So we started to set about a fusion with reggae music, because in this time reggae was started to be listened to in Mauritius," explains Ras Natty Baby, a local musician who has championed the new style. "We started to think, 'how are we going to start a new style of music to express the real problems of Mauritius?' It should probably come as no surprise that the local music also incorporates a range of styles. Under the Dutch and the French, slaves brought over from other African nations drove a large part of the economy. When people were coming around, [many former slaves] thought they were slave hunters and they just threw themselves down the mountain and killed themselves in this way," he adds.
