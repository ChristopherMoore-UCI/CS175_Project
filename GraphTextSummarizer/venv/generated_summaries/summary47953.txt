The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said Sunday that the Americans had been detained for "alleged violations of Haitian laws related to immigration." SOS Children's Villages, where Haitian authorities took the 33 children after the Americans' arrests, said at least 20 of the kids aren't orphans and many others have relatives such as aunts and uncles. The officer told Silsby that her group couldn't gather Haitian children as they were doing, but then offered his help, the interpreter said. " "We know how to do this in the right way and it was unfortunate that, whatever the motivation, that this group of Americans took matters into their own hands," she said, adding that U.S. authorities were in discussions with the Haitian government "about the appropriate disposal of their cases. Jean Sainvil, a pastor who helped find children from a camp in the Delmas neighborhood of the capital, told CNN that the Americans told him they were seeking orphans. The number of Haitian orphans taken to the United States after the earthquake -- those whose approval and paperwork had been in the bureaucratic pipeline at the time of the disaster -- is 578, with 44 others awaiting transportation, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
