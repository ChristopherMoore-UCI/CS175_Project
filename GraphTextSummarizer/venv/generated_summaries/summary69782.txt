Not so tender was Brielle Von Hugel, who nearly knocked Ryan over in her excitement to be called back into the spotlight, which is where Brielle belongs. In all my years of recapping embarrassing reality television, Brielle's performance marks one of the few times I've ever actually turned my television way, way, way down -- not, like, as a courtesy to the Thai delivery guy (that's normal) but as a way to save face from strangers passing in the night. Anyway, moments after Jimmy Iovine had bitched about there being "too many Adele wannabes," Brielle launched right into Adele's "Someone Like You."
