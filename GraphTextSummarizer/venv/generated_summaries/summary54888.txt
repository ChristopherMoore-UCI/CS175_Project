Countries like Canada attract a greater influx of immigrants with higher education levels and specialized skills through immigration policies that specifically favor visa applicants with advanced degrees or work experience. In contrast, U.S. policies place more emphasis on family relationships and less consideration on skills or education levels when granting permanent residence. But if we look at their purchasing power, we find that undocumented immigrants sustain hundreds of thousand of U.S. jobs. About 30% of immigrants in the U.S. possess a low level of education, and only 35% possess a high level of education. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the number of immigrants is almost four times what it was 100 years ago.
