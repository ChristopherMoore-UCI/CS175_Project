Last September, the French government commissioned an anti-radicalization organization called the Prevention Center Against Sectarianism Related to Islam, which goes by the French acronym CPDSI, to counter online recruitment of French youths by jihadist groups. According to the CPDSI, young French people who get involved with jihadist groups are from a range of economic, social and religious backgrounds. "The jihadist in charge of online recruitment will look for key words on social media," Bouzar said on French TV Canal Plus. " "We know that 90 percent of French young jihadists started on the Internet," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said at a press conference the day the government launched the website. " And even though the latest "battlefields" are social media platforms and no real bullets are being fired, there are French civilians already caught in what amounts to a cyber-crossfire.
