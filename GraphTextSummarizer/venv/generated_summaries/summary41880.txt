And a short time later, after a chase in which the suspects allegedly shot at police and threw bombs out their windows, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was dead. Their mother Zubeidat Tsarnaev told CNN on Friday that she and her husband had left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia. But the the source described the earlier bedside questioning -- which took place in two rounds during parts of Saturday, Sunday and Monday, New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly had said -- as "very thorough" and said investigators do not feel hamstrung. The parents moved to Dagestan, a semiautonomous republic in southern Russia that year. Tsarnaev has not given investigators any substantive information since officials informed him of his constitutional rights prior to charging him with use of and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, the source said Friday.
