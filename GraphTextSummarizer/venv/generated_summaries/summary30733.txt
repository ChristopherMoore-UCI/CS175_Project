"I have some reason to believe it does." The last documentation of an interaction with Jeremiah was in May, according to Department of Children and Families spokesman Alec Loftus. The state agency was charged with the responsibility of protecting children from child abuse. In June, Loftus says the social worker was told that Jeremiah had moved to Florida to live with his grandmother, but never bothered to follow up or verify whether that was the case. Turns out, tragically, Jeremiah was not getting the visits, state officials say. "As a result of those statements" the affidavit continues, "[she] and [another brother that isn't Jeremiah] were removed from the home and taken into protective custody."
