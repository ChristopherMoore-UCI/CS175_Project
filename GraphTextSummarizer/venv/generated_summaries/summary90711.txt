The Ford pickup truck crammed with nearly two dozen people ran off a highway in southeastern Texas on Sunday evening, officials said. -- A damaged front right tire caused the pickup truck accident in Texas that killed 15 people in the town of Goliad this week, authorities said Wednesday. The death toll increased to 15 Wednesday, Bryant said. At least two of the dead were children, troopers told CNN affiliate KTRK in Houston. Trooper Gerald Bryant of the Texas Highway Patrol said the rubber of the tire had started to come apart.
