Midfielder Ramires wasted a free header at the other end, and it looked like Chelsea would pay for the Brazilian's miss when Bale put Adebayor clear on goal -- but Terry came to the rescue to clear the Togo international's low shot after goalkeeper Petr Cech was beaten. Villas-Boas brought on $80 million striker Fernando Torres with 13 minutes to play, but it was former Chelsea defender William Gallas -- who scored a winner against Tottenham in 2006 -- who next went closest to scoring as he volleyed a good chance wide.

Defeat would have left Chelsea five points behind their third-placed London rivals, but the result kept the battle for European Champions League places finely poised as the season nears the halfway stage. Club World Cup champions Barca thrashed fourth division L'Hospitalet 9-0, as a trio of 20-year-olds -- midfielder Thiago Alcantara and strikers Isaac Cuenca and Cristian Tello -- all scored twice.
