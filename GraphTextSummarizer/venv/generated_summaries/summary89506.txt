-- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is one of the leading leftist figures in Latin America and one of the United States' most vocal critics, aligning himself with former Cuban President Fidel Castro and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Five colorful quotes from Hugo Chavez Amid festering social tensions in 1992, Chavez, by then a lieutenant colonel, led an unsuccessful coup against President Carlos Andres Perez for which he was imprisoned for two years. Hugo Chavez wins re-election When first elected on December 6, 1998, in a landslide, Chavez was at age 44 the youngest person in the nation's history to become president. In a series of musical chairs, Chavez's vice president, Diosdado Cabello, was sworn in as president, after which he immediately restored Chavez to power. His legacy will be one of both "self-styled Latin American Robin Hood" and "shrewd autocrat using and abusing his country's oil riches to stay in power," CNN's Paula Newton wrote.
