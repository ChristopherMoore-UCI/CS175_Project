Getting to Mars Mars One was originally slated to land the first humans in 2023, but the project has been delayed. More than 200,000 people have signed up to be prospective astronauts, Mars One CEO Bas Lansdorp said in Washington on Tuesday. The communications satellite will provide live video feed from surface of Mars to Earth, representing the first Mars synchronous communications satellite, Lansdorp said. As Lansdorp himself said Tuesday, "You can't go to Mars on excitement. The cost of the lander and satellite will be something that the contracted companies will study, although Mars One has a ballpark figure in mind, Lansdorp said.
