The guest list for the two-day extravaganza includes heads of state, like French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silivia, and members of the rich and famous such as British model Naomi Campbell, British business mogul Richard Branson and Armani. The event has galvanized the attention of thousands around the world, whose fascination with Monaco's royalty blossomed with the April 1956 wedding of Prince Ranier III and Hollywood movie star Grace Kelly. Prince Albert formally became Monaco's head of state following his father's death in 2005. The event kicked off the second day of festivities in the small seaside nation of 33,000, where a holiday has been declared to celebrate the wedding of Charlene Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer, and Prince Albert. In matching vows, the couple promised to remain loyal to one another in sickness and in health, and then slipped wedding rings on each other's fingers.
