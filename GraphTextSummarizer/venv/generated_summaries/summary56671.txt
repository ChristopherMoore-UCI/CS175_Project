They were heading to Cairo's Tahrir Square to commemorate the deaths of pro-Coptic protesters killed in clashes in the Egyptian capital last month. Problems between Egypt's Muslim majority and the Copts have been on the rise in recent months, with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups. Egypt has been ruled by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces since the departure of President Hosni Mubarak earlier this year. The demonstrations occurred a day after hundreds of Coptic Christians marching in Cairo were attacked by unknown assailants. The throng, dominated by Islamist parties but also including secular forces, comes ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections set to begin on November 28.
