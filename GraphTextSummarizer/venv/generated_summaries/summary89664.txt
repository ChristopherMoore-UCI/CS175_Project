-- Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine agreed Tuesday to review the report examining the deadly 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech and to correct any errors based on what has been learned since its publication. The report also noted that campus and state agencies might have taken a different approach to Cho had his middle- and high-school records followed him to Virginia Tech, officially Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Kaine announced last week that mental health records belonging to Cho were recently found at the home of Dr. Robert Miller, former director of Virginia Tech's Cook Counseling Center. The family members contend that the August 2007 report compiled by the independent Virginia Tech Review Panel contains "grave errors, misinformation and glaring omissions," their statement says. And Kaine said on Washington-based WTOP's "Ask the Governor" program, "I have made a commitment to the families of those who were injured and killed at Virginia Tech that the report that was done under my direction ... that we are going to open the factual narrative of that report and look at any information that has come in since."
