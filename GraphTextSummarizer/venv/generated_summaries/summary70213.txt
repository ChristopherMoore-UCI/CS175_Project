As Paul broadens his appeal among Republicans and even Democrats, he has attracted closer scrutiny of his views and issues on which he agrees or disagrees with his father, a former congressman and presidential candidate who ran as a Libertarian in 1988 and as a Republican in 2008 and 2012. -- Former presidential candidate Ralph Nader had some biting words about Rand Paul, saying the self-described "libertarian-ish" lawmaker is retreating from his roots as he broadens his appeal for a potential presidential bid. Rand Paul: U.S. aid to Israel OK -- for now Nader has been pushing the idea of a left-right alliance and earlier this year said he could envision Paul as a possible leader of the movement, but still expressed skepticism of what he called his "evolving" views. Nader argued that Paul wants to give more aid to Israel, a reference to the first-term senator's policy on foreign aid that came under question this year. While Rand Paul has long sought to distinguish himself from his father's political brand, his own star has in part benefited from his father's fame as well as the grassroots support he generated in key early presidential primary states.
