Officials wielding infrared thermometers are becoming more difficult to avoid at entry points from mainland China as Hong Kong strengthens its defenses against the H7N9 strain of bird flu. Wearing a customary white lab coat during a tour of the China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday, Premier Li Keqiang urged officials to be vigilant against bird flu. As of Sunday, the number of bird flu infections had risen to 124, based on provincial Ministry of Health websites. The figure includes one case in Taiwan, which remains the only recorded infection beyond mainland China. CNN's Vivian Kam in Hong Kong and Feng Ke in Beijing contributed to this report.
