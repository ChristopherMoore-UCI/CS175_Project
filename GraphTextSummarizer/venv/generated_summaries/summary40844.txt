" There was a series of protests in Arab nations in the 1950s, but those were prompted by an ideology of Pan-Arabism in a post-colonial world, said Emile Hokayem, with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Arab leaders have been getting the message, Hokayem said, noting an article in the Wall Street Journal in which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said leaders must "see the need of reform" before protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia break out, because by then "it's too late to do any reform." Abdullah's decision and Assad's remarks "are preventive moves," said Hokayem. " When the Tunisia protests proved successful at first, many analysts still doubted a "domino theory" would play out through the Middle East, said Hokayem, because each nation has a different structure, population, and set of challenges. "If Saudi Arabia starts to see popular protests," said Hounshell, "then you're really going to see people in Washington freak out. The protests -- which have also caught on to various extents in Algeria, Yemen, and Sudan -- have proved to be "a real watershed event for the Arab world," said Blake Hounshell, managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine.
