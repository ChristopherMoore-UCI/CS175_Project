When the lights dimmed Friday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, UCLA's marching band paraded through the aisles, their horn section blasting the Stones' 1965 hit, "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" -- to the delight of concertgoers Jack Nicholson, Eddie Murphy, Johnny Depp and Nicole Kidman. Friday night, it was not uncommon for fans who paid $450, $250 and $85 to be sitting elbow-to-elbow. Every seat in the arena was filled, thanks to promoter AEG Live releasing a slew of unsold seats for $85 at the last minute -- a bargain considering most concertgoers shelled out $150-$600 for their tickets. For two hours and 20 minutes, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts barreled through 23 career-spanning tracks, including "Paint it Black," "Gimme Shelter," "Miss You" and "Sympathy for the Devil." But by the time Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Charlie launched into a spirited reprise of "Satisfaction," most fans agreed it was an appropriate finish, no matter how much they paid for their seats.
