-- IndyCar said it has launched an investigation into the 15-vehicle wreck that claimed the life of driver Dan Wheldon and expects to have preliminary findings within weeks. Wheldon's death was the first for the IndyCar circuit since March 2006, when driver Paul Dana was killed in a two-car crash while warming up for the season-opening race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway. "The safety of our drivers, their crews, IndyCar staff, racetrack staff and spectators is always our paramount concern," IndyCar said in a statement, declining to comment further on the probe. Two drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- J.R. Hildebrand and Pippa Mann -- were released Monday from the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, said IndyCar.
