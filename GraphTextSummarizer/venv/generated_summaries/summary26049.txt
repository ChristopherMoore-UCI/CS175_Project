Israel Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said a 37-year-old Arab motorist from East Jerusalem struck two people standing at a bus stop in the French Hill section of the city. One Israeli citizen was killed and another injured in what police are calling a suspected terror attack Wednesday night near Hebrew University in Jerusalem. A 20-year-old woman remains in serious condition, according to Rosenfeld. "From the investigation and first findings, there is a strong suspicion that we're talking about a terror attack," Rosenfeld said. One victim, identified by police as Shalom Yohai Cherki, 26, died at the hospital.
