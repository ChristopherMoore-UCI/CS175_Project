Although Homeland Security and the FBI say they are not aware of  a specific, credible plot against U.S. malls, they've worked  to improve security in light of the attack in Kenya. The terror group  released a video Saturday calling for similar attacks in malls in the United States, Canada and the UK. It tested the readiness of SWAT teams by staging fake attacks at malls when they were closed, the official said. Since then, the FBI has had a program that works with malls to improve security, the official said. Despite what some officials described as an attention ploy, security was beefed up in malls listed as potential targets.
