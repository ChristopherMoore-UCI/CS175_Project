Her father, Arcedio Alvarez Quintero, is being held in jail to face charges of sexual abuse, incest and aggravated sexual assault. " Gilma Jimenez, a local councilwoman who has had close contact with Nidia, has offered her financial assistance and has been speaking out against child abuse. Jimenez added that Alvarez is receiving special protection in the jail, saying, "Criminals will tolerate any crime, except child abuse. "This is the indifference, the silence that encourages more child abuse." This case comes as Colombia is weighing whether to change the constitution to punish convicted child abusers with up to life imprisonment.
