In December 2009, when racist images of first lady Michelle Obama popped to the top of Google search results, the company took a similar free-speech stance. Santorum is just the latest to gripe at Google over how it ranks search results. "We believe Google has acted anti-competitively in at least two key ways: by misusing Yelp review content in their competing Places product and by favoring their own competing Places product in search results," Yelp's Jeremy Stoppelman wrote. The CEO of Yelp posted a blog Tuesday saying that Google purposefully ranks its own products -- like Google Places -- above its competitors. "We have a bias toward free expression," Google spokesman Scott Rubin said at the time.
