The measure allows state law enforcement to detain the Democrats and bring them back to Wisconsin, according to Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. On Friday night, the state's Department of Administration noted on its website that the Capitol closed at 6 p.m., with Capitol Police Chief Charles Tubbs speaking to five people who left shortly thereafter. The stalemate has appeared increasingly contentious in recent days as Senate lawmakers adopted a resolution Wednesday that would fine absentee lawmakers $100 every day they remain missing. Democrat State Sen. Jon Erpenbach said Friday that the move threatened to derail any productive discussions between fellow Democrats and Republicans, including representatives from the governor's office. The measure "may be able to be rescinded and layoffs avoided" if 14 Senate Democrats return to the state Capitol, the Republican's office said in a press release.
