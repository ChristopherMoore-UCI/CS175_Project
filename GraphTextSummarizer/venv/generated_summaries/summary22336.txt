Orlando International (MCO) Orlando airport seems to be unaware of the current revival in airport restaurants. OK, the Grand Central Oyster Bar in Terminal C may lack the atmosphere of its New York City sister, but, hey, you're in an airport. John F Kennedy International, New York City (JFK) Chef Andrew Carmellini's New York restaurants -- The Dutch and Locanda Verde -- are always packed. Whenever someone starts talking about the "good ol' days" of air travel, remind them about eating at old school airports. Chicago O'Hare International (ORD) Chef Rick Bayless is known for his Mexican food and has several restaurants in Chicago.
