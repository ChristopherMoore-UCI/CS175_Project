Under attack from the outset by Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Holder rejected accusations he was stonewalling congressional investigators on the botched "Fast and Furious" gunrunning sting operation and failing to investigate recent leaks of classified information properly. Holder responded the administration has prosecuted classified leaks more than any previous administration. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, leveled the harshest criticism, accusing Holder of misleading Congress over what he and other top Justice Department officials knew about the Fast and Furious program and refusing to appoint a special counsel to investigate leaked national security details in recent media reports. Last week, Holder assigned Ronald C. Machen Jr., U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a Democratic appointee, and Rod J. Rosenstein, U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland and a holdover GOP appointee, to lead the investigations into the alleged leaks. -- Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday rejected a GOP call to resign, telling a heated Senate hearing that Republicans were trying to score political points instead of addressing significant issues.
