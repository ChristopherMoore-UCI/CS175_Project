The cross was erected in 1954 in honor of Korean War veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back-and-forth since 1989, when two Vietnam War veterans filed suit saying it violated the California Constitution's "No Preference" clause. It's the latest legal salvo in the decades-long battle over the cross on the memorial at Mount Soledad in San Diego. But that was followed by more lawsuits, including one filed by Vietnam veterans Steve Trunk and now-deceased Philip K. Paulson and another filed by the ACLU on behalf of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States. Since that first lawsuit, the city of San Diego twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, only to be stopped by the courts. The United States will defend against efforts to remove a giant cross atop a war memorial in Southern California over claims it violates the constitutional separation of church and state, according to a petition filed this week with the U.S. Supreme Court.
