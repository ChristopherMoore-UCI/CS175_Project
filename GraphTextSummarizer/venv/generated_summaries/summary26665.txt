Granny Dot would come home from work, cook dinner, and her husband, Kenneth Landgraf, would wash the dishes so she could begin writing. Hundreds of soldiers who got her letters came to know her as Granny Dot. Many things have changed since Granny Dot churned out letters and sent gifts regularly. Each time a different soldier responded to one of her letters, Granny Dot proudly tied a bright yellow ribbon to her dogwood tree in New Albany, Indiana. Granny Dot was a regular one-woman USO.
