Speaking of her early days with Hizb ut Tahrir, she reflects on her interaction with other members of the group: "I was initially looking for spiritual understanding of Islam and they were trying to say that spirituality is important but their main focus was on politics and that the politics was just as spiritual in Islam." Hadiya was only 18 years old when she became interested in Hizb ut Tahrir, a radical Islamic group. It was in 2008 that she finally severed ties with Hizb ut Tahrir and instead started giving talks in colleges to foster closer ties among communities. As a member of Hizb ut Tahir, Hadiya held regular talks and tried to recruit others to the group. -- Hadiya Masieh, a 32-year-old mother, was born a Hindu, received her early education in a Christian school, converted to Islam and joined a radical group in college.
