While any old travel site can add some social-networking features and call itself "the Facebook of travel," Tripping paves the way for true face-to-face interactions in about 130 countries across the globe. Price is based on size, paper stock, cover material, and shipping fees, but single copies start at $11 for a 20-page book. For the eco-minded, it even includes a carbon-footprint estimate for each mode of travel. Live traffic information was recently added for 13 European countries; the site's maps for New York City, London, and other major cities now have public transit options; markings for tunnels and highway signs become easier to read every year; and you can plot your route by car, bicycle, or foot -- although the latter two options are still in beta. Like other booking sites, Bing lets you comparison-shop for tickets across more than a hundred sources.
