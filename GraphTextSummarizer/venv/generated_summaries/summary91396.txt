" Guns not blazing Tiffany & Co had been producing decorative presentation swords that were awarded to American officers during the Civil War and Mexican-American War of 1846-8. "They were produced to symbolize the potency of American manufacturing and craftsmanship, and were created using techniques that nobody else could equal. They were clad in silver, etched with intricate designs, and studded with precious jewels. The project was abruptly discontinued in 1911, when New York adopted gun control laws. "So far as we know, the guns never killed anybody," says Pierre Terjanian, the head of the Arms and Armor department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where a collection of seven such guns is kept.
