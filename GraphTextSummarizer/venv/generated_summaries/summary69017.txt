The Magic Power website contains a disclaimer that reads in part: "Consult a physician before using this product if you have any medical condition including, but not limited to, strokes, high blood pressure, heart, liver, kidney or thyroid disease, diabetes, anemia, depression, anxiety, other psychiatric conditions, a family history of these or other medical conditions, or if taking any prescription, OTC and/or other herbal medications."

Autor, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's office of compliance, said in the statement.
