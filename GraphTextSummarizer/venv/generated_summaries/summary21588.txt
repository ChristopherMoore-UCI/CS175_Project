The ticket offered by Great Rail Journeys is first class most of the way, crossing three continents in the kind of style you'd associate with a golden age of rail travel -- albeit without the top hats and tailcoats. -- A 53-day journey by train might sound like murder on the Orient Express, but one enterprising British travel company is offering rail tickets that take nearly eight weeks to circumnavigate the globe. En route, passengers get to experience some of the world's most luxurious trains, including the Tsar's Gold Private Train from Mongolia, the Venice Simplon Orient-Express and the British Orient Express Pullman. Appleyard says the company had sold its first tickets but is planning to limit numbers to about 25 to "keep it fairly exclusive." "There is a huge number of people who are interested in rail as a method of travel," he said. The itinerary begins in London on May 18, 2015.
