-- China reassured its neighbors Sunday that it will maintain "peace and stability" in the turbulent South China Sea, a day after the U.S. renewed concerns over territorial disputes. The area rich in oil deposits is rife with territorial disputes with claims by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. " Vietnamese defense minister, Gen. Phung Quang Thanh, reiterated calls for the conclusion of a code of conduct between the regional organization ASEAN and China to help restrain disputes in the South China Sea. The Philippines accused China of intimidation in disputed oil-rich Spratly islands in the South China Sea, where its oil exploration ship was confronted by Chinese ships in March. Defense Minister Gen. Liang Guanglie said China was keeping its agreements to the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes.
