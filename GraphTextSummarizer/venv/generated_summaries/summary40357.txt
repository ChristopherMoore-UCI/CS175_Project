The One Fund Boston was established by Boston Mayor Tom Menino and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. This category includes loss of life and those who sustained double amputations of limbs or permanent brain damage. "No amount of money can replace what has been lost," One Fund Boston Administrator Kenneth Feinberg said, "But (the tragedy) was made lighter by the unprecedented generosity of Bostonians, of Americans, and of people around the world." At least 264 people were wounded and 3 were killed in the double bombings, which took place near the Boston marathon finish line on April 15. Payments will be made to claimants in each of the four classifications of claims (categories A through D), according to the release.
