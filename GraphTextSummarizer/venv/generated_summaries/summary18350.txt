There was never much lost love between most other political forces and the Brotherhood. After it, one imagines the popularity of the military dropped with the departure of Brotherhood support for it. The Brotherhood's political strategy has gone from trying to enforce authority over the state from within, to engaging in continuous protests against it from without. Other political forces have, generally speaking, decided there is a binary choice to be made: back the Muslim Brotherhood, or back the military. They were joined by many others -- and no-one can now claim the uprising was theirs alone.
