ISIS militants in northern Syria released 19 Assyrian Christian hostages on Sunday, according to Rami Abdelrahman, the chief of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. On Saturday, the observatory -- citing an Assyrian commander -- said that ISIS planned to release 29 Assyrian Christian hostages. The founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network, Osama Edward, puts the number of Assyrian hostages at more than 262. The "court" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. The Syrian Observatory said Saturday that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release, citing an Assyrian commander.
