In Bieber's case, he was not handed over to immigration agents and hustled out the back door of the police department to begin deportation proceedings. If Bieber is convicted of the alleged crimes in South Florida, he should get what many other foreigners have already received for less serious infractions: a one-way ticket out of the country. Again, back in the real world of law enforcement, there are police stations -- for instance, in Southern California -- that allow federal immigration agents to sit at a desk in the squad room. Bieber isn't known for doing smart things, but the one smart thing that Team Bieber did is what the rich and spoiled often do when they land in jail in South Florida. However, police say Bieber admitted to them that he had been drinking, using marijuana and taking prescription pills.
