-- A neighborhood in east London was getting back to normal Saturday after British Army engineers detonated a large World War II bomb unearthed this week on a building site, officials said. In London, which suffered the aerial bombardment of the Blitz, bombs are uncovered two or three times a year, Saunders said. Much of the Blitz focused on east London. The bomb was "enormous," said Simon Saunders, a spokesman for the British Army's London district. German bombers attacked the city every day or night for the first two months, but the worst night was the last -- May 10, 1941, when 3,000 people were killed in London, according to the Museum of London.
