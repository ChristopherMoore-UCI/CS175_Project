One of the two pianos featured in the 1942 classic film starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman will be auctioned tomorrow in New York by Sotheby's. "The estimated price for the piano is $800,000 to $1.2 million," said David Redden, Vice Chairman at Sotheby's. " Dooley Wilson, the actor who portrayed Sam, was a trumpeter, not a pianist, according to Redden. "It was sold to a Japanese man and now it's come back to us," Redden told CNN. Redden is no stranger to this famous Hollywood prop.
