Richard's naked body was returned to Leicester for public display before he was interred three days after death. Other graves were of correct length and neat rectangular with vertical sides, according to researchers. British archaeologists, in the first academic paper since the discovery of his skeleton under a parking lot, said Richard's body was buried in Leicester, central England, "with minimal reverence." "The haste may partially be explained by the fact that Richard's damaged body had already been on public display for several days in the height of summer, and was thus in poor condition." Richard was discovered buried among the remains of what was once the city's Grey Friars friary. Clues coaxed from the skeleton may shed "a new light" on the physical description of Richard III as a humpbacked man with a "withered arm," which was used to support history's evil image of him, Professor Lin Foxhall, head of the University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, said then.
