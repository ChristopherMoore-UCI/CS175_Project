These people seem to have lost sight of the fact that in their prime, in pivotal moments in games, they are one of the most influential people in the world," said former NBA player John Amaechi. "Kobe Bryant, Joakim Noah and Roger McDowell are not any different from many people in our society who use offensive language like that on a daily basis," said Jarrod Chin of the Society for the Study of Sport in Society at Boston's Northeastern University. "When sports stars use slurs, it is especially damaging because their increased public profile means many more people are exposed. The NBA recently released a pubic service announcement featuring players Grant Hill and Jared Dudley about anti-gay language. Amaechi says he still remembers the pointed response from NBA star Tim Hardaway that followed his disclosure.
