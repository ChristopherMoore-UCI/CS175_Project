Haskell has children with his estranged wife, but those children were not believed to have been in the Spring-area home where the shootings happened, Hickman said. The house belonged to relatives of Haskell's spouse, and Haskell might have been an uncle by marriage to at least some of the children, but his relationship to everyone in the home wasn't immediately clear, Hickman said. Haskell was not the slain children's father, as police had mistakenly asserted earlier, Hickman said. "Fortunately, they were brought out of the house before that could happen, (or) we would have had more tragedy." Hours-long standoff Haskell approached the second home and saw officers there; he drove away and the officers pursued him, Hickman said. Haskell, 34, is being held on charges of capital murder, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman said.
