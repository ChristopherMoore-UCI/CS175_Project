But Moore explained his tweet in a Facebook post: "My dad was in the First Marine Division in the South Pacific in World War II. "I didn't say a word about 'American Sniper' in my tweets," Moore wrote on Facebook. But Moore stressed that his comments were not a jab at the movie "American Sniper," which earned $105 million in weekend ticket sales and nabbed six Academy Award nominations last week, including best picture. Shortly after his tweet proclaiming "snipers aren't heroes" netted a barrage of criticism, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore tried to explain where that sentiment came from -- his war veteran father. "My uncle killed by sniper in WW2," Moore tweeted.
