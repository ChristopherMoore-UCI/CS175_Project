Attorney Brian Cuban is trying to get Facebook to remove pages for Holocaust denial groups such as this one. " Deborah Lipstadt is the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University and an expert on Holocaust denial. Last year Facebook removed several pages posted by Italian neo-Nazis after complaints that they encouraged violence against gypsies. That issue is at the heart of attempts by a Dallas, Texas, attorney to have social-networking site Facebook remove pages for Holocaust deniers. Schnitt said Facebook has drawn the line with pages or groups that attack an individual or incite or threaten violence.
