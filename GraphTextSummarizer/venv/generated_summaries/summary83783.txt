" In addition to the invaluable guidance, many participants were able to build friendships and network with fellow Heroes. Last December, Jan and other top 10 Heroes from previous years, along with members from their organizations, attended the three-day intensive training designed to help the Heroes' nonprofits build a strong, sustainable foundation for long-term success. The Heroes underwent a condensed version of the foundation's multiple Alchemy trainings, which typically take place over 13 months. "Alchemy helps the Heroes leverage the affirmation and public attention of their work to benefit their organizations and put them on a path towards greater sustainability." David Puckett, who travels to Mexico to provide prosthetic and orthotic care to people in need, translated what he learned at Alchemy into more consistent financial support for his group. "Just being in a room with present and past Heroes who are making a difference was an honor," said Marie Da Silva, whose school in Malawi provides free education for AIDS orphans.
