Goals from Goran Pandev, Walter Samuel and Diego Milito earned Jose Mourinho's Inter side a comfortable victory in the San Siro, taking the lead after just six minutes. Samuel Eto'o, playing his first game since returning from Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon, set up Pandev to score at the near post. Since then they have drawn their next two matches, with Inter taking full advantage, although they are facing a renewed challenge from Roma, who have gone 12 games without defeat. Roma's later 1-0 win at Fiorentina, with Mirko Vucinic scoring the only goal, saw them move into second place above Milan, eight points adrift of Inter but having played a game more. Inter Milan took a stranglehold on the Serie A title with a 3-0 win over Cagliari on Sunday which saw them open a 10-point lead over city rivals AC Mlan, who could only manage a goalless draw at Bologna.
