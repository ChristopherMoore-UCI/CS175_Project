"Our biggest problem is that the general public has been stuck with deflation -- in mind and heart -- for the past 20 years," Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso told CNN's Jill Dougherty recently. It could lead to a bubble, though I don't think it will be as bad as it was back in the 1980s," he said, referring to the spectacular crash that followed decades of soaring stock and real estate values in Japan. But in Tokyo's central Akihabara district, four young Abenomics devotees dressed in giant glittery bow-ties and denim mini-skirts are handing out fliers. They chant: "We're the Street Corner Economists -- please come to our concert'!" Granted, it's less the promise of massive public spending programs, the whirring of the monetary printing press or the slightly ambiguous growth strategies pulling in the punters here. "So when the Nikkei goes below 9,000 we wear long skirts; when it's between 10 and 11,000 we go medium-length, and miniskirts when it's 11 to 13,000."
