We all understand the President's sense about the limits of American involvement in military conflict. -- When President Obama spoke to the nation about military action in Iraq, it was hard to directly catch his eye. So he sent some noncombat special forces troops to get some eyes on the situation on the ground, but declined to use American air power at that time. Time and time again, this President has been drawn into decisions that threaten to undermine his chief foreign policy narrative: killing Osama Bin Laden, ending two unpopular wars. But the natural question to then ask is whether this credo doesn't just generate more trouble over time.
