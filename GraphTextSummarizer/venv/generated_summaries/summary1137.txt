Ann Romney, the wife of former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, condemned South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Democratic challenger after he mistakenly called her a "whore" — and then chuckled. " Romney aides made her available for an interview on Sheheen's comments. "We need to make sure we have a safe place so that other women can feel like they can do this and these kinds of things aren't going to happen to them," Romney said. We have to be better than that." Romney said women voters care about a broad array of issues — national security, the economy, education — beyond just social issues like abortion rights and access to contraception. Romney argued that the message has lost its potency in 2014, though Democrats say women's issues have kept them in the hunt in several tight Senate races from Colorado to North Carolina.
