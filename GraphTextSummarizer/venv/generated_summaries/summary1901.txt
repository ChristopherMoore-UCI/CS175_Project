In its report, the OECD said Australians felt "a strong sense of community and high levels of civic participation," with 94% of people feeling like they knew someone to rely on should they need help. The OECD creates the list using eleven criteria, including housing, education, health, income, and civic engagement. Average household disposable income sits at $28,884, more than the OECD average of $23,047 and despite Australians working an average 83 hours less a year. The OECD found the country has a strong sense of community but "only moderate levels" of civic participation. The so-called "lucky country" beat Sweden and Canada to take the top spot in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Better Life Index.
