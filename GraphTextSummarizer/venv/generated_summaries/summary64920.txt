A recent study from the Canadian government found that PBDE flame retardants were present in indoor air at concentrations 50 times higher than those found outdoors. Fresh air and ventilation can help dilute indoor concentrations. Go easy on air conditioning; when you turn it on and close your windows, it keeps fresh air from getting in. Vacuum and dust regularly (once or twice a week should be plenty), and use a vacuum with a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter. Put used vacuum filters in a bag and close it tightly before discarding.
