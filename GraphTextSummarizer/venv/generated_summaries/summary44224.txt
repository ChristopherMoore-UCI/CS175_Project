"This is not one of the easiest environments for Davos, there is so much economic uncertainty, so much resentment towards bankers and business leaders generally," said Mark Malloch-Brown, a former U.N. deputy secretary general and adviser to Forum financial talks. Says Verwaayen, the failure of numerous crisis meetings held over the past 24 months by economists and European leaders to create a solution to the eurozone problem underscores the need for the alternative dialogues hosted by Davos. " Marco Magnani, a researcher in political economics at Harvard University appointed as a Forum young global leader, argues that in spite of its elitist nature, Davos offers diverse face-to-face encounters in an age when people are often sequestered behind computer screens. In a world where people power appears to be gaining momentum, you could be forgiven for thinking this month's meeting of the rich and powerful in the Swiss ski resort of Davos is an anachronism. "It is exactly these kinds of moments, where the official channels have clogged up in terms of finding solutions to the crisis both within Europe but more broadly at the global level, where Davos comes into its own," he added.
