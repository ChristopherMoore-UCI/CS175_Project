-- Colombian police have arrested six gang members in connection with the May assassination attempt on a former minister, police said Tuesday. Londono was minister of the interior and justice from 2002 to 2004 during the administration of President Alvaro Uribe. He was known for being outspoken against leftist rebel groups, including the FARC. The leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group, commonly known as the FARC, was suspected immediately in the attack, but police did not make a connection to the group. And while police said six arrests were made, Santos and the attorney general's office put the number at five.
