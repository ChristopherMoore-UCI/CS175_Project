"What they would like to see is free and open use of unmanned aircraft as soon as we can get there." "On the other side, you have pilots, commercial pilots, general aviation pilots, who are very concerned that these are difficult to see, they don't really have a good understanding of how they interact with other aircraft, and bedrock principle of aviation is a principle called see and avoid. According to Michael Huerta, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, regulations are in place to prevent drones from interfering with large aircraft -- but education about drone safety and regulation enforcement needs to be improved in order to actually keep airways safe. "Yes, there are proponents of unmanned aircraft and they really see huge potential with this technology and for them, we can't move fast enough," Huerta said. Still, proponents of drone use argue the unmanned aerial vehicles have great potential for both surveillance and commercialism, a balance which Huerta says the FAA is working to achieve. Huerta says the FAA is working to educate people about the dangers of flying drones that high, since enforcement of the small, unmanned aerial vehicles can be difficult.
