But the possibility that Ridge could be McCain's running mate sparked a backlash among conservatives because he supports abortion rights. A Republican insider said this month that McCain campaign manager Rick Davis has called several state party chairmen and indicated that Ridge will be the Republican vice presidential pick this cycle. Ridge, who is also the former secretary of homeland security, is reportedly on McCain's shortlist of possible running mates. Watch who is on McCain's shortlist Â» Asked whether either former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge or former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was his VP pick, McCain replied to KDKA, "I haven't decided yet, so I can't tell you." Thursday night's arrival of a private jet from Alaska at the Middleton, Ohio, airport raised speculation that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin would be McCain's pick.
