United piled on the pressure in the early stages but Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici kept them at bay with smart saves from Tom Cleverley and Ashley Young. With his side 12 points clear at the top of the English Premier League and in the box seat after drawing 1-1 with Real in their European Champions League last 16 tie, they moved into the last eight of the FA Cup with a 2-1 win over Reading. Only goalkeeper David De Gea, midfielder Phil Jones and striker Danny Welbeck, who grabbed United's goal at the Bernabeu, survived from the Real Madrid test as they defeated struggling Reading. Nani came on for Jones and twice went close, volleying narrowly wide before forcing Federici to tip over his fierce shot but the pressure finally told as the Portuguese tucked home from Antonio Valencia's cross. Three minutes later Hernandez doubled United's lead with a near post header but McAnuff's finish on 81 minutes gave Reading hope though they couldn't force an equalizer. -- It is a measure of the squad Alex Ferguson has at his disposal that the Manchester United coach can make eight changes to the side that drew with Real Madrid and still move closer to an historic treble.
