Hard lessons for U.S. nuclear safety from Fukushima meltdown Hanford became a focal point of U.S. nuclear efforts beginning in 1943, when aspects of the Manhattan Project were moved there. Inslee said that he got the latest information about the site during a meeting in Washington with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu. The site -- about half the size of Rhode Island, in an area centered roughly 75 miles east of Yakima -- continued to buzz during the Cold War, with more plutonium production as well as the construction of several nuclear reactors. "To see Hanford workers furloughed at the exact moment we have additional leakers out there is completely unacceptable." The sprawling, 586-square mile Hanford site houses a total of 177 underground tanks full of radioactive sludge, of which 149 are single-shell tanks.
