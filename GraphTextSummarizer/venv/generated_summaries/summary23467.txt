Michigan winner charged with welfare fraud Red Bud locals commenting on a message board thread threw out several names of suspected winners. -- With just 3,700 residents in Red Bud, Illinois, Denise Metzger is using the process of elimination to guess who bought a lottery ticket now worth $218 million at her convenience store last month. Moto Mart, which has seen a two-fold rise in lottery ticket sales, also seems to be gossip central for lottery rumors. The Mega Millions mystery winner's identity will be revealed by Illinois lottery officials at the Red Bud Village Hall by Wednesday morning. Mayor Tim Lowry sees the decision by the winner to have the announcement in his southern Illinois town as evidence it's a Red Bud resident.
