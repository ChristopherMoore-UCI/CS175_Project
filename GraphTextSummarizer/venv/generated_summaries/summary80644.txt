But during a February Supreme Court hearing, Barbour's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was "an unconstitutional encroachment" on the governor's power. -- Mississippi's Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office, rejecting a challenge by the state's attorney general. He said the case was not only about the power of the governor's office, "but about the ability of a governor to grant mercy." "As I've stated from the beginning, I recognize and respect the natural feelings of victims and their families and I know this has been difficult for many of them," Barbour said in his statement Thursday. In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Barbour said the court "reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state," but acknowledged that his decision "has been difficult" for many of the inmates' victims. But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Michael Randolph called the decision "a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons, and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state.
