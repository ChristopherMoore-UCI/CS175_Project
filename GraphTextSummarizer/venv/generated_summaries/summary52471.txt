Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, glowingly praised Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday, and urged Democratic politicians to pick sides on labor in his closing remarks at a labor summit on raising wages. "Trumka's comments appear to reflect the yearning of so many Americans, who long not just for more leaders like Elizabeth Warren specifically but in general, leaders who stand up for working people and not just for powerful monied interests," said Sally Kohn, a liberal activist and CNN contributor. Republicans thwarted the law in Congress, but voters in reliably red Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota gave labor leaders hope when they voted to approve ballot measures to increase their minimum wages. The AFL-CIO will also step up their 2016 activity this year by taking their Raising Wages summit message to the first four presidential primary states - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Although the Massachusetts senator has said she is not running for president in 2016, Warren has been followed by presidential speculation for months as liberal groups have started movements to urge Warren to run in 2016.
