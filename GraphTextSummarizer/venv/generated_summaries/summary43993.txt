Police searches of locales in Barcelona and Valencia turned up material to forge documents, dozens of passports, some already forged and others blank and waiting to be filled in, passport-sized photographs of numerous people, computer information and cell phones. The ring operated by stealing passports in various Spanish cities and sending them to Thailand, where they were altered and sent to the other five European countries to criminal networks, to facilitate fraudulent border crossings. -- Police arrested 13 men in Barcelona and Valencia early Tuesday on suspicion of working in an international document forgery ring, possibly with links to Islamic terrorists, a police statement said. Spanish police detain a suspect following the arrests in Valencia and Barcelona Tuesday. The ring, in addition to providing forged passports, also trafficked in drugs and human beings, in a network stretching to Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Thailand, and police in those countries were part of the investigation, the statement said.
