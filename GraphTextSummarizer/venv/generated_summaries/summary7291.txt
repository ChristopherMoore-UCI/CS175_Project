The question in my mind, is whether Microsoft can take its mobile operating system and make it a player in the burgeoning market of cheap smartphones. Nokia's market share was 23.4% in the last quarter of 2012, according to research firm Gartner. One question rightly being asked, is whether rival handset makers or operators will simply stop making phones with Microsoft's mobile operating system. That's because Nokia sells an enormous number of cheaper mobiles in emerging markets. Nokia and Microsoft joined ranks two years ago and the others were a fraction of Microsoft's fraction of the mobile operating market.
