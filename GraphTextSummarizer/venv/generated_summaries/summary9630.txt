Entertainment Weekly reports that the singer and TV personality, whose full name is Melanie Brown, will join fellow judges Howard Stern and Howie Mandel on the NBC reality competition when it returns this summer. " "I've known Melanie since she did 'Dancing with the Stars,' and I've known her as a performer in The Spice Girls before that," Paul Telegdy, NBC's president of alternative and late night programming, said in a statement to EW. "To know her is to know a very frank, strong, enduring entertainer. She competed on "Dancing With the Stars" in the United States, served as a judge on the Australian version of "The X Factor" and was a guest judge on the UK's "X Factor" and "Britain's Next Top Model. Osbourne announced she was leaving "AGT" last year following claims that NBC discriminated against her son, Jack. The contestants will get a lot of constructive feedback from her and I can't wait to see her chemistry with Howard and Howie."
