Although there haven't been similar watershed events since, Schreiber and Groff said that the most similar event could be the 2008 election campaign, during which many young people rallied behind Barack Obama. Jonathan Groff also came to "Taking Woodstock" with limited big-screen experience and was excited to work with Lee.

Similarly, the name of Ang Lee is a draw that attracted a number of actors to his new film, "Taking Woodstock." "Taking Woodstock," which is out August 28, features performers who were either not born or very young when the monumental festival occurred in 1969, but many were enticed to join the movie because of Lee's involvement.
