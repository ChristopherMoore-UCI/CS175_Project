At the arraignment Wednesday, Schwartz warned Lohan that she could be put back in jail if she violates the law. Lohan is on supervised probation for a drunken driving conviction. Lohan wore what appeared to be several diamond bracelets on her right arm, complemented by diamond earrings and a large diamond-filled ring on her right hand.
