Travelers may have more flights to choose from on certain routes because of NextGen. "There are some estimates that flights could be 10% to 20% shorter in the short distances and a few percent better in the long distances," said air industry consultant Michael Miller of Miller Air Group. Airlines sharing precise information about where their flights are on the tarmac and exactly when aircraft are expected to depart their gates can save up to 4Â½ minutes per flight in delays, said Mike Romanowski, the FAA's top NextGen official. NextGen aims to switch its tracking system to a technology that millions of travelers have had in their pockets for years: global satellite positioning, or GPS. But what really frustrates Stuker are flights that fail to arrive on time.
