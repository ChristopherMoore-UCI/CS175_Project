It's a gut wrenching quandary we face at CNN Impact too often. Not only do we bring you the latest news on all CNN's platforms, but where possible, we provide ways on the network and on CNN.com/impact to get involved and to donate to help those whose stories we tell. We may not be able to stop children from being recruited as soldiers by armed militias, but we can connect you with UNICEF who is working to end the participation of children in armed conflict. Imagine if it were your child or parent spouse that was in harms way and ask "Could the response be improved?" At CNN, our first jon is to bring you all the facts, provide context and keep everyone involved honest. How can I help?" Frustratingly, it is often when stories are still evolving that the answer -- too frequently -- is that all we can do is wait.
