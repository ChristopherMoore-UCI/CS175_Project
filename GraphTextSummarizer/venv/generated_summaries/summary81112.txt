A wave of arctic air that settled over the Midwest and the Plains is expected to spread into the Southeast late Monday, bringing a chance of snow to several major Southern cities by Tuesday. Forecasters issued a winter storm warning for New Orleans and its suburbs Monday afternoon, warning that the city could see half an inch of snow and ice by Tuesday evening. State officials told reporters that up to four inches of snow could fall in the south-central part of the state, and the Gulf Coast could see three-quarters of an inch. Whiteout conditions could also be found in Hazleton, Iowa, said CNN iReporter Danny Murphy. Atlanta will see the mercury drop into the low 20s overnight, with a 30 to 40% chance of snow Tuesday.
