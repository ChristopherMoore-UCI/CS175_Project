Woods was forced to pull out of the Masters for the first time last month after undergoing an operation on March 31 -- having struggled for several weeks with a pinched nerve in his back -- and he has been sidelined ever since. -- The world of golf is eager to know when Tiger Woods will return to action after back surgery, yet not even the man himself can set a date. " Woods, who has begun cycling and swimming as he builds up his strength and fitness, had been struggling since last year with the back injury, which severely hampered his game in the opening months of 2014 leading up to the Masters. " Had Woods been fit, he would be preparing to defend his title at the Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach this week, with the event getting underway Thursday. "My recovery from microdiscectomy surgery for a pinched nerve in my back is coming along, but it's a very slow process," added Woods.
