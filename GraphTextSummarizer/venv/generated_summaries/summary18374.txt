Grint joins an A-list cast that includes Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, Megan Mullally, F. Murrary Abraham and newcomer Micah Stock. The play first premiered in New York in 1986 at the Manhattan Theatre Club; the 2014 production is a newly revised adaptation by McNally, the four-time Tony-winning scribe whose recent premiere Mothers and Sons marked his 50th year on Broadway. Grint's "Potter" co-star Daniel Radcliffe recently returned to Broadway in The Cripple of Inishmaan, but their stints on the New York stage won't overlap (Radcliffe's engagement ends this July). Jack O'Brien will direct the limited 17-week engagement, which opens at Broadway's Schoenfeld Theatre on October 9. (EW.com ) -- Another "Harry Potter" star is coming to Broadway.
