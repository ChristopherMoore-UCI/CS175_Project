" Tyler was an 18-year-old freshman at Rutgers University in New Jersey when he jumped off the George Washington Bridge in New York on September 22, 2010, after prosecutors say his roommate and another Rutgers student spied on Clementi kissing another man via a computer webcam. -- Almost 15 months since Tyler Clementi committed suicide, his older brother James wants people to know that "he's much more than the way that he died. For now, James Clementi is memorializing Tyler in an Out Magazine article, "Letters to My Brother." James, who is gay, said they hadn't spoken about each other's sexuality growing up, but when James finally came out to Tyler before Tyler left for college, he said his younger brother was becoming more comfortable with his own sexuality. I just wanted him to know so that it would be a safe place and that if he did want to talk to me, he would be able to." Tyler told James he was gay, too, and James said it didn't "seem to be any kind of burden or trouble for him, he seemed OK with it."
