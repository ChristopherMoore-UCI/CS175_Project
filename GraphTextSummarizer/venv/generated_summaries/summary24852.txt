Discovery started its 39th and final flight with a launch late Thursday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. "The airlock's atmospheric pressure will be lowered to help purge nitrogen from Bowen and Drew's bloodstreams, protecting them from 'the bends' when they leave the airlock for the vacuum of space," a statement on NASA's website said. Prior to Thursday's launch, Discovery had spent 352 days in orbit, circling the Earth 5,628 times. The craft also was the first to hook up with the international space station, doing so on May 29, 1999, according to NASA. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock with a space station of any kind when it met up on June 4, 1998, with Russia's now defunct Mir space station.
