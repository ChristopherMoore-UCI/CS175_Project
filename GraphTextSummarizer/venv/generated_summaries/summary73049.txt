Among Obama supporters, 26% of likely voters "moderately" support him while 30% of registered voters "moderately" support him. The stakes are high in the first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, set for Wednesday night in Denver. Among Romney supporters, 28% of likely voters "moderately" support him and 35% of registered voters support him. In a race that involves both rallying the base and attracting independents, especially in the swing states, turning moderate support to strong support as well as registered voters to likely voters can be a key to victory. In 2008, 72% of voters said they were satisfied with the choices, perhaps because both Barack Obama and Sarah Palin were dynamic.
