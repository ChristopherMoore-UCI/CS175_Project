-- The winner of the $338 million Powerball jackpot paid $30,000 in back child support to the mother of three of his children Monday and had the warrant cleared during a hearing in a New Jersey family court. Every person who wins more than $600 in the lottery is checked for outstanding taxes, liens, child support payments and the like, according to Judith Drucker, public relations manager for the New Jersey Lottery. He owed a total of $29,000 in child support, according to William Maer of the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. It is not clear which children are covered by the payments or why he paid more than the original warrant required. The judge warned Quezada that he'll be approached with a lot of investment offers, but the best investment would be in his children.
