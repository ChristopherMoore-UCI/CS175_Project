The catacombs snake below the city, a 321-kilometer (200-mile) network of old quarries, caves and tunnels. Paris' dead had been buried in cemeteries and beneath churches in the city center, but the number of bodies began to overwhelm the land, breaking through the walls of people's cellars and causing major health concerns. Builders dug deep underground to extract limestone to build Paris above ground. Over time, they have served as everything from hiding places for revolutionaries to mushroom farms. Entering unauthorized sections of the catacombs is illegal and a police force is tasked with patrolling the tunnels, and caught cataphiles risk fines of up to 60 euros ($73).
