Pelosi said Wednesday the change would bring in an additional $25 billion instead of providing tax protection to only 6,600 more families through the lower rate and higher exemption in the negotiated tax deal. It also would extend unemployment benefits for 13 months, cut the payroll tax by 2 percentage points for a year, restore the estate tax at a lower level and continue a series of other tax breaks. Currently, the estate tax is scheduled to exempt inheritances up to $1 million and tax amounts above that at a rate of 55%. A number of House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, want to change the estate tax to levels previously approved in a separate House bill that would exempt inheritances up to $3.5 million and tax amounts above that at a 45% rate. However, more than two dozen moderate House Democrats submitted a letter to their House leadership Tuesday, calling for the tax package to be passed unchanged so it can go directly to Obama to be signed into law.
