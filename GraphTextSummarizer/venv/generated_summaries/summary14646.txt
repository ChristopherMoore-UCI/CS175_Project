The clock is perched on a 96-meter (310-foot) elegant tower at the Westminster Bridge end of the Palace of Westminster. Big Ben has been disrupted a few times over the years for various reasons, including weather and breakages. The clock pays tribute to Britain's royal history: It has a Latin inscription of the phrase: "O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the First." Some say it was named after the 1850s heavyweight boxer Ben Caunt while others suggest it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a former member of parliament. -- Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock, celebrates on Sunday 150 years of keeping London on time.
