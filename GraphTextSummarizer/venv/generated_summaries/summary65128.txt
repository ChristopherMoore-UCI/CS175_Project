Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel led from start to finish to win the Malaysian Grand Prix at Sepang Sunday. But he was later penalized 20 seconds by race stewards following a collision with Alonso as they battled for third spot on lap 46. It was the start of a disappointing afternoon for 2008 champion Hamilton, who crossed the line seventh behind the Ferrari pair of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso in fifth and sixth. Alonso, who was also penalized, stayed sixth. Veteran Heidfeld moved ahead of Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton into second position on the first corner and was always among the front runners through the pits stops.
