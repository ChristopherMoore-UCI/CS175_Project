-- Fernando Alonso's reign as the undisputed No. 1 driver at Ferrari is over, according to Ferrari chairman Luca di Montemolo. " Di Montezemolo praised Alonso's skill -- the Spaniard was the drivers' champion in 2005 and 2006 -- by giving the 32-year-old a "good eight out of 10" mark for a 2013 season which has seen him struggle to keep pace with Red Bull's runaway world champion Sebastian Vettel. Ferrari is a team and I want drivers (who) will drive and will act and react as a team member, not only one man. " Raikkonen has won 20 grands prix since making his F1 debut in 2001 and returns to Ferrari -- he drove for the Italian team between 2007 and 2009 -- as a replacement for Brazilian Felipe Massa, who is moving to Williams after eight years at the "Prancing Horse." The double world champion will be partnered at the Italian team in 2014 by Kimi Raikkonen, the Finn who won the last of Ferrari's 15 world championships in 2007.
