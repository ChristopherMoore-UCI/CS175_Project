Paulk died near midnight Saturday at the Atlanta Medical Center, a nursing supervisor confirmed to CNN. -- Bishop Earl Paulk, a charismatic preacher brought down by a series of sex scandals, has died. Paulk founded the Chapel Hill Harvester Church in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta. Paulk's death came after an "extended and horrible battle with cancer," Paulk's nephew, Bishop Jim Swilley, wrote in a blog post. But a court-ordered paternity test showed that he also fathered a child with his sister-in-law.
