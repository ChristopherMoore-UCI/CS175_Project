But after some soul searching and many Google Images, I can't help but think DiCaprio would make one intriguing Christian Grey. Let's keep it real here: Christian Grey can be one scary dude, whether he's defending Anastasia or punishing her, and that aggressive side of a character is another element DiCaprio is darn good at â€” even when the veins aren't popping out of his forehead. No one can deny that seeing DiCaprio's name on the Fifty Shades of Grey poster would add an additional level of credibility to the film, both in that the standard of acting would automatically increase, and DiCaprio's acceptance would mean that the role intrigued him. And if DiCaprio can do anything, it's play a character that is so layered and broken down and yet puts up this playboy front for the crowd (Gatsby, anyone?). Before I could make sense of any of it, I read that Oliver Stone told The Wall Street Journal that Leonardo DiCaprio was his choice for the coveted role.
