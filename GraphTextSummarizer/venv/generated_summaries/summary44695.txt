-- While rampant speculation on who is or is not in the running for the role of Finnick Odair in "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" continues to set the Internet ablaze, producers have reportedly made their first offer for another pivotal role in the sequel. Should the deal go through, it will be the first major new role cast in Catching Fire. Plutarch is a far savvier political animal than his predecessor, and he plays a crucial role in the events of Catching Fire. According to multiple reports, Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman has been asked to play Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Gamemaker at the Capitol after Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) was creatively executed at the end of The Hunger Games.
