The computer programmer,  horrified when a neighbor's cat was set on fire eight years ago, created the California-based organization to track animal cruelty cases and animal abusers. Among the abuses they've uncovered: • Dogs with missing ears and patches of skin • Animals with teeth shaved down to the bone • "Vets" who have used leg splints that are to tight to "treat" animals in dogfighting rings •  Contraptions, usually fashioned out of wood, much like a treadmill, that force chained dogs to run or be choked. "At the height of attention on the Vick case, things quieted down across the country with some of these dogfighters getting out of the business," veteran animal abuse investigator Tim Rickey said. Dozens more dogfighting cases have been investigated and prosecuted since the Vick case, said Alison Gianotto, who runs the database PetAbuse.com. Still, detectives, animal welfare professionals and prosecutors agree that the attention the Vick case has brought to dogfighting has been positive because more people are inclined to report their suspicions.
