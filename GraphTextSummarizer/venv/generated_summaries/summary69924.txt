And rather than getting better, the study found that as a new generation of children of only children grows up, the effects they found are likely to "magnify" as fewer Chinese grow up with extended families. The study found that 27% of the children born before 1979 were from single-child families, while 82% of the individuals born by 1983 studied were only children. Since then China's economy has taken off, while its population growth has slowed, and wages and living standards have soared. One of the authors, Professor Lisa Cameron of Monash University, said that the groups of children born after the policy were considerably more risk-averse, less trusting and trustworthy, pessimistic and less competitive than children born before the policy. The authors said that much of the outcome of the study could be explained by the effects of the one-child policy on family values in China.
