Perry, whose 14-month marriage to Russell Brand ended last month, was honored in five categories, as favorite female artist, tour headliner and for song of the year for "ET" with Kanye West, music video for "Last Friday Night" and TV guest star for "How I Met Your Mother." Among the other winners in the 43 categories, "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2" took four awards -- favorite movie, action movie, book adaptation and ensemble movie cast, although no stars from the film attended. Other honorees included Ellen DeGeneres, Lea Michele and Demi Lovato, as well as favorite movie actress and actor Emma Stone and Johnny Depp. In a Twitter message earlier in the week, Perry said she wouldn't attend but told fans, "I want to thank u all for voting for me, fingers crossed!"
