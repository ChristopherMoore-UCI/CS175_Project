Shopping options aren't vast, but Northeasterners from New York to New Hampshire can't get enough of jewelry designers Alex + Ani, whose Terminal B store glistens with sparkly goods. If all this luxury proves too exhausting, there are three spas on site with services ranging from a 10-minute manicure to a cellulite-reducing galvanic massage at Jetsetter Spa (Terminal H). DTW is home to a handful of well-reviewed, high-end restaurants, the most novel of which is PB&J (McNamara Terminal), where peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are made to order. Ralph Lauren's daughter's first airport outpost of Dylan's Candy Bar arrives shortly in McNamara Terminal, presenting patrons with a Sophie's choice between angel food and red velvet cakes to go. Casual Cuban spot Ku-Va (Terminal D) is renown for its ropa vieja and mojitos on the go.
