In addition, Reid had been arrested six times by Bridgeton police since 2009 on charges of making terroristic threats, harassment, burglary, obstruction, marijuana possession and stalking, according to police records. Michael Gaimari described Days and Worley as "very good officers" responsible for "a lot of key arrests." Another statement released this week said: "The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office is committed to conducting a thorough, fair and impartial investigation into the police-involved shooting death of Jerame Reid. Police and court records list Reid's first name as Jerome, but the prosecutor's office listed it as Jerame. Gaimari said Days was one of four officers who arrested Reid last August on charges that included resisting arrest, drug possession, intent to distribute and failure to appear. The Police Department in Bridgeton, New Jersey, released video this week showing the death of Jerame Reid, 36, who was shot on the night of December 30.
