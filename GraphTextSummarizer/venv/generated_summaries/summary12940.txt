The stadium, in Gelsenkirchen, stages all Schalke's home games and was also due to hold the annual biathlon World Team Challenge later this week. -- Heavy snowfall in Germany has caused part of the roof to collapse at the Veltins Arena, which hosts Bundesliga soccer team Schalke 04. The Bundesliga is currently on its winter break, with Schalke not scheduled to play at the Veltins Arena until the January 15 clash with Hamburg. "The holes are not going to be closed in time,'' Schalke's chairman Peter Peters said of the biathlon on the club's official website. Staff had cleared an earlier downfall prior to Christmas but were unable to get onto the roof after that due to harsh weather conditions.
