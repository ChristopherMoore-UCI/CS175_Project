Richard Barret told CNN affiliate WSVN that he didn't see the gunman enter, but he later saw him scuffling with restaurant manager Steve Lebrun. [wrestling move]," Barret said Wednesday, describing how he and Lebrun drove the gunman into the floor headfirst. The incident took place at a Miami Subs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Lebrun told WSVN he attacked the gunman after the gunman pulled the trigger and it did not go off. "That's when I rushed and grabbed his wrist, took the gun from his hand and beat the living daylights out of him," Lebrun said.
