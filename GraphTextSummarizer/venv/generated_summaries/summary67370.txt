" Today, Key West's annual "shoe drop" still stars Marion as Sushi -- in a better-constructed shoe -- and now attracts attention from around the world. "At 11 o'clock, Sushi arrives, and we lower the shoe and put her in it, then raise her up," said pub owner Joey Schroeder. After ringing in 2013, Marion will put the dress in storage along with the 15 others from new years past. " Marion said the months of preparation for the hourlong show, and the potential danger of being dangled in midair, is all worth it because it allows him to represent the gay community and the city of Key West. It takes Marion two hours to transform into Sushi: an hour applying makeup, a half-hour getting into the dress and another half-hour preparing his wig.
