" It has been more than a year since the Obama administration said that Syria had crossed a "red line" with its use of chemical weapons during the nation's civil war, which has raged since 2011. In August 2013, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters that a team of experts had gathered to go to Syria to investigate reports of chemical weapons. The final stockpile of Syria's chemical weapons has been shipped out of the country, according to the OPCW, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Later that month, video and witness accounts appeared to support the allegations that scores of people killed outside the Syrian capital of Damascus had been poisoned with chemical weapons. Half of Syria's population of 22 million has been displaced, and a flood of refugees are struggling to put their lives back together in neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, Ban said.
