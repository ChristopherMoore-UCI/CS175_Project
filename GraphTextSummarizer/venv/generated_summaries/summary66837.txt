Stenson claimed the $10 million prize for winning the FedExCup after winning the season-ending Tour Championship at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club in September before storming to a six-stroke victory in the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai eight weeks later. " With a new physical and psychological regime in place, Stenson started to see the green shoots of recovery with victory at the South African Open in November 2012. As if the loss of form wasn't sickening enough, Stenson then picked up a waterborne parasite on holiday in November 2011 which led to a bout of viral pneumonia. " Stenson will get his first chance at Augusta National in April, but before that will be lining up at Dove Mountain, Arizona for the WGC Match Play Championship on February 19 -- a tournament that he won in 2007. After winning golf's "fifth major," The Players Championship at Sawgrass in May 2009, Stenson looked set to join the sport's elite with strong showings at the U.S. Open (ninth place) and the U.S.PGA Championship (tied sixth) later that season.
