-- World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko has told reporters that he believes rival David Haye is only bluffing with his threats to quit boxing in October. International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO) champion Klitschko will defend his titles against Dereck Chisora on April 30, prompting World Boxing Association (WBA) champion Haye to announce that the unification fight between the duo will now not happen because he intends to retire when he turns 31 later this year. " Haye made the comments after Klitschko chose to honor an agreement to face the Briton's compatriot Chisora, in a fight that was postponed from last year after Klitschko suffered a back injury in training. However, Klitschko maintains that if he beats Chisora, he can still fight Haye later in the year. "David Haye has accomplished nothing in the heavyweight division other than to present himself with his stupid t-shirt and comments," Klitschko continued.
