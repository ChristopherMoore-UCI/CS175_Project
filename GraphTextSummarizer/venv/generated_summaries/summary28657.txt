Grizzlies' forward Rudy Gay turned the tables when he took Haddadi for a taste of American ribs at a Memphis restaurant. Off the court, Haddadi has been working to bridge the gap between Iranian-Americans and basketball. The NBA had to apply to the U.S. government for a license that granted Haddadi permission to play for the NBA. "If they ever make a movie about Haddadi, I'm going to get Sacha Baron Cohen to play the part." Mayar Zokaei, Haddadi's Iranian-American manager, said the Iranian basketball player has brought lots of media attention to the middle-of-the-standings Grizzlies. Haddadi and teammate Rudy Gay agree the United States will win.
