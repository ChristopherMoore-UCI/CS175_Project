-- New York police said Friday they have new video showing what they called a "person of interest" in the case of a woman whose body was found in a suitcase earlier this week. On Thursday, police identified the victim as Betty Williams, 28, from the Bronx. Blood was leaking from suitcase when it was found Wednesday night, police said. "The cause of death is strangulation," Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Thursday. "We're talking to relatives and we hope to have more definitive information about her acquaintances that will help in the investigation," Kelly said.
