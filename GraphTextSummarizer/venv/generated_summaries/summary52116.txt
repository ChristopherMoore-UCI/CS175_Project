The letters have been sent to Miller's family in which he addressed Speaker of the House John Boehner, Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama. North Korea has accused him of ripping up his visa on arrival to the country so he could go to prison and expose human rights violations there, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. The American held in North Korea, Matthew Miller, begins his six-year sentence of hard labor on Thursday. Miller was convicted of committing "acts hostile" to North Korea and sentenced earlier this month. KCNA described him as "rudely behaved," saying he was sent to infiltrate prison as part of a United States campaign against North Korea.
