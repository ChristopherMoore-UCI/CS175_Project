Education remains a major focus of the Exploratorium, which hosts webcasts, builds apps, trains science teachers and sells exhibits to other museums around the world. Though the Exploratorium costs up to $25 to enter, the 330,000-square-foot museum is rimmed with free public space: a wind sculpture, a giant sundial and wooden pylons in the water that track the tides and colors of the bay. At the Exploratorium, one does not stand stiffly in front of musty exhibits and read tiny placards. The Exploratorium was originally opened in that location in 1969 by physicist Frank Oppenheimer. The installations dabble in every scientific discipline, including electricity, sensory perception, weather, light, astronomy and sociology.
