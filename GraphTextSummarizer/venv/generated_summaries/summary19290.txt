" Atlanta Public Schools, which has 47,000 students, is the second large school system to have schools placed on probation, and the second in the metro area, according to Jennifer Oliver, vice president for communications for the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. According to AdvancED, the steps the school system must take to show progress include: developing a plan to effectively communicate is mission to staff and other "stakeholders;" hiring a trained mediator to work with board members to resolve issues; ensuring that board policies -- "especially those related to ethics and chain of command" -- are understood and followed; and coming up with a plan for selecting a superintendent that "demonstrates integrity throughout the process. The probation placed on the system's high schools stems from complaints that conflicts between members had severely hampered the school board's ability to govern effectively, according to a statement from AdvancEd, the world's largest school accrediting agency and the parent company of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Schools in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, lost their accreditation in 2008 and are approaching the end of a two-year probation. CNN education contributor Steve Perry asks how Atlanta schools' cheating scandal could affect students.
