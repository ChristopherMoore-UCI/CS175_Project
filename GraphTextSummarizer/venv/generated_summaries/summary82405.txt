Winehouse has battled drug addiction and spent about two weeks in a rehabilitation clinic last January. The tabloid also published pictures of Winehouse and Bowman in playful poses on a beach on the island of St. Lucia. Winehouse was quoted by a London tabloid last week saying she was "off the drugs for good" and has a new man in her life, 21-year-old actor Josh Bowman. Police started investigating her last year after obtaining a leaked home video that showed her smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she was heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium. She won five Grammy awards last year -- three for "Rehab" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist.
