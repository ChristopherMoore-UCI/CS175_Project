Cal Ripken Jr. achieved stardom as a shortstop and third baseman with the Baltimore Orioles and is a member of baseball's Hall of Fame. -- Former Baltimore Orioles "Iron man" Cal Ripken Jr. said Friday that his 74-year-old mother is doing well after being abducted by a gunman last week, but he thinks the kidnapping might have been premeditated. Aberdeen authorities say they are still looking for motives in the case and haven't found evidence of ransom demands for the elder Ripken. "At this time I can say we know of no ransom demand," Police Chief Henry Trabert told reporters last week. The suspect apparently put sunglasses on the woman and they drove around all day and made stops for gas, but made no mention of Cal Ripken Jr., Trabert said.
