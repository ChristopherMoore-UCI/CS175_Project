The watch, which for a time was believed to be lost, was auctioned off for $717,000, according to the auction house. "As the Babe's personal award for the first world championship in New York Yankees franchise history, I believe that this is the most important piece of New York Yankees memorabilia that exists," Ivy said. "This bat serves as a key piece of evidence for the many millions who believe that Jackson deserves enshrinement in the Baseball Hall of Fame," said Chris Ivy, director of sports collectibles at Heritage Auctions. -- Several items that once belonged to sporting legends such as Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson went up for auction Saturday evening in New York, fetching millions of dollars. Another item that made headlines were shards of the bat that Roger Clemens threw at Mike Piazza during the 2000 World Series after Piazza broke his bat after making contact with "The Rocket's" pitch. The auction, organized by the Heritage Auction House, took place Saturday evening at the Ukrainian Institute of America in New York City.
