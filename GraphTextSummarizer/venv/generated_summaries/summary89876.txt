Of the 38 containers of cremated remains found at the former funeral home, 33 were marked and identified, said Kimberly Chandler, a spokeswoman for the forensic science division of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security. The discovery prompted Delaware authorities to conduct an exploratory excavation on the property on Wednesday. Authorities will attempt to track down relatives or make arrangements to dispose of the remains, Chandler said. Nine of the marked containers held the remains of Jonestown massacre victims, Chandler said. Earlier, California Rep. Leo Ryan had arrived on a one-man investigative mission, bringing along a TV camera crew and various reporters.
