Hermann's appointment as Rutgers athletic director came more than a month after a video of a Rutgers coach hurling basketballs and yelling homophobic slurs prompted the coach's firing, the resignation of the school's athletic director and sharp criticism from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. " Word of the Louisville lawsuit followed news first reported Sunday by a New Jersey newspaper, The Star-Ledger, that a group of former volleyball players at Tennessee accused Hermann of "mental cruelty. Hermann was named in a 2008 lawsuit filed by Mary Banker, an assistant track and field coach, who alleged she was the victim of sex discrimination by the head coach and then fired after she complained to Hermann and the university's human resources department, according to documents. "We're lucky to have you," Hermann allegedly said in an e-mail, according to court documents. The allegations against Hermann have raised questions about whether the Newark, New Jersey, university properly vetted Hermann before hiring her.
