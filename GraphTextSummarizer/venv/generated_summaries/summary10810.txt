During the long dark days of Jim Crow segregation, HBCUs educated the lawyers, doctors, teachers and ministers who built black communities across the South. They have worked together under the UNCF umbrella to raise and distribute more than $3 billion and help more than 350,000 students graduate from UNCF member institutions. I vividly remember being introduced to the historic role churches played in black education. The churches' investment in black education paid dividends, not only to the students, but also for America. Montgomery was at the time the center of a movement led largely by black ministers under the guidance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
