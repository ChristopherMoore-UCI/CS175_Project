The last two inmates who escaped through the ceiling in the shower of the Caddo County Jail in Anadarko, Oklahoma, last month have been captured, Caddo County Sheriff Gene Cain told CNN on Tuesday. They broke a lock on the hatch above the shower head, Cain told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV, and then moved through a crawl space until they reached a wall, where they knocked out concrete block or two. The four inmates made a clean getaway October 27 after prying open a maintenance hatch in their shower -- the first escape from the 2-year-old Caddo County jail, Cain said. Four orange inmate uniforms were found outside the jail, CNN affiliate KOCO-TV reported. That got them to an unlocked door outside the jail area, Cain explained.
