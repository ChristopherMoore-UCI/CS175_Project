The younger son of political activist Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Myanmar on Tuesday for a long-awaited visit with his mother, from whom he'd been separated for a decade. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged Myanmar's regime over the years. Myanmar air force security officials escorted Aris, speeding his arrival without going through standard immigration. Myanmar's military regime freed her days after holding the country's first elections in two decades, which critics worldwide dismissed as a sham. Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on November 13, after spending most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison.
