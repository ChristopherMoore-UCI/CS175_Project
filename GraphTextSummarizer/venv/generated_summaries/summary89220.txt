"Fighter brands are very unusual but they are becoming increasingly common," he told CNN. "The problem is that fighter brands are almost always a knee-jerk reaction to a problem and are not always well thought out," Neil Saunders, consulting director with Verdict Research, told CNN. "Ask the question, 'do I need a fighter brand or is this a real seismic change in the market, which means I need to change my existing strategy with existing brands?' "The majority of fighter brands not only haven't worked, but have gone on to do significant damage to the companies that launched them," said Ritson. "The airline industry is a prime example, where people have launched fighter brands to combat the budget airlines and have been notoriously unsuccessful," said Saunders.
