Zhang is part of a growing number of voices calling for better sex education to combat child sex abuse, rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases, and unwanted pregnancies. Sex education is taught inadequately in school and avoided by parents, resulting in generations of Chinese children growing up wondering if babies come out of armpits, or from the garbage dump, as others have also cited. Educators have also largely ignored what calls the government has made to improve sex education. Sex education is not considered important," Zhang explains. He adds that only one college in the country -- Capital Normal University -- offers an academic minor in sex education.
