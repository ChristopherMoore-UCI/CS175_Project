But it is difficult to see who can stop Bayern, who last lost in the Bundesliga in October 2012 and have scored 39 goals in 15 league games this season under new boss Guardiola. -- Bayern Munich's record breaking run continued Saturday with Werder Bremen crushed 7-0 by Pep Guardiola's European Champions who are making Bundesliga history every week. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid opened their defense of the Copa del Rey with 4-0 win at minnows Sant Andreu. Werder continue to hover above the drop zone in a disappointing season, but Bayern have a four point lead over Bayer Leverkusen, who beat third-placed Borussia Dortmund in a crunch match later Saturday. Both sides finished with 10 men with Leverkusen losing Bosnia defender Emir Spahic while Dortmund, who trail Bayern by 10 points, had Sokratis dismissed for a second yellow card late on.
