Adkins' father, Dan Adkins, told CNN affiliate WBNS that his family worried about him, but Adkins assured them he would be safe at a guarded compound. -- Brian Adkins, a newly assigned American diplomat in Ethiopia, was found dead last weekend at his home in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, an embassy spokesman and a senior State Department official told CNN. U.S. Embassy press officer Michael McClellan identified Adkins and said he was from Columbus, Ohio. "The Ethiopian federal police are investigating it." Adkins, who would have turned 26 on Monday, received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from George Washington University, according to the school's newspaper, the GW Hatchet, which reported his death. The GW Hatchet reported that Adkins moved to Ethiopia as part of a Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship, after studying the local language and culture for nearly a year.
