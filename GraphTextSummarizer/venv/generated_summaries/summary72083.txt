"Hello, this is first lady Michelle Obama with NORAD Tracks Santa. Adding to the holiday excitement, first lady Michelle Obama teamed with NORAD to take calls Friday from children eager to know Santa's whereabouts, according to a NORAD press release. The bi-national air defense command began tracking Santa in 1955 because of a typo in a Sears Roebuck & Co. advertisement, according to NORAD's website. Google Earth shows Santa and his reindeer in action as they make their way across the globe, from Seattle's Space Needle the to pyramids in Egypt and so on. The map, which launched at 2 a.m. EST on Friday, uses little red and yellow presents to note the places Santa has already visited.
