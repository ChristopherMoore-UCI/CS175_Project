John Travolta is speaking out about his flub while introducing Idina Menzel's singing performance at the Oscars on Sunday night. Idina is incredibly talented and I am so happy Frozen took home two Oscars Sunday night!"

Travolta butchered the singer's name, calling her "the wickedly talented Adele Dazeem."
