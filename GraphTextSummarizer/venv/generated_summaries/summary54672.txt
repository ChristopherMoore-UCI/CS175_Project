"It is time to upgrade," Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement Wednesday. For nearly 30 years, the current jumbo jet Air Force One has been a customized version of the 747-200B. The newer 747-8 is longer and more efficient than its older brother. For example, the technological wizardry onboard the present 747s got wide play in the 1997 Harrison Ford action movie "Air Force One," in which the President's jet is hijacked by Russian nationalists. That's basically Air Force One in a nutshell. Consider the fact that all these things happened on an Air Force One: -- President Kennedy's body was flown to Washington for burial.
