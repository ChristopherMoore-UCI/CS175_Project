Shelby, 25, who is in his third season with the team, was at a Fort Lauderdale dance club early Saturday when security guards told police he was causing a disturbance, the affidavit says. Fort Lauderdale police documents do not elaborate on the allegation that Shelby was touching women at the club, saying only that security alleged he did not have their permission. Shelby refused, according to police, and asked the officer, "What are you going to do?" Appearing to be intoxicated, he began filming and photographing the officer, who called for backup, the affidavit states. Shelby was again asked to leave and refused before police told him he was under arrest for trespassing. After police stunned Shelby a third time, they were able to take him into custody and transport him to a local hospital and then the Broward Sheriff's Office jail.
