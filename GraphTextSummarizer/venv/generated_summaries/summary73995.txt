One of Colbert's opponents on the executive council, Charleston Democratic party chairman Waring Howe, defended the decision. Colbert has said he will not file for the Republican party ballot because of the $35,000 fee, so the move likely ends his bid to officially run for president in South Carolina. The party's executive council met Thursday afternoon in Columbia to decide which candidates met the criteria to be placed on the ballot, and Colbert didn't make the cut, executive director Joe Werner said. Stephen Colbert's name won't be on the South Carolina Democratic primary ballot. -- The South Carolina Democratic Party voted Thursday to keep funnyman Stephen Colbert's name off the Democratic Primary ballot, according to the party's executive director.
