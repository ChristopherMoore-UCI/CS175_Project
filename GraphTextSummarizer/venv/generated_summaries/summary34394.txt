President Clinton was inspired to enter politics, he admits, as a 16-year-old on a visit to Washington, in a moment captured by cameras, when he shook hands with the New Frontier's President John F. Kennedy, whom he then emulated. That other Clinton Bill Clinton had no such debility. I served my apprenticeship in politics working for mad-genius GOP pollster and strategist Arthur Finkelstein. Hillary Clinton hasn't yet been president, though it feels like she is running for reelection. At least in the short term, in any brutal exchange between a brass-knuckled political operative and Hillary Clinton, guess who wins and who loses?
