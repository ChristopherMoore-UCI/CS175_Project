Later Monday morning, in a surprise announcement, Obama made clear his own proposals for net neutrality, agreeing that there shouldn't be any fast lanes and calling for stricter regulations to keep things equal. -- Tom Wheeler's Monday started with protesters, ended with protesters, and was punctuated with pressure from President Barack Obama in between. Wheeler, in a written statement, said Obama's plan was a "welcome and important addition." Encouraged by the president's proposals, the protesters returned to Wheeler's home Monday night. The protesters want tighter regulations to ensure none of the major Internet providers get better access to websites and services than smaller competitors. Such access, also known as "fast lanes," has been supported by Wheeler in the past.
