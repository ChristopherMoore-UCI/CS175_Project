Haiti now has the opportunity to design their reconstruction plans around these pockets, and grow them, so they can more effectively act as natural buffers to climate change and natural disasters. An expedition by a conservation team searching for frogs in Haiti's dwindling forests has turned up six species not seen by scientists in more than two decades. "Finding six lost species in these relatively small corners of the country tells us that, despite tremendous human pressures, nature is hanging on in Haiti," said Moore. " Moore spent just over a week in the southern Haitian cloud forests, searching through the trees, creeks, and bushes for frogs and other amphibians. "A common assumption about Haiti is that there is nothing left to save", said Moore, an amphibian conservation researcher who has been to the island three times.
