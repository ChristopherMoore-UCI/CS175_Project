-- With the Alps looming large, Norway's Alexander Kristoff took his chance to fulfill a childhood dream and sprint to victory in a stage of the Tour de France Thursday. One man missing will be Garmin-Sharp's Andrew Talansky, who rode so heroically to the finish of the 11th stage, despite the effects of heavy falls earlier in the Tour. "Tomorrow and the next day are really important stages for the Tour de France." The 27-year-old Kristoff has come to the fore this season with a victory in the Milan-San Remo one-day classic but was desperate for a Tour de France stage win. The Katusha rider hit the front with a powerful surge and held off green jersey holder Peter Sagan of Slovakia, who again missed out on a stage win despite his consistent high finishes.
