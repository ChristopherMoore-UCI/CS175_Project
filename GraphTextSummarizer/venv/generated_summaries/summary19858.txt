Security experts warn parents to make sure to enable passwords for baby monitors and Web cameras. "Of course, devices may well be protected by passwords, but default passwords that haven't been changed are like having no password at all, as other commenters pointed out," wrote Vaas on the Sophos Security blog. Seltzer said that anyone on the Internet could build a scanner that would find cameras still hooked up to their default port. The IP camera was also password protected," he said. Multiple security experts have identified the camera model shown in the Houston news report as a Foscam FI9821P.  A FAQ page on the manufacturer's site lists the default user name and password -- both "admin" -- for the camera, as well as the default port used to connect it to the Web.
