According to PhoneNews, some cost-conscious callers would call GOOG-411 to place free calls to business numbers -- using it like a "friends and family number." -- Google's 411 service will shut down for good on Friday, but that doesn't mean the end of free calls to business numbers. But, even without the Google service, there's still another way to get around charges for calls to business numbers. PhoneNews notes it takes 24 hours to update friends-and-family numbers with your phone provider, so this service is useful when you unexpectedly need to call a long-distance business number. I found this especially useful when calling tech support or customer service numbers -- which often, surprisingly, aren't toll-free.
