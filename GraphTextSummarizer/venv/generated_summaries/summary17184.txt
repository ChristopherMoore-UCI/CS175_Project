" That incident left seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi as Stoner's closest chaser, but he was beaten to second place by fellow Italian Andrea Dovizioso. The 2007 world champion moved up to second place in the overall standings above Dani Pedrosa, who was taken to hospital with a broken collarbone after a collision with Marco Simoncelli. Pedrosa was passed by Simoncelli but clipped the bike of his fellow Honda rider when he tried to retake second place. Stoner, in his first season with Repsol Honda, triumphed by more than 14 seconds as he continued the dominance he showed in practice and qualifying to win for the first time at Le Mans. It was still Rossi's best finish since leaving Yamaha for Ducati, but he trails former teammate Jorge Lorenzo by 31 points.
