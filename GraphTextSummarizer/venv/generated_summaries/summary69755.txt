The battle for control of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, is shifting in favor of Iraqi and tribal forces fighting ISIS militants, Iraqi officials said Monday. ISIS still controls large parts of Anbar, but Iraqi forces say they've made progress in the past week in Diyala province with the help of coalition airstrikes. Iraqi forces, with the help of coalition airstrikes, have pushed back ISIS militants and have retaken territory lost after ISIS fighters launched a coordinated assault on the city Friday. While fighting continues in parts of Ramadi and in an eastern suburb, al-Issawi is optimistic Iraqi forces will be able to retake the city, but only if coalition airstrikes continue, he said. Iraqiya state TV has been reporting that the strategic towns of Jalawla and Saadiya, located a few kilometers apart, have been retaken by Kurdish Peshmerga forces, Iraqi military and police and Shiite militias.
