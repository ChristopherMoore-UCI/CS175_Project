The protests are part of a "Quit Kashmir" campaign launched by separatist groups against Indian rule in Kashmir. Clashes between Indian security forces and stone-throwing protesters raged in numerous towns across Kashmir, from the northern resort town of Tangmarg to the central Budgam district and Anantnag in the south. Scores of others wounded in the violence are receiving treatment in Kashmir hospitals that have come under tremendous strain. -- Indian-administered Kashmir witnessed widespread violence Monday that killed 18 people and left 80 wounded, some of them critically. India deployed thousands of troops in Kashmir to guard against what Indian leaders believe was a Pakistan-backed insurgency that began in the late 1980s.
