France, which had lost two of its previous three World Cup games against African opposition, might have been expected to emerge a different side after the interval. After all, Nigeria had managed just one victory in its previous 11 World Cup matches and suffered defeat on both occasions it had reached the second round in 1994 and 1998. " Pogba's goal -- the 146th of the tournament, one more than was managed at the entire 2010 World Cup -- set up a frantic finale as Nigeria pushed forward in search of an equalizer. Paul Pogba's 79th minute header and an own-goal from Joseph Yobo smoothed France's passage into the next round following a difficult afternoon.
