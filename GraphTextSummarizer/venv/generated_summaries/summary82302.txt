The unrest was part of the opposition against the candidacy of President Abdoulaye Wade ahead of February 26 elections. The opposition June 23 Movement, or M23, is named after the date of protests last summer that forced Wade to withdraw a constitutional amendment that would have nearly guaranteed his victory in this month's election. -- Senegalese police clashed Friday night with protesters, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them from downtown Dakar, where protests have been banned. The court rejected their candidacies last month in the same ruling that granted Wade and 13 others spots on the February ballot. Amadou Sow, a 38-year-old security guard, went downtown on his day off to protest Wade's candidacy and to exercise his right to protest in one of Africa's most stable democracies.
