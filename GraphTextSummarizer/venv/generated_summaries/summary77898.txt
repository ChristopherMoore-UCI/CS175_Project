The Portuguese boss -- whose team advanced beyond the last-32 stage of Spain's premier cup competition for the first time in three years -- highlighted Romero's past record of handing out yellow cards as the reason behind his dismissal. Mourinho was protesting a 37th-minute yellow card given to Mali midfielder Mahamadou Diarra when Romero adjudged him to have overstepped the mark and banished him from the touchline. "In the 37th minute, the manager Jose Mario dos Santos Mourinho Felix was given a yellow card for the following reason: raising his arms in the air, complaining about a decision I made," Romero reportedly wrote in his after-match summary. However, Spanish press reported that Romero claimed Mourinho abused him after being booked for protesting, forcing him to send the coach to the stands. " Real's win was emphatic, as goals from Esteban Granero, Gonzalo Higuain, Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso ensured they avoided the humiliation of last year when they suffered a 4-1 aggregate loss to third-tier team Alcoron.
