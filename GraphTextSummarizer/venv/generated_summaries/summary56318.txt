Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno publicly denied an assertion by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that she conditioned Superstorm Sandy recovery money last year on Zimmer's support for a redevelopment project backed by Christie. Christie aides push back Christie spokesman Colin Reed said it was "categorically false" that Sandy funds were withheld. The governor's spokesman also said the mayor and Christie have had a "productive relationship," noting an August tweet by Zimmer saying she's "very glad Gov. Christie has been our governor. The accusations over the weekend added fuel to a political and legal firestorm that has consumed the Christie administration in recent weeks, mainly over suggestions top aides and advisers to the governor orchestrated traffic jams around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last year to punish that town's mayor for not endorsing Christie for re-election. Christie has denied knowledge of the alleged bridge scheme that gained steam this month with the release of explosive e-mails between Christie appointees before, during and after the September traffic fiasco.
