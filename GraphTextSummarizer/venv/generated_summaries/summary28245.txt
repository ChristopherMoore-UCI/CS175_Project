Fine starts to 2015 for world number one Rory McIlroy and his arch-rival Rickie Fowler, a superb 64 from first round leader Martin Kaymer and aces for England's Tom Lewis and Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez. But last year's U.S. Open champion Kaymer, a three-time winner at the venue, later upstaged them with a blistering eight-under 64, which included 10 birdies, a personal best for him, he told the official European Tour website. His late charge denied Belgium's Thomas Pieters (65) the honor of first day leadership, while there was a five-strong group on 66, consisting of Branden Grace, Gregory Bourdy, Tyrell Hatton, Alexander Levy and Mikko Ilonen. There was no doubting the shots of the day, which came from young gun Lewis and the 51-year-old Jimenez, who aced the seventh and 15th holes respectively. The first day of the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship Thursday was nothing but eventful as a top class field jostled for position at the top of the leader board.
