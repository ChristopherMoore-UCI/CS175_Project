We recently met with Leslie Voltaire, Haiti's special envoy to the United Nations, who is charged by President René Préval with facilitating the international community's efforts to make sure there's effective aid management and delivery through the offices of Bill Clinton, the U.N.'s special envoy to Haiti. Impact your world: How you can help Haiti At last count, about 1.6 million Haitians are still living in the tent camps, without enough food, or a sufficient supply of water, and certainly without any feeling of safety or security. I was expecting to see people relocated from tents and starting to get into temporary housing. If the government works with us in identifying people to relocate, Yéle would start with that piece of land, which has a great agricultural component to it. We want to work with the government to rebuild, and we want to help get families into new homes.
