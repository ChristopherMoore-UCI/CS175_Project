-- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon traveled to Washington last week expecting to see top Obama administration officials. Washington must also weigh how much effort to expend on dissuading its European allies from taking tougher measures against Israel such as boycotting products made in settlements or sanctioning Israeli companies that do business in what is considered occupied territory. But the biggest culprit, the officials said, is continued Israeli settlement construction in defiance of continued American objections. Several U.S. officials said a growing frustration with Israel on a host of issues has prompted a discussion within the administration about how to best to express it "We are in the process of re-evaluating exactly that question," one senior administration official said, adding "various options are being drafted." In addition to the public dissing of Kerry, who spent the better part of a year in a failed effort to broker a framework agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, officials said Israel's inflexibility on security arrangements proposed for the plan by General John Allen further aggravated the already strained ties.
