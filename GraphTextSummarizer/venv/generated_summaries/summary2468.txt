Israel's Iron Dome defense system is capable of and successful at shooting Hamas-launched rockets out of the sky, but "that can't be certain" in defending Israelis from bombardment from Gaza, said Clinton, especially now that Hamas is reportedly sending drones over the border. Clinton pointed to the Muslim Brotherhood, and former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, as key allies in the negotiation process between Israel and Palestine that she helped spearhead as Secretary of State in November 2012. " Clinton said that the new, military-led regime in Egypt, which offered a cease-fire Tuesday that Israel accepted and Hamas rejected, sees Hamas as a "danger." Clinton said Egypt's new President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sees Hamas as a "source of instability and violence that can affect them in Sinai and beyond." Klein's book, which hinges on multiple anonymous sources to draw a story highly critical of Clinton, recently overtook Clinton's own memoir at the top of the New York Times Best Sellers list.
