Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. Doctors have been treating Gabor, 93, at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for two weeks without success, leading to Friday's amputation of her right leg above the knee, Rigberg said. " Husband Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said he did not tell Gabor she was being taken to surgery for an amputation. Gabor's only child, daughter Francesca Hilton, complained that doctors had been ordered by Von Anhalt not to talk to her or let her see her mother. Hilton has maintained a strained relationship with Von Anhalt, Gabor's ninth and current husband of 23 years.
