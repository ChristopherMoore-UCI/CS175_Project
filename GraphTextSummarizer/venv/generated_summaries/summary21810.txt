The Jason Statham vehicle "Homefront" grossed $2.8 million over its first two days and may only find about $9.5 million in its first five. Disney's animated musical pulled in $26.3 million on Wednesday and Thursday ($15.2 million, then $11.1 million), a substantially bigger start than Tangled, which grossed $19.9 million in its first two days in 2010. "Catching Fire" earned $20.7 million on Wednesday and $14.9 million on Thursday. Both "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" and Disney's "Frozen" are thriving at the box office, so much so that the films are on track to break records and achieve the two best Thanksgiving five-day weekends of all time. "Black Nativity" fared even worse, with $1.1 million combined on Wednesday and Thursday, which may result in a $3.8 million five-day start.
