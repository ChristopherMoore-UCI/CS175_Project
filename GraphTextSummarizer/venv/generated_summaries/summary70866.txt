On Thursday night, only about 800 people sought refuge at the four shelters set up by the Red Cross, said a Red Cross spokesman, Vinicio Sarazua Santillan. "People are returning to their houses now that the activity has lowered," said David de Leon, a spokesman for CONRED Guatemala, which organizes disaster relief. A government photo of Volcan de Fuego showed a massive wall of smoke that was lighter where it rose into the sky, and dark gray as it drifted. "You feel an indescribable energy, and this time was no different." Three people were treated at mobile health centers for respiratory problems, according to de Leon. The eruption of a volcano in Guatemala was diminishing Friday, emergency officials said, though a heightened alert for the communities near the Volcan de Fuego remained in place.
