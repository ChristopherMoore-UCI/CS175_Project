The iPad and previous iPod Touch model can receive video calls but cannot transmit video because they don't have cameras. Speculation about Skype adding video features had begun to spread this week, with some reports suggesting the feature would be the focus of the company's press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show next week. Skype's Android app doesn't yet support video calling, but other app developers have found workarounds. Apple said carriers requested time to upgrade their networks to handle the traffic load of video calling. Skype released a new version of the telephony application for iPhone, which adds video-chat features that go beyond what Apple offers.
