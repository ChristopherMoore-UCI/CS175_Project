The operation carried on into the early morning, the president said, and Guerrero -- the leader of the Popular Revolutionary Anti-terrorist Army of Colombia, or ERPAC by its Spanish initials -- managed to escape the building. That's why this strike is so important," Santos said, calling Guerrero "the killer of killers." A right-wing paramilitary leader in Colombia was killed in a police operation on Christmas Day, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos confirmed Wednesday. On Guerrero's body, they found a handgun plated with gold and diamonds, and a knife was in his hand, Santos said. On December 24, national police forces dropped in from helicopters to raid a building where Guerrero was thought to be.
