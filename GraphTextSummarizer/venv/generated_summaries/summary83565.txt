And in an economy where the disparity between the wealth of high school graduates and college graduates is increasingly stark, the choice to not go to college seems like financial suicide, even if the choice to take on debt may seem very risky as well. With the emergence of a new industrial economy in the 19th Century, college education became both a source of individual edification and national prosperity, and with the Morrill Acts of 1865 and 1890, the federal government created free (or nearly free) institutions accessible to people who never would have dreamed of going to college before. This dataset includes people who graduated college in the early-1990s, when average debt per borrower was less than half what it is today. This attitude resulted in shifting the cost of college increasingly onto the shoulders of individual students through more and more student loans. Was The New York Times' own magazine cover about "boomerang kids" (featuring a recent graduate with $80,000 in debt living at home) or  its front-page series on "Degrees of Debt" (featuring "a generation hobbled by the soaring cost of college") just another media clichÃ©?
