Overdose rates in the United States have more than tripled since 1990, and prescription drugs are to blame for a number of those deaths. Agents hope it will become a successful weapon to fight the war on prescription drug abuse, a war they feel they are losing. "The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse," said Harry Sommers, special agent in charge of the DEA's Atlanta division. Often, abusers will seek both "uppers" and "downers" when they are addicted to prescription painkillers. The CDC suggests that pharmacists talk with patients about safely using, storing and disposing of prescription painkillers.
