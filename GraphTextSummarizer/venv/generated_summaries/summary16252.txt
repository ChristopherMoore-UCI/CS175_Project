A Ciaran Clark goal early in the second half gave the home fans hope that a comeback could be mounted, but Marouane Chamakh poked a shot past Brad Friedel minutes later to restore Arsenal's two goal cushion. A 76th minute strike from Martin Petrov and another from England striker Kevin Davies in the 89th minute cancelled out Blackpool's two goals scored by Ian Evatt and Like Varney in either half. But back came Wolves with goals from Stephen Hunt in the 81st minute followed by Sylvan Ebanks-Blake who scored the winner a minute before the end. But Stoke's push for an equalizer finally paid off when Matthew Etherington scored in the second minute of added time. Everton's difficulties continued as they were thumped 4-1 at Goodison Park by West Bromwich Albion.
