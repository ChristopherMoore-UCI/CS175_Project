Now known as Zachery Bryan (he dropped his middle name shortly after "Home Improvement" ended), the 30-year-old works as a producer in Beverly Hills. Since the show concluded in 1999, Bryan has appeared on episodes of "Boston Public," "Center of the Universe" and "Veronica Mars." Of course, the Taylor family patriarch is busy starring on "Last Man Standing," which is essentially "Home Improvement" with three daughters. Despite his preference for comedies and love stories, Bryan's production company produced the horror film "Rogue River," which comes out on DVD Tuesday. From his run-in with the cops to that time he was caught with marijuana, Brad Taylor certainly got into his fair share of trouble on "Home Improvement."
