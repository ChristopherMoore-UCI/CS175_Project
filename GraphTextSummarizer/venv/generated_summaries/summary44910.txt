" "You don't want somebody who can't act, but looks exactly like the guy," she added, noting that it might be difficult to find an actor with Harris-Moore's 6-foot-5 frame -- which is why she suggests taller actors like "Friday Night Lights' " Zach Gilford and "The Last Song's" Liam Hemsworth. Casting director Tammara Billik, who also made the connection between the Barefoot Bandit and Leonardo DiCaprio's "Catch Me If You Can," said the movie will be a success, whether it's on the big screen or the flat screen. "Crash" and "Iron Man" casting director Randi Hiller didn't hesitate when asked which young Hollywood star would make a good barefoot bandit. His story, which mirrors 2002's "Catch Me If You Can" -- based on the true story of con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. -- has people talking, although details of the "Barefoot" film are still under lock and key. Harris-Moore, suspected of stealing automobiles, boats and airplanes, as well as committing a number of other thefts, earned his nickname -- the Barefoot Bandit -- by committing some of his crimes without shoes.
