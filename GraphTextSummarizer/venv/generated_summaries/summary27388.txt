-- A victim of Washington state's notorious "Green River Killer" has been identified 29 years after her disappearance, when a relative saw a TV movie about the serial murderer in April and family members gave DNA samples to investigators, authorities said Tuesday. Ridgway, 63, is serving life sentences without parole in Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, Washington, corrections spokeswoman Judi Feliciano said Tuesday. Watch: Inside the mind of the 'Green River Killer' Gary Leon Ridgway, dubbed the Green River serial killer, pleaded guilty in 2003 to killing 48 women, including Major, though her remains hadn't been identified at the time, West said. On December 30, 1985, at the Mountain View Cemetery in Auburn, Washington, authorities found remains that were determined this week as belonging to Major, West said.
