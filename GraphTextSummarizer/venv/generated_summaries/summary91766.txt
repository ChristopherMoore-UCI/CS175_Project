Covering slang from the United States to England, New Zealand, and beyond, Jonathon "Mr. Slang" Green records and documents more than 100,000 words and idioms in an OED-like, quotation-packed historical dictionary. I bet Carlin would appreciate Green's spin on slang: "To me its greatest charm is that at its heart, even its most obscene and gutter-dwelling heart, it is subversive. As Green says, slang is "...vibrant, creative, witty, and open to seemingly infinite re-invention. As Green notes, "...the basic concerns remain consistent in slang as they do in much that is human: sex, money, intoxication, fear (of others), aggrandizement (of oneself). One of the most accepted definitions is "Historical Dictionary of American Slang" editor Jonathan Lighter's claim -- "The aim and chief function of slang is to lower and disavow the dignity of discourse."
