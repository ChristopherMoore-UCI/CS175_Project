-- Europe risks being squeezed between "low-cost China" and "high-tech America" unless it can rediscover the knack for innovation, says the head of aerospace company Avio.

" "Europe runs the risk of (being) squeezed between the muscles of low-cost China and the innovation of high-tech America," said Caio, a corporate high-flyer whose resume includes heading Cable and Wireless, Indesit and Olivetti. Yes, they are suffering." Avio was now looking to Brazil and China for growth, said Caio.
