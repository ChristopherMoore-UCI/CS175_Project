-- Police are searching for a teen they say shot and killed someone in a Seattle-area bar where Seahawks players and other celebrities were partying. Several players and other celebrities were among hundreds of people gathered at Munchbar, a popular nightspot in Bellevue, Washington. The shooting occurred early Monday morning just a few hours after the Seattle Seahawks won their way into the NFL playoffs with a victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Jones is "a suspect in the murder of a 30-year-old man early this morning at the Munchbar in downtown Bellevue," Bellevue Police said in a statement. The teen was sentenced to less than a year in juvenile detention for a first-degree manslaughter charge in the death of the popular musician who played his tuba outside Seattle venues, the affiliate reported.
