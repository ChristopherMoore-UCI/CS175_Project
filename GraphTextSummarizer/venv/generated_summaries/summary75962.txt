"It is reasonable to believe that Dr. Eroshevich provided Anna Nicole Smith prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from California to Nassau, Bahamas with her on her travels to visit Anna Nicole Smith," Doss said. -- Doctors gave Anna Nicole Smith a long list of dangerous drugs over the three years before her death, including while she was pregnant, according to sworn statements by investigators from state agencies. Thompson told Doss he later "admonished Dr. Eroshevich" about the drugs she was requesting for Smith. Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall, "was given drugs in excessive amounts," according to a medical expert consulted and quoted by a state medical board investigator. Smith died in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, of what was later ruled to be "acute combined drug intoxication."
