Being an actress, I've had the opportunity to work with poor students, helping to provide arts-intergrated education programs for the past 19 years, working with many young students in Harlem, the Bronx, Brooklyn and the Lower East Side of Manhattan. I'm going to vote because I want elected officials who understand and can relate to the obstacles that young people and their parents face every day. But their dreams could be shattered if we elect the wrong candidates -- people who will pursue policies that do nothing for kids. I am inspired to support young people who want a future in the arts and in jobs that will make their communities better.
