Montreal authorities on Saturday detailed the charges pending against Magnotta, accusing him of first-degree murder in the grisly killing and dismembering of the student and threatening, among others, Canada's prime minister. -- Police in Paris are searching for a self-proclaimed porn star suspected of killing and cutting up a university student in Canada, authorities in Montreal said Sunday. The search for him began after a severed hand and foot were mailed to the Ottawa headquarters of Canada's Liberal and Conservative parties, while a torso was discovered stuffed in a suitcase and tossed in the trash heap of a Montreal apartment building. Having earlier indicated that Magnotta is good at disguising himself, the police commander said Saturday that the suspect could now be anywhere in Europe, though authorities haven't ruled out the possibility he may be back in Canada. "Information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in Canada, and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals."
