"In order to eliminate the threat posed to their lives, they responded with fire toward the origins of the shooting." Regev, the Israeli government spokesman, said Friday that it could have been inadvertent Israeli fire or the result of a Hamas rocket strike on Israel that fell short. The first occurred Tuesday at an UNRWA school in eastern Gaza, where about 300 people were staying. The second occurred Wednesday in central Gaza at a shelter where about 1,500 were staying. At least 864 people have been killed and more than 5,700 wounded since the start of an Israeli operation on Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Friday. An Israeli military representative said Friday that another soldier had been killed in Gaza, bringing the total number of Israelis killed to 36 -- 33 soldiers and three civilians.
