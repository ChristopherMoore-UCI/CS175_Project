-- There are dueling narratives in the death of Michael Brown: one says he was holding his hands up in surrender as officer Darren Wilson shot him, and the other says Brown was the aggressor, and Wilson shot as Brown was rushing toward him. Signs of struggle A friend of Wilson's called into a St. Louis radio show to say that Brown "bum rushed" Wilson and punched him in the face. Ross said it's possible Brown was surrendering, but he might have been bent over for other reasons, too: he might have been crouching to dodge bullets or he might have been slumped over because he was weak from his wounds, or he might have been making an attempt to rush at Wilson with his head down. "An autopsy is a snapshot," said Dr. Eric Mitchell, a forensic pathologist in Kansas City, Kansas. To look for signs of struggle, pathologists pay special attention to the hands, forearms, feet and shins, looking for signs of abrasions, cuts and bruises.
