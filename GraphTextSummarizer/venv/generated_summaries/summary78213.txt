Motion detectors alerted security that something was amiss shortly after 5:30 a.m., said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. Spyder The total value of the damaged cars is substantial, said museum executive director Wendell Strode. That car will likely go on display elsewhere in the museum, Frassinelli said, but the others from the damaged dome will be placed in storage. Sinkholes at the Motorsports Park aren't really a concern, Frassinelli said. "When you go in there, it's unreal," said Frassinelli.
