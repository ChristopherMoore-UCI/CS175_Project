-- Italian police on Monday found an explosive package at the Greek Embassy in Rome, the second time in as many weeks that embassies there have received explosives through the mail. He said that authorities were checking all embassies in Rome and Italian embassies aboard for suspicious packages. Late last week, an anarchist group claimed credit for a pair of mail bombings Thursday at embassies in Rome, vowing in messages that it plans more such acts to "destroy the systems of domination," the state-run ANSA news agency reported. Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattin called the attacks "a serious threat against foreign embassies in Rome." Police also responded to other reports of suspicious packages at the Venezuelan and Danish embassies in Rome and possibly other embassies as well on Monday.
