"Today he is in custody and (Venezuelan) President (Hugo) Chavez has told us that he will be handed over to us," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said. Authorities allege that Torres was a part of the inner circle of FARC leader Luis Edgar Devia Silva -- known as Raul Reyes -- who was killed in a 2008 raid in Ecuador. -- Venezuelan authorities have arrested a key ideological leader of the FARC leftist guerrilla group who is known as "The Singer" for his role as a musician promoting the rebel movement, officials said Wednesday.
