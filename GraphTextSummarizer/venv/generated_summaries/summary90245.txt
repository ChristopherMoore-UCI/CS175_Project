The app's developer, Little iApps, created Confession in consultation with two Catholic priests, one of them an official with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "It is essential to understand well the sacrament of penitence requires the personal dialogue between the penitent and the confessor and the absolution by the confessor," Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told reporters on Wednesday. The Vatican qualified its support for "Confession: A Roman Catholic App," on Wednesday, a day after the program's developer announced it was the first app to have official church blessing. The app's developer said Wednesday that he welcomed the Vatican's warning about Confession. The first is an examination of conscience that's designed to help Catholics prepare for confession before stepping into the confessional, "so you don't walk in and just start making up sins off the top of your head," Leinen said.
