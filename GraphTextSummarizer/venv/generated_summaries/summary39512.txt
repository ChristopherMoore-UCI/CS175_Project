Improving the lives of young herd boys It's not only the possibility of floods, or the biting winds that easily find their way through the worn-out, thin clothes of the young shepherds, that threaten them. They are the herd boys of Lesotho, often spending months or even years away from their families. Becoming a shepherd is a cultural obligation in the country and often deprives young boys of any form of education. Providing support and information about HIV/AIDS is one of Sentebale's missions, and it is also providing an education for the herd boys through night schools. The rural mountainsides are where boys as young as five tend cattle and sheep.
