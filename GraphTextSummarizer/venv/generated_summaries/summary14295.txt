Because practitioners of personology, which is a form of face reading, believe the features on our face tell, literally, the inside story of what kind of person we are. The more clues we have about the type of person we are, we can gauge what will make us happier in life, both in careers and in relationships. The theory of reading personality traits in facial features dates back to Aristotle. There are many more traits that personology builds on to get a whole personality picture, but the real question is: What good is it? Tickle has devoted her life to the study of personology, and she informs us in a lovely British accent that this is no fleeting New-Age fad.
