Police were called to their house on the city's south side at 3:30 a.m., according to a domestic battery report issued by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which offers the following account of events: Flav, whose real name is William J. Drayton, 53, was arguing with the woman, Elizabeth Trujillo, 39. Former rap star Flavor Flav was arrested Wednesday in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with assault with a deadly weapon and battery in a case involving his fiancee of eight years, police said. At that point, Trujillo's 17-year-old son, Gibran, began wrestling with Drayton in the living room of the four-bedroom, 2-1/2-bath house, Trujillo told police. Though Drayton "confirmed the stories told by Gibran and Trujillo," he denied having chased or threatened to kill the teenager, the report said. Drayton -- who is 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs 131 pounds -- grabbed two knives from the kitchen and chased his fiancee's son -- who is 6 feet, 175 pounds -- "around the living room, threatening to kill Gibran," the teen told police, according to the report.
