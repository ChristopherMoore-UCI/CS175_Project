My mother instilled a love of music and had all of her seven children taught a musical instrument. I couldn't live without love and music! Paul Field, managing director of "The Wiggles" 2. I was singing in a band at the time and the store manager asked me to choose between retail and rock'n'roll. I owe my success to... my father and mother.
