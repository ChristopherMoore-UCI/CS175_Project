Boehner and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader McConnell are still struggling to rein in tea party conservatives who are itching for more showdowns over Obama's immigration policies, the health care law, the debt ceiling and more. The bipartisan 56-40 vote sends the bill to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign it into law. It blocks a voter-approved law in the District of Columbia, that legalizes marijuana and blunts a school lunch program championed by first lady Michelle Obama. "Every Republican candidate all across the country said we'll do everything humanly possible to stop President Obama's illegal amnesty. Though his challenge failed, the senator wanted a vote to "ensure that every senator will be on record regarding the constitutionality of President Obama's illegal amnesty," Catherine Frazier, Cruz's press secretary, emailed reporters early Saturday ahead of the vote.
