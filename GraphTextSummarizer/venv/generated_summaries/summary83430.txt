-- This year's race for best actor at the Academy Awards was supposed to have been the most wide open in decades, with candidates ranging from two-time winner Tom Hanks for "Captain Phillips" to newcomer Oscar Isaac for "Inside Llewyn Davis." For instance, 10 years ago, onetime model Charlize Theron, who at the time had gained traction in her bid for serious consideration as an actress, made herself the all-but-inevitable best actress Oscar winner in "Monster" by becoming unrecognizably fat and grotesque as serial killer Aileen Wuornos. But Bridges' sixth Oscar nomination was overshadowed by finally winning best actor the year before for portraying a seedy, recidivist country-western singer in "Crazy Heart." Some observers believed the Oscar was as much for Clooney's good works, including his direction of that year's critically acclaimed "Good Night and Good Luck," as for his performance. If ... OK, fine, when McConaughey steps to the winner's circle Sunday night after his name is announced, it will represent the latest manifestation of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences' historic tendency to honor actors who make heads swivel by changing their image, professional or physical; the more dramatic and conspicuous the transformation, the better the chances that actor, or actress, will be rewarded.
