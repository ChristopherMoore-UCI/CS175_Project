"We believe that the hacker downloaded email addresses of users who contacted those three customers for support, as well as support email subject lines," Zendesk said in the post. "We recently learned that the vendor we use to answer support requests and other emails (Zendesk) experienced a security breach," said Pinterest in an email. It did not name the three customers publicly, but subsequent e-mails from Pinterest, Tumblr and Twitter to their customers confirmed the breach. The hack affected users of three services that use Zendesk: Pinterest, Tumblr and Twitter. -- Customer support tool Zendesk announced in a blog post Friday that it had been hacked earlier this week.
