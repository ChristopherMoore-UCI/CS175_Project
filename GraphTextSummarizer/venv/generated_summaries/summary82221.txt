A NASCAR Sprint Cup car stolen from outside the hotel where the team was staying turned up on a rural Georgia road Saturday -- the day before the scheduled race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, but not in time for the team to qualify. The Chevrolet was found by itself, minus the stolen Ford truck and trailer, in Loganville, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta Motor Speedway, the team wrote in a series of tweets Saturday. The car remained behind for some minor work, said the team and driver Travis Kvapil. The trailer with car inside arrived at the hotel Thursday night at 11 p.m. and hotel surveillance video shows the theft occurred at 5:32 a.m. Friday, the team said. "It wasn't quite ready to go to the racetrack yet," Kvapil told CNN on Saturday.
