Dozens of Michael Jackson fans, angry about the pop star's death, gathered outside the courthouse Monday. When brother Jermaine Jackson left the last hearing in June, he indicated some of them were not satisfied with the case against Murray. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, which the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. Murray sat silently in front of the judge at Monday's court appearance, while Jackson's elderly parents watched from the second row. -- A judge has delayed the preliminary hearing for Dr. Conrad Murray, charged in Michael Jackson's death, until early next year because more investigation is being done and some prosecution witnesses won't be available until then.
