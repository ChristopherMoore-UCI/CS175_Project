GOP-led House votes to establish select committee on Benghazi Hillary Clinton: No reason for new Benghazi committee Issa called the administration's lack of compliance "in violation of any reasonable transparency or historic precedent at least since Richard Milhous Nixon." " On September 16, five days after the Benghazi attack, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on Sunday talk shows and said the assault grew out of a protest against the controversial video. Republicans questioned that explanation, noting the Benghazi attack would clearly be the dominant topic that Rice would face and arguing the administration clearly knew that. For Republicans, the issue resonates with their conservative base, especially the accusation that the administration failed to provide proper security for American diplomats and was unable to send military assets to respond to the Benghazi attack. Because Clinton was secretary of state when the Benghazi attack occurred, Republicans have sought to depict her as inattentive to security needs of diplomatic staff.
