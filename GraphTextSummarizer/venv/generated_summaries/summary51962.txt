Here are five reasons to approach any prognostication with caution this time around: 1) Low turnout While more than half of eligible voters turn out for presidential elections, the percentage drops sharply in midterm balloting for all 435 House seats and about a third of the Senate. "All politics is local," former House Speaker Tip O'Neill famously said, and that is particularly true in congressional elections. Republicans frame the election as the chance to increase their House majority and regain control of the Senate, which would strengthen the party's ability to minimize or defeat the policies of Democratic President Barack Obama. While voting takes place in all 50 states, the competition involves the district congressional races and statewide Senate races. For example, which party wins a majority in the Senate depends on the outcomes of half a dozen races, including contests involving incumbent Democrats in Arkansas and North Carolina.
