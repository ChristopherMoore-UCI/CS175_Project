We're paying down credit card balances and placing greater value not just on the new and novel, the cool and the trendy, but also on value itself. The Internet is now a daily, indispensable tool we use to search for better prices and seek counsel from others with firsthand knowledge of brands and stores we might be considering. In the buying and selling universe, are we witnessing a permanent change in values? Because if there's one thing I learned after three years of watching folks shop and buy -- in good times, then bad -- it isn't that we buy that's been our problem, it's how we bought that was the issue: recklessly, and with little more than a piece of plastic or phantom home equity. I would explore all that attracts us -- bees to nectar-- to specific stores and products, why some of us are cheapskates and others have holes in our pockets.
