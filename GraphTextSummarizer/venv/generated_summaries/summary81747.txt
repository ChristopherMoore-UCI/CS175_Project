The uproar in Britain reached its crescendo Thursday evening when London Mayor Boris Johnson whipped up a crowd of 60,000 revelers at a pre-Olympics celebration with a taunt for the Republican presidential candidate. -- If only Mitt Romney could turn the Olympic torch on the newspaper headlines in London. Romney has yet to publicly acknowledge the outrage he set off in London when he appeared to question the city's "disconcerting" problems in gearing up for the Olympic Games. Asked about the controversy on NBC's "Today" show, Romney again sidestepped the question but declared London prepared. "After being here a couple of days it looks to me like London is ready," Romney said.
