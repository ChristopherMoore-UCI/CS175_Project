Davis, who teaches students in the 11th grade, said educators shouldn't limit reading requirements to books that students can relate to. Students learning English need more time to give feedback, and generally need to attend after-school writing sessions in order to catch up.

Don't forget to write -- and read, too Because time spent reading at home varies from student to student, kids come into language arts classrooms with varying skills. Natalie Schlittenhardt, an eighth-grade teacher in Pima, Arizona, said results on the statewide tests are really a report card on whether students had a good day on the day they took the test.
