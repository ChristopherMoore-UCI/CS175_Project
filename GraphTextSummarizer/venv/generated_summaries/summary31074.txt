The Malaysian businessman has been replaced as team principal at Caterham F1 by its new French chief executive Cyril Abiteboul, who has been charged with moving the UK-based marque from the lower regions of the championship standings. AirAsia owner Fernandes, who led the team into F1 in 2010 under the Lotus name, will now concentrate on producing Caterham sports cars in collaboration with Renault. "The strategy for the establishment and growth of Caterham Group has now reached the stage where we can step back from the day-to-day running of the F1 team in favor of Cyril," Fernandes, who also owns English Premier League football team Queens Park Rangers, said in a statement. The 35-year-old Abiteboul, who joined from Renault in September, will combine his new role with his duties as CEO, working with the Caterham group's overall chief Riad Asmat. "I am honored to take over as team principal," said the 35-year-old Abiteboul, whose first race in charge will be the U.S. Grand Prix at the new Circuit of the Americas in Texas on November 18.
