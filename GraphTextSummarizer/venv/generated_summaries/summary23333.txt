Italy said Britain did not inform it before the attempt, carried out in conjunction with Nigerian forces, to rescue Briton Chris McManus and Italian national Franco Lamolinara, who were kidnapped last year. The meeting between Hague and Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata took place at a foreign ministers meeting in Copenhagen. The UK ambassador to Italy, Christopher Prentice, spoke to Italian authorities in Rome on Friday "on his own initiative to explain events," the British Foreign Office said. "A clarification on the political-diplomatic level is also needed," Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said. In a meeting Friday with his Italian counterpart, British Foreign Secretary William Hague sought to explain why Rome had not been consulted before a failed rescue attempt that resulted in the deaths Thursday in Nigeria of two hostages -- an Italian and a Briton.
