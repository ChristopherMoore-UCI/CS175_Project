President Barack Obama called House Speaker John Boehner before Tuesday's vote to discuss the measure, according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. The House recently passed a measure that would cut $61 billion in funding for the rest of the year, largely by imposing cuts in domestic discretionary spending that Democrats insist are too severe, and Obama has threatened to veto it. Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, predicted it would be hard for Senate Democrats and House Republicans to agree on specific cuts anywhere near the magnitude of what the GOP wants. At the same time, some conservative Republicans have pushed for a larger package of cuts totalling $100 billion from current spending levels. -- The House of Representatives passed a bill Tuesday that would extend funding for the federal government by another two weeks -- through March 18 -- while cutting $4 billion from current spending levels.
