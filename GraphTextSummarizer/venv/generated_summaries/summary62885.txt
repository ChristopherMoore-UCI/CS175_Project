IBM's sponsorship of the Masters tournament guarantees club membership for its officers, but the club does not allow women to join. " Rick Santorum, in a statement e-mailed to reporters, said, "I encourage Augusta to accept women members, but I recognize their right as a private organization to decide for themselves." Burk says there are only two choices at hand: Augusta can open its doors to women, or IBM can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club. Augusta is famously secretive about its membership, and the club declined to comment on the issue, as did IBM spokesman Chris Andrews. Now, she says, "the boys" at Augusta, members and sponsors alike, find themselves in a big bind.
