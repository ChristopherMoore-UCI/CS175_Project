On Saturday, the Kremlin issued a statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Barack Obama that Russia approved military action in Ukraine because it "reserves the right to defend its interests and the Russian-speaking people who live there. Eastern Ukraine and the Crimea have closer ties to Russia, while Western Ukraine is more friendly with Europe. If Ukraine didn't, and instead joined a Moscow-led Customs Union, it would get deep discounts on natural gas, Russia said. Russia threatened its much smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if Ukraine forged ahead. He flew to Moscow, where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas.
