Officials intercepted a man who had strapped blocks of heroin onto his body; a suspect who had hidden drugs on a birthday card and two others who had swallowed packs of drugs. "These smuggling attempts show the lengths that organized criminals will go to in a bid to get drugs into the UK," said Brodie Clark, chief of Border Force. In August, authorities seized yams concealed with drugs aboard a freight flight at Kent International Airport in Manston. Other hiding places include drugs scatterered inside air spaces of glass ornaments shaped like love hearts, chickens and miniature bottles. Drug smugglers tried to conceal cannabis in a painting of former Arsenal player Emmanuel Adebayor.
