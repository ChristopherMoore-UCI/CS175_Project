Goodbye of the year -- Alex Ferguson After 26 years, 13 domestic league titles, two European Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups, Alex Ferguson brought down the curtain on his illustrious managerial career in May. Ferguson, who won 38 trophies during his tenure at Manchester United, led the club to the English Premier League title in his final season before stepping down. By season's end he had won 13 races to equal the record of most victories in one campaign, set by compatriot Michael Schumacher in 2004. Winning moment of the year -- Andy Murray A year after crying his eyes out on Wimbledon's Centre Court, Andy Murray finally ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion in July. Vettel joined Schumacher, Juan Manuel Fangio and Alain Prost as a four-time champion and will be favorite to win a fifth in 2014. Bayern Munich It was the year that German football left the watching world in a trance as both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund reached May's European Champions League final.
