Parker, who worked as a surgical technician at Rose Medical Center in Denver, is accused of injecting herself with syringes that held patients' pain medication Fentanyl, then replacing the pain medication in the syringes with saline, according to a statement from the office of the U.S. attorney for Colorado. Parker worked at Rose Medical Center from October 2008 to April 2009, said Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for Colorado. -- Nineteen former patients at a Denver, Colorado, hospital have tested positive for hepatitis C, federal prosecutors said Thursday as they announced new charges against a former hospital employee accused of exposing the patients to the virus.
