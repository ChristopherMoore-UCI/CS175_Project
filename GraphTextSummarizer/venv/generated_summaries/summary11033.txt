Diggs, who plays a doctor on ABC's "Private Practice," returned to his Studio City home from the SAG ceremonies Sunday night to find a man in his garage "looking for items to steal," a Los Angeles police spokesman said Monday. Diggs detained the man until officers from the LAPD's North Hollywood division arrived to take him into custody, Villanueva said. -- Just hours after Taye Diggs walked the red carpet and was a presenter at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the actor tackled a burglar at his home, police said. The burglar ran from the home, but Diggs caught up with him down the street and tackled him, Detective Gus Villanueva said.
