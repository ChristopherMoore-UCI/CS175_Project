According to Russian designer Max Kamanin, creator of Displair, high-tech displays made from mist and air are "the next step in visual technology". The screen-free display comes at a time when concerns are emerging over the hygiene of digital multi-touch displays: "By creating Displair we have developed a product which can be used as a public terminal for extracting necessary information such as timetables and restaurant menus," says Kamanin. " With Displair, users need not wear special glasses as with many other new screen systems because the image is being displayed onto an invisible screen; and that screen responds "intuitively" to hand movements -- 1500 of them -- many of which are similar to those used on our mobile devices, such as pinch-and-zoom. It's not a riddle, but it is a trick question: if the projections of companies like Displair are true then the screens of the future won't be screens at all but interactive images floating in mid-air. Tired with "electronic junk" such as TV sets and monitors, Kamanin wanted to invent something that would allow people to display and interact with information without cluttering the physical environment.
