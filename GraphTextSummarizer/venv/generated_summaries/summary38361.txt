Even though it's only a short-term agreement, world leaders hope it will pave the way to a long-term guarantee that Iran won't produce nuclear weapons. -- Israeli President Shimon Peres said Sunday that he could be willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, but expressed wariness of other forces in the country. It was the first face-to-face meeting of U.S. and Israeli officials since the U.S. and five other world powers reached a six-month deal with Iran last month over its nuclear program. If it was only him I'd take it with greater assurance, but there are other structures, other people. Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian energy purposes, not weaponry.
