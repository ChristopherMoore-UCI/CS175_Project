In "Escape From Tomorrow," the most buzzed-about movie out of this year's Sundance Film Festival, director Randall Moore presents Disney World as a dystopian hellscape and uses it as the backdrop for a descent into madness. " Moore said Disney security pulled his actors aside and demanded to know why they had entered and then re-entered the park within a seven-minute period. He said he told Disney security he and his "family" entered and then quickly left the park because they needed to reapply sunscreen. " Moore shot for 10 days at the Disney parks in Orlando, and for two weeks at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Avoiding detection by Disney security took "a lot of planning," he said.
