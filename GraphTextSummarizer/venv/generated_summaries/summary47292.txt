Beckham is still hoping to win his England place back, having been discarded by national coach Fabio Capello after suffering an Achilles injury in his second loan stint at Italian club AC Milan last year which ruled him out of the World Cup in South Africa. They wanted him back in early February so that made it difficult to do a playing deal on the basis of three weeks," manager Harry Redknapp said on Sunday. Tottenham had hoped the former England captain would join up in a temporary three-month move to boost the club's Premier League and Champions League hopes. The 35-year-old LA Galaxy player could have made his debut against former team Manchester United, where he made his name, next Sunday. However, the London side's website said the midfielder's Major League Soccer club would not let Beckham stay longer than February 10.
