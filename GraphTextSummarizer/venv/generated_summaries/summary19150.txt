-- An Australian man sentenced to 500 lashes and a year in prison after his conviction on blasphemy charges in Saudi Arabia is headed home after his punishment was greatly reduced, officials said Thursday. The family spent weeks searching for the Iraqi-born father of five after he went missing in early November while performing the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. Mansor Almaribe was arrested and convicted in mid November in the city of Medina. Blasphemy is punishable by up to a death sentence under the strict Muslim law in Saudi Arabia. Australian officials said they were told Almaribe made comments "insulting to prophet Mohammed's relatives." "I don't think my dad would even survive 50 lashes not 500," his son said last month.
