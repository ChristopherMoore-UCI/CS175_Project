"Although we have respect for workers' rights, we find it unacceptable for them to disrupt match-day proceedings and will not hesitate to take action in such instances," Danny Jordaan, the CEO of South Africa's World Cup organizing committee told South Africa's news agency News 24. -- More than 100 security guards have been protesting outside some of the World Cup stadiums this week in South Africa, calling on soccer's world governing body FIFA to upgrade their pay. Along with dealing with security, the guards handle tickets -- so a strike delayed the start of Monday's match between world champions Italy and Paraguay in Cape Town. The strikes have been frowned upon by tournament organizers, but FIFA did not immediately respond for a request for comment. Protesters were out again Tuesday outside of Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban.
