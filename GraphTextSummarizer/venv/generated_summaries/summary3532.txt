The first case prompted fears that the virus was spreading beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- the three nations which have seen the most cases of Ebola. As the world reels from the outbreak, scores of companies are fast-tracking tests for various vaccines, and hope to have millions of experimental doses by next year. Health care workers in affected nations will get the first opportunity to try the experimental vaccines, the WHO said. A nurse has died of Ebola in the Malian capital of Bamako, the health ministry said Wednesday, sparking fears that the nation has not yet defeated the deadly virus. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.
