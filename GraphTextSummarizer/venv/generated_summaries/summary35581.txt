On average, 17 children are placed in state care each day as a result of the detention and removal of immigrant parents, according to ICE. The Obama administration stated in 2012 that undocumented immigrants without criminal records would be considered low-priority removals, including those parents of U.S.-born children with strong ties in the United States. Child welfare departments and the federal government aren't required to track cases of families separated by deportation. About 5,100 U.S. children in 22 states have lost parents to deportation, according to the Applied Research Center -- a 30-year-old racial justice think tank. She accuses the Obama administration of failing to honor its pledge to make parents like the Sozas less likely to be deported.
