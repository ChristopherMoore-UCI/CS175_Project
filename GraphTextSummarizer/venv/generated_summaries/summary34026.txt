"Du Bin is a very respected professional photographer, documentary film-maker and author with a distinguished record of collaboration with international media organizations," says Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. -- A Chinese journalist, whose work exposed alleged human rights abuses of the government, has been detained by secret police in Beijing, said a close friend and human rights groups. He vanished later that month, says Hu Jia, an activist and friend of Du. Copies of the alleged warrants viewed by CNN suggest that Du faces allegations including disturbing public order. Du recently released a book on the Tiananmen massacre that was published in Hong Kong.
