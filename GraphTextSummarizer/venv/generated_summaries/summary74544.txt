Earlier this year, the Indian government increased the federal budget for space research to around $1 billion from some $700 million, ISRO spokesman S. Satish told CNN, as scientists propose to send astronauts into space by 2015 on solely Indian missions. Vikram Sarabhai, seen as the father of India's space program, made this case for government funding of the program in the 1960s: "We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically-advanced nations in the exploration of the Moon or the planets or manned space-flight," Sarabhai said, according to ISRO's Website. India holds its first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India on November 21, 1963. In the country's space calendar, November 21, 1963, is a key date: It marks the first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India. "But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society," said Sarabhai, in what the agency described as a "vision" for India's space endeavors.
