It really means that Google's close partners -- mobile operators and phone manufacturers, but not consumers -- can chop up Android to their liking. For example, when Motorola wanted to swap out Google's built-in location services on its Android phones for a competing service from a startup called Skyhook Wireless, Google effectively forced them to stop, according to a lawsuit that Skyhook filed against Google. For example, Google especially loves to boast that its Android software for phones and tablets is "open." Meanwhile, despite all the talk about Android being "open," there are even some things that Google's huge Android partners can't change. And it's why most Android owners have to wait a long time for Android software updates -- if the updates are ever made available for their specific phones.
