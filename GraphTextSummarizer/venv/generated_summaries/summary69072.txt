American flies Boeing 767-300s on international routes as well as long-haul domestic routes. Concerned the problem may exist on other airline fleets, Boeing says it plans to advise airlines to inspect the parts more frequently than the current recommendation of every 1,500 takeoff and landing cycles. You're talking about the strut that connects an engine to the wing," said Boeing spokesperson Peter Conte. The 767-200s fly primarily transcontinental routes. American Airlines spokesman Tim Wagner said the problem was first discovered on one of its 767-300s about two weeks ago during a maintenance check targeting other parts of the aircraft.
