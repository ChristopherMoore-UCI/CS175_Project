For years, he has been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached Italian courts. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, is arguably one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. Prosecutors had argued that Berlusconi had sex 13 times with underage dancer Karima el Mahroug -- known as "Ruby the heart-stealer" -- and abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from jail, where she was being held on charges of theft. On Friday, Milan Court of Appeal presiding judge Concetta Locurto read his acquittal verdict live on Italian television. A panel of judges convicted Berlusconi of both charges in June 2013, sentencing the flamboyant billionaire tycoon to seven years in prison and barring him from holding public office.
