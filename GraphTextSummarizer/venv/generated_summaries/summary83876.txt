The penalty is the largest safety violation fine for a utility in California history, said Andrew Kotch, spokesman for the California Public Utilities Commission. -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company must pay $38 million for safety violations in connection with a Christmas Eve 2008 explosion and fire in northern California, officials said. "This decision sends a signal that California is taking a firm stand on integrity and safety in its gas distribution infrastructure," Timothy Alan Simon, the commissioner assigned in this proceeding, said in a statement. The commission said PG&E committed safety violations that included not following its internal procedures after discovering the installation of a gas pipe with a wall thickness below specifications; not administering drug and alcohol tests after the Rancho Cordova explosion to all employees "whose performance on December 24, 2008, under the circumstances presented, could not be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident"; and making an "unreasonably delayed and not effective" response to a neighborhood resident's phone call about an outdoor gas leak odor. They destroyed a house in Rancho Cordova, California, near Sacramento, authorities said.
