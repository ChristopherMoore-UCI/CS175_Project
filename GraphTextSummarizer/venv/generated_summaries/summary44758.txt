This is why I was saddened to watch Eddie Long duck and dodge allegations that he seduced multiple teenage boys into sexual relationships. -- Over the past two decades, Bishop Eddie Long has built his public ministry at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church near Atlanta, Georgia, upon a testosterone-laden theology and a hypermasculine image. Maybe for the good of New Birth, Eddie Long should take that sword out of his golden ring and fall on it. The ministry motto, "Taking Authority," is signified by a golden sword and shield that adorns the bishop's ring finger. But aside from a brief yet legally broad statement through lawyers saying that "the charges against me and New Birth are false," he did not counter the boys' allegations.
