His decision means that if a panel of military officers finds Hasan guilty, they can consider the death penalty as a possible sentence. "Following the attack at Fort Hood and the failed attack over Detroit, we've improved the analytic process, created new groups to track threat information, and enhanced cooperation among our intelligence agencies, including better information sharing so that all threats are acted upon quickly." And he repeatedly has complained that he and his client have been denied full details of what U.S. intelligence agencies knew about Hasan's contacts with overseas terrorists, including Anwar al-Alwaki, an American-born cleric now believed to be in Yemen and to be the target of American drone attacks. Lt. Gen. Donald Campbell, the Fort Hood commander, formally announced that the charges against Hasan will be tried as capital offenses in a general court-martial. Hasan, who is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair after being shot by police responding to the rampage, is being held in a county jail near Fort Hood.
