Getting there: Rjukan is a 2.5 hour coach journey from Oslo Airport. Solar Tower Systems, a company that builds mirror systems for solar thermal power plants in hotter climes, was drafted in to install the mirrors on the mountain wall -- not an easy task. "It's magnificent now that it's in place," says Tracy Murphy, owner of town center business CafÃ© Nye Tider. The small town of Rjukan sits deep in the narrow Vestfjord Valley, in the Telemark region south-west of Oslo. The towering peaks that surround it rise to almost 2,000 meters above sea level and block out the sunlight for half the year, meaning Rjukan residents live in a permanent shadow from September to March.
