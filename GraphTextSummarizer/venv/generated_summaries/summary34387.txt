"They tried to negotiate and explain that the compensation policy of HK airlines is different from mainland Chinese airlines."

A nearly 9-hour flight delay turned into a standoff at Hong Kong airport Wednesday, with passengers refusing to leave the plane for 5-hours until the airline agreed to higher compensation.
