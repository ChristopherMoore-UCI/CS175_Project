Blizzard warnings stretched from southeast Colorado through western Kansas, the Oklahoma panhandle and far northern Texas, according to the National Weather Service. Visibility in parts of western Kansas and southeast Colorado was less than a quarter-mile, said Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Heavy snowfall was reported in eastern Colorado and western Kansas on Tuesday, along with freezing rain and sleet across south-central Kansas. Warnings that had threatened northeast New Mexico, however, had expired by late Tuesday morning. Roads and highways were "completely snow-packed" or covered with ice in much of western Kansas on Monday, according to the state's Department of Transportation.
