Cameroon joined Ivory Coast and Nigeria as African qualifiers for the World Cup finals with a 4-1 victory over Tunisia in Yaounde Sunday. Nigeria, leading 2-1 from the first leg, were given a comfortable cushion when Victor Moses, on loan at Liverpool from fellow EPL side Chelsea, scored from the penalty spot after Anyalem Hailu handled. Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, Senegal went ahead in the 77th minute after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba fouled Sadio Mane. That match was played in Casablanca, with Senegal punished by FIFA for crowd trouble, but they gave Ivory Coast an uncomfortable time. Ethiopia put up a brave fight but the reigning African champions made sure of their passage when substitute Victor Obinna doubled Nigeria's lead after 82 minutes with a fine free kick.
