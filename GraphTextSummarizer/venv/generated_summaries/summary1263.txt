Lohan told police she asked LaBella to borrow his cell phone because her battery died, and then discovered photos he took of her at the nightclub, the source said. LaBella told police Lohan took his phone without permission and refused to give it back. When she refused to return the phone, Lohan told police that LaBella pushed her onto the bed and she suffered scratches, the source added. LaBella told police he is a clerical worker from Valley Village, a suburb of Los Angeles. Lohan, who is on unsupervised probation for a shoplifting conviction, moved to New York this summer following a series of late-night controversies in Los Angeles.
