And in another policy that sets her at odds with many euroskeptic politicians including Cameron, Merkel raised the specter of full European political union, with more national laws ceded to Brussels. -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched an outspoken defense of the European project on Wednesday, but warned that the bloc's richest nation would not make bailout promises to solve the eurozone crisis that it cannot keep. Outside the conference hall, Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, said Merkel's "call for greater political unity was the price for Germany bailing Greece out and putting a firewall around Italy to avoid severe contagion" in world markets. Nevertheless she insisted the European court of justice should enforce the public spending and budget policies of eurozone nations. In comments that could cause concerns about Germany's growing influence in Europe, Merkel said: "We have seen that something needs to be changed here, so it is not only austerity measures ... but also structural reforms that lead to more jobs."
