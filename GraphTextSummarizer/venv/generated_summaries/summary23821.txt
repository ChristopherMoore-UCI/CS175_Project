"I wish I had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight." WMAR reports that the woman saw her son on television throwing rocks at police. But Police Commissioner Anthony Batts thanked her in remarks to the media. The name of the woman dressed in light blue jeans, a yellow lace tunic and a cropped yellow jacket was not immediately known. "And if you saw in one scene you had one mother who grabbed their child who had a hood on his head and she started smacking him on the head because she was so embarrassed," he said Monday.
