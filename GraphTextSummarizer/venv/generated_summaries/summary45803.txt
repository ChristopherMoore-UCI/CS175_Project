" When in full flow, water polo can be quite a frenetic business, so Webster and her teammates have engineered unique ways of communicating during the game. While obviously disappointed at missing out on gold at the World Championships, Webster was an integral part of her country's best return since 2007, when the Stingers also took silver. "I feel free when I play water polo," Webster explains. " Not only does water polo require finesse, vision, excellent hand-eye coordination and strength, it also requires bundles of stamina. By the age of 13 Webster was playing for her state, Victoria, and by 16 she was representing her country, captaining Australia to the Junior World Championships title in 2007.
