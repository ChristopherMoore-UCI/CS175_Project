The attack took place Monday in a remote area of Gariaband in Chhattisgarh state when the officers were on their way to search a house as part of anti-Maoist operation, said state police spokesman Rajesh Mishra. Over the years, they targeted Indian security forces in several impoverished eastern Indian states that have become known as the "Red Corridor." The Maoist guerrillas are called Naxalites after Naxalbari, a village in neighboring West Bengal state where they originated in the late 1960s. About 10 days ago, seven officers were killed when they were ambushed as they were returning from routine patrol, Mishra said. -- Suspected Maoist insurgents killed nine policemen during an ambush in eastern India, authorities said Tuesday.
