In a move that is surely music to the ears of Apple fans in Asia, the U.S. technology giant has rolled out its online digital media store, iTunes, in a dozen territories, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. While Apple's wildly popular Mac computers, iPhones, and iPads are widely available in the Asia-Pacific region, its customers outside of Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have previously been unable to purchase music, movies, and other media from iTunes without a gift card or credit card attached to a billing address in a country with an iTunes store. Apple would not comment on the company's plans to launch iTunes in China. Apple has sold more than 16 billion songs via its iTunes Store since it was launched in 2003, according to the company. Curiously, mainland China is the obvious absentee, despite being the California-based company's second largest market and the site of five Apple retail stores.
