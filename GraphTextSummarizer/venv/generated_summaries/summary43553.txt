Looking and talking like an Old West figure, Mayor Cameron Hamilton made his declaration while on the dais of the Porterville City Council last week. "I'm against bullying, but I'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything and the ills of the world," Hamilton said during the City Council meeting.

Hamilton expressed exasperation -- and blamed zero-tolerance zones in school as a big part of the problem.
