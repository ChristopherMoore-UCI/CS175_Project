Husband, father Smith, 57, was last seen when he left a friend's house in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. That changed in February last year, when his car was found at a storage facility in Simi Valley, northwest of Los Angeles. Hikers found his body this week in a shallow grave in Palmdale, according to Lt. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta, and JR Nichols reported from Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officially declared him dead in May this year.
