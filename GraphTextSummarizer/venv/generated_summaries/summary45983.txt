President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is running for a second term, visited Toulouse and offered his sympathies to bereaved families. The crisis could yet have a negative effect on Sarkozy though, with the far-right saying that the government had failed to protect French people from Islamic fundamentalists. For this reason, as Persico noted, Sarkozy may be keen to keep the focus on security and the Toulouse attacks -- issues on which he looks strong. Political analyst Simon Persico, from the Center of European Studies in Paris, said Sarkozy won the 2007 election by being right-wing, and taking a strong stance on race, but had found it difficult to maintain this stance while in power. "In this election, Le Pen is saying the original is better than the copy, and that voters should not believe Sarkozy on race," he told CNN.
