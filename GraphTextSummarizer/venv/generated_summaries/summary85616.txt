-- Samoa will switch its driving from the right side to the left side of the road on Monday in a move opponents have called ill-conceived and said will lead to dozens of wrecks and fatalities. "It narrows the bridge between the rich guys and people like us, the lower class people from the rural areas," Fa'aleaga Young Yen told CNN affiliate TVNZ in New Zealand. "To send the same kind of car from New Zealand? The government said it will strictly enforce the use of seat belts and has built speed bumps to prevent wrecks. The change will allow the thousands of expatriate Samoans who live in their nation's biggest neighbors, New Zealand and Australia, to send used -- and therefore, cheaper -- cars to their families back home.
