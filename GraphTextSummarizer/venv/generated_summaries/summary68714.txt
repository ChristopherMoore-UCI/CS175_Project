South Sudan is to become the world's newest country Saturday after South Sudan natives voted overwhelmingly in January for independence. -- The president of Sudan will visit South Sudan when it marks its independence from the north on Saturday, a government official said Thursday. The planned visit comes amid tense relations between north and South Sudan. Violence erupted two months ago along the contested border area of Abyei and subsequently in South Kordofan, a state that lies north of the border but where many people, especially in the Nuba Mountains, are allied with the south. President Omar al-Bashir will make the trip as an expression of hope for "brotherly relations" between his government based in the north and South Sudan, his spokesman said.
