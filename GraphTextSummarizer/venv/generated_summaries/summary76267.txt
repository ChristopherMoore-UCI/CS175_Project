Only in politics and government, when the hired hands come up short, are they allowed to get away with flicking spitballs at each other as the country waits for results -- spitballs in the form of purportedly clever attack lines packaged and issued by advisers, meant to wound the other side, yet doing nothing to further the completion of the jobs at hand. They have lofty titles and work in buildings made of white marble. We wouldn't accept that from electricians or auto mechanics; there is no reason to accept it from men and women with federal titles. When work needs to be done, you hire people who promise that they know how to do it, and you expect to get what you paid for. â€¢ A fair solution to health care, that compassionate people along every station of the right/left continuum can live with and be proud of.
