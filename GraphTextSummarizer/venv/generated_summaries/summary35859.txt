Solid scientific data is lacking, but light therapy appears to cause a change in brain chemicals linked to mood and seems to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms. "This is both very disorienting and a trigger for mood slumps and depression." "Since the inner clock relies on sunlight to stay in sync, winter sunrise is later and winter nights are longer, melatonin can overshoot into the day, causing grogginess or 'brain fog,' for several hours," Terman says. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, it's a type of depression, with symptoms such as: • Sad, anxious or "empty" feelings • Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism • Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness • Irritability, restlessness • Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy • Fatigue and decreased energy • Difficulty concentrating, remembering details and making decisions • Exercise helps decrease stress and anxiety, both of which can increase symptoms of SAD. Younger people have a higher risk of SAD, and those affected are more likely to have blood relatives with SAD or another form of depression.
