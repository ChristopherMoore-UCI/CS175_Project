India summons U.S. diplomat over report of NSA spying Report: NSA collects millions of facial images per day Telecom firm pushed back on NSA data collection, papers show CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report. The board expressed concern over the use of "about" collections -- those that lead to a person who may not be involved to a suspect communication -- "and the use of queries to search for the communications of specific U.S. persons within the information that has been collected." Among the board's conclusions was an affirmation that the "core" of the 702 program -- that is, narrowly defining those subjects targeted as non-U.S. citizens living abroad and submitting to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court rules and oversight -- "fits within the 'totality of the circumstances' standard for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, as that standard has been defined by the courts to date." The nation's top intelligence official praised the report, but civil liberty advocates said the board failed to make effective proposals to protect privacy rights. The requests stemmed from media reports on two NSA programs that were based on the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The report lists 10 recommendations for strengthening privacy protections, such as revising the criteria for selecting targets for intelligence-gathering, limiting FBI use of Section 702 data, using more advanced "upstream" filtering technology to protect communications that are off-limits and requiring the government to supply random samples of targeting decisions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court when reapplying for certification of the Section 702 program.
