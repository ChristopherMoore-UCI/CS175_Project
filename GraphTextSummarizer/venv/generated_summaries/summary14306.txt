The comments by Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, came shortly before an eruption of rage by some protesters over the decision not to indict police Officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of 18-year-old Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In The New York Times video, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, is visible in the crowd Monday night in Ferguson. His words were markedly different than those of Michael Brown Sr., who recorded a public service announcement last week, saying that "destroying property is not the answer. A row of businesses on West Florissant Avenue, a major thoroughfare in the St. Louis suburb, was engulfed in flames Monday night. " St. Louis Alderman Antonio French told CNN Tuesday that he was nearby when Head made the statements.
