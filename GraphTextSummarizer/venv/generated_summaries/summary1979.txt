They're going to need to start the long journey of repairing and replacing the damage that's been done by the storm," said Maj. Terry Ray, Mississippi Gulf Coast area commander. We will continue to feed and roll out cleaning supplies and materials so people can get back to where they were before the disaster hit. AmeriCares has delivered family emergency kits and cleaning supplies to Mississippi families affected by the storm. The relief supplies include household cleaning kits, mops and family emergency kits, which contain tote bags stocked with soap, shampoo, toothbrushes and other personal care items. The Salvation Army is building up emergency response teams and supplies in affected areas along the Gulf Coast.
