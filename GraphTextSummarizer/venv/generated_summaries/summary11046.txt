" Watch this: Turning Mandela's life into a blockbuster While it's still unclear exactly who will control the "Mandela Brand" in the years to come, the way Madiba's legacy and image endures seems to depend on all those who have a stake in it -- from his family and his party, the African National Congress, to the people of South Africa.
