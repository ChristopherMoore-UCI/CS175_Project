"There's suspicion about everything going on in this case," Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday in a news conference about the case. Not according to a Wilson County mechanic, who "did not determine any type of issues" with the truck, according to Woodard. Authorities say the initial statements from the two guards who work for TransValue Inc., a Florida-based company that transports valuables, were a bit confusing due to the guards' spotty English, though Woodward said police now have a clearer picture after bringing in Spanish-speakers to translate. But people called authorities around 6:49 p.m. Sunday after they spotted the men, still bound, coming out of the woods, according to Woodard. "Right now, (the guards) are still considered victims," Woodard said, declining to answer whether or not authorities believe this was an inside job.
