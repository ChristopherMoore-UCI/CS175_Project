Among other things, he discussed the need to provide greater export financing to American manufacturing companies while expanding support for small business. -- President Barack Obama trumpeted his manufacturing and export agenda Friday, telling a crowd in Washington state that the American economy is poised for a strong, long-term recovery with the right kind of government assistance. " Obama also said he wants to help American firms get matching support to counter financing that other multinational companies are receiving from their governments. Obama pushed Congress in his speech to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the official credit agency tasked with helping to finance the foreign purchase of goods from American companies who are unable to accept the credit risk themselves. During the speech, the president highlighted his promise to double American exports over five years -- a goal he said is on track to be reached ahead of schedule.
