And this year, Cocktail Bodega in New York City -- which is half juice bar, half cocktail lounge -- is serving up a "Tequila Immune Booster" made with tequila, ginger and carrot juice -- a good source of vitamin A, which can help maintain a healthy immune system. "It's probably something that over a long period of time helps you maintain a healthy immune system, but if you take it when you're actually sick, it doesn't do anything to the virus itself," says Dr. Nicole Bouvier, assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Disease at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. When Jeni Britton Bauer, owner of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams in Columbus, Ohio, was young, getting a cold or the flu meant her mother and grandmother would mix up a cocktail of their own cure-all for the winter ills -- a syrup of honey, lemon juice and whiskey. Sorry, whiskey fans: the Maker's Mark is not going to cure your cold or flu, though it certainly can make you feel less miserable. But "flu is in a lot of places where beverages don't reach," says Bouvier.
