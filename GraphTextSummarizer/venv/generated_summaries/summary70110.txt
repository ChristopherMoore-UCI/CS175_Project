From silent disco parties at Bonnaroo in Tennessee to all-night raves at Serbia's Exit festival, our guide prepares music fans worldwide for another year of summer music festivals in the sun. -- More than 160,000 people flocked to the tenth Coachella music festival in April, signaling the start of the annual summer music festival season worldwide. Over 200,000 people attended Exit last year, dancing at all night raves in the gorgeous surroundings of Petrovaradin Fortress, an eighteenth century castle near the Danube River. Bestival boasts a yearly fancy dress competition -- last year was "30,000 freaks under the sea," and 2009 is the year of "Outer Space," so make sure to dress accordingly. This year's headliners include Franz Ferdinand, Blur, and Bruce Springsteen.
