Manchin and Democrats here are hitting back against Raese by painting the wealthy miner and media magnate as out of touch with West Virginia voters. " In television and radio ads, and on the campaign trail, Raese is pounding Manchin -- warning voters he would be a "rubber stamp" for President Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress. -- Wealthy Republican businessman John Raese has run three times for statewide office in West Virginia over the past few decades and has never won. Still, in any other election year, those charges might not resonate against Manchin, who is incredibly popular in West Virginia. Manchin also admits that the president's unpopularity in West Virginia is a real issue.
