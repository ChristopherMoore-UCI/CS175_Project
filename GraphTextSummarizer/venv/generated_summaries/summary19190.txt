It's working with the parks department and others to increase surveillance and vaccinate wild raccoons in New York's Central Park, Morningside Park and Riverside Park. -- Authorities and medical experts warned Friday that a rabies outbreak in Central Park could spread from raccoons to humans. In addition to the increased surveillance and vaccinations, authorities in New York are suggesting that visitors to city parks keep pets on a leash and be wary of raccoons they see during the day. Health investigators have confirmed reports of 28 rabid raccoons in or near Central Park this month and last, compared with just three cases from 2003 through November. Dr. Charles Rupprecht, chief of the rabies program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday that ideal conditions in Central Park for animals -- few predators -- could exacerbate an outbreak.
