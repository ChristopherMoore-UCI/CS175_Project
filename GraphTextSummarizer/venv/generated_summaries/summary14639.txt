A World Health Organization panel convened Monday to discuss the ethics of using experimental medicine to fight Ebola in West Africa. The patients' treatment has raised questions about the use of unproven and unlicensed drugs to treat Ebola and why these three have received the serum when so many others in West Africa also have the virus. Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. Emirates this month become the first major international airline to suspend flights from Guinea, followed by pan-African airline ASKY and smaller regional carrier Arik Air. There are no proven vaccines or drugs to treat Ebola, but ZMapp was given to two American missionaries infected with the disease early last week.
