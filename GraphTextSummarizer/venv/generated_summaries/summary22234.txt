Inaugural events have spotlighted the intersection of politics, pop culture and music since the early '60s, said David Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University. This year's festivities include a Kids' Inaugural Concert on Saturday and two official balls on Monday night. At Richard Nixon's first inauguration in 1969, the crowd was treated to "This is My Country" performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of Salt Lake City, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. "The first time around, we heard songs that had a message that you wouldn't have heard in previous inaugurations -- 'A Change is Gonna Come,' 'We Shall Overcome.' "The younger the president, the more we see a connection to pop culture and to music," said Phil Gallo, senior correspondent for Billboard.
