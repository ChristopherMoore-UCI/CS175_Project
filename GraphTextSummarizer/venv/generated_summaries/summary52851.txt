Obama used the life of 106-year-old Ann Nixon Cooper of Atlanta, Georgia, to illustrate what the nation has overcome in her lifetime, including the Depression, world wars, the nation's quest for civil rights, a man on the moon, the fall of the Berlin Wall and even a world connected by technology. "Change has come to America," President-elect Barack Obama told the nation on Tuesday night. Watch Obama say all things are possible in U.S. Â» Obama pledged to heal partisan wounds left after a bruising election battle, again using the words of Lincoln, the first Republican in White House. "As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, 'We are not enemies, but friends ... though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.' "Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long," Obama said. "At this defining moment, change has come to America," Obama, who will be the nation's first black president, told a crowd of about 125,000 people in Chicago's Grant Park. Obama spent the first part of his historic Election Day voting, visiting campaign staffers and playing a little basketball.
