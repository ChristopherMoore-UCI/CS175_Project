"We are serving tea and donut holes in recognition that Sen. Reid just passed health care reform, and [that] we're closing the Medicare donut hole," said Zac Petkanas, deputy communications director for the Reid campaign. Reid, who is not facing a serious primary challenge, last year aired ads aimed at promoting what he has done to help improve the economy, as well as introducing himself to hundreds of thousands of new voters who have moved to Nevada since his last election. Recent polls from the Mason-Dixon organization show 33 percent of those polled have a favorable view of Reid, while 52 percent said they have an unfavorable view of the senator -- some of the worst numbers he has faced in years. It's staffed, he added, "with real Nevadans from Nevada and folks from Searchlight who support Reid." I think we have an economic situation in Nevada that is very difficult," Reid told CNN in a recent interview in Las Vegas.
