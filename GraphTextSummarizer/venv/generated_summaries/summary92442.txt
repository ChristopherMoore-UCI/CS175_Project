As soon as many non-Hispanics began to see this writing on the wall, they started building more walls. A state that was once controlled by Mexico, before Manifest Destiny came along and ordained that God wanted white folks from Kansas and Missouri to have it, is now heavily populated by the runaway children of Mexico and their offspring. Most Hispanics are registered Democrats, but this goes for Hispanic Republicans, too. Demographers predict that sometime this spring in California, Hispanics will make up 39% of the population while non-Hispanic whites will account for 38.8%. There are more Mexicans living in Los Angeles than in any other city in the world except for Mexico City.
