To fulfill his own vision, Bertrand has applied his and his family's pioneering spirit and brilliance to develop Solar Impulse, a solar-powered long-range glider to fly around the world and to harness an unlimited form of renewable energy using technologies that won't contribute to daunting environmental concerns. His grandfather's pioneering principles of balloon technology were eventually applied to allow descent into the deep ocean, which informed the work of his father, Jacques Piccard, an oceanographer and engineer who made history in 1960 as part of the first and only manned exploration of the Challenger Deep, the deepest place in the ocean. Bertrand believes that as much as the world is locked into short term ways of thinking, there are positive and optimistic solutions that are profitable, protect the environment, create jobs and help economic growth. In the sixth episode of Motherboard's Upgrade! series, we travel back to Geneva, Switzerland, to talk to Bertrand about his vision for Solar Impulse, the impact it could have on the world and why, if we can't think and act sustainably, generations to come will be forced to face the growing dilemma our current way of life is creating in our increasingly fragile environment. In the 1930s, his grandfather, physicist and inventor Auguste Piccard, applied his excitement and interest in ballooning to designing a high-flying balloon attached to a pressurized aluminum gondola.
