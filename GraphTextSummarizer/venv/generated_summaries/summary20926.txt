The homeowner told police that "he heard someone outside banging on his front door yelling that she had been raped," the affidavit said. Juan L. Vera-Soledad, 29, of DeLand was arrested in the incident and charged with kidnapping and sex battery with a weapon, according to a charging affidavit filed by police. "If there are two of you, one continues to talk to the victim reassuring them help is on the way while the other person stays on the line with the authorities," Waples said. The distressed couple begged police to hurry.
