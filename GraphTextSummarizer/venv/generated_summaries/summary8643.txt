" CNN legal expert and longtime New York attorney Paul Callan, who has presented cases to hundreds of grand juries, said it is highly unusual. Though the grand jury has until January to make a decision, the prosecutor's office has said that an announcement on whether it will indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson could come as early as mid-November. "Grand juries often hear a variety of evidence from many different sources," he said. The pathologist hired by Michael Brown's family to conduct an autopsy on the Ferguson, Missouri, teenager will testify Thursday before the grand jury that is deciding whether to indict a police officer in Brown's killing, according to family attorney Anthony Gray. In the days after Brown's killing, protesters marched in the streets, enraged because they felt the fatal shooting was the result of an excessive use of force by police.
