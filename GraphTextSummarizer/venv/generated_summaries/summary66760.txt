It signaled defeat for new Inter coach Rafael Benitez in his first competitive fixture, after taking over from Jose Mourinho, who joined Spanish club Real Madrid. Atletico Madrid upset European champions Inter Milan to secure the UEFA Super Cup in Monaco. Goals from Jose Reyes and Sergio Aguero handed the Europa League winners a healthy advantage before Inter's Argentina striker Diego Milito missed a late penalty. Two goals in as many minutes from Ivo Ilicevic and Srdjan Lakic gave the home side the advantage just after the half hour mark. Despite fielding a host of World Cup stars, including Franck Ribery, Thomas Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mark Van Bommel, Bayern couldn't find a way back into the game.
