Sen. Rand Paul on Monday invoked the controversial deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown last year in a new opinion piece marking Martin Luther King, Jr. When he met with local NAACP leaders in Ferguson in October, he said the GOP's "biggest mistake" in the past few decades has been not competing for African Americans' votes. Citing King's rhetoric, Paul added that "the uneasy coexistence of the two Americas is brought to bear by the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown." Paul said that his trips last year to urban areas like Detroit, Atlanta and Chicago, as well as to Ferguson, Missouri, have highlighted what he often calls "an undercurrent of unease," referring to racial tension that saw renewed attention last year after Brown and Garner were killed by white police officers. Rep. Barbara Lee said in a recent op-ed that he needs "to do a much better job if he actually expects to win" votes from African Americans. "We need to notice and be aware of the injustices embedded in our criminal system," he said in the op-ed, though noting that he believes "most police are conscientious and want only to provide safety for us." "The blame," he continued, "should be directed to the laws and the politicians who order police into untenable positions, that insist on 'taking down' someone for selling a couple of untaxed cigarettes.
