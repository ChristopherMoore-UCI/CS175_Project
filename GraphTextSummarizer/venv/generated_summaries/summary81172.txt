The 35-year-old Woods, winner of the British Open in 2000, 2005 and 2006, also missed the 2008 tournament at Royal Birkdale following reconstructive knee surgery after his U.S. Open victory a month earlier. -- Tiger Woods will follow his agent, Mark Steinberg, to Excel Sports Management, the company announced Monday. On his official website last week, Woods said: "Unfortunately, I've been advised that I should not play in the British Open. "As I stated at the AT&T National, I am only going to come back when I'm 100% ready as I do not want to risk further injury." " Woods suffered injuries to his left knee and left Achilles tendon during the Masters in April and withdrew after nine holes of the Players Championship when he inflamed his leg again. The former world No. 1 had already announced that he will miss this week's British Open championship at Sandwich, England, because of injuries to his left leg.
