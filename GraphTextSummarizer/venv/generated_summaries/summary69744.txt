Over the weekend, Google Chrome routed more Internet traffic than Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which long has held its spot as the most-used Web browser in the world, according to data from StatCounter, an Internet monitor. "At weekends, when people are free to choose what browser to use, many of them are selecting Chrome in preference to Internet Explorer." According to StatCounter's latest report, which was spotted by the blog Global Nerdy, Google Chrome fielded 32.8% of Web page requests on Sunday. "Whether Chrome can take the lead in the browser wars in the long term remains to be seen, however the trend towards Chrome usage at weekends is undeniable," StatCounter's CEO Aodhan Cullen said in a written news release in March, when Chrome bested Explorer for a day. And some groups have criticized StatCounter's data collection methods, saying the group does not account for the different ways countries collect Internet traffic data.
