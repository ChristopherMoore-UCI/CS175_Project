The last documentation of state authorities' interaction with Jeremiah was in May 2013, according to Department of Children and Families spokesman Alec Loftus. A body found off a central Massachusetts highway has been positively identified as that of Jeremiah Oliver, a 5-year-old boy who was missing for months before police were alerted. The case raised questions about the state's role as it relates to Jeremiah's care, with Massachusetts Department of Children and Families Commissioner Olga Roche admitting that there had been "a serious failure." The district attorney's office did not speculate Saturday on whether they might face additional charges now that Jeremiah has been confirmed dead. In June, Loftus said, the social worker was told that Jeremiah had moved to Florida to live with his grandmother but did not follow up or verify that.
