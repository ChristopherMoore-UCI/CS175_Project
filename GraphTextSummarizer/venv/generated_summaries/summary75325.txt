Once again, the lure of ISIS may have ensnared another group of foreigners -- this time, medical students suspected of traveling to Syria to work in ISIS-controlled hospitals. " In a joint statement, the students' and doctors' families said their children are humanitarians who went "to Turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on Turkey's borders." Ediboglu, an opposition lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS, and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria. Eight of the group are medical students who've just graduated, and the three others are in their final year of medical school, he said. At least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border, pleading for their return, according to The Observer.
