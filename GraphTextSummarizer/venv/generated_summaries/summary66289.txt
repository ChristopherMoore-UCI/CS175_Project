-- Embattled NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized Friday for what he said was his mishandling of the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal but vowed "now I will get it right and will do whatever is necessary to accomplish that." With Ray Rice suspended indefinitely, the league saw three more of its players come under scrutiny over domestic violence or child abuse allegations. Speaking at a Manhattan news conference amid calls for his resignation, Goodell announced a sweeping policy to counter domestic abuse and sexual assault, mandating all players and staff on the league's 32 teams undergo education and training about how to prevent abuse. The policy is a direct response to a number of high-profile cases, including Rice's, that involve NFL players. Even as Goodell pledged to move ahead and "get it right," questions loom in the Rice case about who knew what when, and who said what to whom.
