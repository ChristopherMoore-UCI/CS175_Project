-- A few reflections from survivors of the massacre at an Aurora, Colorado, theater from CNN interviews: 'That's when I felt a big ole bang in my leg' Bonnie Kate Pourciau, 18, said she is "not a huge Batman fan, really," but decided to go to the movie after she and her friend Elizabeth Sumrall stopped at a hotel in Aurora en route from Seattle to their homes in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 'Who expects to be shot in a movie theater?' Christina Blache was also wounded in the early Friday massacre. "It's a silver lining to a very dark cloud, but we all know Caleb, we know he's a fighter, we know he's not going to stay out of that child's life for any length of time if he can avoid it." 'A silver lining to a very dark cloud' Baby Hugo was born Tuesday morning to Katie and Caleb Medley. When the gunfire broke out, Pourciau told CNN affiliate KMGH from her bed in Aurora Medical Center, she thought it was special effects in the movie.
