-- English Premier League club Liverpool have appointed Brendan Rodgers as their new manager. The 39-year-old began his coaching career at Chelsea, under the stewardship of Jose Mourinho, who led the club to successive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006 and now coaches Spanish giants Real Madrid. They beat Premier League champions Manchester City, Arsenal and, ironically, Liverpool on the final day of the season. Rodgers succeeds club legend Kenny Dalglish, who was sacked earlier this month. The 21-year-old made 37 Premier League appearances for Liverpool last season, after joining the club from Sunderland in June 2011.
