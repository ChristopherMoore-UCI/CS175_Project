He doesn't trust Iran, vows it won't get nuclear weapons, and believes past rhetoric by its leaders threatening annihilation of Israel is unacceptable and kind of insane. He bristled when yet another GOP legislator, Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, described the U.S. position as giving Iran the benefit of the doubt by not requiring the dismantling of all centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. Israel opposes that deal because it allows Iran -- a longtime enemy of  the Jewish state -- to continue enriching uranium needed to develop nuclear weapons. The interim agreement eases some $7 billion in economic sanctions in return for limiting aspects of Iran's nuclear program, Kerry told the committee. So why is Secretary of State John Kerry so adamant about getting time to try to negotiate an agreement that would further curb Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting crippling economic sanctions?
