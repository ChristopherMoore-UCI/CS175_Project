The new online streaming format on Netflix gave creator Mitch Hurwitz more freedom with episode length, allowing far more variability than in the TV format. Some critics have welcomed the fresh presentation, praising Hurwitz for pushing forward the show's legacy: The Hollywood Reporter: "The beauty about the Netflix version of 'Arrested Development' is that, given the laws of time and hype, it should not have succeeded. To work around cast availability, as stars like Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, David Cross, Will Arnett and Portia de Rossi have moved on to busy careers, each episode focuses on one member of the Bluth family rather than trying to incorporate the entire cast. "It's been our great joy to bring this to you on Netflix, where you can access it whenever and however you want," Hurwitz wrote in the letter, dated May 25. So while everything feels familiar, it's not the same old "Arrested Development."
