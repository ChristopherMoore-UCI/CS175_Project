Mickelson, who is part of a group of potential investors which includes four grandchildren of former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, revealed he would be putting "a lot" of his own money into the deal. "He is a world-class person, athlete and businessman with a strong history of charitable leadership and he will be an ideal partner for many years in San Diego." "When we met with Phil we were inspired by his commitment to San Diego and his passion for the Padres," Kevin O'Malley, one of the other potential investors, said in a prepared statement released to the PGA Tour's website. " Mickelson, who was born in San Diego, is the second-highest earner on the PGA Tour, having amassed winnings of $66 million since turning pro in 1992. "I've had the opportunity to invest in other sports franchises, and I've turned it down in the past," the 41-year-old told the San Diego Union-Tribune website.
