-- A South Carolina woman whose husband tried to find a donor kidney for her for nearly a year by wearing a sandwich board on the streets of their city has gotten one -- and it's working "A-OK," her husband told CNN. The eventual donor contacted the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, where the surgery was performed last Wednesday. Larry Swilling, Jimmy Sue's husband, said the woman, who they only met the day before the surgery, was up and walking hours after the procedure last week. Jimmy Sue Swilling will leave the hospital Friday, her husband said, although they'll have to go to Charleston every month for the next four months to make sure the kidney is working properly.
