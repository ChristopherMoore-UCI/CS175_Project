"Mrs. Hernandez has seen her husband's delusions and hallucinations and other mental illnesses for a very long period of time," Gottlieb said. The search began Wednesday afternoon and wrapped up at 3 a.m. Thursday at the couple's New Jersey house, said Robert Gottlieb, who represents Rosemary Hernandez. " Rosemary Hernandez feels that her husband's confession is unreliable and is coming from a mentally ill man, Gottlieb said. Norma Hernandez, the suspect's sister, said she went to police in Camden, New Jersey, back then but felt that they didn't believe her. A relative has said she reported that Hernandez told family members in the 1980s that he killed a boy in New York.
