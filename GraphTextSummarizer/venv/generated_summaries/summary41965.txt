But female educational facilities, students and teachers have come under vicious attack as the insurgency has strengthened and spread from Taliban strongholds in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand. Many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school during the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001. -- Dozens of schoolgirls and teachers were sickened Wednesday by poison gas in Afghanistan, medical and government officials said. The latest incident, this one at a high school, is the ninth such case involving the poisoning of schoolgirls, said Asif Nang, spokesman for the nation's education ministry. A report compiled last year by the humanitarian agency CARE documented 670 education-related attacks in 2008, including murder and arson.
