Reeves gave folks a silver dollar to remember him by, while the Lone Ranger left silver bullets. Many of the thousands of criminals captured by Reeves were sent to the House of Corrections in Detroit  -- the same city where the Lone Ranger character was created by George Trendle and Fran Striker. While there, he managed to escape to the Indian Territory -- now the state of Oklahoma -- living with native American Indians and learning their languages and tracking skills.
