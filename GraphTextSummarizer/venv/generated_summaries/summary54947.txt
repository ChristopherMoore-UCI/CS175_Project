Police say the bruised body of swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found at the exclusive Soho House club and hotel. The details of the indictment of Nick Brooks, 24, are sealed and will not be revealed until his next court appearance, on January 4, said Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. "Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke," said publicist Kate Godici. The medical examiner's office will provide more details surrounding Cachay's death "pending toxicology and tissue testing, which would take a few weeks," spokeswoman Grace Burgess said. Authorities said they relied on interviews with hotel employees and surveillance videos from the location.
