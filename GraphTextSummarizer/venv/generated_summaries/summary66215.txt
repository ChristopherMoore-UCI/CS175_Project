Along with director Rob Reiner and author and screenwriter William Goldman, the "Princess Bride" cast -- including Robin Wright (Buttercup), Wallace Shawn (Vizzini) and Carol Kane (Valerie) -- reminisced about the making of the film, which they hadn't seen with an audience since before its release, and a small private screening for friends at that, since it didn't have a big premiere back in 1987. Elwes demonstrated his sense of humor at last December's Jason Reitman-organized stage reading of "The Princess Bride," when he played the part of Prince Humperdinck instead of Westley, allowing that role to go to Paul Rudd. " "A girl once showed me a tattoo of 'As you wish' on the back of her neck," said Cary Elwes, who played Westley. "I get asked for that line, too," laughed Chris Sarandon, who played the dastardly Prince Humperdinck. The plot involves the kidnapping of Buttercup and Westley's daughter, Waverly, and at first it was a fiction (along with other faux-dramas Goldman created as part of the "Bride"-verse), but then it started to become a reality of sorts.
