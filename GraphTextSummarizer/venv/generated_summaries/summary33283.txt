Her research analyzed brain activity and found that highly complex sounds -- or chaotic noise -- triggered the part of the brain associated with negative emotions, while low-complexity music triggered the part of the brain associated with positive emotions. Meier, who will begin studying biology and computer science at Harvard this fall, hopes that his research can be applied to other cells, and eventually lead to real-world solutions, like treating cancer. Joshua Meier, 18, New Jersey Stem cells are valued for their ability to develop into specialized cells, and have the potential to treat Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury and other conditions. A school project when she was in seventh grade led Samantha to create "celloidosomes," three-dimensional structures built out of living cells, which act as a container for other particles. This is why, for the last five years, he's been part of a team trying to perfect islet cell transplantation in diabetics -- working to prevent the cells from being rejected by a recipient's immune system.
