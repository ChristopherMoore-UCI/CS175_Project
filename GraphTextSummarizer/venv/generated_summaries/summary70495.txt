"We are trying to get it as close as possible to the natural animal," said Alex Villanueva, a Virginia Tech doctoral student in mechanical engineering. "One reason to develop a larger vehicle is payloadâ€”more room to put instruments, allowing you to achieve more complex missions," Villanueva said. Virginia Tech's research team, led by mechanical engineering professor Shashank Priya, unveiled an early prototype called RoboJelly in 2012. Cyro is part of a nationwide, multi-university $5 million project funded by U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the Office of Naval Research. The robot does not currently carry a camera, but researchers say one could be added, along with other monitoring instruments.
