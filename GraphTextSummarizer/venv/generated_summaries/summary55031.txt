Often technology and engineering education is overlooked when people talk about STEM education or when governments make decisions about education policy. What the ad is demonstrating is not science education, but rather the middle two letters of STEM - or science, technology, engineering and math - education. As a country we need to focus on improving in all areas of science, technology, engineering and math education if we are to succeed in creating and competing for the jobs that will be prevalent in the decades to come. Another aspect covered in technology education classes focuses on engineering design by creating a more efficient shopping cart or a new blade design for a wind turbine. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for technology and engineering education as many colleges and universities have cut their programs, and sadly so have some high and middle schools.
