-- White House hopeful Hillary Clinton has raked in several high profile endorsements as she campaigns for president, but the latest may not be greeted with open arms. Fleiss isn't the first former madam to express support for Clinton's White House Bid. Former "Hollywood Madam" Heidi Lynne Fleiss Heidi Lynne Fleiss, the former "Hollywood Madam" who was convicted on charges connected to a prostitution ring in 1995, is a big supporter of the New York Democrat's White House bid, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The paper reports Fleiss actually tried to attend a Clinton campaign rally in Pahrump, Nevada, last week, but was turned away because the building was filled to capacity. "Even if you're a Republican, if you're a woman and you're smart, you have to respect her." Fleiss currently resides in Nevada -- now a early primary state -- and runs a laundromat, called "Dirty Laundry."
