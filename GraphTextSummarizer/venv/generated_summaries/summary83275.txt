So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken. By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters. Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations. Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters. Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.
