Deputy who shot Eric Harris turns himself in Bates was carrying his personal gun, a Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolver, and a Model X26 Taser, he said in his statement to investigators. Tasers are built to feel and look different than guns, according to Taser International. After Bates announced at the scene he was going to use his Taser, he "used his nondominant hand, and it was the gun," said Clark Brewster, Bates' attorney. Here are some factors to consider: Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body, and the Taser should be placed on the nondominant side. Taser's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer's nondominant side, as law enforcement experts say.
