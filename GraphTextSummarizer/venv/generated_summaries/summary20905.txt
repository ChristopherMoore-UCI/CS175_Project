" Mark Ryan Wilsey said Wednesday that Boiling Spring Lakes police were familiar with  Vidal, having gone to the family's house at least three times before. A North Carolina detective justifiably shot a schizophrenic 18-year-old because he believed another officer's life was in danger, a group representing police officers said, offering an account vastly different from that of the late teen's outraged family. According to Mark Ryan Wilsey, Vidal had schizophrenia and "was having an episode" when his father contacted police to subdue him so he could get help. And the family has no qualms with the first two law enforcement officers who responded -- one from Boiling Spring Lakes police and the other a Brunswick County Sheriff's deputy -- with the stepbrother saying they "did nothing wrong. Boiling Spring Lakes police and the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office have both cleared their officers involved in the case after finding, in internal reviews, no evidence they'd violated policy or state law.
