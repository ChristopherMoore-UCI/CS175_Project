The litany of Jarrett's run-ins with other White House power brokers reads like a plot synopsis for a new "Mean Girls" movie. Women in Washington -- and in positions of power anywhere -- should be subjected to the same criticisms and held to the same standards as men. The Politico story, headlined "Fire Valerie Jarrett, even notes that "nobody knows precisely what Jarrett does in the White House." Valerie Jarrett is certainly not the first woman who achieved power in Washington to be treated so disrespectfully. Mark Davis, a former White House speechwriter in the George H.W. Bush administration, says, "Jarrett is the White House 'mirror, mirror on the wall' who has cultivated the psychological dependency of the president of the United States."
