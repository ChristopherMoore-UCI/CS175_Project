The U.S. military has said it believes al-Baghdadi is a fictional character, portrayed by an actor in previous video statements and used as a front for al Qaeda leaders outside Iraq. Nizar headed al Qaeda in Iraq's propaganda network and was a conduit between al-Masri and senior al Qaeda leaders. Al-Zawahiri conveys advice from al Qaeda's chief, bin Laden, on how to improve the group's performance and passed along dissatisfaction among al Qaeda members and leaders over a range of issues. Complaints revolve around the group's recruiting efforts, poor communication between al Qaeda central and al Qaeda in Iraq, ineffective and dishonest propaganda techniques, and the growing difficulty in moving "assets" from other countries into Iraq. The letter to al-Masri, however, was obtained in April during an operation that killed al Qaeda in Iraq Information Minister Abu Nizar.
