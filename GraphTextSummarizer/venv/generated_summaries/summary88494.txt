Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich: -- When the Republican candidates were asked what they would bring to the White House if elected, Georgia businessman Herman Cain set himself apart from the career politicians on the stage with him by replying: "I would bring a sense of humor to the White House, because America's too uptight!" I'm going to bring the most beautiful, most thoughtful, incredible first lady that this country's ever seen, Anita. Well, first of all, I would reduce the White House by kicking out all the White House czars the first day, creating a lot more space. Texas Rep. Ron Paul: I'd bring a bushel basket full of common sense.
