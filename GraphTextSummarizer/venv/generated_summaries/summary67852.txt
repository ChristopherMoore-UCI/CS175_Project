The idea behind Pono is to boost digital music from the compressed and lossy formats to high-quality resolution. -- Neil Young has long complained about the quality of digital music formats. Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, Tom Petty and Sting were among the artists who joined Young in a video to promote a Kickstarter campaign for Pono, a digital music service and device designed to "bring the highest-quality digital music" to consumers, according to its press announcement. Pono will stream music in 24-bit, 192 kHz sound -- brighter and more present than the "underwater listening," as Young describes it, provided by MP3s and even CDs. "Every part of my body is getting hit with this," Young said of his experience with Pono, according to the San Jose Mercury News.
