"Everything was staged by the president to hide the extreme corruption and to hide the poverty, hunger and unemployment that have risen to an alarming level," said Gilmar Gutierrez, a congressman and brother of former president Lucio Gutierrez, the man Correa claimed was behind the coup attempt. The extension comes after President Rafael Correa was attacked by police on September 30. Correa, who was roughed up and hit by tear gas, said the law would do no such thing and the police officers had not read it. Troops rescued Correa in a dramatic shootout with officers at a hospital, where Correa said he was held for more than 10 hours. Police officers have said they were angered by a new law that would take away their bonuses and reduce their compensation.
