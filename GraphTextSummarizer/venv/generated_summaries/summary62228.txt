If you just know my first couple of albums, absolutely, it seems a little different." Jones said "Little Broken Hearts" is a natural progression from her last few albums and from her work on Burton's "Rome" project last year. Jones' 2002 debut, "Come Away with Me," reigns as a diamond (10 million copies) selling album, a feat that may not be revisited often these days, with CD sales lagging. Jones' newest CD, "Little Broken Hearts," debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Top 200 chart last month, making the singer five for five when it comes to her albums reaching the top three. But Jones hasn't played it safe in recent years, taking serious stylistic detours. Jones said she and Burton enjoyed working together so much, she wanted to continue that relationship.
