Its news release said Hurwitz would "produce, develop and create new original series for Netflix." Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, called Hurwitz "a true genius with one of the most distinctive voices in comedy today." Netflix announced a deal Tuesday to have Hurwitz come up with new shows, which means another oddball comedy might be on the way. -- Whether or not Netflix orders more episodes of "Arrested Development," the streaming service will remain in business with the show's creator, Mitch Hurwitz. Netflix has commissioned a number of original shows before, including "Orange is the New Black" and "Hemlock Grove." A Netflix spokeswoman confirmed that the arrangement with Hurwitz is a first for the company.
