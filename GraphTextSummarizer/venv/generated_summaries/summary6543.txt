U.S. counterterror strategy now includes both "widening our borders" by preventing potential terrorists abroad from boarding planes to the United States as well as dealing with "this growth of homegrown extremism," she said. -- The death of Osama bin Laden "is not the death of terrorism, unfortunately," U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN at an international security conference Thursday. Al Qaeda has been reaching out with "English-language publications and the like," prompting an increase in the number of individual potential terrorists, she said. John Brennan called it "the first counterterrorism strategy that designates the homeland as a primary area of emphasis in our counterterrorism efforts. Napolitano is in Spain to discuss terrorism and security with the interior ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom.
