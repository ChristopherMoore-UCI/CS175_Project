The National Weather Service said Wednesday that another system is moving toward the area and several more inches of snow could come down Thursday night into Friday night. " For many people in New England this blizzard brought whiteout conditions from heavy snow and wind greater than 35 mph for as long as 14 hours. Wednesday was a day for digging out in New England. If anyone has a right to complain, it was those digging out Wednesday not just in New England but also on New York's Long Island. CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said as the low pressure develops off the coast,  damaging winds might yet again be in store for New England on Friday and Saturday.
