Pacquiao is widely expected to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a much-hyped showdown later this year, but the 31-year-old claims his place in boxing history is already assured following the successful defense of his WBO welterweight crown against Joshua Clottey last week. That's a heavy burden when it's my mother doing that," he told reporters after meeting Filipino President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in Malacanang on Monday morning. Pacquiao opted to fight Ghana's Clottey, whom he beat in 12 rounds, while Mayweather will take on fellow American Shane Mosley on May 1. Any likely meeting between the two would probably be the richest in box office history and be staged at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, although Pacquiao filled the home stadium of the Dallas Cowboys NFL team -- where the Mayweather fight was initially scheduled to be held -- for his bout with Clottey. He is standing for election in the Sarangani province on May 10, on the platform of opposition senator Manuel Villar's Nacionalista Party.
