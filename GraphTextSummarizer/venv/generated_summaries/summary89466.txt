Malawi government officials have said that they supported Madonna's second adoption. She has been involved with Malawi for several years and made a documentary, "I Am Because We Are," to highlight poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating children in that country. The judge who ruled against the adoption said she had "a gripping temptation" to approve it, but decided doing so would open doors to child trafficking, court records show. "Inter-country adoption is not the best way of providing protection to children. ... Supporting children from outside our country only helps five of the 1.5 million orphans we have," said Mavuto Bamusi, national coordinator of the Malawi Human Rights Consultative Committee.
