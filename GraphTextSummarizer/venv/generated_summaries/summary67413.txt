Clark tells the story of going out on the first Wild Oats, Bob Oatley's boat that has dominated the Sydney to Hobart race, and being blown away by the technology of a keel boat. "I wish Sydney-Hobart wasn't the first race, in fact you couldn't choose a worst race for our first race. For Read, Comanche and its crew, Sydney-Hobart will be something of a trip into the unknown but with the technology on board and money spent, Read is all too aware that the expectation will be high in subsequent races. " It is befitting then that Comanche's first race should be Sydney-Hobart, although it is not without its perils. Read and the Clarks have become close friends during their time together, Clark's only regret as a septuagenarian is that he is no longer young enough to be on board in some of Comanche's tougher races.
