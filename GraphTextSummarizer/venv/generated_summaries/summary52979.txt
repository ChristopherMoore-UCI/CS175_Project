He played a one-two with Gennaro Gattuso on the edge of the Inter area but the veteran midfielder's attempted return pass went into the path of the onrushing Robinho, and Pato pounced on the loose ball to beat compatriot goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the winner against his former team when Milan beat Inter in November, but his suspension meant that Pato led the attack along with fellow Brazilian Robinho. Pato, playing in his first Milan derby, doubled the lead in the 62nd minute when he headed home from Ignazio Abate's mishit shot after the right-back was put in space by Clarence Seedorf. His team's hopes of gaining parity suffered a huge blow nine minutes after the interval when last man Christian Chivu was sent off for clipping the heels of Pato as the forward burst towards Cesar's goal. But the former Italy forward ruined his own night by getting booked twice within a minute -- the first for taking his shirt off to celebrate his goal and the second for a poorly-timed tackle on substitute Ivan Cordoba.
