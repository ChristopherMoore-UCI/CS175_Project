In studies of children in homes headed by single mothers, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that many children without active fathers have lower grade point averages, lower college aspirations, poor school attendance records, higher dropout rates and are more likely to be in trouble with the law than children who live with both parents. So although I can say I am proud that our children have independently chosen to lead lives of global service, I am equally convinced that it is due in part to Haskell's influence in their lives. Sociologists have also concluded adolescent girls from 15 to 19 years old reared in homes without fathers are significantly more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant than girls reared in homes with a mother and a father. In the eyes of my children, Haskell was an alien who appeared one day, hypnotized their mother and set up camp in their home, toting his organic food, reggae music, incense and all things African. But over the past 13 years that Haskell has been in our lives, and after hundreds of family meetings, hours of group therapy sessions and more than a dozen self-help books, (including "Step-parenting for Dummies"), I've finally noticed a change of hearts.
