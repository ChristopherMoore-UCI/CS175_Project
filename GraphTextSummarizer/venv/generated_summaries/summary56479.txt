Vonn, who won golds in the world championships last month in downhill and super-G, has now racked up 1788 points in World Cup racing this season and is closing on the all-time record of 1970 by Janica Kostelic in 2006. Nadia Fancini of Italy gave herself a chance of taking the overall super-G title by taking the lead from German Maria Riesch with a fine run on the Olympia piste. It was her ninth World Cup win of the season and 22nd of her career with races in the giant slalom and slalom to come in Sweden to add to her tally. Vonn trailed Switzerland's Fabienne Suter by 15 points going into the final super-G of the season and her cause was helped as Suter produced a disappointing run which eventually saw her finish eighth. -- Lindsey Vonn of the United States continued her dream finish to the season with victory in the super-G at the World Cup finals in Are on Thursday -- clinching the overall title in the discipline.
