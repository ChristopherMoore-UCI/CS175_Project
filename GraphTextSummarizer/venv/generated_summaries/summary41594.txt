As of Tuesday morning, Emilia was about 680 miles (1,095 kilometers) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. Though Emilia's intensity could fluctuate Tuesday, "gradual weakening is expected to begin by tonight and continue through Thursday," the weather agency said Tuesday. -- Hurricane Emilia raged into to a Category 4 storm Tuesday, hurling 140 mph winds as it spun across the Pacific Ocean. Like Hurricane Emilia, Tropical Storm Daniel did not pose a threat to land, the weather agency said. By 5 a.m. ET Tuesday, Daniel's maximum sustained winds had weakened to 70 mph -- under the 74-mph threshold to qualify as a hurricane, according to the hurricane center.
