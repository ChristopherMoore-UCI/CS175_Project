The 60-year-old, who has previous international experience with Spain and Serbia, returns to management after a short stint at relegated La Liga club Real Valladolid at the end of last season. "Jacques Songo'o, who served alongside Paul Le Guen as assistant coach in charge of goalkeepers during the World Cup, keeps his post." Clemente, whose playing career was cut short by injury in 1971, started coaching four years later and has been in charge of clubs such as Athletic Bilbao (three times), Espanyol (twice), Marseille, Real Sociedad and Real Betis. His first task will be to help the Indomitable Lions to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Four-times champions Cameroon's first game is next month away to Mauritius, with Senegal and Congo Democratic Republic also in Group E. He replaces Frenchman Paul Le Guen, who stepped down from the role after Cameroon lost all three matches at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
