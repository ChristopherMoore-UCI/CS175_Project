Fire officials believe the owner hit rocks witha lawn mower sparking it. "That ignited the area around him, and before they could contain it, it started spreading, and as you can tell by the wind up here, it didn't take long for it to spread," Bill Hahn, fire chief of Southwest Polk, told CNN affiliate KOIN. The couple were swimming with a red float, appearing fine one minute and under water the next, witnesses told CNN affiliate WSVN. "We're in a low lying area, so it floods from time to time, but I got up and there was actually two inches of water in the den," he said. At least nine large fires have scorched 407,883 acres across Idaho, which is experiencing the most wildland fire activity of any state, according to the Boise-based National Interagency Fire Center.
