After IVF shock, mom gives birth to two sets of identical twins Such amniotic sac helmet births are rare enough, but to have the entire baby inside the sac, or 'en caul,' occurs in less than one in 80,000 births, Cedars-Sinai said. But sometimes, the sac can get stuck around part of the baby, according to Dr. Amos Grunebaum, an obstetrician and gynecologist, who publishes a website on birth and baby care. "Even though it's a cliche -- we caught our breath," neonatologist William Binder told CNN affiliate KCAL. That's so rare, that even doctors delivering babies hardly see it. Then Binder got to work helping Silas to breathe - and giving him special care, because Silas was born three months before his due date via Caesarean section.
