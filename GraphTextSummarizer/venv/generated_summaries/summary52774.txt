" Nadal, who beat Federer in the final in 2008 but missed out on last year's event due to knee problems, was again too strong for Soderling as he followed up his Roland Garros triumph with another win over the Swede. Berdych reached his second grand slam semifinal, having also reached the last four in Paris earlier this month before losing to eventual runner-up Soderling. Another vital break in the fourth set took Berdych to the brink of victory, and he took his second match point to seal an impressive win. but you never know how you are going to wake up in two days but the way I am playing match after match is very encouraging. The Swiss star was knocked out at the last-eight stage of a tennis grand slam event for second successive time following his similar exit at the French Open a month ago.
