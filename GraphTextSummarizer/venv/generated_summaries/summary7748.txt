Stern said that over the "next 24 to 48 hours," NBA officials will talk to the Maloofs to try to "facilitate an agreement" for them to sell the Kings to the so-called Ranadive group, thus assuring the team remains in California. Commissioner David Stern cited the existence of a "strong ownership group," a construction team and plan to build a new arena, plus strong support from Sacramento's mayor and others in the region, as reasons why the Kings will remain in northern California. Wednesday's vote follows months of talks between members of the Maloof family, the majority owners of the Kings, and a Seattle-based group that includes investor Chris Hansen and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Meanwhile, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson -- himself a former all-star NBA guard -- kept pushing to keep the Kings in his city. And he vowed "fair dealing and ultimate consideration down to the road" for any future efforts to land an NBA team in Seattle, which saw its last franchise -- the Supersonics -- leave for Oklahoma City in 2008.
