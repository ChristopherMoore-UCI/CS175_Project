Police who arrested Kamari Charlton on September 1 at the Changi Airport were acting on an Interpol alert that he was wanted on allegations of money laundering and running a phone-scam operation in Australia, said embassy spokesman Siewgay Ong. Charlton was about to leave Singapore with his pregnant wife when he was arrested, said Arun Maaran of Charlton's defense team. The U.S. Embassy in Singapore is closely monitoring Charlton's case, Ehrendreich said. Unlike most offenders who overstay, Maaran said, Charlton was not in Singapore to take advantage of its strong economy by working illegally. A cousin of Charlton's wife also overstayed but was allowed to leave Singapore after paying a fine, Maaran said.
