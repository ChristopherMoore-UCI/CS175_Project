The fetuses came from illegal abortion clinics, police Lt. Col. Chusak Kumsai said Wednesday. "From the confession of one of the morticians of the temple that we interrogated last night, he told us that they received these fetuses from the same places as the first lot of 348 fetus remains, and they became dry," said Col. Sombat Milintachinda, chief of the investigation team. Friday's recovery efforts brought the total discovered to 2,002 fetuses, police Col. Metee Rakpan said. "From our interrogation of the morticians, they admitted that they have been receiving fetuses for about four years, and they told us that they kept the fetuses until they dried up, so it is easy to burn them," Milintachinda said. The fetuses were initially discovered earlier in the week, given away by the smell of decay at the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok.
