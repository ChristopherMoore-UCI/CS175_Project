So, to set the record straight, CIA officers are not spies â€” a spy is someone who commits espionage against his own country. CIA officers recruit spies. These requirements guide CIA officers during every networking opportunity, every meeting and every chance encounter, helping them determine if and how to proceed. More specifically, when critical information is needed, teams of officers from both the analytical and the operational sides of the CIA set about identifying exactly who might be able to provide the answers and fill the gaps. Even relatively proactive efforts such as attendance at job fairs or college recruiting events rely on job seekers making the first move.
