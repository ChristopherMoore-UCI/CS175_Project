And in an interview with PandoDaily, Musk said the Hyperloop could form a fifth tent pole of modern transportation, joining cars, planes, trains, and boats, adding that because of its low energy usage and ability to get juice from solar power, it could generate more power than it would consume. The serial entrepreneur envisions a future where mag-lev trains in enormous pneumatic tubes whisk us from Los Angeles to New York in 45 minutes. According to ET3, state trips would average speeds of around 370 mph, while international trips would hit that insane 4,000 mph mark. But ET3′s claims pose more questions than answers, particularly when considering you can buy your own license for the bargain basement price of $100. A massive vacuum tube — mounted either above ground or even under water — would be combined with a magnetic levitation system used on conventional bullet trains.
