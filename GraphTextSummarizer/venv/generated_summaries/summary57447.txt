A statement from Rodriguez's representatives followed the Miami New Times report, declaring, "The news report about a purported relationship between Alex Rodriguez and Anthony Bosch are not true ... The Miami New Times report identified other players in addition to Rodriguez as being named in handwritten notes of Anthony Bosch, chief of the Biogenesis clinic. Meanwhile, ESPN.com published a story Friday quoting unidentified sources as describing how the man who ran Biogenesis allegedly would go to Rodriguez's waterfront mansion when summoned and inject the star player with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). Alex Rodriguez was not Mr. Bosch's patient, he was never treated by him and he was never advised by him." ESPN's report Friday focused on Rodriguez and what unidentified sources described as a personal relationship between the player and Bosch.
