-- P.D. James, the British novelist renowned for her crime novels featuring detective Adam Dalgliesh as well as such works as "The Children of Men," died Thursday. Over a five-decade career as a published writer, James won countless honors for her thoughtful, probing mysteries featuring Dalgliesh, a Scotland Yard detective who was also a poet. "Saddened to hear of the death of P.D. James, one of the UK's greatest crime writers, who thrilled and inspired generations of readers," tweeted British Prime Minister David Cameron. The Guardian reported that James died at her home in Oxford, England. James was following in the British mystery tradition even as she longed to tweak it, she told the Guardian.
