Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was re-elected Sunday to a new six-year term, overcoming an energetic challenge by a candidate backed by an opposition coalition, according to nearly complete results announced by election officials. Chavez had secured 7.4 million votes and Capriles 6.1 million votes, election officials said. Chavez, 58, has had more than a decade to implement his vision of 21st century socialism, a view that emphasizes use of state oil windfalls to fund social programs. Despite that tight economic relationship, the two countries are not exactly close allies: Chavez often rails against the U.S. and its allies as "imperialists." Further complicating the U.S.-Venezuela relationship is how Chavez is allied with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, defended former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and has even offered his support for Syria's leader Bashar al-Assad. After casting his ballot, Chavez called on Venezuelans to vote and remain calm.
