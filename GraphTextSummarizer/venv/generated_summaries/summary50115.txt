Interactive map: Where to find Banksy in New York The painting, which the famously anonymous British graffiti artist entitled "The Banality of the Banality of Evil," is being auctioned off to benefit Housing Works, a nonprofit that supports homelessness and those living or affected with HIV/AIDS, according to spokeswoman Rebecca Edmondson. "Banksy is giving back to the New York community that has watched his every move over the last month," Edmondson said, "Nothing but good could come of it." Housing Works was contacted by Banksy's team to confirm the donation and authenticate the painting signed by Banksy under the original artist, K. Sager. Opinion: Banksy's insult shows he's clueless about New York Banksy has stirred some controversy in New York City during his month-long street-art residency, "Better Out Than In." -- The elusive graffiti artist Banksy made his mark on a painting bought for just $50 from a New York City thrift store, and bidding has exceeded $300,000 in a charity auction. Banksy debuted the latest addition to his New York City art collection on Wednesday with "Bronx Zoo," a graffiti painting of a growling wild cat resting on a railing, outside of Yankee Stadium, according to his website.
