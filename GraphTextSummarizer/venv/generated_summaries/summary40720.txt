Talking about Freetown, the former Sierra Leone trade minister said, "If you look at the spike in the capital, we cannot afford one minute of complacence, whether locally or internationally." Chan echoed this view Friday for all areas now battling Ebola, saying "we must maintain our vigilance" given that for all the places where the outbreak appears to be stabilizing, new cases are still popping up elsewhere. Ebola has officially been eradicated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization declared Friday, even amid fresh concerns about the deadly virus in places like Sierra Leone and Mali. The Democratic Republic of Congo has had 38 confirmed and 28 probable reported Ebola cases in recent months. Contrast that with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, home to the vast majority of more than 15,000 Ebola cases and over 5,000 deaths in recent months, according to a WHO report out Friday. This good news notwithstanding, Ebola remains a very real threat elsewhere, particularly in West Africa.
