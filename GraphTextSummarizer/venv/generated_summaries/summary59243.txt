Amid public outrage over government corruption, unemployment and a lack of basic services, Iraq's parliament approved the appointments of eight new ministers to the Cabinet on Sunday -- but key security posts remain empty. It is too soon to predict whether that will happen or whether the United States and Iraq will negotiate an agreement to keep some U.S. soldiers there after next year. Similar demonstrations have been held across Iraq in recent weeks, inspired by uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries in the region. The government composition is inclusive of Iraq's major ethnic and sectarian groups, brought together by a fragile U.S.-backed power sharing deal agreed on in November. He had been barred from politics because of alleged ties to the Baathist party, the outlawed political movement of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
