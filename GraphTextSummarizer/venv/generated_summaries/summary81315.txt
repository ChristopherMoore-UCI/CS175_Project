HGTV: "House Hunters on Vacation" (6:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. ET), various incarnations of "House Hunters" and "House Hunters International" (10 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET) — a smart move. TV Land marathons "The Andy Griffith Show" from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET, while the Hallmark Movie Channel, not to be outdone, airs "Matlock" from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. ET the following morning. USA: "NCIS" (10 a.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET) — warning, this is how they convert new fans. Food Network: "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" (10 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET) — more or less addictive than Cake Boss (6 a.m. to noon ET, TLC)? If you haven't yet caught the reboot — as gloriously unruly as Larry Hagman's eyebrows — you can watch the first four episodes (starting at 5 p.m. ET) leading into a new one at 9 p.m. ET.
