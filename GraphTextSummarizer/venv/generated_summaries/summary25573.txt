Today, where Begum stands, that seems like a long shot, but in a generation, if she gets her way, old attitudes could fade and women assume a fuller role in shaping Pakistan's future. But Begum sees what's happening in Pakistan's bigger cities where women have even become government ministers. The Taliban don't want to see women educated, they want a status quo, even a regression where women will have a lesser role than Victorian children. I want "to give women their rights, the rights that they deserve, I have come out to help people and help the poor people," she tells me. Back then children were at least seen if not heard, the Taliban -- if they could -- would silence women forever and confine them to their homes.
