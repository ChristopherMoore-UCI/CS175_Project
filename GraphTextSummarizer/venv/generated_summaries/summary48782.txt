The Justice Department confirmed the layoffs with CNN and offered a written statement: "ATF was forced to cut its budget by $82 million across the board, including its firearms program and, as a result, 98 contractors in its Martinsburg, West Virginia, facility firearms program have been laid off so far." He said those other sections deal with tracing stolen firearms and keeping records that help police investigate firearms trafficking. The fight against gun-related crime has taken a hit from budget cuts, as a federal agency has laid off nearly a hundred contract workers at its facility dedicated to tracing firearms used by criminals. " The firearms bureau hired the contract workers because requests for gun traces kept rising while the bureau's budget for full-time positions did not, Chipman told CNN. "Laying off employees at the National Tracing Center is a big deal," said David Chipman, a former ATF special agent who once headed the agency's firearms program.
