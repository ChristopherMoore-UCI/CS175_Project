The Pacific Islanders needed a bonus-point win, but fell short as Les Bleus went through in second place behind unbeaten New Zealand -- who face Canada on Sunday. "Full credit to Scotland, we knew this was going to be an incredibly tough game and they made it that way," said England skipper Lewis Moody. Wales and Fiji will battle for second place in Group D on Sunday, with the British side needing just one point to progress. "We played really bad rugby," France captain Thierry Dusautoir said. Scotland picked up a bonus point, but need Georgia to beat Argentina by more than seven points on Sunday to reach the quarterfinals.
