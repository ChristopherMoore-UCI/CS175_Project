Even if the Justice Department never files criminal charges against Zimmerman -- which is likely given the implausibility of obtaining a conviction -- it is extremely inappropriate for law enforcement officials, particularly the U.S. attorney general, to engage in a running extrajudicial commentary that taints the jury pool and ratchets up the investigative anxiety for a citizen who is presumed innocent and has been acquitted. Federal courts prosaically apply established law to provable facts, and they rely heavily on the Justice Department to perform that duty faithfully. Law enforcement officials speak in court -- with public charges, if prosecutors have the evidence to back them up. Law enforcement is not supposed to speak until the government is ready to file public charges and back them up in court. Yet, though Attorney General Eric Holder never tires of reminding us about the due process owed even to foreign terrorists who've confessed to mass murder, the principle does not seem to apply to Zimmerman, an American now acquitted of murder.
