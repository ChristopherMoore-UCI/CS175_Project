Protesters rally after Egypt's Hosni Mubarak is sentenced to life in prison Mubarak and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, were cleared of corruption charges on Saturday, but the sons now face two other sets of charges. Five of Mubarak's aides have been freed; Gamal and Alaa Mubarak remain in prison. Former President Hosni Mubarak and his Interior Minister Habib El Adly were sentenced to life in prison, while six top interior ministry officials were cleared of the charges. Many Egyptians taking part in Sunday's protests expressed anger that former strongman Mubarak, 84, had escaped the death penalty. Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message to Egypt's future leaders that they are not above the law, though it said the acquittals give "a green light to future police abuse." Amnesty International described the verdict as "a significant step towards combating long-standing impunity in Egypt" but it too said the ruling leaves many waiting for full justice.
