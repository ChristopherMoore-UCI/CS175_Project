The decision by Kaduna court Monday came after the Association of Muslim Brotherhood group decried planned forums in a lawsuit last week. The court in Kaduna city ordered the Civil Rights Congress of Nigeria not to have forums on Twitter, Facebook or other sites discussing the 2000 punishment of Mallam Bello Jangebe, whose right hand was amputated for stealing. -- An Islamic court in northern Nigeria has prohibited a human rights group from using social networking Web sites to discuss amputations as punishment, court records show. Jangebe's hand was cut off after he was convicted of stealing a cow, according to a report by Amnesty International. In its motion, the pro-Sharia group said the debate on social sites would mock the strict Islamic law as "negative issues will be discussed."
