The FDA is requiring label changes for drugs that may increase the risk of sudden hearing loss. The FDA began investigating the possible link between hearing loss and ED drugs after the publication of an article for ear, nose and throat specialists in last April's Journal of Laryntology and Otology, according to FDA spokeswoman Rita Chappelle. In separate statements, Pfizer and Lilly representatives said "the FDA is making this change in the interests of patients so that patients can make informed decisions regarding PD-5 medications." GlaxoSmithKline did not return calls, but Schering-Plough noted that "based on patient reports, all occurrences of sudden hearing loss in patients taking Levitra were temporary." Boucher is an ear, nose and throat specialist for the FDA who reviewed reports of sudden hearing loss in patients taking these drugs. This prompted the FDA to look for other reports of sudden hearing loss.
