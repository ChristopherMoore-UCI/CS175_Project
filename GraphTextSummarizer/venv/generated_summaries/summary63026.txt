Carlos Barrios, the 13th miner rescued, says they're not targeting President Sebastian Pinera. According to the Hollywood Reporter, producer Mike Medavoy ("Shutter Island", "Black Swan") has snapped up the right to the story and Jose Rivera ("Motorcycle Diaries") has been enlisted to adapt the screenplay. They say their lawsuit isn't about the money, but about raising awareness about the working conditions for miners in their country, which they say, has been neglected for a long time. Thirty-one of the 33 miners filed a lawsuit accusing the agency that oversees mining of failing to ensure safety measures. Pena also appeared on "The Late Show with Dave Letterman" on CBS where he impersonated his idol, Elvis Presley.
