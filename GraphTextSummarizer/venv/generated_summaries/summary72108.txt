"The International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces Afghanistan take all allegations of inappropriate behavior by contractors and service members very seriously," said an ISAF spokesman. "It reminded me of times I'd visit my friends going to college that were in fraternities," said John Melson, a former employee of Jorge Scientific who was based at that villa in Kabul on assignment to support efforts to train Afghan security personnel. It is a video of employees of an American security contractor working in Kabul, Afghanistan. The company says the workers seen in the videos would not have been tasked with defending the compound, since they had administrative roles and support roles, rather than top security jobs. The result of the misconduct, it says, was undermanned security, missed work, and damage to relations with Afghan people and officials.
