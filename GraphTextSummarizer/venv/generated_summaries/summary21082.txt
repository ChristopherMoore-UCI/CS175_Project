We know we're doing 'Stars on Ice' in the spring!" To the delight of an enraptured home crowd, Russia's Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katsalapov -- who had already won gold in the team event at Sochi -- won bronze at the Iceberg Skating Palace. The Germans managed to end an incredible winning streak in the event, with Austria not only having won gold in the last two Olympics but also failing to lose a team large hill event since 2005. The U.S. had won 14 figure skating gold medals before, all of which came in either the men's or women's singles. Having taken team bronze on day two of the Games, and a silver in Vancouver four years ago, Davis and White saved the best for last as they completed their Olympic medal set. I felt like we had done everything we could from the beginning of this competition -- in practice, team event, this event.
