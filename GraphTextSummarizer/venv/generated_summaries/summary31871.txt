He was wrong about that -- and it would be wrong to discuss press freedom and national security in an off-the-record setting. National security veterans like Leon Panetta, Bob Gates, Bob Kerrey and former CIA head Mike Hayden could give powerful voice to the very real threats posed by leaks. He should ask a high-powered group of leading public citizens to examine the issue fully and, if need be, loudly. Leaks truly can cost lives, and no member of the media should sugarcoat that reality or shirk their responsibility to public safety. And yet secretly pawing through phone records, targeting journalists, these actions are inconsistent with a truly free press.
