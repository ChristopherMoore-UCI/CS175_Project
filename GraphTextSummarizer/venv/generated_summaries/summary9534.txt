Nigerian authorities have blamed Boko Haram, a fundamentalist Islamic movement that mounted similar attacks the previous Christmas. Clashes between the two groups have flared periodically for years, but Boko Haram -- which wants to establish a state based on Islamic law in the north -- has stepped up the violence with a series of high-profile attacks in the past two years. -- Nigeria's Christians are losing faith that the government will protect them from attacks by Islamic extremists and will "respond appropriately" to future killings, the country's leading church group warned Wednesday. "The best thing is for all religious leaders, opinion and traditional leaders, youth leaders and women leaders to come together and assist government," Jonathan said. He has deployed government troops across northern Nigeria in an effort to destroy Boko Haram, a step he told the Christian leaders was overdue.
