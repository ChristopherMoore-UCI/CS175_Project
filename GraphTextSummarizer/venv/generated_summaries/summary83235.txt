"We are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year's Boston Marathon as a display of support," the BAA said in a statement. The bombs that killed three people and wounded 264 others last year were placed in backpacks. Keeping that in mind, police will double the number of officers on patrol from last year, with 3,500 scattered among the crowd. Halstead said his officers are ready for this year's marathon. The race will have 9,000 more runners than last year.
