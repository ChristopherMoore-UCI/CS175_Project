The Islamist extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Once hailed as a model of democracy in Africa, a coup and an uprising of Islamist militants in the north threatens to create an arc of instability for the continent. How did the north end up in the hands of Islamist militants? "We don't have to answer to anyone over the application of sharia," Islamist commissioner Aliou Toure said in August. During a meeting in the Malian capital on October 19, the U.N. deputy secretary-general said the world body is ready to bring military planners and security advisers.
