" "Light enters the eye through the lens -- different wavelengths corresponding to different colors," writes Wired's Adam Rogers. " "What's happening here is your visual system is looking at this thing, and you're trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis," Bevil Conway, a neuroscientist who studies color and vision at Wellesley College, told Wired. "The light hits the retina in the back of the eye where pigments fire up neural connections to the visual cortex, the part of the brain that processes those signals into an image." Usually this process works fine, Rogers writes, but the image of this particular dress is "some kind of perceptual boundary. The battle, it says, "is about more than just social media -- it's about primal biology and the way human eyes and brains have evolved to see color in a sunlit world. Whether folks were team white and gold or team blue and black, the common consensus across social media seemed to be that it is far from the height of fashion.
