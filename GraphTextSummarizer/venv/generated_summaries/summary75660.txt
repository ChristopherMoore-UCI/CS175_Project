The group's press office said Hassan Nasrallah plans to make remarks about the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which issued indictments and arrest warrants this week in the February 14, 2005 killing of Rafik Hariri and 22 others. Syria had thousands of troops in Lebanon and great influence in the country until mass protests after Hariri's assassination known as the Cedar Revolution forced their withdrawal. -- Hezbollah's leader plans to speak Saturday about the indictment of four party members in the assassination six years ago of Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's former prime minister. People believe Hariri wanted the Syrians to withdraw from Lebanon and lessen Syria's influence, and many suspect that Syria and its ally Hezbollah went after Hariri because of his stance on this issue. Many Lebanese believe the killing revolved around the controversies over Syria's role in Lebanon, occupied at the time by Syrian troops, and the Damascus government's strong political influence in Lebanon.
