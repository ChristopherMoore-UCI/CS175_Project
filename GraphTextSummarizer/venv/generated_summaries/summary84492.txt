A lot of people have speculated that with "Avengers: Age of Ultron" next year, which has Thor in a prominent role, they guessed that we would change the character back in time for the movie, that's not the plan. Wednesday sees the publication of "Thor" #1, which tells how the original Thor we all know (perhaps best of all, Chris Hemsworth's character in the movie) is replaced by a new Thor with two X chromosomes. That part's been disappointing, but that to me has been washed out by the people who are excited to see a new Thor story. CNN: What did you decide to go for with the design of the new Thor? Call her Thor.
