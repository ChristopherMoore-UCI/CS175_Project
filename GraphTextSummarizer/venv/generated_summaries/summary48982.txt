"It was stupid," Von Anhalt said after a doctor repaired the damage at a Beverly Hills eye clinic. The patch protects an eye that Prince Frederic Von Anhalt accidentally glued shut Tuesday morning, publicist John Blanchette said. "It was dark and he grabbed his wife's nail glue instead of eye drops," Blanchette said. Von Anhalt, 68, will have to wear the patch over his right eye for two weeks, he said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
