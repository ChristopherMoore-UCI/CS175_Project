Jose Paredes, the vice minister for basic industries and mining, said the government needs to take over the Sidetur plant because it was not providing enough steel to meet the nation's construction demands. Last year, he nationalized a local unit of U.S. food giant Cargill. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Sunday his government will take over the Sidetur steel manufacturing plant. "This business needs to meet the needs of the country," Paredes was quoted as saying by the state-run Agencia Venezolana de Noticias. Sidetur is owned by Vivencia, which had two mineral plants appropriated by the government in 2008.
