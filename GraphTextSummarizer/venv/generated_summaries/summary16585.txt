In a third study released Monday, researchers treated patients with severe heart failure with stem cells derived from bone marrow. At Cedars-Sinai, 17 patients, including Milles, were given stem cells approximately six weeks after suffering a moderate to major heart attack. " Conventional wisdom took a hit Monday, as Bolli's group and a team from Cedars-Sinai each reported that stem cell therapies were able to reverse heart damage, without dangerous side effects, at least in a small group of patients. In Bolli's study, published in The Lancet, 16 patients with severe heart failure received a purified batch of cardiac stem cells. For years, doctors believed that heart cells, once destroyed, were gone forever.
