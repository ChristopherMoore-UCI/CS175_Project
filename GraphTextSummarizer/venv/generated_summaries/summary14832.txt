"They serve some of our highest-need children, both in terms of neighborhoods that we have difficulty attracting traditionally prepared teachers and in subject areas where we have difficulty, that teacher colleges are not preparing teachers in those areas. "It's very hard to justify laying off teachers who have given service to a school system and then turn around and bring in new teachers," argued John Wilson of the National Education Association, the nation's largest professional employee organization for the advancement of public education. Vicki Bernstein, who is in charge of teacher recruitment and quality for the city's Department of Education, says teachers coming in through alternative programs, like Teach For America, perform as well as teachers from traditional routes. Besides the matter of taking away potential jobs from career teachers, unions question whether these young recruits have the right credentials and experience to handle tough classrooms. Which is why a teachers union says those positions should go to career teachers, not inexperienced recruits who may stay only the required two years.
