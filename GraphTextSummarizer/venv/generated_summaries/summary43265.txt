Following Ramis' death, director Ivan Reitman, who helmed both 1984's "Ghostbusters" and 1989's "Ghostbusters II," decided not to direct the third "Ghostbusters" feature but has remained with the movie as a producer. -- Director Paul Feig might find himself leading a "Ghostbusters" reboot with an all-female cast, according to reports from Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. Feig, who helmed high-performing, female-led comedies "Bridesmaids" and "The Heat," is said to have caught the eye of studio Sony to direct a new "Ghostbusters" film. On Twitter over the weekend, he re-tweeted reaction to the news that he could lead an all-female "Ghostbusters," and also appeared to respond to those who've scoffed at the all-women concept as a "gimmick. " "Interesting how making a movie with men in the lead roles is normal but making a movie with women in the lead roles is a 'gimmick,' " Feig tweeted with the hashtag, "#its2014."
