Edith Eva Eger says the portrait was taken by her first teenage crush: a Jewish boy named Imre. "She was very shy when I was growing up," recalls Eger's eldest daughter, Marianne who says her mother transformed in the 1970s, after a visit to Auschwitz. Eger says months later, those same girls rescued her when she nearly collapsed from disease and starvation during a forced death march through Austria. "I had my 17th birthday in Auschwitz," Eger says. " Upon arrival at the camp, Eger said Dr. Joseph Mengele, one of the Auschwitz complex's top medical officers, stood at the end of a line of prisoners deciding who would go to the gas chambers and who would head for the prison barracks.
