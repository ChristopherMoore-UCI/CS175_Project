Director Sam Taylor-Johnson chosen for 'Fifty Shades of Grey' Fans have not rallied around the idea of Hunnam as Christian Grey and have offered another suggestion: Matt Bomer. -- Not everyone's pleased with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam in the starring roles in "Fifty Shades of Grey," but the bigger-name stars fans have been clamoring for reportedly weren't all that interested. "Handled correctly, 'Fifty Shades' could catapult Johnson and Hunnam to the A-list," The Hollywood Reporter predicts. 'Fifty Shades' screenwriter's thinking NC-17 So with Johnson and Hunnam being the choices -- and "there is a lot that goes into casting that isn't just looks. Talent, availability, their desire to do it, chemistry with other actor, etc.," "Fifty Shades" producer Dana Brunetti tweeted -- the next best thing the "Fifty Shades" team can do is knock the adaptation, written by Kelly Marcel, out of the park.
