A child prodigy and chess master by the time he was 15, Fischer achieved international fame in 1972 when he defeated chess grandmaster Boris Spassky of Russia during the height of the Cold War, becoming the world champion. -- The body of chess legend Bobby Fischer was exhumed Monday in Iceland, law enforcement officials have told CNN. Soviet chess masters had held the title since World War II -- until Fischer won. Iceland's supreme court ruled last month in favor of a request by Jinky Young, Fischer's alleged daughter, to exhume his remains in order to settle a paternity question. Police in the Icelandic town of Selfoss, where Fischer is buried, say the alleged daughter is 9 years old.
