"No amount of resources or changes will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if President Obama continues to ignore the law," he wrote in a statement, resurrecting the common refrain when immigration reform was still a possibility. Republicans and Democrats have urgently pressed President Barack Obama to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border -- and fast. With the door closed to any action on immigration reform this year with midterm campaigning in full swing, Congress and Obama now face a crisis around that issue, which Republicans do not want to touch as it's politically charged and complex. A law signed by President George W. Bush just prior to Obama's swearing-in, was meant to address child victims of illegal trafficking. As a central example, Republicans point to Obama's decision in 2012 to defer deportations of children brought to the United States illegally by their parents.
