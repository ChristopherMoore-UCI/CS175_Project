Mosley's promoter Golden Boy took the chance to have a dig at Filipino star Pacquiao over his refusal to undergo blood testing in the lead-up to the planned fight with Mayweather. -- Floyd Mayweather Junior has confirmed that he will fight WBA welterweight super champion Shane Mosley in Las Vegas on May 1 following the controversial collapse of his much-hyped showdown with Manny Pacquiao. "Shane Mosley is one of the greatest fighters of this era and I commend him for not only agreeing to the fight against Mayweather, but also agreeing to participate in a testing process that can only help the integrity of the sport," Golden Boy chief executive Richard Schaefer said. The undefeated Mayweather, a six-time world champion at five different weights and Pacquiao's chief rival for the pound-for-pound bragging stakes, said in a statement that he was looking forward to taking on his fellow American. Mosley had been due for a unification bout on January 30 with Andre Berto, who claimed the WBC title that Mayweather vacated when he retired in 2008, but the fight was scrapped when his opponent lost family members in the Haiti earthquake.
