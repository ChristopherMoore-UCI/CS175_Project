Their hands and feet had been bound with duct tape, state attorney general's office spokesman Arturo Sandoval said. "This phenomenon [of violence] here ... we've been seeing it, and living it in Juarez for the last two years," Sandoval said. But despite local reports and contrary to popular belief, the violence in Juarez has lessened recently, said Sandoval. The body of another man was found Sunday morning dumped in front of a church in the Valley of Juarez two miles outside Juarez proper, Sandoval said. Investigators were still working on identifying the victims, Sandoval said.
