Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner warned Lohan that avoiding future trouble could be a challenge. She will remain on probation for a misdemeanor shoplifting conviction, but without the strict reporting requirements of the two felony drunken driving convictions. If the allegation had been made last month, before Lohan was released from the strict rules of supervised probation, it might have had more serious implications for her. -- A woman filed a battery complaint against Lindsay Lohan on Saturday, accusing the actress of shoving her at a West Hollywood nightclub two nights earlier, according to a Los Angeles County sheriff's official. Lohan is preparing to portray Elizabeth Taylor in a Lifetime movie, which starts filming next month.
