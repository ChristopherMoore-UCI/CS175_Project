"Divers must have been checking their oxygen levels to make sure they weren't seeing things," said Jed Dodd, executive director of The Studios of Key West, which showed the Vandenberg Project exhibition. It was this rich history that gave Franke the inspiration for his unique World War II era scenes. Sunk just off Key West , an island in the Straits of Florida, in 2009, the Vandenberg is the second-largest artificial reef in the world, attracting a diverse range of marine animals and plant life. The 12 sumptuous images of everyday scenes -- from a housewife hanging out washing to a teenager watching TV -- take place against the eerie backdrop of sunken ship USNS General Hoyt S.Vandenberg. " Viennese artist Andreas Franke, who worked as an advertising photographer for more than 20 years, took the powerful images while on a diving exhibition last year.
