The justices said Officer Mike Stanton of the La Mesa Police Department had "qualified immunity" from civil claims of unreasonable search and seizure. The conservative majority court in recent years has given the benefit of the doubt to law enforcement in a number of cases involving searches of private property. The incident happened in May 2008, in a neighborhood east of San Diego that lower courts had said was known for "violence associated with drug gangs." Sims sued in federal court, alleging the officer invaded her home without a warrant. Now, the high court has reversed, saying previous rulings made clear that Stanton deserved immunity from civil claims.
