The Germans will contest the title match for the first time in 22 years after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead against Australia in Brisbane on Sunday as Angelique Kerber beat former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur 4-6 6-0 6-4. Not only has Wawrinka won his maiden major at January's Australian Open -- earning him the new moniker of "Grand Slam Stan" -- but he has now ticked off another box after claiming his first Masters title. The Czechs crushed defending champions Italy 4-0, with former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova clinching a home final as she won the third singles rubber 6-3 7-5 against Roberta Vinci. Also on Sunday, Croatia's Donna Vekic became the youngest player to win a WTA Tour title in eight years as she upset Australian Open runner-up Dominika Cibulkova at the Malaysian Open. The celebrations were muted on Sunday as he and Federer hugged over the net in Monte Carlo, but deep inside Wawrinka was buzzing after coming from behind to triumph 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 against the 17-time grand slam champion.
