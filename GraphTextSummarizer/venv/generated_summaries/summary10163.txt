-- Cuban authorities detained dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez along with two others as she traveled to cover the trial of a Spanish politician accused of killing a prominent dissident, a human rights activist told CNN on Friday. Carromero is facing a vehicular homicide charge for a car crash that killed prominent Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya. "Cuban authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Sanchez, Escobar and DÃ­az and allow all Cuban reporters to report without fear of intimidation." He is accused of speeding and then losing control of a car that he, Paya, Swedish politician Jans Aron Modig and Cuban dissident Harold Cepero were traveling in. A family member of the well-known blogger said that Sanchez, her husband, Reinaldo Escobar, and another blogger, Agustin Diaz, were arrested in the eastern Cuban city of Bayamo on Thursday, activist and dissident Elizardo Sanchez told CNN en EspaÃ±ol.
