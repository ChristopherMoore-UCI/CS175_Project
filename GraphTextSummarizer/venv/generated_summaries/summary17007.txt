The senators from northern states, where gun laws are stricter, are appealing to their colleagues in both parties to support the legislation, to help law enforcement stop guns from being "sold and re-sold across state lines." It would also stem the flow of guns purchased legally in one state from getting into the hands of people in other states where they are not legally allowed to own them, according to a statement issued Monday by Senator Patrick Leahy,  a Democrat from Vermont who is one of the bill's authors. The senators say they formulated the bill at the behest of law enforcement officials, who want new legislation that will empower police in their fight against gun traffickers. The measure combines anti-trafficking elements contributed by three Democrats, Leahy, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, with elements contributed by two Republicans, Illinois Senator Mark Kirk and Maine Senator Susan Collins. The meeting will likely also address three other pieces of legislation aimed at reducing gun violence, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein's controversial assault weapons ban.
