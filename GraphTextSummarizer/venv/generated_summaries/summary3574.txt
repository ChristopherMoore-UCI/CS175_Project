According to CNN affiliate KETV, 11-year-old Hunter and Sherman, the family's housekeeper, were killed in March 2008. However, they have said a cold case unit is assisting to determine whether there is a connection between the case and the unsolved killings of Shirlee Sherman and Thomas Hunter. "It's just kind of shocking to have somebody that seemed so full of life and invincible taken so suddenly," said Creighton medical student Justin McCarthy, KETV reported. According to the school's website, he attended Pennsylvania State University and worked in the pathology and neurology departments. "When I heard the news last night, I was literally shaken -- literally," Laura Neece-Baltaro, a family friend of the Brumbacks, told KETV.
