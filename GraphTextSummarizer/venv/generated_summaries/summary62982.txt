A Frank coincidence When the wardrobe department was fishing around for a jacket for Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan), some MGM staffers bought a bunch at a second-hand store. That makeup was killer Makeup in 1939, especially the elaborate and colorful cosmetics many members of the cast wore, wasn't as safe as the stuff performers wear today. At some point in the '90s, word went around that Pink Floyd's 1973 album "Dark Side of the Moon" synced up with the movie in eerie ways. Buddy Ebsen, who was originally cast as the Tin Man, had to leave the film when his lungs became infected by aluminum dust. Though members of Floyd swear it's pure coincidence -- and psychologists will tell you that we see links where we want to  -- some of the matchups are striking: "The Great Gig in the Sky" meshes well with the tornado; the old Side 1 of the album ends just as the sepia-colored portion of the movie does; and the heartbeat at the album's close coincides with Dorothy listening to the Tin Man's torso.
