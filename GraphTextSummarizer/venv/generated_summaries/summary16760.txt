-- Republican Rep. Cory Gardner has won the race for Colorado's U.S. Senate seat, defeating incumbent Sen. Mark Udall, according to a CNN projection. Udall spent much of the race trying to define Gardner as too conservative for Colorado. Udall's "war on women" strategy was one reason the Denver Post chose to endorse Gardner, just six years after they backed Udall. Yet his effort to get women to turnout quickly backfired after Gardner softened his opposition to birth control restrictions. Polling from recent weeks showed Gardner holding a slight lead against the incumbent senator, even though most fell within the margin of error.
