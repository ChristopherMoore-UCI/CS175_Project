Tuitel had been on a US Airways flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Kansas City, Missouri, where he had a late-September speaking engagement. "We asked Mr. Tuitel if he might be interested in working with us as a sounding board to help us continue to work toward improving our service for our customers with disabilities," she said. The Air Carrier Access Act outlines how airlines should deal with people with disabilities, but it is unclear whether US Airways' actions violated the act's provisions. But Friday, as the story spread to more media outlets, Mohr said US Airways' "customer relations team had an extremely productive discussion" with Tuitel. I was just embarrassed because I couldn't do my job." US Airways' official policy on disabled passengers stipulates that "for safety-related reasons, if a passenger has a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft, the airline requires that the passenger travel with a safety assistant to assist the passenger to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency evacuation," Mohr said.
