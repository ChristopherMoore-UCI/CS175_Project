Rangers paid around $10.9 million to agents with former boss Hughes signing a host of players including Brazil's Julio Cesar from Inter Milan, Real Madrid's Esteban Granero and Ji-Sung Park from Manchester United. Of the newly-promoted clubs, West Ham United leads the way, racking up figures of $7.1 million, while Reading came close to hitting the $3.5 million mark. The Anfield club spent around $13.8 million on agents' fees, with much of that coming from the reported $40 million it paid out for Fabio Borini and Joe Allen in August. The west London club has yet to win a single league game this season and appointed Harry Redknapp as its new manager last week after dispensing with the services of Mark Hughes. According to the figures, Manchester United paid $5.7 million, which was down from $7.1 million the previous year.
