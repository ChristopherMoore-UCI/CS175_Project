No court date has yet been set for the girls, who Judd said will probably not see any time in juvenile detention because they have no previous criminal records and the charge is a class-three felony, one step up from a misdemeanor under Florida law. While bullying was not in itself against the law, Judd said, the girls' actions allegedly harassing Rebecca in school and online formed the basis for the stalking charge. According to Judd, the girl was upset that Rebecca had once dated her current boyfriend and began bullying and harassing her more than a year ago when they were both students at a Florida middle school. Had Rebecca been 17 or older, he said, authorities could have filed nothing more than misdemeanor charges. The girl denies she stalked Rebecca and she hasn't accessed Facebook recently, DeMichael said.
