In "Coco Avant Chanel," French actress Audrey Tautou plays Coco Chanel, founder of the iconic Parisien haute couture house, Chanel. For "Coco Avant Chanel" director Anne Fontaine, there was only one actress who could play Coco Chanel in her biopic about the legendary couturier -- French actress Audrey Tautou. Highlights from the French film talent at this year's Cannes Film Festival Â» Fontaine also had to add an element of fiction to her telling of Chanel's early years, taking liberties with the script to get some of Chanel's most iconic designs into the film. Indeed, Coco herself once said, "I lost everything with the loss of Capel." Tautou's portrayal of Chanel's broken heart in the scenes around Capel's death may be her finest. "In the last part [of the film], I was completely her." Fontaine and Tautou both acknowledge the biggest challenge of making "Coco Before Chanel" was doing justice to one of the most well-known and influential women of the 20th Century.
