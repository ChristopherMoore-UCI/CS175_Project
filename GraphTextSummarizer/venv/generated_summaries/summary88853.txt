It also wanted to hold the first round of summit talks in June at Panmunjom, a truce village on the border where meetings between north and south take place, and a second round of talks during the nuclear security summit in Berlin in March next year, KCNA reported. " State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a news briefing Wednesday that he did not see it as a ratcheting up of tensions, but "we've been consistent in saying North Korea needs to improve North-South relations before we move forward, ceasing provocative actions." Journalist Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report. However, North Korean officials said South Korea had asked for a series of summits at the May 9 secret meeting.
