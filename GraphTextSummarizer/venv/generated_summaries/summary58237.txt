"We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under Ayer's amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero," said Greg Silverman, president of Creative Development and Worldwide Production for Warner Bros. With Leto sure to relish the role of the Clown Prince of Crime, and Smith stepping out of the role of hero, this will be an interesting one to watch. Warner Bros. Pictures (owned by Time Warner, just like CNN) confirmed the long-rumored casting on Tuesday. Tom Hardy -- best known as Bane from "The Dark Knight Rises" -- returns to the world of comic book movies as Rick Flagg. This news will bring a smile to the face of many Jared Leto fans. The Oscar-winning actor has been cast to play the Joker in "Suicide Squad," based on the DC Comics series, due in theaters on August 5, 2016.
