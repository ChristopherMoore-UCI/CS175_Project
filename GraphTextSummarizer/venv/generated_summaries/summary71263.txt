-- Panama City Beach, Florida, police are looking for a hotel security guard accused of raping an Alabama student and throwing her off a sixth-floor hotel balcony, a police spokesman told CNN. After his initial questioning, Wuertly told police he was leaving for Tennessee and would return on Wednesday. The 18-year-old woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, remains hospitalized, but her injuries are not life-threatening, Lt. Dave Humphreys said. Wuertly had been questioned by police regarding the attack, but they lacked the evidence to hold him, the spokesman said. Police released this photo of Shawn Wuertly, who worked as a hotel security guard in Panama City Beach, Florida.
