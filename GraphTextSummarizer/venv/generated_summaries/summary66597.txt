The British parliament was officially dissolved on Monday, as a nationwide election campaign launches to determine if Gordon Brown can hang on as prime minister. Brown's Labour party has been in power for 13 years, first under Tony Blair and, since 2007, with Brown as prime minister. "Government ministers remain in charge of their departments until after the election result is known," according to Parliament, but do not make any major policy decisions. The opposition Conservative party, led by David Cameron, has consistently held an edge in recent opinion polls, but it is not clear that Cameron has a big enough lead to dislodge Brown. The new parliament is due to take office on May 24.
