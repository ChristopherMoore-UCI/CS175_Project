Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is a good friend and U.S. ally, but declined to predict whether the embattled leader would heed protesters' calls to step down. Protesters have pledged to stay on the streets of Egyptian cities until Hosni Mubarak relinquishes power. Mubarak, who has led the north African nation for three decades, has said he will stay in power until September, and will not run for re-election. " Massive demonstrations have been held in Egyptian cities since January 25 to demand an end to Mubarak's rule. Cheney made the comments Saturday night at a ceremony honoring former President Ronald Reagan in Santa Barbara, California.
