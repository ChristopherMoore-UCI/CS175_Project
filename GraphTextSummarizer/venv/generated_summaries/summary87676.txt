Hernik -- who was competing in his first Dakar -- was found at kilometer 206 on the stage between San Juan and Chilecito, in northern Argentina. The 2015 Dakar rally suffered tragedy on only its third day of competition when motorbike rider Michal Hernik was found dead. " Hernik's death means five competitors have died since the rally moved from West Africa to South America in 2009 because of security concerns in the Sahara region. No damage was found to either his body or bike, said race director Etienne Lavigne. Since the Dakar began on December 26, 1978, a total of 24 competitors have died but there have been over 50 fatalities when including the deaths of spectators and officials.
