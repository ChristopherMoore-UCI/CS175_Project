Crystal Thornton, from Lyles, Tennessee, was enjoying the concert's opening act at the  Bridgestone Arena in Nashville with her best friend Christina Tugman on Tuesday night when she had a seizure, according to information provided by Vanderbilt Medical Center. She was then airlifted to  Vanderbilt Medical Center's emergency department, where doctors  immediately used therapeutic hypothermia to cool Thornton's body temperature to between 93 and  86 degrees -- below the normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees. " After undergoing the two days of cooling therapy, Thornton's body temperature was slowly restored to normal. Chilled water blankets were placed over Thornton's body and head, and medical personnel then used a machine to lower her body  temperature for 48 hours. "The patient  received incredible care from the moment she experienced problems at the  Bridgestone Arena," said Dr. Jared McKinney, medical director of LifeFlight  Event Medicine.
