-- IMG, the behemoth sports management agency that represents three of tennis' biggest stars in Maria Sharapova, Novak Djokovic and Li Na, is no longer working with controversial Australian Bernard Tomic. His father John was found guilty of assaulting Tomic's former hitting partner and last year handed a suspended eight-month sentence. CNN understands that the Tomic camp has approached his former agent, Lawrence Frankopan, who is now at StarWing Sports. But Tomic isn't Australia's top hope now, replaced by the man who beat Nadal at Wimbledon, 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios. StarWing Sports represents, among others, Chris Evert and 2014 Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka.
