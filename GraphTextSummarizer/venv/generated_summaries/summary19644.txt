Leading the first international news team into this part of the Philippines in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan -- one of the strongest storms ever recorded to hit land -- Hancocks and crew hitched a ride from Manila with the country's military, along with members of the World Food Program, the United Nations, local media and a load of food aid. People are coming to the terminal area as they believe this is where food and water and first aid will be administered. Food and water are the main issue facing residents. The first challenge will be providing food and water as well as shelter. The military and the U.N. are looking for where they should set up areas where residents can come to get assistance.
