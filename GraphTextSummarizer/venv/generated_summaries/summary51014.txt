Speaking to an audience of students and activists in New Delhi, Obama declared the U.S. was India's best-suited partner as it makes rapid economic advances and appears poised to overtake China to become the world's most populous nation. During his remarks Tuesday, Obama said India must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change, even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive India to new economic heights. In the final hours of a visit meant to demonstrate the deep societal ties between the United States and India, President Barack Obama briefly broke from his gushing praise for the new Prime Minister to make a soft but undisguised push toward gender equality and religious freedom. White House officials say the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already-high expectations, and claim the relationship greased the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow U.S. firms to construct power plants in India. "Here's the truth: even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if growing countries like India—with soaring energy needs—don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change," Obama said.
