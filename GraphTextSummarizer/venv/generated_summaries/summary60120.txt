The modern sport of Wushu started life in ancient China as a form of self defense, explains Daniel Kainan Pan, a former member of the Great Britain Wushu team. "Traditional Wushu can be said to be the ancestor of all martial arts like Aikido, Karate, Judo -- they all came from ancient Chinese martial arts," Kainan Pan says. " Kainan Pan grew up idolizing Chinese Wushu legend turned actor Jet Li, but for Duong it is her compatriot Nguyen Thuy Hien who has spurred her on. "What really sets Wushu apart (from other martial arts) is that it's more of a complete system, in the sense that in the fighting aspect there are grabs and throws but also punches and kicks -- you can use anything you want. "Everything about Wushu is equally very difficult," Duong says.
