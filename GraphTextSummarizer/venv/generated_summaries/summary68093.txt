Dramatic entries are a given with air travel, and airports should convey a sense of welcome and arrival to travelers landing in a new city, like the great train stations of yesteryear, says architecture critic Paul Goldberger. The design is intriguing to Goldberger, which is why the Carrasco airport is also on his list of airports to experience. (Maybe if it was still open, Goldberger would like flying out of John F. Kennedy International Airport better.) Although most airports don't meet his wish for a "grand welcome" -- even the ones he likes --  some architects are designing lovely airports that are worth admiring.
