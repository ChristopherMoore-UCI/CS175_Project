Thus, Bonten and the hospital entered a complicated period of legal negotiations, where they finally came to a mutual agreement after a strange set of circumstances. You see, as per his profession, van de Goot was able to legally obtain Bonten's leg from the hospital after surgery. That book led Bonten to a pathologist named Frank van de Goot, who was more than happy to help with all this lamp nonsense. You see, leading up to his surgery at Erasmus Medical Center, a news reporter gave Bonten a book by Joris van Casteren about a mysterious leg found by a fisherman in the IJssel River. Eventually, as Bonten's story became an even bigger media sensation, a designer named William Schaper Kotter decided to reach out and offer his services to complete the vision.
