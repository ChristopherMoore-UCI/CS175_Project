"Water doesn't always fit the venture capital model," said Scott Bryan, COO of Imagine H2O, a San Francisco nonprofit focused on helping water-technology companies get their ideas off the ground. There also are products that help detect leaks, waste-water treatment research, and tools for better tracking water usage and waste. Farms or rural homes with wells on their property can choose to keep their information private or share it anonymously with WellIntel, which uses the data to help government agencies and others see the bigger picture of water shortages. Agriculture accounts for 70% of all our water usage, so much of the current technology focuses on helping farms use water more efficiently. "Everybody for the most part has been tuned out on water (shortages) because within the U.S. it's not really been a big issue," said Amhaus.
