Nunez is also known as Christian Esquino, the insurance companies allege, a businessman with a criminal record that includes falsifying airplane records. The DEA confirmed Friday the link between Starwood and Esquino. In another court action, Starwood distances itself from Esquino and denies he is the owner. Court records that surfaced after Sunday's fatal crash revealed that the aviation company, Starwood Management, had two planes authorities seized this year.
