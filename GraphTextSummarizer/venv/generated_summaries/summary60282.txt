The two have exchanged gifts, something common among reunited twins, said Nancy Segal, a psychology professor at Cal State Fullerton and author of four books about twins. She said fraternal twins are less likely to be close friends and don't stay in contact as closely as identical twins. She interviewed Hamel and Hunt to see how environment affects twins who are raised apart. In 1936, a pregnant single woman in England made the difficult decision to give up one of her newborns, separating fraternal twins. Both were raised as the only child in the family, though Hunt had no idea she had a twin until her daughter told her last year.
