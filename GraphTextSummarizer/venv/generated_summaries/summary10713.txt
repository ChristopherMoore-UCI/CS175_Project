There are more players that are picking it up in high school and in middle school, and the level of talent is continuing to get younger. The aim is to pass your way into the opposition's end zone, just like in American Football, but once in possession players aren't allowed to run with the disc. Players are constantly harrying round the field of play creating space, executing a variety of throws -- including the "hammer" and the "scoober" -- and flinging themselves around attempting to catch the disc. "I think that ultimate will become an Olympic sport," Poole, who plays for Atlanta-based team Chain Lightning, told CNN's Human to Hero series. But forget outdated notions of dogs scurrying after flying discs in the park, ultimate is a frenetic pursuit that blends aspects of football and rugby into a dynamic "frisbee" package.
