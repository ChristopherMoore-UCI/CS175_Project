At their last meeting, on July 13, Rosenbaum said he had been arranging kidney sales for 10 years, the complaint says. -- One of the sweeping criminal complaints unveiled Thursday in New Jersey against 44 public officials and others includes a New York man accused of trying to arrange the private sale of a kidney from a donor in Israel. The undercover FBI agent told Rosenbaum one of her uncles needed a kidney because he had been on dialysis for two years and on a transplant list at a Philadelphia hospital, the complaint says. According to the complaint, the undercover FBI agent called a person who was the recipient of a kidney brokered by Rosenbaum, who had provided the telephone number as a reference. All of the donors "come from Israel," Rosenbaum is alleged to have said.
