He represented the family of a Chechen woman killed by a former Russian colonel in March 2000, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. -- Russian investigators have no suspects in Monday's killings of a prominent human rights lawyer and a journalist despite round-the-clock efforts to find the gunman, officials said Wednesday. Journalist Anastasia Baburova, 25, who worked for the pro-democracy newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was also shot when she tried to intervene, and she died later in a hospital, Russian reports said. Novaya Gazeta Editor-in-Chief Dmitry Muratov suggested Baburova was killed when she tried to apprehend the lawyer's killer, but he also could not rule out the possibility that she herself was a target, Interfax reported. Surveillance cameras recorded the murders but investigators could not make out the killer's identity, Moscow Police Chief Vladimir Pronin told reporters, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported.
