Filatov has previously merged his love of chess and art by sponsoring this year's World Chess Championship Match at Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. The original piece, painted in 1947, won the Stalin Prize and remains in the Tretyakov State Gallery in Moscow. Filatov says he is "aware of what kind of empire I lived in, that many times this empire, the leaders put the world at risk of world war. He was commissioned by the USSR's communist leader Joseph Stalin to create "A Letter from the Front," a warm depiction of a family receiving news from the front line. Filatov, a 40-year old professional chess player and businessman, is investing in his love of Soviet Union art by scouting the world for pieces created behind the Iron Curtain.
