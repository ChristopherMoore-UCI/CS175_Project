" Reuters: Megrahi says his Lockerbie role exaggerated "Clearly he is in a better condition than when I saw him a month ago," Robertson said Monday. While al-Megrahi told Reuters that he had been treated badly since his return to Libya, Robertson said Monday that his family is building a "huge new house in a very upmarket part of Tripoli. Prosecutors said al-Megrahi, the former chief of security for Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta, brought the bomb to Malta. " Given Gadhafi's ouster, Robertson said, it's not clear why al-Megrahi isn't speaking out now about what he knows about the bombing, but it's clear he has answers that many people would like to hear. Robertson said al-Megrahi's family told him they believe al-Megrahi was the victim of both international justice and the regime of ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who they say used him as a scapegoat.
