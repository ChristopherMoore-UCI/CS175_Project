"Despite the things that have happened with Jerry Sandusky, Penn State never really lost the support of its alumni," La Torre said. The school was thrust into the national spotlight with accusations against former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted last month on 45 of 48 counts related to sexual abuse of boys. -- In a year marred with controversy and national notoriety, Penn State University alumni and boosters finally have something to smile about. The scandal's fallout included the firings of legendary football coach Joe Paterno and university President Graham Spanier. "The philosophy of Penn State has been to listen and give answers to the best of our ability." La Torre said anyone donating to the university has a right to specify what the money goes for.
