Animation film studio Pixar -- where Apple boss Steve Jobs was formerly CEO -- runs a huge range of courses for staff at its own corporate university. The Yale Daily News quoted unnamed Apple "company insiders" as saying Podolny would mastermind executive education programs within the computer company. An Apple store in downtown Munich, Germany Podolny, still only 43 and credited with helping applications to the school rise by 50 percent in his four-year tenure, is leaving to become the first ever dean of the so-called Apple University. The computer and tech company has yet to say exactly what Apple University is -- an Apple spokesman called it only an "exciting new project" -- but many people assume it is likely to be an in-house executive education and training facility for employees. In an email to staff and students announcing his departure, Podolny spoke of his regret but said he had long harbored a passion for all things Apple.
