During the two-week mission, the six-member crew will deliver an Italian-built Tranquility node and a seven-windowed cupola to the station, which will be used as a control room for robotics. Endeavour lifted off from Kennedy Space Center early Monday. The delicate docking maneuver took place while both spacecraft were circling the globe at about 17,500 mph (28,165 km/h). The space station will be about 90 percent complete once the node and cupola are added, NASA said. -- The space shuttle Endeavour docked with the international space station early Wednesday, completing a three-day orbital chase.
