The previous severe weather alert, generated by Phanfone, caused more than 1.2 million people to be evacuated to shelters, disrupted air and rail travel as well as the search and rescue efforts for missing hikers on Mount Ontake. Hot on the heels of Typhoon Phanfone, which lashed Japan with rain and high winds last week, Vongfong, which has intensified in recent days to become the strongest tropical cyclone of 2014 so far, looks poised to buffet the country in the coming days. Track the typhoon Currently over open water, the storm, which is classed as a Super Typhoon, is heading north towards the Japanese island prefecture of Okinawa, according to the Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Typhoon Vongfong is the strongest tropical cyclone since last year's Typhoon Haiyan, which had winds of 315 km/h (195 mph) which devastated parts of the Philippines, leaving over 6,000 dead and more than 1,800 missing. This year has seen a lower-than-average number of named storms and typhoons, but double the yearly average of Super Typhoons - six in total so far.
