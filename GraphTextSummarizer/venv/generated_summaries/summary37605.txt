Tempers flared in injury time when Brazilian full-back Marcelo's dismissal for a lunging tackle on Barca debutant Cesc Fabregas sparked a mass brawl between the two sets of players. Barca regained the lead on the brink of half-time, when Messi found the net following a neat back-heel from center-back Gerard Pique. Lionel Messi's volley two minutes from time secured a 5-4 aggregate triumph for Josep Guardiola's side, after French striker Karim Benzema's goal in the 82nd minute looked to have forced the Spanish season's traditional curtain-raiser into extra-time. Guardiola has now won 11 major honors since becoming Barca coach in 2008 and the former club captain was delighted with his team's performance. Having drawn Sunday's first leg 2-2 at the Bernabeu, European champions Barca went ahead in the tie when Andres Iniesta latched onto a through ball from FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi and clipped a finish over Iker Casillas in the Real goal.
