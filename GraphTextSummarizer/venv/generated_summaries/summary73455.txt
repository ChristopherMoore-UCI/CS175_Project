"Belgrade was so many times conquered, pulled down and built again, so, that is why we have so many layers and every of those people left its marks on the ground of this city," says art historian Bojana Ibrajter Gazibara, surrounded by a cluster of ancient statues and elaborate headstones that dot an old gunpowder storage room deep inside the fortress. Lying at the confluence of the great Danube and Sava rivers, Belgrade -- home today for some 1.5 million people -- is strategically located at the crossroads between Eastern and Western Europe and a meeting point of different civilizations. "It's a roof for many different activities," says Maja Lalic, the creative force behind Mikser House. Nowhere is Belgrade's historical and cultural significance more evident than in the imposing ancient fortress that towers over the point where the Danube and Sava rivers mingle.
