-- New information regarding the killing of a U.S. immigration agent in Mexico points to it being a sanctioned hit by the Zetas drug cartel and not a rogue incident, said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who said he has been briefed by federal immigration officials. Zapata and Special Agent Victor Avila were driving back to Mexico City from a meeting with U.S. officials from Monterrey and stopped for sandwiches at a Subway shop in the city of San Luis Potosi, McCaul told CNN. The agents were returning to Mexico City after meeting other U.S. personnel in San Luis Potos√≠, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said Wednesday. "Such meetings among U.S. law enforcement personnel working in Mexico are a regular part of ICE's bilateral cooperation in Mexico under existing agreements," it said, adding that the Mexican government does not authorize U.S. law enforcement personnel to carry weapons. The agency said about 30 officers are assigned to its office in Mexico City; they work on a range of issues including drugs, weapons, currency and immigration.
