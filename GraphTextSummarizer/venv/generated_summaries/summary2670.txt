"The Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection marks a new chapter for our brand, and we're excited to give Lilly fans everywhere, including those who have loved the brand for years and those who will get to know it for the first time through this collaboration, a chance to experience this incredibly chic lifestyle collection," said Jane Schoenborn, Lilly Pulitzer's vice president of creative communications. Retail giant Target announced Tuesday its latest designer partnership, with Lilly Pulitzer -- sorority-girl favorite and the queen of bold American resortwear. "As we started to think about the perfect partner to collaborate with, Lilly Pulitzer was the clear choice given the brand's inspiring heritage, authority with print and pattern and resort-chic aesthetic. Because of her socialite roots (her designs were a favorite of former schoolmate Jacqueline Kennedy), many Lilly lovers on social media weren't seeing the bright side of the design partnership. The big box store has collaborated on capsule collections with design powerhouses like Phillip Lim, Zac Posen, Prabal Gurung, Jason Wu and Joseph Altuzarra.
