The official new title of the show is "Don't Trust The B----- in Apartment 23," dashing out the letters of the curse in an attempt to soften its impact (not entirely unlike how CBS solved buying short-lived "S**t My Dad Says" last season, substituting the non-word "$#*!"). The Disney-owned network has two upcoming shows that previously used the word "b**ch" in their title -- "Don't Trust the B**ch in Apartment 23" and drama "Good Christian B**ches."

The new version more clearly suggests the show's premise -- about a naive midwesterner (Dreama Walker) who moves in with a hardcore party girl (Krysten Ritter). Although networks are wary about the swear word in a show's title, on-air use is fair game.
