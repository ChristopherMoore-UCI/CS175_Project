"The tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers," Morgan said in August. "He came out of the car with more of a lunging motion coming out of the car, and the deputies were standing behind him and he had what appeared to be a metallic object in his hand," said Sheriff David Morgan. Middleton's attorney, Lorenzo Williams, told CNN on Wednesday that his client was distraught over the grand jury decision. "This will not preclude Mr. Middleton from moving forward with a civil action," he said. In the FDLE report, Middleton allegedly told investigators that he used crack cocaine and alcohol the day before, but only drank two beers earlier on the day of the shooting.
