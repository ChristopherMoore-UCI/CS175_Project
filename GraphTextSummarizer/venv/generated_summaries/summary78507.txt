While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year. Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments.
