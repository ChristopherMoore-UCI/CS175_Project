She is the granddaughter of Eugene Meyer -- former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman and the first president of the World Bank -- and the niece of Katharine Graham, who owned and published the Washington Post at the time of the 1970s Watergate scandal. Taking on the project of restoring Endeavour after discovering her in England, Meyer lived in Fawley, a village on the southwest coast in close proximity to an oil refinery and a power station. "Endeavour was the most beautiful J ever designed and built," Meyer says. When Meyer organized an event in 1989 pitching Endeavour and Shamrock -- another of her restoration projects -- she needed 90 sailors to act as crew. Her father was a powerboater and fisherman, her mother a sailor who regaled a young Meyer with stories of the J-Class yachts.
