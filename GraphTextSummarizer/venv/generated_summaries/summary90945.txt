" Music streaming apps and sites were supposed to make music cheap -- or free -- for consumers while assuring that the artists who created the songs would be fairly compensated. " Ek noted that Spotify has paid more than $2 billion to record labels, music publishers and groups that distribute royalties to songwriters and recording artists -- $1 billion of which came in the past year. He noted that, as traditional revenue streams dry up, streaming sites like Pandora are growing. "If half of radio listening shifts from terrestrial to Pandora and other internet radio platforms, it will mean billions in additional royalty dollars for performers and songwriters," Grimaldi said. "As the highest paying form of radio, Pandora is proud to play the music of thousands of artists for our more than 75 million users," Dave Grimaldi, Pandora's director of public affairs, said in an email.
