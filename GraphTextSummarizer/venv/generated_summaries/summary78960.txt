-- Former Haitian first lady Mirlande Manigat will face popular musician Michel Martelly in the second round of presidential elections in Haiti, the electoral commission announced Thursday. U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth Merten told reporters in Washington that Thursday was "a good day in Haiti." The third-place candidate, Martelly, claimed he had won more votes than Celestin and a review of results by an Organization of American States team supported that contention. When the initial results were announced, Haitians responded by charging fraud and burning cars, tires and Celestin's campaign headquarters in Port-au-Prince. Merten called for all of Haiti's politicians and people to remain "calm and peaceful" in the run-up to the second round of voting.
