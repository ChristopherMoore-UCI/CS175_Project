"Mr. Clash continues to deny any wrongdoing, and we intend to defend this case forcefully." Although Stephens called it an "an adult consensual relationship" last November, the revelation triggered Clash's suspension from Sesame Street and eventually his resignation. "Clash was an adult male living a prominent public life centered around the entertainment of toddlers, while at the same time he was, in secret, preying on teenage boys to satisfy his depraved sexual interests," the Stephens suit alleged. Clash resigned from his job on "Sesame Street" after the first lawsuit was filed in November. "Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon," the lawsuit said. Sheldon Stephens, now 24, is the fourth man to sue Kevin Clash, but he was the first one to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with him as a teen.
