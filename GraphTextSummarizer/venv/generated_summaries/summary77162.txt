State prosecutors allege that former President Graham Spanier, former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Senior Vice President Gary Schultz all knew about two allegations made against Sandusky in 1998 and in 2001, but lied about their knowledge when a grand jury convened several years later. Penn State OKs settlements for Sandusky victims E-mails that surfaced during Penn State's internal investigation into Sandusky's actions led, in part, to criminal charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and failure to report child abuse against the three school officials. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. At least three of Sandusky's known victims were abused after 2001, according to testimony at last year's trial of former Nittany Lions defensive coordinator. Paterno told him, McQueary testified, that Penn State administrators had "screwed it up" when talking about the 2001 investigation.
