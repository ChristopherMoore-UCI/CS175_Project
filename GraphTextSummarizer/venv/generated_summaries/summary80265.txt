Brazil's defenders made the first of many poor clearances and the striker just accepted the ball outside the Brazilian area to shoot for goal in the bottom corner of the net with a low drive. Brazil could have pulled off a comeback when Hulk scored in injury time and Oscar missed the equalizer with seconds to go. The much-fancied Brazilians were in shock from the early setback and there was an altercation between Raphael and Juan after the goal as they tried to work out who was to blame for the error which allowed Mexico in. It was one of two simple goals scored by Oribe Peralta which allowed the Mexicans to command a game which was littered with defensive errors by the Brazilians. -- Mexico scored the quickest goal in Olympic football history to ensure five-time World Cup winners Brazil miss out yet again on an Olympic gold medal.
