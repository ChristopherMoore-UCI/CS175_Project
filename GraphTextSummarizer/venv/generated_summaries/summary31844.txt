Unlike animal and human bones, coral can't be rejected by the body, say medical experts at the company CoreBone, which manufactures bone replacements from coral. It is hoped the coral grown in this surreal "farm," could one day be used in bone operations -- encompassing everything from dental implants to spinal procedures. "In six years of growing corals, I haven't left these four walls for more than 12 hours -- not even once," he said. "We have a constant supply," says Ohad Schwartz of company CoreBone. Happily for Shaham, his ambitious experiment appears to be thriving, with coral in the lab growing at ten times the normal rate.
