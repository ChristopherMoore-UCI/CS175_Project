"The brain sends out the signals to move, but at the level of the spinal cord, the motor neurons are inhibited," said Dr. William C. Dement, a pioneer in the field of sleep research and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. REM behavior disorder and sleepwalking are defined as separate disorders, but in reality there may be some overlap, Dement said. Clonazepam is also prescribed for REM behavior disorder, although it is sometimes not appropriate in older patients because it may aggravate sleep apnea, Pelayo said. Experts say there isn't a lot of research going on into sleepwalking or REM behavior disorder treatments since the available resources are sufficient in most people. Most of them are most likely to happen when a person is sleep-deprived and under stress, said Philip Gehrman, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
