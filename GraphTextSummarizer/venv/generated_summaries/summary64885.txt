After a goalless 90 minutes, Peru scored the opening goal 11 minuites into extra time when Carlos Lobaton reacted first to fire the ball home after goalkeeper Luis Martinez fumbled an attempted punched clearance. And they were made to pay for those misses as Peru netted twice in extra time to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1997. However, they missed a host of chances to win the match in extra time, notably when highly-rated Porto striker Radamel Falcao fired a penalty wide. And they sealed their victory six minutes into the second period when Paolo Guerrero set Juan Vargas free on the counter-attack -- and the Fiorentina star drilled home the decisive second goal. Dayro Moreno hit the post and Fredy Guarin the crossbar as Colombia did everything but score during regulation time.
