The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a Sunni Islamist militant group, claimed responsibility for that attack, calling it the "first small payment" in a bigger push against the Lebanon-based Shiite militia Hezbollah. ISIS, which is an affiliate of the al Qaeda terrorist organization, is one of the rebel groups fighting to overthrow autocratic Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The neighborhood is part of Hezbollah's high-security area known as "security square," and many of the Shiite Islamist group's leaders live there. Hezbollah -- also considered a terrorist organization by the United States -- is fighting beside al-Assad's troops, who are trying to quash the rebellion in Syria. Cryptic claim A cryptic message claiming responsibility for the attack appeared on Twitter from a user with the name "al-Nusra Front in Lebanon."
