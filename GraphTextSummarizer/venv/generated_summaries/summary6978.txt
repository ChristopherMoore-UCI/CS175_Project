Marquez Parra told CNN the emphasis should be on academics, and notes squads express their spirit during school hours at several schools in different ways. She told CNN affiliate WFLA that her "shorter than mid-thigh" skirt is a part of tradition: The football players and cheerleaders wear their uniforms each Friday during school on game day. Parra said the school is still working with the cheerleading team on what will be allowed during school for this Friday's game day: School leaders say the uniforms just aren't appropriate for classrooms and don't fit into student dress codes. The decision to ban cheerleader skirts during classroom hours is being ridiculed as short in spirit by some Pinellas County high school cheerleaders and parents.
