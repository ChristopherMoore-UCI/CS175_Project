"The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth." As Jackson has acknowledged, "The Hobbit" is a slender story compared with the far more sprawling and complex "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Apparently, when it comes to Middle-earth, director Peter Jackson thinks three is the magic number. " How exactly The Hobbit will be turned into a three-film series is still somewhat unclear, though. The second film is slated for Dec. 13, 2013.
