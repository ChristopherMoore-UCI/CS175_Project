Tillis leads among suburban and rural voters, earning 49% support in each category compared to 43% support for Hagan among suburban voters and 44% with rural voters. Hagan, though, holds a massive lead in urban areas, where she has 59% support to Tillis' 37%. "Hagan seems to have done a good job of defining her lesser-known challenger in an unflattering light," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Hagan led with 48% support to 46% for Tillis, the state House speaker, in the survey of 559 likely voters, conducted Oct. 27-30 and with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. North Carolina is one of several states that President Barack Obama won at least once -- Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire are the others -- where Republicans are hoping to grab Senate seats previously held by Democrats.
