-- The captors of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, two Americans currently being held in Iran on suspicion of espionage, allowed them to telephone home over the weekend, according a statement released Monday by members of their families. Last week, Cindy Hickey and Laura Fattal, the respective mothers of Bauer and Josh Fattal, announced they were going on a hunger strike to protest their sons' treatment. Bauer, Fattal and Bauer's fiancee, Sarah Shourd, were arrested July 31, 2009, while hiking along an unmarked border between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan. U.S. officials have repeatedly said the charges against Bauer and Fattal are meritless and have called on the Iranian government to release the two men. A trial for the men was supposed to take place earlier this month, but it was delayed without an explanation after Bauer and Fattal were not brought to the courthouse.
