The boy's death aggravated U.S. State Department efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process to adopt a Russian child before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. After Texas boy's death, Russian official continues call for ban on adoptions But others say the Russian move is in retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. A Texas coroner declared the death of an adopted Russian boy accidental, prompting Moscow to demand a complete report from U.S. officials. Still, he wants his country to ban all international adoptions of Russian children.
