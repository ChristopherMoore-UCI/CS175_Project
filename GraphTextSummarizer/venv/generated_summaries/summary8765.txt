Alongside Rowling, 13 other authors invited to contribute to the June 10 auction include Margaret Atwood, Sebastian Faulks, Nick Hornby, and Tom Stoppard. -- Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is writing a prequel to her best-selling series  to be auctioned for charity -- but at just 800 words, it may lack some of the magic fans of the boy wizard might be hoping for. A book featuring all 13 cards will go on sale in August. Autographed copies of J.K. Rowling's work have fetched millions of dollars at auction. "I can't begin to guess how much it will raise at auction."
