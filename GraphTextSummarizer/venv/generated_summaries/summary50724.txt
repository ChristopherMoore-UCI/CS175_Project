"I agree with Mitt Romney, who recently said he's proud of what he accomplished on health care in Massachusetts and supports giving states the power to determine their own health care solutions. "I think there are a number of features in the Massachusetts plan that could inform Washington on ways to improve health care for all Americans," Romney said. In the same interview, Romney suggested that parts of the Massachusetts experiment could serve as a model for national health care reform. Instead, states would be allowed to conduct their own experiments in health care reform. It's a tight box for Romney: He must convince his fellow Republicans to look past the very health care reform provision that's at the heart of those court challenges.
