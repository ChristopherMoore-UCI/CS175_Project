Waxman, D-California, has led a House investigation into a series of electrical accidents in Iraq that he said may have been responsible for the deaths of 19 U.S. troops and contractors. " "My office has heard from several active-duty soldiers a report that as recently as three weeks ago, soldiers in Iraq continued to receive electrical shocks on a regular basis as they carry out their daily activities, including taking showers," Casey told the committee. A report that year warned U.S. commanders that contractors must properly ground electrical systems. But Waxman said the Army had been warning of electrical hazards in Iraq since 2004, including one fatality similar to Maseth's. That office concluded that there was "no credible evidence" that KBR and the Pentagon agency that oversees defense contractors were aware of electrical problems at the facility, committee Chairman Henry Waxman said during a Wednesday hearing.
