Maj. Gen. Michael Carey led the 20th Air Force responsible for three nuclear wings. Maj. Gen. Carey has otherwise served the nation extremely well," said  Gen William Shelton,  who heads the Air Force Space Command. But an Air Force Inspector General report released Thursday sheds more light into the case. There was no indication Carey's behavior compromised sensitive nuclear information or  went beyond drinking, dancing and fraternizing with the women, officials said. "I am confident Maj. Gen. Carey will use his depth of space expertise to assist my command in providing foundational space and cyberspace capabilities to the warfighter," Shelton said.
