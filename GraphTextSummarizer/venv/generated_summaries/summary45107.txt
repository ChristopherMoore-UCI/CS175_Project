Watch Knox in court » As Knox stood outside, police went in and began shouting and banging down Kercher's door, Knox said. Knox worked at his bar and initially told police that Lumumba was present when Kercher was killed. When she later was told that her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher, was found dead, Knox said in Italian, "I was like, 'No, no, how can this be?' After her testimony Friday, Knox's father, Kurt Knox, said he thought his daughter did well on the stand and predicted that her innocence would become more apparent as the trial continues. Watch Knox take the stand » Knox is scheduled to resume testifying Saturday, when prosecutors plan to question her.
