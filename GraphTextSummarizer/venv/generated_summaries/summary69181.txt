But vaccine manufacturers say there is plenty of vaccine for those who want to get a flu shot. "We have completed production of this year's vaccine, and are confident supply of seasonal flu vaccine should cover demand," Dr. Leonard Friedland, who heads up medical affairs and clinical development for GSK Vaccines North America. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu vaccine makers produced about 135 million doses this year. According to Michael Szumera, SP's director of public relations, they've sold out of some versions of Fluzone, but the company has adult flu vaccine ready for immediate shipment. -- As the number of seasonal influenza cases continues to rise, reports of vaccine shortages in some locations are beginning to circulate.
