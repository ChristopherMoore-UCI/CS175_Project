"Initial results from the national polio laboratory in Damascus indicate that two of the cases could be positive for polio -- final results are awaited from the regional reference laboratory of the Eastern Mediterranean Region of WHO," it said. There is no cure for polio, but the vaccine -- given multiple times -- can protect for life. Syria's Ministry of Health "confirms that it is treating this event as a cluster of 'hot' AFP cases, pending final laboratory confirmation," and is planning an urgent, nationwide response, it said. -- The World Health Organization said Saturday it is investigating a possible outbreak of polio in Syria, where an ongoing civil war has decimated the public health infrastructure. The organization said it received reports Thursday of "a cluster of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases" in the country.
