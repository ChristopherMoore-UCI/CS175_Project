Survivor's attorney withdraws lawsuit Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school. "I think right now it has to be the safest school in America," added Monroe Police Lieutenant Keith White. For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school. They won't be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school. The school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at Sandy Hook to help ease the transition for students.
