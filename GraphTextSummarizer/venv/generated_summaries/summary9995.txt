Four former JONAH clients, who were teens when they signed up for help, filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against JONAH and two of its counselors Tuesday, saying they were defrauded by JONAH's claim that "being gay is a mental disorder" that could be reversed by conversion therapy -- "a position rejected by the American Psychiatric Association four decades ago," the lawsuit said. In an interview Thursday with the Family Research Council's Washington Watch Radio, Goldberg said he was optimistic that JONAH has "a very strong case and we should be able to emerge victorious." Goldberg promised Bruck that "JONAH could help him change his orientation from gay to straight," the suit said. Levin attended weekly sessions for 18 months at JONAH's Jersey City, New Jersey, headquarters conducted by Alan Downing, an unlicensed JONAH counselor who calls himself a "life coach," the suit said. JONAH co-director Arthur Goldberg said the position that people's sexual orientation can be changed by therapy is not contradicted by the latest statements from the American Psychiatric Association, but he did not give any examples.
