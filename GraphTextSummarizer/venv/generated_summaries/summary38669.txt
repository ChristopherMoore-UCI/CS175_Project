Trailing to Fernando Torres' strike, Atletico offered a brutal riposte with Adrian Lopez leveling before Diego Costa and Arda Turan applied the finishing touches. "It's a dream," Atletico midfielder Tiago told Sky Sports. To score three goals away from home in European competition is a marked achievement, but to do so against Chelsea, a team whose defense has been so miserly in the competition, is staggering. The dour goalless draw in the opening leg led to plenty of accusations that Chelsea had not attempted to win the game but simply stifle Atletico. Buoyed by the goal, Chelsea began to take control and with its resilient defense holding Atletico comfortably, the visitors appeared rattled.
