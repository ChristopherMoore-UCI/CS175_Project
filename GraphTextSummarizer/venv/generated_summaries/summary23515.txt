The first plume was found by Mississippi universities in early May. USF has concluded microscopic oil droplets are forming deep water oil plumes. "These hydrocarbons are from depth and not associated with sinking degraded oil but associated with the source of the Deep Horizon well head," said USF Chemical Oceanographer David Hollander. After a weeklong analysis of water samples, USF scientists found more oil in deeper water. Full coverage of oil spill BP has not commented on the latest development but in the past denied underwater oil plumes exist. " Scientists on board the university's research vessel Weatherbird II were not able to find the dissolved hydrocarbon or oil by sight.
