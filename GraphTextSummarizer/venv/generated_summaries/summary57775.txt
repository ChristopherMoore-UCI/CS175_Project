Revisit Melville's own experience as a summer tourist by checking into the Jared Coffin House -- called Ocean House when Melville stayed there -- for a bed and breakfast ($180-$560 in peak season). About 20 miles away in Monterey, stroll along Cannery Row to Steinbeck Plaza and absorb the atmosphere of this street -- called Ocean View Avenue until it was renamed for Steinbeck's book -- where Lee Chong, Mack and the others hatched their schemes. Its sunny vistas are in contrast with Steinbeck's characters and their harsh struggles, but several sites ensure that the ghost of Tom Joad is not forgotten. Unwind with a visit to Asimolar State Beach in Pacific Grove, where the Steinbeck family owned a summer cottage. Start, as Steinbeck did, in Salinas, where his birthplace and boyhood home on Central Avenue has been preserved as The Steinbeck House.
