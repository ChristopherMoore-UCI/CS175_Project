-- Federal regulators are asking Graco Children's Products why it is not including infant seats in a major recall of child car seats. The models involved: Cozy Cline, Comfort Sport, Classic Ride 50, My Ride 65, My Ride with Safety Surround, My Ride 70, Size 4 Me 70, Smartseat, Nautilus, Nautilus Elite, and Argos 70. But it declined the request to recall seven models that include rear-facing seats: Snugride, Snugride 30, Snugride 32, Infant Safe Seat-Step 1, Snugride 35, Tuetonia 35, and Snugride Click Connect 40. On Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration demanded more information. "They are uniquely designed to detach from their base for quick release if needed," the company said.
