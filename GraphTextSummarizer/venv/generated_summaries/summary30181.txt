As Taliban fighters headed with Bergdahl toward an agreed upon meeting point in Afghanistan, on the other side of the world Qataris officials were waiting for the five detainees to be released. There, in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, the heavily armed fighters turned Bergdahl over to U.S. military commandos. U.S. officials believe he was captured by the Taliban, but may have been held by the Haqqani Network, a terror group that operates along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. How the Qataris signaled to the Taliban that the detainees were in the custody is unclear, and administration officials have not detailed the communications. The negotiations began in earnest last week, with Qatar ferrying messages back and forth between U.S. officials and the Taliban.
