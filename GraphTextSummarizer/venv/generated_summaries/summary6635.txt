McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York, pointed out that veterans would need to prove they had experienced unacceptable waits for VA care, and that any private doctor treating them would have to first call the VA for authorization. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, and CNN's reporting uncovered the deaths of dozens of others who were waiting for VA care in Phoenix. " Dr. Robert Jesse, a top official in the VA health administration, also acknowledged the need for major changes after revelations first reported by CNN of sometimes deadly waits for medical care faced by veterans. Meanwhile, both the House and Senate have passed legislation to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at non-VA facilities at the government's expense. They include a hiring freeze at central headquarters and 21 regional facilities, suspension of all performance awards for senior managers in fiscal year 2014, eliminating an unattainable goal of getting newly enrolled veterans an appointment within 14 days, and ordering an independent outside audit of VA medical care scheduling practices across the system.
