Pegg stars as Gary, a pathetic screwup still living in the past who cons his four closest childhood pals (Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan) into returning to their quaint hometown after 20-odd years to reenact what he calls the best night of his life: an Odyssean 12-pub crawl ending at a watering hole named the World's End. -- Back in 2004, Edgar Wright's brilliantly subversive zombie comedy, "Shaun of the Dead," introduced American audiences to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.
