SI video on Manning and Luck Last week, Manning's father, former NFL quarterback Archie Manning, told two different radio shows that Luck and Peyton would not be able to play on the same team. If the Colts wanted to trade Manning, it would cost them $28 million, plus they would take a $38 million cap hit (NFL teams have a maximum amount to spend each year on player salaries and bonuses). Indianapolis fans would like to keep Manning for a couple of years and then transition to Luck. Let's say the Colts keep Manning for a year and then deal him: It's a $28 million cap hit, still enormous, leaving them short of cap money to surround Luck with talented players. If they get the first pick in the draft -- and they have a two-game lead on Minnesota and St. Louis with three games remaining -- they will be in position to pick Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck , by most accounts the best quarterback prospect to come out of college since Hall of Famer John Elway left Stanford and joined the Denver Broncos in 1983.
