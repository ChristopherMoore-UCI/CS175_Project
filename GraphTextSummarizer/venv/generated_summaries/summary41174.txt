Mardan is a main transit point for the large numbers of Pakistanis fleeing the Swat Valley, the site of fierce fighting between Taliban militants and Pakistani soldiers. Pakistani forces have targeted regional Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah and Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan, but have "no information about whether we have been successful," said the spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. Meanwhile, Pakistan's military said it was continuing the assault on Taliban militants. One Pakistani soldier was also killed in recent fighting, Abbas said. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced $110 million in humanitarian aid for Pakistani refugees.
