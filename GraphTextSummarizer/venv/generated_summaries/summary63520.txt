While MMA fighters might not bring in the reported millions per bout that heavyweight boxers such as Floyd Mayweather versus Victor Ortiz saw last month, how much they earn depends on who they are and what stage of their career they are in, Straka says. But those who watch Edgar defend his title against Maynard on Saturday will find that what they see is what they get, Straka says. "Frankie Edgar would never need to get another job if he retired tomorrow," Straka said. "It's the fastest-growing sport in the world," says Mike Straka, a long-time MMA journalist and broadcaster who now works in the fight industry. A lot of guys have mental exercises and visualizations -- but for me, this is what I do,'' said Edgar, who weighs 155 pounds and is 5-foot-6 and has what The New York Times calls a fighter's badge of honor: cauliflower ear.
