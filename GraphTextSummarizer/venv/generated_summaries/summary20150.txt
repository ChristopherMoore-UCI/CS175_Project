Michael Neal Harvey, 34, was arrested without incident by FBI agents and U.S. marshals in Niagara Falls, New York, on Monday morning in connection with the death of Valerie Hamilton, according to a statement issued by Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, police. Earlier Monday, Hamilton's father, Merl Hamilton, the chief of police of Concord, North Carolina, about 30 miles northeast of Charlotte, issued a tearful plea on "Good Morning America" for help locating the suspect. A stolen 1996 Chevy Blazer that police had said Harvey was last seen driving also was recovered in Niagara Falls, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said. Detectives from Charlotte were on the way to New York to interview Harvey and "work on the extradition process," the statement said. Valerie Hamilton, who lived in Charlotte, was last seen between 12:30 and 1:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Thomas Street Tavern in Charlotte with a man believed to be Harvey.
