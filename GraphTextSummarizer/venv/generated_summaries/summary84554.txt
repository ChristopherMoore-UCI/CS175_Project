But that's where the beauty ends because these striking flowers are water hyacinths -- an aquatic weed wreaking havoc in local communities and ruining water supplies. In 2013, the company was awarded a grant from the Federal Government of Nigeria allowing the small startup to grow and take seven full-time staff on board as well as provide work opportunities to local artisans during busy periods. "We want to see ourselves as the number one maker of eco-friendly handicrafts -- that are telling this very unique story about how we have transformed Nigeria's problem of water hyacinth into a beneficial solution." In addition to creating beautiful woven handicrafts, Idachaba wanted to offer local communities skills and potential business ideas. She adds: "And to build on that (to) become one of the major non-oil sector exporters of products from Nigeria."
