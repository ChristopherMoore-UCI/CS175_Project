But the goal of universal access to clean water is far from complete says Stef Smits, program officer for IRC International Water and Sanitation Center. "Lots of organizations do monitoring and that's great, but it tends to be a very slow process," said Keri Kugler, Water for People's senior manager of programmatic data. "Water sanitation is a harder goal to get to. It's an area which the U.N. concedes is "lagging far behind" the millennium commitments, with 2.5 billion people (including one billion children) still exposed to poor sanitation and one child dying every 20 seconds as a consequence, the U.N. estimates. Various countries are experimenting with mobile monitoring, which could play a vital role in solving long-term sanitation issues, IRC's Stef Smits says.
