An environmental surveyor from Lyons, Illinois, who was conducting tests at an industrial site in southwest Chicago found the remains Friday afternoon. Illinois State Police have named her husband, Drew Peterson, a suspect. Drew and Stacy Peterson have been married four years and have two children. The original mention of a blue container in a statement from Lyons, Illinois, police sparked interest because of the possible tie to Stacy Peterson, 23, who disappeared October 28. Chicago Police spokeswoman Monique Bond said on Saturday that  no blue barrel was found near the body.
