California state air regulators have taken strong steps to clean up the diesel truck fleet, but we are far from where we need to be -- diesel trucks, collectively, are still an enormous source of particulate pollution. Since the valley's population is growing, there are also more cars and trucks. The two biggest air pollution culprits are transportation sources such as cars and trucks and stationary sources such as oil refineries and industrial facilities. Just like ozone, fossil fuel combustion at power plants and by cars and trucks plays a major role in its production. A massive increase in public transit, hybrid and zero-emission cars and trucks is a sound solution to help alleviate this pollution.
