-- Nordic countries agreed to lend struggling Iceland $2.5 billion to help it recover from a series of crippling bank failures, bolstering a $2.1 billion aid package from the International Monetary Fund, their governments announced Thursday. "As a result,Iceland is facing a severe recession, given the high debt level in the economy and significant dependence of the private sector on foreign currency and inflation-indexed debt," John Lipsky, the IMF's acting chairman, said in a statement announcing the decision. Iceland sought IMF help after its government was forced to nationalize three banks to head off a complete collapse of its financial system. "We stand ready to assist Iceland in the spirit of continuous Nordic cooperation." Both moves are aimed at stabilizing Iceland's finances and shoring up its currency, which plummeted after a series of bank failures in October.
