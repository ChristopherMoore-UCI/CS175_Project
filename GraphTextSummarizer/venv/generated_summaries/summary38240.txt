After hitting bogeys in two of his first three holes, McIlroy didn't drop another shot and struck six birdies for a 66. While Woods struggled to find his best form, Rory McIlroy had another fine day and was the clubhouse leader late in the second round at 11-under-par 129, 11 shots better than Woods. The good news for Tiger Woods at the Honda Classic was that his second round was better than the first. Woods carded a 1-over 71 on Thursday in Palm Beach Gardens and improved by two shots Friday. The tough course was clearly taking its toll, as McIlroy was the lone member of the top eight in the world rankings to be inside the top 20 at the Honda Classic nearing the end of play Friday.
