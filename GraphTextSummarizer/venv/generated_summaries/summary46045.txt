This legislation is the next important step in the fight against women trafficking, said attorney Ori Keidar, one of the founders of the task force against the problem. " Keidar said the legislation is modeled after similar legislation in Sweden that has drastically reduced trafficking and prostitution. This 300-kilometer border was the main route for smuggling women into Israel, Keidar said. "The legislation against the prostitutes' customers will bring a reduction in the demand for prostitution and it will be a less lucrative business for crime organizations," Keidar said. "This legislation against the customers will bring a further reduction in trafficking and with a little more pressure we can make this go away" Keidar said.
