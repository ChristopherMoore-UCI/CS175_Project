The sweeping victory of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party in recent elections has been confirmed by state media. Suu Kyi, 66, led her party to a landslide victory the last time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990. A White House statement Monday congratulated Suu Kyi and the people of Myanmar, also known as Burma. Myanmar had invited election observers from ASEAN members as well as the United States and the European Union. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional organizations of which Myanmar is a member, on Tuesday called on other countries around the globe to lift sanctions on Myanmar following "the orderly, fair, transparent and peaceful manner" in which it said the elections had been conducted.
