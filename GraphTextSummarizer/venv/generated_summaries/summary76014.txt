"The people who are in Europe and America are concerned about Egypt, but what is (important) to remember is that rumors can be very damaging," Hawass wrote in a blog post Friday. But, Hawass wrote in a blog post on Saturday, "The two mummies that were reported as damaged at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo were in fact unidentified skulls dating to the Late Period; these two skulls are not royal mummies." Several Egyptologists told CNN in late January they were trying to stay on top of the situation as best they could and sift fact from rumor. "With 80 million people in a country that suffers from poverty and rising food prices ... you have to expect that some people are going to be desperate and look for any means necessary to try to improve their lot," Kara Cooney told CNN last month. On January 28, as the protests were under way, a group of people broke into the museum in Cairo, Hawass has said. The work, on artifacts from King Tutankhamun's tomb, includes restoring a statue -- broken by looters in the Egyptian Museum -- of King Tut on a panther, Zahi Hawass told CNN Sunday.
