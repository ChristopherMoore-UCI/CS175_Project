The first secretary of the U.S. Interests section of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran had been in an "indecent sexual relation" with an Iranian woman in his car, Iran's Press TV reported, citing Iranian police. Press TV said it had contacted the deputy head of the U.S. Interest Section in Tehran, Elizabeth Bucher, but she would not comment on the report. The United States and Iran have not had full diplomatic relations since the 1979 Islamic revolution. -- A Swiss diplomat was released from jail Thursday after being arrested on a sex charge, the Iranian media reported. The woman was "improperly dressed and in an obscene situation," Press TV said.
