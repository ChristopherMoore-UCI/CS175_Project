"It's become more difficult now to green light films; to be able to think of developing films," Nikhil Advani of People Tree Films who works as both a producer and a director told CNN. It's the new reality: Money that was gushing into the market from abroad to finance films a year and a half ago is now just trickling in. The strike is finally over, but money is still tight and this is affecting the number of films going into production. But a financial drama has arrived on the movie sets and production suites of India's largest city courtesy of the world economic downturn and a producer's strike -- fewer films are being made; less tickets are being sold and money is suddenly tight. "Is that a good thing or a bad thing?" says Advani of the changes the slowdown has forced on the way he produces upcoming films.
