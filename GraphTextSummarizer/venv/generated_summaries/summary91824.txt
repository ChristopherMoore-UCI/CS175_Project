The British ship HMS Daring arrived in Cebu on Sunday to provide medical assistance, emergency supplies and clean water to stranded victims, the UK government said. "HMS Daring's arrival is a major boost to DFID's disaster experts and medical teams already deployed in the Philippines," Britain's International Development Secretary Justine Greening said, referring to the Department for International Development. Nancy Lindborg, an assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, told CNN on Sunday the United States has been focused "on getting the logistics up, bringing in food, shelter and getting the water system back on tap." "It's chaotic, but every day, it's improving, going out to affected communities very quickly," said USAID official Ben Hemingway Sunday. As the days went by, thousands were scrounging for food, clean water and medical aid.
