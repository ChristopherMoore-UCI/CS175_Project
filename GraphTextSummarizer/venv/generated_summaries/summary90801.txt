Despite the fact that he says he worked for Noontide Press, a publishing outfit owned by arguably the most notorious Holocaust denier, he was never able to get his own anti-Semitic book published. The Anti-Defamation League just reported the fourth annual decline in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States, and 65 percent of whites and a record number of blacks, 59 percent, say race relations are good, according to a New York Times/CBS poll. That month Richard Poplawski, a 22-year-old with a history of both job failures and anti-Semitic conspiratorial Internet rants, was charged with gunning down and killing three Pittsburgh police officers during an ambush at his home. He is the editor of the recently published book: "Hate Crimes: Understanding and Defining Hate Crime" (Praeger, 2009) and was a 2004 Summer Seminar Scholar at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Years earlier, after his life began to unravel into fanaticism, he joined an anti-government and anti-Semitic movement called "The Freemen."
