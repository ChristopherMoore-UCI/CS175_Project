Iran has the biggest beef with Norwegian rats, Mohammad Hadi Heydarzadeh, a top environmental official, told CNN. He said the critters have "entered Iran from abroad by cargo ships." University researchers are working with the government to assess whether their newest plan of attack is working. Rats are reportedly running rampant in 26 districts in the capital. Though it's unclear if the rats come with paperwork, a search of ratbehavior.org shows that that particular kind of rat can grow 16 inches long.
