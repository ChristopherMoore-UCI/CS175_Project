He now stands accused of two felony counts of false imprisonment, four misdemeanor counts of battery and one misdemeanor count of sexual battery in the incident, spokesman Alex Bastian said. Garizabalo faces seven charges following the outrageous May 10 incident at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station, a spokesman for the San Francisco District Attorney's office said Monday. -- Here's hoping Yeiner Garizabalo wears more to court Tuesday than he did in a San Francisco subway station in May. Last week, police said Garizabalo had been arrested, given a mental evaluation, charged with battery and released. A judge set Garizabalo's bail at $100,000 after he was re-arrested Monday.
