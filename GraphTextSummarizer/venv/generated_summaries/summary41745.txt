News of the ban comes on the heels of the limited release of "The Interview," the movie that provoked North Korea to vow "merciless" action against the United States  over its lampooning of leader Kim Jong Un. In 1956, the same biblical story was told in "The Ten Commandments" starring Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Ramses.

Australian actor Joel Hedgerton plays the Pharaoh Ramses in the 20th Century Fox production.
