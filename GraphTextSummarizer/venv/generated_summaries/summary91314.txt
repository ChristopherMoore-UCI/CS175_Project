Wenk said bears have been very visible to park visitors this year but that park officials rely on reports from hikers to determine how many bears are in the back country of the park. Wenk advised visitors to familiarize themselves with bear safety and protocol before they begin hiking. The grizzly bear that attacked and killed a man in Yellowstone National Park acted in defense, park officials said on Thursday, adding that they have no plans to kill the bear. There are more than 600 bears in Yellowstone ecosystem, according to park officials. A warning sign was posted at the head of the trail because of known bear activity along access points.
