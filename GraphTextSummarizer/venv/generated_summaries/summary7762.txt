Four people belonging to a group that received training in Belgorod, Russia, have been arrested, Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov of Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said on his website. Police officers are among the two dead and 15 wounded after an explosion during a peaceful protest in the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Sunday. Sunday's attack came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, appearing in London, blasted Russia for its "land-grabbing in Ukraine" and threatened additional sanctions. The explosion is a suspected terrorist act, said Anatoly Dmitriev, head of the Kharkiv region of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Moscow has repeatedly denied that it is arming separatists and sending its own troops over the border, but Kerry said satellites and other technology show it's "no secret" what is happening in Ukraine.
