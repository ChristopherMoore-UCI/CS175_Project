What those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everyone wants: in the words of Sigmund Freud, to work and to love. Steve, a lawyer and psychologist, has worked with many patients who suffer from severe mental illness. And that's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing. Second, I have many family members and close friends who know me and who know my illness. Despite my diagnosis with schizophrenia and my "grave prognosis" -- that I would live in a board and care facility and work at a menial job at best -- I am a chaired professor of law at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, with a beloved husband, Will, and many good friends.
