The latest fatalities occurred in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces -- both in eastern China -- and brought the total number of deaths from H7N9 avian influenza to nine, from 28 reported cases, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. "At this point, there is no evidence of sustained human to human transmission," said WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl, in quotes carried by Xinhua. -- Two more people have died from a rare strain of bird flu in China, as health officials investigate possible cases of transmission between family members. Other cities across China have announced plans to suspend trading in live birds. Authorities in the city of Nanjing took this a step further by announcing a ban on the trading of livestock and live poultry would come into effect from midnight on Tuesday, according to a statement from the Nanjing Urban Management Bureau -- though the WHO says no positive samples of the H7N9 virus have been found in pigs or farms in China so far.
