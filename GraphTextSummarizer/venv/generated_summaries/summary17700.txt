Ultimately, I suspect that with this information out there, many Americans will come to believe that these programs have reasonable safeguards for our civil liberties. National security laws must protect national security. Last month, when Edward Snowden began leaking highly classified documents to the press, many Americans were shocked by what they read. It's hard to have that debate around secret programs authorized by secret legal opinions issued by a secret court. Based on briefings, I believe these programs protect our country and have saved lives and have reasonable safeguards in place to protect Americans' privacy.
