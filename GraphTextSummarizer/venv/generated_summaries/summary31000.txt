Curtis Lopez, 45, was arrested Thursday morning in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a warrant was issued, said Chief Tom Manger of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police. "Our focus and our priority now is locating William McQuain," Manger told reporters Thursday. Jane McQuain was probably dead for 10 to 12 days before police found her, Manger said. "We were hoping that we would find (William) with Mr. Lopez and we did not, so we are asking for the public's help in locating 11-year-old William McQuain," Manger said. When detectives arrived at the woman's home in Germantown, they found Jane McQuain, 51, dead in her bedroom with evidence of trauma to her upper body, Manger said.
