Sergio Berensztein, a professor at Torcuato Di Tella University in Argentina, said the outcome of the power struggle between Redrado and Fernandez de Kirchner could set a precedent of how Argentina deals with increasing government expenditures in the face of low government revenue. "The most important thing here is that there is a overstepping by the executive, in violation of central bank autonomy," he said. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's decree on Thursday removed Central Bank President Martin Redrado from his post for "misconduct and dereliction of duty by a public servant," the state-run Telam news agency reported. -- Argentina's central bank president was removed from his post by presidential decree, a possible final blow in a political standoff between the banker and the executive. However, Berensztein told CNN en Espa√±ol that decisions to draw money from the central bank must come from congress, rather than presidential decree.
