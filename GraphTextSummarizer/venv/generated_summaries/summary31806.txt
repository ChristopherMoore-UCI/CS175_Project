Although the killing occurred in Colombia, the lawsuit argues that U.S. federal laws -- including the Alien Tort Statute and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- give American courts jurisdiction in the case. He alleges that their actions violated Florida racketeering statutes and U.S. federal laws, and that Colombian laws hold the rebel groups liable for wrongful death. The U.S. National Couterterrorism Center describes the FARC as "Latin America's oldest, largest, most capable, and best-equipped insurgency of Marxist origin" and notes that it has "well-documented ties to a range of drug trafficking activities" Tactics include "bombings, murder, mortar attacks, kidnapping, extortion, and hijacking, as well as guerrilla and conventional military action against Colombian political, military, and economic targets," the center says. This isn't the first time Colombian rebels have been tied to lawsuits in the United States. He filed a lawsuit in a Florida court this month, 13 years after the bullet-riddled body of his father -- a former senator and U.N. ambassador -- was found on a dirt road in northern Colombia.
