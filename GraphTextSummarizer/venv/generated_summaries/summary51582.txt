Instead, it is rooted in an internal church report on child protection practices in his Cloyne diocese in southern Ireland. Magee did not resign, but he was effectively stripped of his authority in March 2009, when Archbishop Dermot Clifford of the neighboring diocese of Cashel and Emly was appointed "apostolic administrator" of Cloyne diocese. In the past five years, Ireland's Catholic Church has had three separate outside investigations into child abuse -- both sexual and physical -- by priests, nuns, and staff at Catholic-run institutions such as schools and orphanages. It found those to be "inadequate, and in some respects dangerous" in Cloyne diocese. The Murphy Commission -- which produced the report into the Dublin archdiocese -- is now investigating Cloyne diocese, McGarry said.
