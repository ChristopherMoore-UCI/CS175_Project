"The accusations regarding Cardinal Domenico Calcagno when he was Bishop of Savona in Italy were investigated by both the Church and by the legal system, by the judge, and the accusations were without foundation. When he was an 11-year-old altar boy in 1981 at the Santissime Anunziate church in the town of Spotorno, Zanardi says he was raped by Father Nello Giraudo at least once a week for 5 years. Zanardi clutches a red case, emblazoned with a picture of Domenico Calcagno -- one of the cardinals who will elect a new pope in the conclave this week -- across it are the words, "Fuori Dal Conclave" or "Out of the Conclave. On 8th September 2003, Calcagno, who was at the time the Bishop of Savona, wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger who was then the Vatican's enforcer of church doctrine and responsible for investigations into the sexual abuse of minors by clergy. Despite incontrovertible evidence against Giraudo, Calcagno didn't kick the pedophile priest out of the church.
