The 3-year-old dog, a Belgian Malinois named Spartacus, was found dead Monday night inside the K-9 handler's car, which was parked outside his home, Brittany Duncan, a Woodstock Police Department spokeswoman, said in a written statement. A police dog died of heat stroke after being left in a patrol car in Woodstock, Georgia, authorities said Tuesday. "After the retirement of his first police K-9, who is now a family pet living with the K-9 handler, the handler is devastated by the loss of his second police K-9," Duncan said. The police department did not publicly identify Spartacus' handler, describing him only as a 9-year police veteran who has worked as a K-9 handler for seven of those years. A memorial service for Spartacus will be announced at a later date, Duncan said.
