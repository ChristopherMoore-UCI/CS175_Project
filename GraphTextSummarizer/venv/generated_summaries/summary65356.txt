Syrian dissidents have said Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese Shiite militia backed by Iran and the Syrian government, has sent fighters to the conflict. Hezbollah recently teamed with government forces during a pitched battle for the Syrian town of the border city of Qusayr, members of the Syrian opposition said. Ahmed Assad, who heads the Option party -- which opposes Hezbollah and the Syrian government -- told reporters one man from his group was shot in the stomach and died. The Lebanese government has remained officially neutral in the conflict -- even as it has firmly, but quietly, supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. CNN staffers saw a heavy presence of Lebanese security forces outside the embassy.
