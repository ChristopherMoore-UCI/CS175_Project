"Let's answer their call to keep fighting for voting rights, civil rights, & human rights." Clinton mentioned the anniversary on stage, tying the marches and event into her work toward leveling the playing field for women and girls. Clinton did not go to Selma, instead opting to attend her Clinton Foundation event in Florida. " While Obama commented on the issue Saturday, Clinton didn't mention it during an 18-minute appearance on stage at a Clinton Global Initiative event at the University of Miami. "So whether it's women's rights or human rights, civil rights or LGBT rights, we're counting on all of you to lead the way, and that's what the no-ceilings initiative at the Clinton Foundation is really all about." Instead, Clinton's remarks to about 1,000 students focused on the foundation's work, including a new report she will roll out Monday about the underrepresentation of women and girls.
