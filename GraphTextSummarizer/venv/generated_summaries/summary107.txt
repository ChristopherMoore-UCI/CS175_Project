The rabbi was discovered as part of an FBI undercover investigation, "Operation Bid Rig," which made news in July 2009 when 44 civic leaders and public officials were arrested on the same morning for public corruption and money laundering. Kassin admitted in federal court that he accepted bank checks in exchange for checks of a lesser value from a charity he operated and controlled, the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey said. Prosecutors said Kassin operated an unlicensed money transmitting business in his home from mid-2007 through 2008. On Monday, he pleaded guilty Monday to illegal cash transmission -- a lesser charge than the original complaint of money laundering, his lawyer Gerald Shargel said. Using the bank account he controlled for the Magen Israel Society charitable organization, Kassin accepted checks, deducted a 10% commission and then issued the difference to other organizations, authorities said.
