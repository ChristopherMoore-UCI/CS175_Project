" Fowle is one of three Americans detained in North Korea, including Matthew Todd Miller, who was taken into custody on April 10, according to KCNA and Korean-American missionary, Kenneth Bae, who has been sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2013. -- The family of Jeffrey Edward Fowle, an American tourist detained in North Korea for apparently breaking an unspecified law, has apologized to the reclusive state and asked for his release. In previous cases of arrested Americans in North Korea, visits by U.S. former heads of state helped secure their return. In the interview, Fowle apologized to both the United States and North Korea. Tepe said the family has received one phone call and one letter from him in North Korea.
