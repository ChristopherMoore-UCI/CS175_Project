-- Manny Pacquiao became the fifth boxer to win major world titles in five different weight divisions after demolishing WBO welterweight champion Miguel Cotto in Las Vegas on Saturday night. Pacquiao was rated as favorite by Las Vegas oddsmakers, but Cotto -- who has held a world title every year since 2004 -- had just one defeat in 35 fights with 27 knockouts going into the bout. The Filipino, dubbed "Pac Man", stopped the Puerto Rican in the 12th and final round to boost his claims to be known as the world's best pound-for-pound fighter with a victory in his seventh weight category -- his Ring Magazine and IBO crowns are not universally recognized. It was Pacquiao's first fight since a stunning knockout of Britain's Ricky Hatton sixth months ago at the same venue, having convincingly defeated the legendary Oscar De La Hoya in his previous outing. Cotto weighed in at 145 pounds in front a 5,000 strong crowd at the MGM Grand Arena, with Pacquiao tipping the scales at 144 pounds.
