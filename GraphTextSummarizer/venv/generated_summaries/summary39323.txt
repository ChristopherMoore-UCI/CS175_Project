Whooping cranes were nearly hunted into extinction, and left homeless as their natural environment was systematically eliminated by short-sighted Homo sapiens. Dr. French was very clear about why he does what he does - he believes the whooping crane has as much right to exist as we do. In fact, I was genuinely impressed with Dr. French and his team, and glad to give their program some national exposure. If you watch the episode again, (assuming I'm still on probation,) I think you'll see that we tried to focus on the human elements -- the simple joy that Dr. French and his team take in their work, and the passion they bring to their job each and every day.
