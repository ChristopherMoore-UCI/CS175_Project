But if you listened to the former Real Madrid and Inter coach opine on the English Premier League title race last season, his side was never in the running. Promising Premier League campaigns have frittered away and shots at silverware squandered. Chelsea may have finished third last season, but Mourinho's tactical prowess was still in evidence. That is precisely what happened in the top flight last season. Eight new arrivals means Liverpool's options are now rich and plentiful but, as Tottenham found out so painfully when trying to replace Gareth Bale last season, it is rare they all hit the ground running.
