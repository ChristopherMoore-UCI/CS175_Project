It's part of an update to security measures aimed at combating potential new threats from terrorists in the Middle East and Europe. The TSA also would have to coordinate with the foreign governments which provide security at airports in their countries, along with the airlines and private security companies. The Transportation Security Administration said Sunday that security screeners at overseas airports may ask U.S.-bound passengers to turn on their electronic devices to prove they work and aren't explosive devices. A homeland security official said last week that the changes would primarily focus on airports in Europe and the Middle East. While there was no specific threat prompting the enhancements, U.S. officials are concerned about the possibility that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula might develop bombs which could pass through current security measures undetected.
