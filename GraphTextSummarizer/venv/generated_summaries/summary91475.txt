-- Faced with a loud and angry backlash from some of its most active users, photo-sharing app Instagram backtracked Tuesday on new language that appeared to give the company ownership of their images. "Instagram users own their content and Instagram does not claim any ownership rights over your photos," he wrote. Instaport, a tool that lets users export and and download their Instagram images, was reporting overtaxed servers Tuesday morning. But the language that upset some of the app's more than 100 million users said that "a business or other entity may pay" Instagram for the use of user images and may do so "without any compensation to you." He shared his thoughts Tuesday on Instagram, where he was posting blank black squares instead of his usual artful black-and-white images.
