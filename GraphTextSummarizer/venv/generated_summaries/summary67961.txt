I saw the qualities Chelsea have, and I was very happy with Jose Mourinho before, so when the opportunity came, I was very happy to take it." Eto'o's career took off when he joined Spanish giants Barcelona in 2004, as he won three league titles and lifted the Champions League twice. German international Andre Schurrle, Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, Croatia striker Stipe Perica and Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel have all arrived, leaving Mourinho with a wealth of options. Eto'o is the latest in a line of high profile signings Chelsea have made since Mourinho returned to the club. The Cameroon striker will get his first taste of the English Premier League at the age of 32 after joining Chelsea from Anzhi Makhachkala. Now Eto'o has followed the Brazilian to London in a move which means Wayne Rooney's much-touted switch to Stamford Bridge from English champions Manchester United looks increasingly unlikely.
