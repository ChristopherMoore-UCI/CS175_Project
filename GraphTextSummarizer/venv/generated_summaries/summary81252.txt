Earlier this year, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a detailed 400-page report documenting abuses, which it submitted to the International Criminal Court for review along with recommendation that North Korean officials face prosecution. Following the release of the report, Michael Kirby, the committee's chairman, told reporters: "The suffering and tears of the people of North Korea demand action." Last month, a United Nations committee approved a draft resolution recommending the International Criminal Court take action against North Korea over a slew of human rights abuses. This was demonstrated recently when North Korea demanded Sony Pictures stop the release of the upcoming movie "The Interview," a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, whose characters are tasked by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. The North Korean government has also called out the U.S. government for what they see as hypocrisy when it comes to human rights abuses -- particularly in light of a new report released by the Senate on Tuesday, which details how the CIA tortured terror detainees.
