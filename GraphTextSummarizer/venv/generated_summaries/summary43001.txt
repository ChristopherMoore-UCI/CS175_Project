Australian airline Qantas grounded all its aircraft Saturday in response to a labor dispute, in a step that will disrupt travel for thousands of people. The Transport Workers Union of Australia said in on online statement: "Today's unwarranted and disgraceful snap announcement by Qantas CEO Alan Joyce is designed to destroy Qantas as we have always known it." Speaking at a news conference in Sydney, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said it was a hard decision to ground the fleet but that the airline had been left with no alternative in the face of the unions' "extreme claim. Customers booked on Qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice, the airline said. Flights with subsidiaries Jetstar and QantasLink, as well as Qantas flights across the Tasman Sea operated by Jetconnect and freight services, are not affected by the grounding, it said.
