The interiors around me are examples of the best in Japanese craftsmanship: walls are of rosewood and maple, floors are made from walnut, window coverings are shoji paper screens, sliding glass doors are etched with flowers and birds. Luxuriating in my own floating world,  contemplating the evening light filtering through the trees, it is easy to see the sense in this change of scene away from the Seven Stars: the proper savoring of hot springs is a very Japanese experience, and not one that should be curtailed by the timetable of even the most handsome of trains. And on the table in front of me is a selection of amuse-bouches either wrapped in leaves, or served on delicate porcelain or in bamboo boxes; mouthfuls of locally-sourced beef, wood-smoked fish, pungent sea urchin, plus of course fugu -- the fish that needs to be cooked by a highly trained and licensed chef, or you're dead. Volcanoes and hot springs Part of the train's purpose is to "introduce Kyushu to the world," according to the Seven Stars company, because Japan's third largest island is not a first-timer's destination. But now Japan Rail Kyushu have invested big money -- over $34 million -- into a special train with the deliberate aim of going slow.
