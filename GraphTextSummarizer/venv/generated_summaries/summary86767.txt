The U.N. mission in Haiti credited access to clean water and free medical facilities for preventing feared outbreaks of cholera and tuberculosis. During epidemics, the source of the contamination is often the feces of an infected person, and infections can spread rapidly in areas where there is poor sewage treatment and a lack of clean drinking water. People lined roadsides in and around villages with  buckets, hoping that passersby might have clean water, said Eric Lotz, Haiti's  national director for the nonprofit Operation Blessing. The group has already prepositioned 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and are distributing water purification kits in affected areas. Ian Rawson, director of Hospital Albert Schweitzer Haiti near Verrettes, said patients began showing cholera-like symptoms on October 16.
