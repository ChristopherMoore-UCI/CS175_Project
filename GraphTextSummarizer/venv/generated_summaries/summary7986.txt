Pakistan is a strategic country in the war on terrorism, and analysts say the United States cannot afford to let a lack of Western aid increase the impact of charities associated with militant groups. On Wednesday, the head of USAID, Dr. Rajiv Shah, went to Sukkur, Pakistan, to get a firsthand look at the needs of the flood survivors and how aid is being distributed. At no time during his visit did Dr. Shah encounter or meet with any members of a banned extremist organization." With millions more new aid coming into the country because of the flooding, it is insisting the government be transparent about how aid money from around the world is being spent. Inside the camp, aid was being distributed in big bags from USAID.
