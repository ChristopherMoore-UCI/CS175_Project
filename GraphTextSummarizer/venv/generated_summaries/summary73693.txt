"I think it's important for us to understand that we can compete with big teams at their stadiums," said Klinsmann, whose team recorded a historic first win in Italy earlier this year and next face two World Cup qualifiers against Jamaica in September. Mexico beat the U.S. 4-2 in last year's Gold Cup final in Pasadena, after which former Germany international Klinsmann replaced Bob Bradley as coach. "I think it's huge," head coach Jurgen Klinsmann told U.S. Soccer's official website. Former World Cup winner Didier Deschamps began his reign as France coach with a 0-0 draw against 2010 semifinalists Uruguay, while Vicente del Bosque's Spain earned a 2-1 win in Puerto Rico. The Barcelona forward failed to convert a first-half spot kick after Germany goalkeeper Ron Robert Zieler had been sent off for hauling down Jose Ernesto Sosa.
