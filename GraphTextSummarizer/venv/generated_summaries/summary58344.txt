Double amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius has moved a step closer to realizing his dream of participating in the Olympics after running the 'B' standard qualifying time for next year's Games in London. Ran a 45.61sec 400m Olympic qualifying time and fastest time in South Africa," Pistorius, whose legs were amputated when he was just 11 months old, wrote. Should he make it to London 2012, Pistorius would become the first amputee sprinter to compete in an Olympics. Dubbed the 'Blade Runner' because of his carbon fiber prosthetic limbs, Pistorius must now run 0.6 seconds faster to be granted automatic qualification. The 24-year-old, who was born without fibulae in both legs, clocked 45.61 seconds to win the 400m race at the Provincial Championships in his home town of Pretoria in South Africa on Wednesday.
