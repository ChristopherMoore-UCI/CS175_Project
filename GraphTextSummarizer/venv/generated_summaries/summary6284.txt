Sitting in a dark, abandoned sports complex with the constant crack of gunshots and the cries of angry protesters ringing in his head, Mounir Benzegala decided he had to leave the bloodshed in Libya once and for all. "There's so many details I just can't get into until I get home and feel safe, but at least I've made it this far," said Benzegala, who had come to Libya only three weeks ago to play on a government-run team backed by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's son, Saif. They and other Americans who have fled Libya's descent into chaos have harrowing tales of escaping the carnage. They were not allowing anyone else in," said Franz Fearnley, who had been working on a land development project in Libya for the previous month. On board the ferry, Benzegala said people stretched out on the floors to sleep, feeling safe at last.
