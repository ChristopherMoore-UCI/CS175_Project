-- A French politician said Monday that International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is facing sexual assault charges in New York, attacked her daughter in 2002. However, in light of the charges against Strauss-Kahn after an alleged incident at a Sofitel hotel in New York on Saturday, Banon's attorney in France, David Koubbi, said he and the young woman are considering whether to file a complaint. CNN does not typically name assault victims, but Mansouret said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed. Banon went to the address, where Strauss-Kahn then locked the door to the room they were in, took her hand and grabbed her arm, according to Mansouret. Mansouret told CNN her daughter had asked to interview Strauss-Kahn, and met him in his office in the National Assembly.
