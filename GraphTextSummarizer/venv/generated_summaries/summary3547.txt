-- Firefighters in northern Colorado face another round of nightmare conditions on Monday as high temperatures, low relative humidity and gusty winds whip a blaze near Fort Collins. Red flag warnings are posted across 10 states, warning of high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures. "It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage," said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who oversees the Forest Service and toured the Colorado blaze. The High Park Fire is west of Fort Collins, has destroyed at least 181 homes, according to a statement posted on InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. It's scary," resident Lupe Sandoval told CNN affiliate KUSA TV.
