"What Ms. Hilton is seeking here is for the court to make sure that Zsa Zsa's best interests are not being sacrificed for the selfish interests of anyone involved in Zsa Zsa's life," said Hilton lawyer Kenneth Kossoff. Hilton and von Anhalt have publicly battled for several years over Gabor's finances and her access to her mother. -- The judge who oversees Britney Spears' conservatorship will consider a request to appoint a conservator to oversee Zsa Zsa Gabor's finances and medical care. "Anything that's contesting Frederic's devotion to his wife or his ability to take care of his wife is ridiculous," Lee said The petition questions why von Anhalt recently borrowed $700,000 on Gabor's $10 million Bel Air mansion, while the house reportedly is in foreclosure after several missed mortgage payments. Hilton contends that Gabor's ninth husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, is keeping her "increasingly isolated" and "heavily sedated," and she questions his handling of Gabor's finances.
