Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda, has launched a series of attacks in Kenya since its forces went into neighboring Somalia in 2011 to battle the extremists. Days before the bus attack, police raided multiple mosques in the port city of Mombasa after they found explosives in one. The bodies of the victims were taken to Nairobi, where the Kenya Red Cross will provide assistance to victims' relatives and survivors of the attack, said the organization's secretary general, Abbas Gullet. Islamist militants ambushed a bus in Kenya on Saturday and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite Quran verses, killing at least 28 people, authorities said. The searches this week prompted clashes with Muslim youths in the city, Kenya's second-largest.
