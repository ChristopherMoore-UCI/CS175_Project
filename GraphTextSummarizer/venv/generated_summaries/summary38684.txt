Called "Float," it gives Beijing residents the tools to measure air quality for themselves with pollution-sensing kites. U.S. readings challenge China's smog claims Though Wu did not name any countries in particular, it was seen as throw-down directed at America's diplomatic missions which post hourly air quality readings via Twitter for Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. But Float has untethered China's official grip on air quality data with its high-flying sensors. Air quality levels are displayed through LED lights that change in color -- from hot pink (which represents the worst air quality) to green (which signifies the best). The team writes: "Urban air quality is a serious issue that affects rapidly industrializing cities globally, and within Beijing as the capital of China, it is an issue kept quiet by the government under fear of criticism and protest from the public."
