Rosenkrantz wore 3-D printed jewellery for weeks at a time in an attempt to catch design features that chafe. Rosenkrantz brought an old-school tailor's approach to the project, but was happy to leverage modern technology. Nervous System figured out how to print bracelets on MakerBots by reducing dimensional designs to flat pieces of plastic that could be printed in under an hour and folded like origami. After two days of printing at Shapeways, a dusty boulder of plastic emerges from an industrial-sized 3-D printer. "We've been working with Nervous and our community over the years to push the machines to their limits," says Carine Carmy of Shapeways.
