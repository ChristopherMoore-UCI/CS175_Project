Even as she grew more recognizable thanks to Disney's marketing prowess, Gomez was never solely definable by the series -- there were departures for albums with her band, Selena Gomez & the Scene, and movies like 2011's "Monte Carlo." Gomez, now 21, has long shed the role that made her famous with younger crowds, that of Alex Russo on the Disney Channel's "Wizards of Waverly Place." But even with those efforts, Gomez began 2013 with a still-intact image as a young adult star. It's a delicate and practically impossible balance, a tightrope that Bieber, his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez, and some cohorts like Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande have all walked this year to varying degrees of success. She did that not with the usual scandals but with a No. 1 album that gained her entr√©e to larger platforms, such as a performance at the 2013 American Music Awards that earned praise from the likes of Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson.
