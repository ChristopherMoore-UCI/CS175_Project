"Under the terms of the lease, Con Edison requested payment of outstanding rent, but to date, tenant has not yet made the required payment." -- Lower Manhattan's controversial Park51 Islamic center is now in a court battle with utility Consolidated Edison, which says the center owes it $1.7 million in a dispute over back rent. According to court documents, Park51 has exercised an option to purchase the Con Edison portion of the site for $10.7 million. In September, Con Edison demanded the $1.7 million it said it was owed. In court papers, Park51 says it owes Con Edison only $881,000 and calls the utility's demand "grossly inflated."
