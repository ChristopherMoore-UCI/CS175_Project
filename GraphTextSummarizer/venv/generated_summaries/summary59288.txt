Captain Keita's 84th minute goal sealed victory for Mali in their opening game and broke a run of three draws at the tournament to determine the continent's best team. The Copper Bullets beat tournament favorites Ivory Coast in a dramatic penalty shoot-out in Libreville, Gabon last February. With the match seemingly heading for a stalemate, just like the opening two matches of the competition on Saturday, Keita capitalized on a mistake by Niger goalkeeper Daouda Kassaly to find the net. -- Former Barcelona star Seydou Keita grabbed the only goal of the game as Mali beat Niger to become the first winners at the Africa Cup of Nations. In a game Mali dominated Keita, who now plays his club football in China, hit the crossbar seven minutes before his goal as the team who finished third in last year's competition ground out a valuable victory.
