Several students and their families had sued, saying that the rented venue "coerces" religious activity and that all Christian symbols and imagery should have been removed to make it fit for public, secular events. They had contracted with a local "megachurch" to hold the events there, for what officials termed "secular convenience." The case is Elmbrook School District v. Doe (12-755). Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say they wanted the court to decide the matter. -- The Supreme Court on Monday declined to get involved in a dispute over a public high school's efforts to hold its student graduation ceremonies in a church.
