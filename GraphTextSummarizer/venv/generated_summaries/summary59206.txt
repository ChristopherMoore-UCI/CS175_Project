To help you get started, we reviewed titles publishing in September and October with the help of numerous sources (Kirkus, School Library Journal, Booklist, Publishers Weekly, Book Riot and Upcoming Books Blog) and came up our top picks. The Young Adult Book Blog Directory (organized by name) • New York Times • New Adult fiction releases (listed on Goodreads) • YALSA (Young Adult Library Services Association) • There are tons of options to consider, including R.L. Stine's return to Fear Street, the latest from "Pretty Little Liars" author Sara Shepard and Carl Hiaasen's first book for teens. We chose a mix of debut authors, anticipated continuations of popular series and new titles from fan-favorite authors. There's a wealth of diverse authors, topics and subgenres available this fall, and our list only scrapes the surface.
