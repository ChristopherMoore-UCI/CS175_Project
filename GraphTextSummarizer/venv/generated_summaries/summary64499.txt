-- U.S. Defense Department officials debated how to dispose of more than 1,000 fragments that could have included human remains from the September 11 attack on the Pentagon before they ended up in a Delaware landfill, according to newly released internal documents. In a 2002 e-mail discussion among Defense Department officials, one official identified in the redacted documents as a colonel suggests scattering the material at sea. "That was at the heart of the debate first because we did not know whether these were human remains to begin with," said Jo Ann Rooney, acting under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness. The material is referred to in the documents as "Group F" and "special." Officials at the Pentagon explained that this group included material that was biological in nature, but it could not be determined that it was human or whether any terrorist remains were mixed in. Another official, however, expressed concern that an at-sea disposal might "send a message to the next of kin that we are disposing human remains, and that is not the case."
