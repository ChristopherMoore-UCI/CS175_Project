I'm proud to note that this year's nominees represent some of the highest-quality stories we've honored yet, and I look forward to continuing the tradition of celebrating standout citizen journalism in years to come. Journalism has been forever changed -- I'd argue for the better -- thanks to the fact that people can interact with media organizations and share their opinions, personal stories, and photos and videos of news as it happens. This year's nominated iReports are prime examples of how participatory storytelling can positively affect the way we cover and understand the news. This year, for the first time ever, we'll also honor examples of standout citizen journalism and participatory storytelling that happened outside of iReport in a special section we're calling Excellence on the Web. Finding and curating notable stories is an essential component of iReport's success.
