By this time, Swearingen had graduated from high school and was attending Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida. It was part of an experiment in his marine science class at Florida's Melbourne High School that started 16 months ago. A teenager in Ireland recently found the bottle and message he tossed off the Florida coast last year. Swearingen says 17-year-old Adam Flannery and his father made the discovery. The note directed the pair to contact science teacher Ethan Hall, which they did.
