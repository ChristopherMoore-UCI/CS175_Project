New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), said in a statement that the ship has sustained "some damage from current movement and there is a significant amount of oil leaking from the vessel." " New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said two inquiries had been launched into the incident to discover how the ship hit the reef. Efforts to recover oil from the grounded ship, now heading south down the coast, are being hampered by high winds and strong swells. A rescue center has been set up in the city of Tauranga to clean oil from animals affected by the spill and MNZ has 12 teams working to assist oiled wildlife. "This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea," the organization's Steve Abel said.
