"Dr. Koop did more than take care of his individual patients -- he taught all of us about critical health issues that affect our larger society," said Dartmouth President Carol L. Folt. "The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia will be forever indebted to Dr. Koop for the imprint he left upon the institution and upon all of pediatric health care. In 1991, Koop won an Emmy for a five-part series on health care reform, Dartmouth said. "Dr. Koop was not only a pioneering pediatric surgeon but also one of the most courageous and passionate public health advocates of the past century," said Wiley W. Souba, dean of the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. -- Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a pediatric surgeon turned public health advocate, died Monday.
