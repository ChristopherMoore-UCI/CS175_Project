Belief Blog: Islam doesn't justify 'honor murders,' experts insist "While we found the main demographic in support of HKA (honor killing attitudes) to be boys in traditional families with low levels of education, we noted substantial minorities of girls, well-educated and even irreligious teenagers who consider honor killing morally right, suggesting a persisting society-wide support for the tradition," said Eisner. Exclusive: How my brother tried to kill me in 'honor attack' A key finding was that support for honor crimes was not connected to religious beliefs, but is far more likely in adolescent boys with low education backgrounds from traditional families. It found that attitudes in support of honor murders "are anchored in a broader system of beliefs about patriarchal authority and dominance, and assumptions about female virginity and chastity." The researchers say their study is one of the first to attempt to gauge cultural attitudes about honor murders in the region. Teenagers who had a large number of siblings were more likely to condone honor killings than those from smaller families, the study found.
