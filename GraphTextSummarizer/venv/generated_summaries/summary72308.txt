Research from Western Illinois University showed a link between the number of Facebook friends you have and how active you are on the site to the likelihood of being a "socially disruptive" narcissist. "Facebook gives those with narcissistic tendencies the opportunity to exploit the site to get the feedback they need and become the center of attention. "People who have a heightened need to feel good about themselves will often turn to Facebook as a way to do so," study author Chris Carpenter from Western Illinois University told Mashable. Do you have tons of Facebook friends and often update your status? Those with more Facebook friends, who tagged themselves in photos and updated their status throughout the day were more likely to have narcissistic traits.
