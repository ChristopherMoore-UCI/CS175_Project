Holmes is facing 152 charges, including murder and attempted murder. The notion that Holmes was blocked from campus is incongruous with the university's statements that he was denied access to non-public portions of the campus because he had withdrawn from classes. It's unclear who the threatened person was, but prosecutors have said it was a professor at the University of Colorado campus where shooting suspect James Holmes used to take graduate classes. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. In an unusual move, the judge will allow the defense team to go against a standing gag order and release a public statement responding to the prosecution's depiction that Holmes was blocked from campus.
