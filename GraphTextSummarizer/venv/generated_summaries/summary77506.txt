In Thursday's other game in Group C, Croatia fought back to hold Italy to a 1-1 draw. After Balotelli has been fouled 22 yards from goal, Pirlo stepped up to curl a wonderful free-kick over the wall, beating Croatia goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa at his near post. Italy's star performer was veteran midfielder Pirlo, who was at the heart of his side's fluent passing game and gave them a deserved lead on 33 minutes. Croatia 1-1 Italy Mario Mandzukic's third goal of Euro 2012 secured a precious point for Croatia as Italy let a lead slip for the second successive time in the tournament. Cesare Prandelli's side will now go into their final Group C game against Ireland in desperate need of a win, while Croatia will feel they are one step closer to surviving the so-called "Group of Death."
