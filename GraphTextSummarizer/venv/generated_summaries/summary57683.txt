The painting was dropped off at the Housing Works auction shop in New York's Gramercy area on Tuesday morning by an anonymous person, according to James Barnes, a Housing Works sales associate. The latest piece in Banksy's monthlong street art residency in New York went up for online auction Tuesday with a starting minimum bid of $74,000. Every day this month, Banksy has been unveiling new works of art around New York. As of Tuesday evening the leading bid was more than $157,000 from a total of 37 bids, according to the auction site. But until the end of the month, the politically charged, controversial graffiti artist is expected to remain in New York.
