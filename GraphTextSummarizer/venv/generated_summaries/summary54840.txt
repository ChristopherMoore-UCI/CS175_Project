-- Four members of the French national soccer team were punished by a disciplinary commission Tuesday following an inquiry into the team's much-criticized performance and behavior at this year's World Cup. Former team captain Patrice Evra was suspended for five games and his deputy Franck Ribery received a three-game ban, while Jeremy Toulalan was ruled out for one match. The commission said it did not suspend defender Eric Abidal after hearing his explanations for refusing to play in the final group match against South Africa. After the FFF expelled Anelka from the tournament, other team members huddled in a bus the next day and refused to train for their next match. Manchester United defender Evra, Lyon midfielder Toulalan and Barcelona's Abidal were said to have met with the commission in Paris Tuesday.
