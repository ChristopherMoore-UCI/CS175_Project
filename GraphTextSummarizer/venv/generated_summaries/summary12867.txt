A state of emergency has been declared in southeastern Peru, which includes Machu Picchu, according to Javier Velasquez, the president of Peru's Cabinet. Known as the "Lost City of the Incas," Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and draws tens of thousands of international tourists every year.
