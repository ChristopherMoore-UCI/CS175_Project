"You need to provide information about what they should expect and what to do if their condition deteriorates." Health.com: Surprising causes of sinus trouble Patient expectations aren't the only driver of antibiotic use for sinus infections, however. Most sinus infections are caused by viruses, which don't respond to antibiotics. A new study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, appears to confirm those doubts: The antibiotic amoxicillin was no better than placebo at improving the congestion, cough, runny nose, pain, and other symptoms that accompany sinus infections (also known as acute sinusitis), researchers found. But general practitioners have no tests at their disposal that reliably diagnose bacterial infections, Garbutt says, and in the study she and her colleagues were unable to identify any symptoms or other markers that predicted which patients would respond to antibiotics. The results reinforce what many doctors have suspected, even if they've continued to prescribe antibiotics to sinusitis patients, says Daniel Merenstein, M.D., an assistant professor of family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center, in Washington, D.C. "We don't practice it, but we do know it," he says.
