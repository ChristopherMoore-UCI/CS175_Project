"Coalition officials will work with Afghan officials to determine what happened and why. These include promises from the United States of no more raids on Afghan homes and that Afghan prisoners will be released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. " U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who leads ISAF in Afghanistan, called Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Thursday night after Karzai spoke out following the attack, a NATO official said. The official said the target was a Taliban sub-commander linked to the killings of Afghan troops and civilians. A vast majority of Afghan elders -- in a meeting called a loya jirga -- recently gave their approval to a new U.S.-Afghanistan security agreement that would allow American troops to remain in the south Asian nation beyond 2014, albeit in more of a support role.
