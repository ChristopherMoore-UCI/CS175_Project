"To some extent the documentaries perpetuate the myth, because they see people with sharks, but whenever you see documentaries with divers in the water and sharks around, those sharks have been attracted with bait," said Ron Taylor.

For nearly 50 years Ron and Valerie Taylor have been filming sharks at close quarters, bringing the lives of the ocean's most fearsome predators to TV and the big screen. " The Taylors hope their captivating underwater footage has helped educate people that sharks deserve respect and protection.
