David, now a senior in high school, and Daniel, a freshman, say they were not aware of their status until a couple of years ago, when they began to make plans for college. It allows undocumented immigrants under 30 who were brought to the United States as children to apply for a temporary deferral of deportation if they are in school or have finished school. What also cuts, they said, are charges that illegal immigrants will take jobs away from rightful Americans. They finished high school in Chicago and moved to Georgia three years ago, where they get by working odd jobs here and there. "I felt that after high school I didn't have anywhere to go," David said.
