" "These new rules significantly increase costs because they require additional product codes, production breaks and product segregation, including a separate category for cattle shipped directly from Canada to U.S. beef plants, without providing any incremental value to our customers," Tyson Foods said in a statement announcing it was suspending cattle shipped from Canada to its beef plants. "While trying to make an untenable mandate fit with our international trade obligations, USDA chose to set up U.S. cattle producers for financial losses," said association President Scott George, a dairy and cattle producer from Cody, Wyoming. This new labeling system aims to bring the U.S. in compliance with World Trade Organization guidelines. In addition to "muscle cuts of beef" (including veal), the COOL law applies to similar cuts of lamb, pork, goat and chicken; wild fish and certain nuts and other food products. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association likewise has spoken out in opposition, with its president calling the action "short-sighted" and fearing it would spur "increased discrimination against imported products" in light of anger internationally about the move.
