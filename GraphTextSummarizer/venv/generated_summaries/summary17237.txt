Durst now sits in a New Orleans jail after his arrest Saturday in connection with the 2000 death of his longtime friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles. For decades, no one has been able to convict millionaire Robert Durst. In this case, Durst is the declarant who spoke those words, and if they're used against him, they could be fair game. Durst will be transferred to Los Angeles to face a first-degree murder charge. Susan Criss was the judge during Durst's 2003 murder trial in which he admitted to shooting an elderly neighbor and then dismembering him.
