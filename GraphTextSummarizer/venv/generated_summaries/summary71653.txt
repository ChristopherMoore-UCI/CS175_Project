As of Monday afternoon, Keenan said, investigators were actively pursuing leads, but police had no one in custody and no suspects. Police believe Jorelys Rivera was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered at her apartment complex in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) Director Vernon Keenan. Earlier, as volunteers and police handed out fliers with information and a picture of the missing child, her mother spent the morning in court trying to regain custody of her other children, who were taken by the Department of Family and Children's Services for alleged lack of supervision. The girl's parents are not suspects, Keenan said. "We need help from the public," said Police Chief Jeff Lance.
