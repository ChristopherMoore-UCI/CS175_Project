"There are wall calendars, desk calendars, pocket calendars, towel calendars and calendar plates. Calendars still have their enthusiasts, Krug said, especially among those who are able to tie in calendars to an already existing passion, such as collecting Coca-Cola memorabilia. While just about every cell phone or PDA allows users to keep track of those ever important events and appointments, calendars still seem to hold an allure for users day by day. Calendars like this one featuring the movie "Twilight" are big sellers. "We've seen double-digit annual growth in our e-commerce channel every year until the last one," said Paul Hoffman, chief operating officer of Calendar Holdings LLC, parent company of Calendars.com and Calendar Club retail stores.
