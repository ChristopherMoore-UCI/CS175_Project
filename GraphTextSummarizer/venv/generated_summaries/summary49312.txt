Christopher Tierney, 31, was released from New York University's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine on Wednesday morning, according to spokesperson Sam Corbett. Several of the performances were canceled following the December 20 incident, as new safety measures were put in place following a meeting with officials from the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. "They've got it well taken care of." Another actor in the show, Patrick Page, said the new measures have increased communication between actors and safety personnel. But the behind-the-scenes drama at the $65 million production Â­-- including a series of mishaps resulting in actor injuries -- has continued to raise questions over its safety record. He suffered four broken ribs, a hairline skull fracture, a broken scapula, or shoulder blade; a bruised lung, three cracked vertebrae and broken bones below his elbow as a result of his fall, his father said.
