Dortmund always held sway in an absorbing contest but Bayern, minus Franck Ribery and former Dortmund midfielder Mario Goetze, were never far behind. Bayern fought back and were denied in the 12th minute by a fine double save by Roman Weidenfeller who blocked Xherdan Shaqiri's low shot before palming away a rebound effort to safety. Bayern halved the deficit eight minutes later when Robben received a cross from Philipp Lahm, before turning and firing a left-foot shot past Weidenfeller. In the 56th minute, Dortmund regained the lead when Daniel van Butyen scored an own goal and 60 seconds they were 3-1 up thanks to a wonderful curling effort from Ilkay Gundogan. Klopp's men were gifted the opening goal in the sixth minute when Reus headed home from close range after Bayern keeper Tom Starke -- deputizing for an injured Manuel Neuer -- had fumbled a cross.
