China doesn't have the right conditions to produce good wine Judy Chan, chief executive of Grace Vineyard in Shanxi province that produces 400,000 bottles of wine a year, says China is not an easy place to grow grapes, with summer rains and winter frosts. Chinese don't know much about wine Fongyee Walker, co-founder of Beijing-based Dragon Phoenix Wine Consulting, says that when she first started educating people about wine, her students were focused on a narrow selection of premium red wines. China will never produce a truly top tier world class wine Janice Robinson, wine writer for the Financial Times, says when she first visited China in 2002 the wine industry was in an "embryonic state" and local enthusiasts came up with just two names when she asked for recommendations.
