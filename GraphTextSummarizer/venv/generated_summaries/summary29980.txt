-- Popes John XXIII and John Paul II will be declared saints in April, the Vatican said Monday. Pope names first Native American saint The church says the second miracle occurred when a Costa Rican woman with a brain aneurism recovered after praying to John Paul. To be named a saint involves a series of steps, but the qualifications are straightforward, according to the veteran Vatican analyst John Allen. John Paul is said to have miraculously cured Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun stricken by Parkinson's disease, several months after his death. The calls to canonize John Paul II began even before he had been buried.
