Holeman identified the dead as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63. After the shootings, Zinkhan left the scene with his two children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. Zinkhan was not at the theater event initially, Holeman said, but when he arrived, he got into "a disagreement" with his wife. Now it's just a matter of trying to locate him." Holeman said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas and owns a home in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Elliott-Gower said he didn't know Zinkhan well, but knew him through Zinkhan's wife who, like Elliott-Gower, was associated with the theater.
