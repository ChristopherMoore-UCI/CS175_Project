The comments came five days after the Illinois senator allowed Access Hollywood reporter Maria Menounos an interview with his entire family, including daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7. The interview remained decidedly light -- Malia commented on seeing her mother in People Magazine while Sasha discussed her father's aversion to sweets -- but it was highly played across several news programs, including many on CNN. In the interview, Malia also said she often gives her dad campaign tips on how to reach out to young people her age. Speaking with CNN Tuesday, Menounos, the Access Hollywood reporter, said the campaign had reached out to the show for an interview and her only goal was to show the Obama family dynamic. -- Days after Barack Obama granted the first television interview with his entire family, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said he regrets thrusting his two young daughters in the media spotlight.
