-- For several fear-filled minutes last Friday, three passengers on board American Airlines flight 2332 in Dallas called emergency dispatchers to report a flight attendant's apparent meltdown, asking for help and trying to make sense of her strange rant. The third 911 caller, a man, asked "Are you all aware of what's going on on flight 2332 right now?" "It looks like they're physically restraining a flight attendant," he said. "We're on flight 2332 and, um, they're talking over the radio about crashing our plane," the first caller, a woman, told the emergency dispatcher. The dispatcher implored the caller not to hang up, asked for her name and phone number, and asked precisely what the flight attendant said. The flight attendant and a colleague were taken to a hospital for treatment, American Airlines said.
