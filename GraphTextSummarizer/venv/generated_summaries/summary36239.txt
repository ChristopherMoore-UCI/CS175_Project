Law enforcement has been involved with St. Hubert plenty in the past, including nine arrests, though police did not specify all the outcomes. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, however, added later in the day that police "said nothing about DNA" while insisting forensic evidence more generally helped lead them to the suspect. -- A New York man arrested in connection with the stabbing of two children in Brooklyn may be linked to another stabbing in a Manhattan subway, a law enforcement official told CNN Thursday. A law enforcement official said Wednesday that DNA evidence from that knife helped police identify the suspect. He was arrested around the same time that Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce identified St. Hubert by name for the first time as the suspect in the attack.
