Russia threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if it forged ahead with an EU deal, but promised deep discounts on natural gas if it were to join the Moscow-led Customs Union instead. Russia called for "stability and order" in neighboring Ukraine on Wednesday as thousands of protesters kept up their demonstrations against the government in Kiev. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland is to visit Ukraine on Wednesday, he said, adding that he himself was looking forward to visiting the country "when it too gets back on the path of European integration and economic responsibility." Yanukovich told reporters on Monday he supports a peaceful resolution to the "questions brought on by our citizens." It's an internal affair of Ukraine, though it's really important to have stability and order there," he said, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Speaking to a visiting Ukrainian delegation in Russia, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Boyko that Moscow was watching the events that have plunged its neighbor,  whom he called an important strategic partner to Russia, into a political crisis.
