Uncomfortable with the thought of going to actual meetings, Twitchell lost 30 pounds on her own and eventually joined the online Weight Watchers POINTS program on October 26, 2004. " Afraid she would have to purchase clothing from online stores catering to larger women, Twitchell told her husband she'd had enough and was ready to make a change. "I have a marriage again," says Twitchell, who recently retired and relocated with her husband from New Jersey to their new home in the mountains of western North Carolina. Twitchell is the first of eight CNN.com I-Reporters who shared their weight loss stories with CNN. Initially, Twitchell made an appointment with her physician in hopes that he would write her a prescription for a pill to help her lose weight.
