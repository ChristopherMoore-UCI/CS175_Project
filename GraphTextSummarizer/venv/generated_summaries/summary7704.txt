London Fire Brigade says that incidents where sexual adventurers get trapped in cuffs and rings have been steadily increasing year-on-year since the first "Fifty Shades of Grey" book was released in 2011. Firefighters in London are concerned that there could be a "spike" in emergency calls from people stuck in handcuffs and other sex toys after watching the new "Fifty Shades of Grey" film, released worldwide this week. 'Fifty Shades of Grey': What the critics say The service said that crews have been called out to 393 incidents they believe are related to sex since April 2014, including 28 incidents involving people trapped in handcuffs. The books have also been credited with boosting sales of sex toys, driving women to hook-up sites and fueling a craze over sexual domination.
