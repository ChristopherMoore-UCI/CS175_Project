The altar where Pope Benedict XVI will celebrate Mass on Sunday is located at Bicentennial Park in Mexico's Guanajuato state, the heartland of Mexican Catholicism. President Felipe Calderon invited the pontiff to Mexico when they met in Vatican City in 2007 and then again in May of last year when Juan Diego, a Mexican Indian, was canonized. Guanajuato state officials said the government has spent nearly $11 million preparing for the visit. Tourism officials hope the papal visit will put Guanajuato state on the map. Guanajuato has the highest percentage of Catholics in Mexico at well over 90 percent.
