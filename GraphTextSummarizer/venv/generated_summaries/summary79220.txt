FBI agents were on scene Monday afternoon helping sheriff's department members in their investigation, as is routine when explosive or suspicious items are found, said Ari Dekofsky, a spokeswoman for the bureau's Los Angeles office. The municipal employees came across the backpack in a storm drain in Placentia around 9 a.m., Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino told CNN. Placentia is a city of about 50,000 people located just north of Anaheim and 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles. -- City workers in Southern California discovered a backpack Monday filled with grenades and other explosive devices, a sheriff's spokesman said. Police and bomb squad personnel subsequently responded and located six grenades, blasting caps, fuse igniters and some white and black powder, according to Amormino.
