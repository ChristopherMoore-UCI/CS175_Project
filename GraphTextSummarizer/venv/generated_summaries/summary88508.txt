The area in question -- aptly named Carlsberg City -- has been home to the famous Carlsberg brewery since 1847, and with it a big slice of Danish cultural history. Carlsberg will remain very much inside Carlsberg City, making specialty beer and building a tourist center that is expected to attract half-a-million visitors per-year when it opens in 2017. "We call it Carlsberg brand and experience center," said Thomas Kjelfred, communications consultant at Visit Carlsberg. While the first apartments in Carlsberg City went up for sale in March, the area has been alive for years. Modeled after intimate medieval towns, Carlsberg City won "Best Master Plan" at the World Architecture Festival in 2009.
