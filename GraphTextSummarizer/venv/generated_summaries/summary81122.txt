Al-Nusra Front used civilian cars to take the peacekeepers to a U.N. base on the Syrian side of the border, a CNN source said, and the troops walked about 200 meters to the Israeli-occupied Golan side. " "The Secretary-General emphasizes to all parties the impartiality of United Nations peacekeepers," the spokesman said. The peacekeepers -- all from Fiji -- were captured two weeks ago by the al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate, in the buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied territory. Fighting from Syria's civil war spilled over into the buffer zone last week. "They know better than anyone else that our mission is to bring peace and security to people living in troubled areas around the world." CNN's Kareem Khadder and Chieu Luu contributed to this report.
