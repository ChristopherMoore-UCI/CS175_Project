-- The Supreme Court turned aside Friday a gay rights group's request to temporarily suspend enforcement of the controversial "don't ask, don't tell" policy on gays in the military. Gay rights groups say the policy violates the due process and First Amendment rights of military members. He reached an agreement with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on a process that includes a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian troops serving alongside straight colleagues. The case puts the administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal, but filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned. In response to the court case, Gates recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under "don't ask, don't tell" by ordering that it be done only by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
