An industrialized Africa will also provide a much-needed new driver of global growth. However, a barrier to Africa's industrialization that is not often talked about is the mindset of private sector leaders -- both in and outside Africa. Africa is also home to 60% of the world's underutilized arable land and has vast timber resources. Yet, in what some might call an unexpected twist, average growth in Africa over the last decade has been more than 5%. Africa's private sector must take the lead in improving coordination between farmers, growers, processors, and exporters; in increasing competitiveness in the value chain, and ensuring the price, quality, and standards that market demands are met.
