I was spending more and more time in the States, working with some of the best American musicians and certainly listening to the great American bands of the day: The Beach Boys, The Mamas and the Papas and more. I loved performing to American audiences, and I still do. In the mid-1960s, having married a Frenchman, I was living in Paris with two small children and enjoying a highly successful career in Europe, singing in French and other languages. These songs have survived the '60s, and I still sing them today with much affection. There was "I Know a Place," "Don't Sleep in the Subway," "Colour My World," "Days" and more.
