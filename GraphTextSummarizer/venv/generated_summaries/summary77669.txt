Richard Hills, Europe's Ryder Cup Director, told the European Tour's official web site: "We have one worthy gold medallist in France, who gave us the confidence to believe that they will stage a truly memorable Ryder Cup in seven years time. "France, as the successful nation, will now be entering into a multi-faceted relationship with Ryder Cup Europe, lasting a minimum of 12 years and benefiting many aspects of golf at all levels. -- France will host golf's Ryder Cup for the first time in 2018, it was announced Tuesday. There had been calls for the tournament to be given to Spain in memory of golfing great Seve Ballesteros, who died after a long battle with cancer earlier this month. "All of us at Ryder Cup Europe look forward to working closely with the French Ryder Cup 2018 team in the coming years.
