Vehicles powered with hydrogen engines are different from the many vehicles across the nation that run with the help of hydrogen fuel cells -- which are the gold standard of green machines. Proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken-and-egg dilemma over whether to build million-dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use. "The hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive to manufacture, but they consume a lot more hydrogen." Verma said the buses are "valid transition technology" aimed at quickly building significant demand for hydrogen, which would then justify an expensive infrastructure. The airport is testing four Ford shuttle vans equipped with internal combustion engines modified to run on hydrogen instead of gasoline. The use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is far less efficient than in the fuel cells.
