"Visitors will be able to feel what it is like to be professional football players, run a smooth 100 meters against Usain Bolt, take part in any Olympic Games race recreated exactly as it was in reality and experience a medals ceremony," it said. Not so at the world's first-ever sports amusement park planned for the Olympic Stadium and other Olympic venues in Barcelona, which promises to give visitors the chance to experience what it's like to race against Usain Bolt. "The park will bring more life to the stadium than it has today and encourage more of the public to use it, while allowing it to continue holding big events," says Maite Fandos, one of the city's deputy mayors. Another shows a visitor in ski gear hoisted aloft in a wind tunnel apparently designed to recreate the experience of ski jumping. The park will also stage daily awards ceremonies to dole out bronze, silver and gold.
