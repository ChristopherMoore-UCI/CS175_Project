Writer Meredith Stiehm, 44, shares similarities with "Homeland's" Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes): both work in male-dominated places (Stiehm is the Showtime series' sole female writer) and both have personal connections to bipolar disorder (Stiehm's sister, like Carrie, suffers from the condition). Stiehm has penned some of the series most acclaimed and talked about episodes, including season one's "The Weekend," where Brody (Damian Lewis) and Carrie go to her cabin in the woods, and season two's "New Car Smell," in which Carrie finally arrests Brody. If the pilot, starring Diane Kruger (Inglorious Basterds) and Demian Bichir (A Better Life), goes to series, it's likely that Stiehm will also leave the Showtime series. She has a very wry sensibility that's so in keeping with who Carrie is. "I didn't come in until like episode 4," says Stiehm.
