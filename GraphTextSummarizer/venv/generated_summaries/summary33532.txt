Djokovic, ranked second in the world, follows in the footsteps of Andy Murray, who appointed Ivan Lendl as coach in 2011 before going on to win the 2012 U.S. Open and 2013 Wimbledon tournament. While Stanislas Wawrinka has enjoyed success working with former World No.2 Magnus Norman, others have not been so fortunate. Novak Djokovic is the latest to join the trend after appointing Boris Becker as the head of his coaching team just over a month before he starts the defense of his Australian Open title. The German led his country to victory in the 1988 and 1989 Davis Cup and also claimed a gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games playing alongside compatriot Michael Stich. The 17-time grand slam winner ended the season by winning the end of year WTA Championships.
