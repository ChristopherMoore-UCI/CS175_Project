-- Eight people died when a bus carrying church members home blew a front tire, crossed the grassy median of Interstate 40 in eastern Tennessee, clipped an SUV and collided with a tractor-trailer before overturning, officials said Wednesday. Front Street Baptist, on its Facebook page, Wednesday evening thanked people for their prayers. Dionne Stutts, wife of Front Street Baptist Senior Pastor Tim Stutts, said the church did not have specifics on anyone traveling on the bus. Miller said eight of the injured were listed as critical, two as serious and four as stable at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Hospital spokeswoman Susan Wyatt said the church group was returning home from a trip to Gatlinburg, Tennessee.
