In August, he moderated a discussion on key issues between presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. We tend to overportray them whether it's Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John McCain. Now that the campaign is over, what is your reaction to the outcome and to President-elect Barack Obama? I don't think any president has come into a crisis so quickly as President-elect Obama has, and no president has come in with probably as high expectations as President-elect Obama. Many people believed [incorrectly] that Barack Obama wasn't really Christian, that he was Muslim, and, of course, the Jeremiah Wright thing.
