"I don't pretend to know how to market a restaurant but I do know something about social media from all that we were doing in 2008, so we built a lot of our reputation, we built a community on Facebook and Twitter and other social media outlets," said Hildebrand, who added that the caf√© has 7,100 people on its Facebook page, and has done no paid advertising. It includes Dave Munson, a former Republican Sioux Falls mayor. "We've known each other for years, since we were kids, so we just come down here, get together and talk about things that interest us," Munson said. Hildebrand says it's a relief that prominent Republicans come in the door, since he spent so many years working aggressively to defeat their candidates. Another way political campaigns were good training for the restaurant business is the long hours.
