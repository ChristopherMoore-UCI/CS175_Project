Thousands of firefighters were able to concentrate Friday on "burnout fires," intended to burn ground fuel that feed the large fire, officials said. And, Helmich said, they continued their "absolutely fantastic" effort to build containment lines and save thousands of residences and structures. Power companies said Friday that they are still watching the huge fire and its potential impact on crucial transmission lines that supply power to hundreds of thousands. "High winds, low humidity are all of the conditions necessary for large fire growth," Whittington said. The Wallow Fire has scorched more than 408,876 acres, leaving a giant bear-paw-like burn mark on the map of eastern Arizona.
