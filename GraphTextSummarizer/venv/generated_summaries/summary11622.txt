Many fans have experienced the utter frustration of waiting for tickets to go on sale at 11 a.m. only to have a site register that there are no more tickets available just minutes later. There also is the matter of the scarcity of tickets. But what about those phrases you have to type in that ensure that you are a human and not a bot attempting to buy blocks of tickets? Literally, that on sale to the public is a really small percentage of tickets. Acts such as the Rolling Stones price their tickets high in the primary market (Companies such as TicketMaster, Live Nation and your venue's box office) so that the secondary ticket market (those brokers/companies that resell those tickets) can't make as much money off of their show.
