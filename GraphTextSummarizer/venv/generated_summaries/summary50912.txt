Included in the show are paintings by Sandro Botticelli, who had a close relationship with the Medicis, as well as paintings of the new mercantile class and their novel activities by artists such as Dutch painter Marinus van Reymerswaele. The exhibition is curated by English writer Tim Parks, author of "Medici Money: Banking, Metaphysics and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence," and Ludovica Sebregondi, an Italian art historian and author of "Iconography of Girolamo Savonarola, 1495 -1998." Both show how the bankers, worried that their activities might be contravening their religious beliefs, poured money into building churches and commissioning devotional paintings -- often with themselves inserted into them. Regardless of their efforts, there was a backlash, personified at the end of the 15th century by the preacher Girolamo Savonarola, who railed against the lavish lives of the rich and encouraged artists such as Botticelli to throw their works onto "bonfires of the vanities. Entitled "Money and Beauty: Bankers, Botticelli and the Bonfire of the Vanities," the exhibition in Florence's Palazzo Strozzi looks at how Florence's famous families got rich -- and how they then used their wealth to commission works from some of the world's most celebrated artists.
