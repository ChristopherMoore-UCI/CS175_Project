As in previous studies, women taking DHA supplements were less likely to give birth prematurely. Previous research has suggested that eating more fish during pregnancy may help stave off postpartum depression and promote cognitive development in young children. Finally, many women were excluded from the study because they were already taking DHA supplements, which might have skewed the results. The overall diet -- or even the lifestyle -- of pregnant women who eat a lot of fish may explain the benefits seen in earlier studies, says Cipriani, who was not involved in the new research. The rates of postpartum depression six months after the women gave birth were not measurably different in the DHA group (10 percent) versus the placebo group (11 percent).
