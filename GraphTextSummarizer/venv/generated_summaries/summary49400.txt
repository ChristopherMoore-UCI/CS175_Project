"I find it so hard to believe that our legislature would enact a law and say 'You know what, if husbands and wives are reading each others' e-mail, that's a priority for us and we've got to stop that,'" attorney Leon Weiss said. Walker says the e-mails revealed that Clara Walker, who has been married three times, was having an affair with her second husband. Leon Walker said he and the first husband were both concerned because, according to Walker, husband No. 2 had a prior arrest on a domestic violence charge. When Clara Walker learned how the e-mails made their way into court, she complained to police. "She'd asked me to read her e-mails before," Walker said in an interview this week.
