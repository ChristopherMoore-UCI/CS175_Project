Amnesty International as well as other human rights groups want Haitian authorities to also bring Duvalier to trial for his alleged brutality. "Haiti's current government led by President Michel Martelly has an obligation under international law to bring to justice those responsible for the crimes against humanity committed during Duvalier's years," Zuniga said. "The cases of human rights abuses we documented in Haiti are likely to be only a small proportion of what really happened during Duvalier's rule," Zuniga said. "What is needed is political will from Haiti's new administration to comply with their international obligations and their duty to the survivors and victims of abuses," said Javier Zuniga, a special advisor at Amnesty International. Amnesty International published a new report Thursday with evidence of arbitrary detentions, torture, deaths in custody, killings and disappearances of Haitians from 1971 to 1985 when Duvalier was in power.
