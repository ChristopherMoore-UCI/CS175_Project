Yet the world No. 8 was unable to replicate that success in front of an expectant home crowd Tuesday in a second-round clash against American qualifier Shelby Rogers. The second seed, playing in his first match since his final defeat to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last month, eased past Canada's Peter Polansky 6-2 6-0. And the 21-year-old then showed her nerve to take the third in style after Bouchard had earlier threatened to rein her back in by securing the second. Elsewhere, in the men's edition of the Rogers Cup -- taking place in Toronto -- Roger Federer needed just 52 minutes to advance to the third round of the competition Tuesday. Bouchard, meanwhile, was disappointed to lose a match in her hometown, but took some satisfaction from the way she performed in the second set.
