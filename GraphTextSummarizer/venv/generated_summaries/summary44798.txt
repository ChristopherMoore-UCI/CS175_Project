The BrainLab was one of the first to demonstrate that a person can control a robotic arm and a wheelchair with brain signals, Jackson said. One technique that Jackson and colleagues use to harness brain signals is called functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Such brain-computer interfaces require that the user wear an EEG cap to measure brain signals, but setting one up is very complicated. Jackson started this lab in 1998 to look at methods of brain control that didn't involve surgery. The lab has also developed a wheelchair that a person can drive by using brain signals, rather than moving a joystick or pressing buttons.
