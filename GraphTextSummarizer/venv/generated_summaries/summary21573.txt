She actually has long hair that isn't permed, but she chooses to wear a weave because daily exposure to the heat from the studio lights can damage hair. Stewart, who is bald, said the two actually talk about weaves on the show quite a bit, something he attributes to his latent hair envy. That's when I stepped in and reminded Stewart that while "weave-gate" was bad, hair is not the last taboo. " I don't care if a man sees a woman bald at the office on Wednesday, with blond finger waves at the club on Friday, and with jet black hair down to her butt at church on Sunday -- if anyone asks if she wears a weave, the answer is "I don't know." She could be holding a receipt from Weaves R Us in one hand, and five pounds of hair in the other, and he should say "I'm not sure."
