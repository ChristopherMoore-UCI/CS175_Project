So researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel, were in for a surprise when their study into the relation between coffee and bad breath, showed that coffee can actually lead to good breath. Breath specialist Mel Rosenberg of the university's Faculty of Medicine found that there are certain components in coffee that inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath -- preventing these bacteria from making their presence felt, or smelt. "Everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath," Rosenberg told CNN "and as a latte drinker, I believe that too." But until Rosenberg's study, no one had ever scientifically shown the link between the consumption of coffee and bad breath. Mel Rosenberg at work in his 'smell laboratory' found that coffee can lead to good breath.
