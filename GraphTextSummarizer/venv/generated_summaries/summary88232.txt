Craig Hammond was allegedly caught with a wristwatch cell phone while being searched Sunday at Corcoran State Prison ahead of a planned visit with Manson, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections. A follower of Charles Manson accused of attempting to smuggle a cell phone to the notorious cult leader has been arrested, California prison officials said Tuesday. Hammond visits regularly with Manson, telling CNN in 2009 that he moved close to Corcoran prison so he could be near the man he believes possesses deep insight into environmental issues. Manson's death sentence was changed to life in prison after California's death penalty was overturned for a period during the 1970s. Manson was initially sentenced to death for the grisly 1969 slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others, including Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, by a group of his followers as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite an apocalyptic race war during the country's massive social unrest.
