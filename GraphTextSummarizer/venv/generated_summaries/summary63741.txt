-- The mantra in Washington during the current winter storm is "stay home," but some doctors and nurses really do need to get to hospitals to take care of the sick. Adrian Stanton was running Virginia Hospital Center's command center Wednesday morning, coordinating the driver pickups and drop-offs. One night-shift supervisor named Lynne said she received a ride from Long on Thursday morning. So, many of them rely on a group of hardy volunteer drivers for transport. Wednesday morning he said the drivers had done somewhere near 50 pick-ups and drop-offs in the previous 24 hours.
