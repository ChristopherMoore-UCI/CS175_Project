The former Tottenham Hotspur winger, who cost the Spanish giants a reported $132 million (Â£85 million), was officially welcomed by Real Madrid President Florentino Perez at a press conference on Monday. "Such has been the attention from Real Madrid and so great is Gareth's desire to join them, that we have taken the view that the player will not be sufficiently committed to our campaign in the current season," Levy told Tottenham's website. A suited Bale then changed into his new kit before stepping out on to the pitch to greet hoards of adoring Madrid fans. "As always, we follow a protocol and we have done all the investigations and all the cardiorespiratory and biomechanical studies and the truth is that he is in excellent physical condition and available for the coaching staff when they see fit.," Diez said in a statement on the Real Madrid website. Earlier, Perez praised the Welsh Intenational who has been named Footballer of the Year in England twice and scored 26 goals in 44 appearances for Tottenham Hotspur last season.
