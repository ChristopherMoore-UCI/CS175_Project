The government agreed to pull its army off the streets, release people jailed since the protests began in March and allow international journalists and Arab League observers to monitor the moves, Arab League ministers announced Wednesday. In a statement issued Sunday, the Arab League criticized the Syrian government's failure to implement its proposal "to end the violence used against protesters," and said Arab League foreign ministers would meet Saturday to discuss the situation. In Aleppo, Syria's largest city and the country's economic center, residents took to the streets in anti-government protests after the morning Eid prayers, the LCC said. On Sunday, Syria's ambassador to the League, Youssef Ahmad, knocked its leaders' comments, according to the government-run Syrian Arab News Agency. "The AL (Arab League) Secretariat is supposed to play its role in coordinating between the Syrian government and the ministerial committee, not proclaim itself a party against the Syrian government," the ambassador said, according to SANA.
