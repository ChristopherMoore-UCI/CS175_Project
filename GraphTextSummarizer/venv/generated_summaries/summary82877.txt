Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that "George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and that during the course of the altercation he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall. Police were initially called to Love's off-campus Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported "a possible alcohol overdose," Police Chief Tim Longo said at the time. Love had "a large bruise on the right side of her face which appears to have been caused by blunt force trauma," according to the police sworn statement. " But defense attorney Lawrence said there was no evidence that Love's head hit a wall. A medical examiner ruled that blunt force trauma killed Love, and authorities allege Huguely caused it during the altercation.
