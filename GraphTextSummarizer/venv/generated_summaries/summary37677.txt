President Barack Obama signed a sweeping overhaul of child nutrition standards in December, enacting a law meant to encourage better eating habits in part by giving the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds. Once the rule takes effect, school districts will be required to meet its standards to be eligible for federal assistance for school meals. Some conservatives, however, contend that enforcement of nutrition standards in school meals is not an appropriate role for the federal government. Saturated fat would constitute less than 10 percent of the total calories in school meals for children at all age levels. If children "eat healthy foods at schools and like them, they're going to be more open to eating healthy food at home and throughout the rest of their lives," said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
