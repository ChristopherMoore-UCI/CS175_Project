"It's definitely very unique circumstances and definitely very predatory behavior," said Clay County prosecutor Brian Melton. Those and other allegations were lodged in a complaint against Timothy Jay Vafeades, 53, who was charged Monday in Clay County, Minnesota, with kidnapping, false imprisonment and domestic abuse. Vafeades allegedly did not let the woman use public restrooms at rest stops or truck stops, nor did he allow her to take showers alone at truck stops. The woman sometimes referred to Vafeades as the "Dentist," as he had several pairs of false teeth and an apparent obsession with vampires. He had one set of dentures made to look like vampire teeth and had ordered a set of false teeth for the woman, the complaint says.
