Some NFL fans have questioned why Harbaugh would call Rice "one heck of a guy" after the news broke and why the Ravens would tweet out in May "Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident." A few months after the incident, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice without pay and fined him an additional game check for "conduct detrimental to the NFL. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who had originally given Rice a two-game ban, increased the suspension after viewing the new video for the first time, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said on Twitter. Running back Ray Rice was released by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL on Monday, the same day a shocking video surfaced showing the NFL star knocking out his future wife with a punch in February. The Canadian Football League said Monday night Rice is ineligible to play in the CFL while he is suspended by the NFL.
