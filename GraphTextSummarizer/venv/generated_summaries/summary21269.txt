Among its most famous findings, Hubble has: -- Helped astronomers discover dark energy, which exerts a repulsive force that works against gravity; -- Helped determine the age of the universe (about 13.75 billion years old); -- Acted as a virtual time machine, providing glimpses into how the universe might have looked millions of years ago and helping shed light on how the giant galaxies we see today were formed; -- Helped identify the atmospheric makeup of planets beyond our solar system. NASA, the European Space Agency and the Space Telescopic Science Institute celebrated Hubble's 20th year in orbit on Saturday by releasing another stunning photo caught by the iconic telescope. "I never would have believed in 1990 that the Hubble would have turned out this great," said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Former NASA astronaut John Grunsfeld, who flew on three service missions to Hubble, said that inside those newborn stars "are the chemical elements ... that make up people." Despite its age, Hubble is 100 times more powerful today than at the time of its launch, NASA says, thanks to its most recent visit by astronauts, including Grunsfeld, on a service mission last May. "We had hoped to get 10 to 15 years out of it with frequent shuttle visits every two and a half to three years," Weiler said.
