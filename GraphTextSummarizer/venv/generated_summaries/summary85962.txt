" In other highlights on Tuesday, the home crowd had a match to savor on Court One as 19-year-old Briton Laura Robson knocked out tenth seed Maria Kirilenko, who made the quarterfinals last year. -- World number one Serena Williams put her recent controversies to one side as she cruised past Mandy Minella of Luxembourg 6-1 6-3 in the first round at Wimbledon. Elsewhere, Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska -- who finished runner-up to Williams last year - cruised past Austrian qualifier Yvonne Meusberger with a 6-1 6-1 victory. "That was a big one for me just because of all the nerves and playing in front of your home crowd at Wimbledon," said Robson, who won Wimbledon as a junior. The world No. 1 will break that record if she reaches the quarterfinals at a venue where she also won Olympic gold last year.
