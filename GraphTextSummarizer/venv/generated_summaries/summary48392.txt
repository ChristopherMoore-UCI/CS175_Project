More than 200 officers and 97 rebels were killed during that period, federal home minister P. Chidambaram said last month. -- Dozens of police officers were involved in a gunbattle with rebel Maoists in the rain-drenched forests of eastern India Wednesday, police reported. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call "class enemies," the rebels are also believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks. While forces stopped many attacks and apprehended key Maoist leaders, the guerrillas too have been successful in carrying out serious assaults in several instances, he noted. Security forces had been tracking the insurgents when a shootout erupted in Chhattisgarh state's Dantewada region, police spokesman Rajesh Mishra told CNN.
