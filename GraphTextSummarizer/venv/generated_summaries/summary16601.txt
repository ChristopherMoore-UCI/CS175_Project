The Russian, who reached a career-high of number eight, made it to the semifinals of the singles at Wimbledon in 1997, but grand slam success eluded her. -- Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova will team up again to play at this year's Wimbledon championships. Swiss star Hingis won five grand slam singles crowns and nine in doubles during a glittering career which ended under a cloud in 2007, when she was suspended for two years for testing positive for cocaine at Wimbledon. The popular pair won the 1999 and 2002 Australian Open doubles titles, but will be returning the SW19 to play in the legends doubles event for players who are retired from the professional circuit, the management company Octagon said Tuesday. As well as winning two grand slam titles together, the pair also reached No.1 in the WTA doubles rankings.
