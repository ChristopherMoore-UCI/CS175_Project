The Football Manager team ran a second simulation which included speculated transfer targets for each team and in this version of the league it's City who take the title from Chelsea on goal difference. And it's Chelsea who emerged victorious, finishing three points clear of defending champions City in second place. This included factoring in the various injuries and suspensions EPL teams have picked up since the game's initial release in November last year. Arsenal faces Monaco in the last 16 next month with Chelsea and Manchester City also reaching the knockout stage.
