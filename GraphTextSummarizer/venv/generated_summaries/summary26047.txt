US security officials and politicians have repeatedly identified Huawei as a threat to US national security -- an allegation the Chinese company has consistently denied. But October's congressional report made it even more difficult for the company to do business in the US, Huawei executives say. Huawei has given up its quest to conquer the market for telecom network equipment in the US, where the Chinese company's sales efforts have been repeatedly blocked by security fears. It also failed to win bids for other US telecom assets and, in 2011, was forced to unwind a $2m deal to buy patents from a US company. At the time, Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called on the US government and private sector companies to shun Huawei and ZTE.
