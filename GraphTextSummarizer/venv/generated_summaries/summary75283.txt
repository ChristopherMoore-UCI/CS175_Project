-- At least 37 people were killed following a bus crash west of Nairobi, Kenya, police said Thursday. "There are no laws for helmet wearing, blood alcohol concentration levels for drivers or child restraints in Kenya and where road safety laws do exist they are poorly enforced." The WHO says that main roads between Nairobi and the eastern part of the country -- such as the Nairobi-Narok highway -- are very dangerous. Between 3,000 and 13,000 people die in road accidents in Kenya every year, the World Health Organization says. Most of the victims are motorcyclists and pedestrians, but one third of them are vehicle passengers often riding on unsafe public transportation.
