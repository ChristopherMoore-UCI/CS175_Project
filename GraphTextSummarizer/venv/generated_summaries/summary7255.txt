Ihsan said the ISI had killed many Taliban fighters over the years and had handed over some to the United States in return for money. Tahir Hussain, commissioner of Faisalabad -- where the blast occurred -- called it an act of terrorism. Pakistan has the highest number of vehicles running on compressed natural gas (CNG) as well as the most refueling stations in the world, according to December 2009 figures from the International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles. The intelligence agency building experienced no major damage, said Naseem Sadiq, a senior government official in Faisalabad. At least 24 people -- mostly civilians -- were killed and 105 others were wounded when a bomb went off at a compressed natural gas station Tuesday, officials said.
