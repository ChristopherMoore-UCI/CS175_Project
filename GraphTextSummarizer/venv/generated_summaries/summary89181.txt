Investment in child welfare systems with trained social workers capable of case management in impoverished countries must be the highest priority to strengthen and support families and communities. Effective and innovative strategies need to be implemented and more resources must be devoted to preventing child abandonment and helping families to remain intact or to be reunified and reintegrated. Children are bought and sold as prostitutes or forced into a life of crime, drug dealing and alcoholism, and many are child laborers making up a large part of the major work force of countries abroad. Millions of children around the globe lose their parents to extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, conflict, war and natural disasters, often forcing family members to relinquish and abandon their children to orphanages. Realizing that millions of orphaned children would never be adopted fast enough, I founded Worldwide Orphans Foundation.
