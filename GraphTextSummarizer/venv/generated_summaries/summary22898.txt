Police and intelligence services did all they could to trace suspects and avert attacks given the resources, intelligence and evidence they had at the time, said the report by the Intelligence and Security Committee, which reports directly to the prime minister. "Hindsight is a wonderful thing," said committee member Michael Mates. Surveillance or further investigation simply wasn't justified in the months before the attacks, said committee member George Howarth. Having additional resources in place might have alerted law enforcement agencies to the intentions of the July 7 bombers, the 2006 report said. Police coverage is now better than it was, Mates said, and he praised the British government for spending more on law enforcement and the security agencies for recruiting more staff.
