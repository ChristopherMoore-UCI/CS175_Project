" Florida Gulf Coast stuns Georgetown in shocking upset Before last weekend's upsets of regional No. 2 seed Georgetown and No. 7 seed San Diego State, most people -- even players Enfield was recruiting -- had no idea know where Florida Gulf Coast University is. The hoops team, which joined Division I just five years ago and became eligible for tournament play two years ago, was coming off a 10-20 season when Enfield was hired away from his assistant position at Florida State. "I wanted that opportunity, so that's why I took it." Enfield signed a five-year contract (which may not stop larger schools from looking to Fort Myers for a coach this off-season) and quickly built a program almost from scratch. Enfield knows that when it comes to recruiting, he's not necessarily going to get guys ready for Division I. Those players go to Kentucky or Duke or other top schools, he said. Florida Gulf Coast is the lowest-seeded team to ever advance to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA college basketball championship tournament.
