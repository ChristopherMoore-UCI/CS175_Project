Instead, users will be able to flip through stories and other posts by tilting the phone in various ways and swiping with their fingers. The idea is to present longer-form Facebook content in a more attractive, magazine-style way that will encourage users to linger over posts, stories and images. It won't have all the functions of the native Facebook app, but it will present your friends' posts, along with stories from other news categories, in a slicker, prettier package. On Wednesday, Facebook reported that 945 million of its 1.2 billion users visited the site via a smartphone or tablet in the last few months and that mobile represented 53% of the site's advertising revenue -- up from 23% last year and zero in 2011. Paper will be the first release from Facebook Creative Labs, which is devoted exclusively to developing new mobile apps for the site.
