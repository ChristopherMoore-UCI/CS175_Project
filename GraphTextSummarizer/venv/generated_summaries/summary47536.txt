Watch Jennifer smile as ball is returned Â» It was mid-July. Jennifer's big catch was the 200th home run for Ryan Howard, an All-Star for the Philadelphia Phillies. A security guard walked up and gave Jennifer a ball autographed by Howard. See where historic baseballs are now Howard's ball is small potatoes in the world of sports memorabilia, maybe worth a couple thousand bucks on the open market. Howard launched his history-making homer in the sixth inning, a solo shot to right field.
