We ask for respect for our privacy and that of our family, and we do not intend to comment further." Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider confirmed the authenticity of the e-mail but declined to comment further. -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, have sent an e-mail to family friends announcing a mutual decision to separate, a longtime family friend told CNN. He co-founded Generation Investment Management, a company that promotes "a new approach to sustainable investing." After leaving Washington and returning to Nashville, Tennessee, Tipper Gore considered but decided against a run for a U.S. Senate seat in her home state in 2002. "They are a real couple." Since losing the 2000 presidential race, Gore has been active in environmental causes, but he has also pursued business interests.
