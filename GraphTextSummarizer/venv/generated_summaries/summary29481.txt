Instead of being charged with simple assault, which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison, Bond was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty for the possession and use of "chemical weapons.

A Supreme Court majority appeared poised Tuesday to give a woman convicted of trying to poison her best friend a chance to argue that her case should have been handled in state courts.

The high court, in a case from more than 70 years ago, suggested that this so-called "gateway" claim could only be raised by state officials, not individual plaintiffs.
