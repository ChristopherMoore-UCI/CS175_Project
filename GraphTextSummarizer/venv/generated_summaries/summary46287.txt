Previously on CNN.com: 3 accused of trying to buy military weapons for Mexican drug cartel Three people were charged last year, according to an indictment unsealed in Phoenix. Court documents say the alleged conspirators' shopping list included: a Stinger surface-to-air-missile; a Dragon fire anti-tank weapon; a Law Rocket anti-tank weapon; and two AT-4 recoilless anti-tank guns. "With the confiscation of a significant quantity of methamphetamine and U.S. currency, this operation not only delivered a financial blow to a Mexican drug trafficking organization, but it also prevented further cartel violence by keeping dangerous weapons out of their hands," Leonardo said in a statement. -- A Mexican national who pleaded guilty to trying to buy a Stinger missile and other military weapons for a Mexican drug cartel has been sentenced to 25 years in prison, federal prosecutors said. The indictment said the defendants were to pay with cash and illegal drugs.
