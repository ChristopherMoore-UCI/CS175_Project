This fiber optic tool is made from the perfect mirror, making it possible to reflect CO2 lasers for the first time. This meant Fink's invention was useful not only in the military and telecommunications field, but could also be used in minimally invasive laser surgery -- the use of lasers rather than scalpels to operate on everything from tumors, deafness and spine injuries. LONDON, England -- A new tool that allows doctors to use laser surgery in complex operations has been hailed as a breakthrough in minimally invasive laser technology. The surgeons believe laser technology will now become more widespread with the avenue of this tool that is "easy and intuitive to use. The "Omni directional dielectric mirror" was created by Professor Yoel Fink, a then-29-year-old student in Material Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1995.
