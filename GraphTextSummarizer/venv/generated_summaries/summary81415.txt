Suicide bombers targeting a bus station in Kano, Nigeria, killed 10 people and left several injured Tuesday, according to the city's police chief, just hours after a similar attack in Yobe state killed 17 people. Likewise in Kano, northern Nigeria's most populous city, suicide bombings in the past year have targeted schools, gas stations and a market. Two men detonated the explosives concealed under their clothes as soon as they got off the bus at Kano Line motor park Tuesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Ibrahim Idris said. Although no one has claimed responsibility for either of the attacks, Boko Haram has been behind dozens of suicide and other bombingsâ€Ž in northern Nigeria. Along with suicide bombings they have attacked churches and mosques, raided once-peaceful villages and kidnapped people young and old, most infamously more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok.
