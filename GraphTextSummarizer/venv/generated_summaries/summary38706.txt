Namibia's Fish River Canyon looks petite to anyone who's ever visited Arizona's Grand Canyon. Years of over-hunting and over-grazing took their toll, and a lot of local flora and fauna started to disappear from the area. It was a shallow sea millions of years ago," explains Marian Hulme, the owner of the local rest camp and caretaker of the forest. While the canyon -- parts of which are 500 million years old -- remained unchanged for millennia, Goldbeck explains the arrival of European settlers in the 18th century had an unsettling effect on the canyon's ecosystem. In addition to these natural sculptures, Hulme's father, who was a caretaker before her, created art from stones and recycled materials.
