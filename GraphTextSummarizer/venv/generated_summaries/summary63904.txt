" See Alpeyrie's photos of rebels and refugees fleeing Syria by dark Alpeyrie, a 33-year-old French-American, worked with Greek photojournalist George Moutafis, whose Syrian contacts helped lead them across the Turkish border into Syria. Alpeyrie stood close to another rebel to get a shot of the young man, cigarette dangling from his mouth, pointing his gun toward an area where Syrian snipers were positioned. Alpeyrie, Moutafis and the Syrians who helped them cross into the country had to move at night in pitch blackness, walking seven miles to a village where rebels and their families were hiding. Alpeyrie and Moutafis began their journey out of Syria by simply walking in the direction of the border, accompanied by the people who had helped get them inside the country. "We said we're done with our work." Alpeyrie's instincts were dead on.
