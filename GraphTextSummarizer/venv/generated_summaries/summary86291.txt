On congressional authorization, the White House has said Obama acted within his authority under the War Powers Act, noting that the president and other officials consulted congressional leaders several times in the run-up to the March 19 deployment of U.S. forces to the U.N.-authorized Libya mission. -- Angry members of Congress questioned top administration officials Wednesday on why they weren't asked to authorize President Barack Obama's decision to commit U.S. forces to the Libya military mission. Other issues raised by the legislators included whether the United States intended to arm the Libyan rebels, and the cost of the mission to U.S. taxpayers, participants told CNN. Nadler said Gates convinced him that a massacre in Libya was imminent before the U.S.-led coalition launched airstrikes to enforce a no-fly zone and prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces from attacking the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. "I strongly oppose arming rebels because in that complex tribal patchwork that makes up this insurgency, it is very uncoordinated," Republican Rep. Geoff Davis of Kentucky told CNN, adding that Islamic radicals were joining the Libyan opposition.
