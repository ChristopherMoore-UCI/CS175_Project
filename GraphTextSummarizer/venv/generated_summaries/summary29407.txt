"I also condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris," tweeted Blatter. "We will support any criminal action against those involved in such behavior, and should evidence point to the involvement of Chelsea season ticket holders or members the club will take the strongest possible action against them including banning orders. The group, who appear to be Chelsea supporters, can then be heard chanting: "We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it." In 2012, team captain John Terry was banned for four matches and fined $356,000 for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. "Such behavior is abhorrent and has no place in football or society," said statement released by Chelsea Wednesday.
