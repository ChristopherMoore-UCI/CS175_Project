Two others were hospitalized in critical condition; one of them, identified by police as 19-year-old Michael Toller, died Sunday. Doering said Sunday that police think at least one person not in custody may have information in the case. "I just got home," a man identified as Guy Heinze Jr. told the emergency dispatcher in the Saturday call, released Monday by authorities. Autopsies on the victims began over the weekend in Savannah, Georgia, and continued Monday, Doering said. "We are not looking for any known suspects," Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said.
