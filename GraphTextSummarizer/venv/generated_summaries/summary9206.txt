"This office understands that the currently released audio tape of approximately 15 minutes is a portion of approximately one (1) hour of overall audio recording of Mr. Donald T. Sterling and Ms. Stiviano, and is in fact legitimate," Mac E. Nehoray said in a news release. When Commissioner Adam Silver speaks to the media Tuesday about the NBA's findings in the investigation into racist remarks attributed to Clippers owner Donald Sterling, the league's players hope it includes the most severe penalties. Opinion: Sterling has to go "He (eventually) could suspend Donald Sterling maybe for a year, maybe even two years or even indefinitely," Nichols said. There is no room in the NBA -- or anywhere else -- for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.'
