While the film ostensibly stars Franco, Lithgow, Freida Pinto and several other noted actors, the real star of the show is Caesar, the digitally created chimp brought to life by Weta Digital -- the company that sprang to prominence for its work on Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy -- and by actor Andy Serkis. Serkis (Gollum in "Lord of the Rings"), who has become the go-to guy for performance capture roles, plays Caesar from infancy to adulthood, growing from a vaguely Curious George-like childhood into your everyday, sullen, teenaged hyper-intelligent ape and eventually into an adult. Caesar is a complex character, a first-of-his-kind artificially created leap in evolution, and as such, has a lot on his mind, all of which Serkis has to portray through movement and facial expressions. Animal control is called, and the second act begins with Caesar incarcerated in what is supposedly a paradise for wayward simians, but as anyone who's seen a movie knows, is basically a maximum-security prison for apes. Here, Caesar begins to suspect that not all humans are as kind as his "dad," Will, and that maybe it's his job as a super-intelligent chimp to balance the scales a bit.
