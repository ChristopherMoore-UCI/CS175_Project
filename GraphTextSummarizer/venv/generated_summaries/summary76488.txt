"That '87 Ryder Cup really was very special for me and it made me realize how special the event was, and I fell in love with it straight away," recalls said flamenco dancer Jose Maria Olazabal, who 25 years later captained a European team to another stunning Ryder Cup on American soil -- this time at Medinah Country Club in Illinois. While he enjoyed success in the Masters, later in 1999 Olazabal suffered Ryder Cup heartache when he halved a controversial decisive match with Justin Leonard as the U.S. won the infamous "Battle of Brookline." In 1987 Ballesteros began what became the most successful partnership in Ryder Cup history -- out of 15 matches together, he and Olazabal won 11, halved two and lost two. In his second season as a European Tour professional, having already become the first Spaniard to win its top rookie award, Olazabal had the privilege of being paired with one of golf's greatest icons for his Ryder Cup debut: "He had tough beginnings, the same scenario -- he had to play golf on the beach with a three iron," Olazabal said.
