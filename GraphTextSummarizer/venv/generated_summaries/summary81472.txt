Last week, after scoring both goals in his side's 2-1 victory over England, Suarez hit out at the British media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions. "Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years," he told reporters following the game. The defeat led to Italian coach Cesare Prandelli offering his resignation in his news conference after the game -- but all eyes were still on Suarez. He was forced to undergo keyhole surgery and missed Uruguay's opening game defeat by Costa Rica before making a near miraculous return in time to face England just five weeks after his operation, scoring both goals in the South American side's 2-1 win. Already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent, the Uruguay striker was seemingly at it again in his country's key World Cup victory over Italy. Uruguay's next game is likely to be against Colombia on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro.
