" Bill Cosby facing litany of allegations CNN has reached out to Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, but has not heard back yet. " Her speaking up now was motivated in part to show solidarity with others, like her longtime friend Janice Dickinson (who says Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982, a claim attorney Singer has called "a fabricated lie"), who have publicly accused Bill Cosby in recent weeks. In an essay for Vanity Fair, famed model Beverly Johnson accuses Bill Cosby of drugging her in a meeting at his Manhattan residence in the 1980s -- adding herself to the list of women who have made accusations against the comedian in recent weeks. After some initial meetings, including one in which Johnson took her child to Cosby's brownstone, she was invited back to Cosby's residence. Johnson, a noted model in the 1970s and the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue, says the alleged incident, which did not involve sexual assault, happened in the mid-'80s when Cosby was starring on "The Cosby Show."
