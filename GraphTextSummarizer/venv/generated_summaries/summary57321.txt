Here's what I saw: Smith, seated opposite Letterman, conducted himself very differently from most child actors. Yet in the online universe of Jaden Hatred, that Letterman appearance played as one thing and one thing only: privilege. I know that when I watched Jaden Smith in "The Karate Kid," the echoes of his father in everything from his cool, appraising glare to the nimble speed of his responses is something I enjoyed like, say, hearing that raspy echo of Bob Dylan in Jakob Dylan's voice back in the "One Headlight" days. Still, what's most striking, and perhaps revealing, about this particular outpouring of toxic anger is that Jaden's famous father, Will Smith, isn't just another big movie star he's one of the most likable movie stars you could ever imagine. Bottom line, for me: Smith was cocky as hell on Letterman, but he was also interesting.
