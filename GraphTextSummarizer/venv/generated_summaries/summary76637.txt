"And we think that we could double the number of heart transplants without any increase in the number of organ donors." Eventually, scientists may even be able to improve donor organs that would otherwise be discarded, Ardehali said. Patients who underwent live organ transplants during the study also spent less time on a mechanical ventilator, less time in the intensive care unit and had fewer lung-related complications. There are three potential benefits to keeping donor organs "alive," said Ardehali, who is UCLA's principal investigator for one of the studies. More than 114,000 people in the United States are awaiting organ donations, according to Organdonor.gov; 18 of them die each day without a donation. Currently, 75 to 80% of donor lungs are rejected because they are infected or have too much damage, he said.
