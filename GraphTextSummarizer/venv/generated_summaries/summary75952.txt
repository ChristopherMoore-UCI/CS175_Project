In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believed an argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. -- Questions about bruises on the body of actress Natalie Wood, whose body was found floating off Catalina Island in 1981, led the Los Angeles County coroner's office to change the cause of death from "accidental drowning" to "drowning and other undetermined factors. He said that Wood's widower, actor Robert Wagner, is not a suspect. Investigators did not comment directly on statements made in news reports in November by Dennis Davern, the captain of a yacht owned by Wood and her husband. Davern offered a previously unreported account of how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island following an argument between the couple.
