Those words, spoken in 2007 to "Naked News," an Internet-based service, took on fresh meaning as the man on the couch was identified by Naked News to be Luka Rocco Magnotta, a porn actor accused of killing and dismembering a man in Canada. In months and years past, he was pegged as a serial kitten-killer by animal rights activists, and as a man who may have dated a Canadian woman convicted of drugging, raping, torturing and killing young girls almost two decades ago. I'm a people person," Magnotta, who used a pseudonym during the interview, told Naked News, a self-described nude news program. All the charges, however, paled in comparison to last week's accusations against Magnotta as he became the center of Canada's most talked-about crime. Authorities launched a massive manhunt for Magnotta after a severed hand was sent to Canada's Liberal Party, a foot was sent to the Conservatives and a torso was stuffed in a suitcase and tossed in the trash of the Montreal apartment building where he lived.
