The quake's epicenter was a few miles from an orphanage in Carrefour, Haiti, where the Wilsons' 21-year-old daughter Katie was working, and the 5-year-old girl they were about to adopt lived. -- Mike and Missy Wilson sat in a meeting late Tuesday afternoon, planning a ministry trip to Haiti when they were interrupted by a text message. Mike Wilson, with two ministry officials, was able to travel into Haiti on a medivac plane, and the three made their way to the town. Wilson said he is working with the U.S. Embassy seeking emergency help to bring Tia to Nashville. Missy Wilson said the next words were from Tia, barely able to speak English, saying, "'Ma-ma, I love you.'
