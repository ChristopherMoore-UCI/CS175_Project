Sales managers at Mississippi TV stations said huge ad buys from PACs and super PACs have strained the state's top advertising markets. The northeastern Mississippi city of Tupelo saw about $500,000 in political spending -- mostly from outside groups -- injected into its TV ad space. But the onslaught of negative ads released by outside groups may also produce a backlash for the McDaniel and Cochran campaigns, as voters may associate the spots with the candidate they are supporting, Taggart said. Beyond Jackson Stations in smaller markets have also seen a surge of political ads. And even in that top 50 TV market, political ads have disrupted schedules and impacted local clients.
