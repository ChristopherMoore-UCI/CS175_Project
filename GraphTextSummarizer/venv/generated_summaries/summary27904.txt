James Doty, chairman of the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, said last week that China might agree to allow it to observe the audits of Chinese companies listed in the US. The restructuring of the China operations of foreign auditing firms, including the "Big Four", threatened to fuel concerns by forcing them to replace all of their foreign partners with Chinese partners. Chinese auditing standards have come under fire over the past year after a number of fraud allegations against Chinese companies listed in overseas markets. After the rash of accounting scandals at Chinese firms, the US government had asked Beijing to open its doors to the US body that oversees the auditors of publicly listed companies. Up to 40 per cent of their partners in China will be allowed to continue operating without Chinese qualifications this year, the finance ministry said.
