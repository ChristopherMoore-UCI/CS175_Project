The U.S. government has requested Russia expel Snowden. Nevertheless, the United States has sent provisional arrest warrants to a number of countries where Snowden could either transit or seek asylum, a U.S. official said last week. "Therefore, I think this issue will be resolved within a week and after this, the question of granting him temporary asylum will be decided upon." A former National Security Agency contractor, Snowden admittedly leaked documents to the media that exposed sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs. The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give Snowden asylum, and Nicaragua's president said he would offer it "if circumstances permit. " UK intelligence agency did not break law, post-Snowden inquiry finds Snowden appears likely to try to avoid the chance of U.S. capture even if Russia grants him papers to leave.
