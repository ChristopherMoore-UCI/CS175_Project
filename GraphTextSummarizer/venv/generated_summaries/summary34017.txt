" Upon searching the car, Neibert found "a large amount of brake dust and brake pad material in and around the wheels," the report said. The memo said before Sikes' vehicle could be tested, technicians had to replace rotors, brakes and pads, as the pads and rotors were worn down. For about 20 minutes, Sikes said, he was unable to gain control of the car as it reached speeds in excess of 90 mph on a winding, hilly portion of Interstate 8 outside of San Diego. In the police report, responding Officer Todd Neibert said he "could smell the heated brakes which indicated they had been used extensively" and said he saw the brake lights periodically illuminate as he came upon the car. -- The California Highway Patrol officer who responded last week to an emergency call about a runaway Toyota Prius described the driver as visibly shaking and said he "appeared to be in shock" once the car came to a stop, according to the police report released Wednesday.
