President and co-founder of Emotiv Systems, Tan Le, said the brain-to-computer interface was undoubtedly the future for video games. "Being able to control a computer with your mind is the ultimate quest of human-machine interaction. What do you think video games of the future will look like? But, for the creators, what possibilities does this open up for future video games? American gaming analyst Todd Greenwald believes it may be some time yet before brain to computer interfaces reach a marketable standard, saying it is "a bit too far out and speculative to say with any confidence". The era of thought controlled games has arrived, and soon you could be required only to 'think' to operate a video game.
