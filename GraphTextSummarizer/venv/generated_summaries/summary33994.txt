At a court appearance in July shortly after Harris-Moore's capture, his lawyer said his client does not want to be considered a role model, despite Facebook sites dedicated to him with thousands of fans. -- Accused "barefoot bandit" Colton Harris-Moore was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in connection with a series of airplane and boat thefts in the Pacific northwest, federal prosecutors in Washington state said. On Wednesday, Harris-Moore was indicted on five counts, including interstate transportation of a stolen aircraft for allegedly flying a Cessna aircraft from Bonners Ferry, Idaho, to near Granite Falls, Washington on September 29, 2009, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle said. Another charge relates to allegations that he stole a 34-foot boat in Ilwaco, Washington, and sailed to Oregon on May 31, 2010, the indictment says. The teen had been on the run since he walked away from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008, according to court records.
