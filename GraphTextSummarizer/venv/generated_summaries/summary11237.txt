North Korea has denied any involvement in the sinking of the Cheonan, calling the results of the preliminary report "sheer fabrication," according to its official Korea Central News Agency. "The ROK Navy ship Cheonan was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack while conducting a normal mission in the vicinity of Baengnyeong Island at 09:22 p.m. on March 26, 2010," the English-version of the report says in its conclusion, according to a Korea Times report. Investigators said that could be because the torpedo parts were too small to hold trace explosives, according to a Korea Herald report. -- South Korea's final report on the March sinking of the warship Cheonan reaffirms that a North Korean torpedo sent the ship to the bottom of the Yellow Sea, killing 46 sailors. For instance, while investigators found traces of explosives on the hull of the Cheonan, no trace of explosives was found on torpedo parts recovered from the scene.
