Live blog: Latest developments in Pistorius trial Doctor back on the stand Friday was the fifth day of the Pistorius murder trial, with the defense trying to chip away at testimony of a neighbor who rushed to the track star's home the night he shot Steenkamp. Another witness who testified Friday, former Pistorius girlfriend Samantha Taylor, said their relationship ended when he cheated on her with Steenkamp. On Friday, Stipp said the screams came "slightly from the left." Pistorius broke down in court Thursday as Stipp said he went to Pistorius' residence after hearing the shots. The doctor was later cross-examined by defense attorney Roux, who said Steenkamp could not have been the one screaming at the time Stipp heard the cries of a woman out of her mind with fear. Pistorius pleaded not guilty Monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing on Valentine's Day 2013 as well as two gun indictments unrelated to her death.
