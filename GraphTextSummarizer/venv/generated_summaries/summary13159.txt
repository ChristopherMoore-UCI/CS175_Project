Read the exact transcript of the Reddit AMA here User mimicthefrench posted how funny it is to imagine "President Obama sitting in the oval office giggling and looking at photos of cats." Several other verification items also confirmed it, including a tweet from the official Barack Obama Twitter account and a photo on Reddit of the president seated at a plain wooden desk, staring into an Apple laptop in front of a single lamp. "Hi I'm Barack Obama, President of the United States," Obama posted on the site by way of introduction. When President Barack Obama decided to take questions directly over social media he didn't turn to his 28 million Facebook fans, or his 19 million Twitter followers. User Druken_Economist posted "moderators and admins have confirmed this thread; this is actually President Obama."
