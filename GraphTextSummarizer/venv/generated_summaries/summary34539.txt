During his upcoming speech to Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will lay out the details of what he understands to be the nuclear agreement between world powers and Iran, hoping it will prompt lawmakers to question the administration and delay the March 24 deadline for a political agreement. Intelligence and national security officials, this official said, met last week with National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Wendy Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator for the Iran talks. However, in congressional testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee last week, Secretary of State John Kerry said, "Anybody running around right now jumping in to say, 'Well, we don't like the deal' or this or that, doesn't know what the deal is. The official suggested Netanyahu would urge lawmakers in his Tuesday address to pressure the Obama administration to push the deadline so more discussion can take place about what he perceives is a dangerous deal that leaves Iran with the ability to develop a nuclear weapon down the line. He described the Prime Minister's speech as a "last chance" to speak directly to Congress before a March 24 deadline for a political framework agreement about the elements believed to be in the deal.
