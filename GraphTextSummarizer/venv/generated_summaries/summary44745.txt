Giving a joint news conference with Karzai, Hollande said he had come to tell French troops that "their task has come to an end in Afghanistan. This visit follows Hollande's announcement at the NATO conference in Chicago that French combat troops would withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of the year. He spoke after meeting with French troops stationed there and holding talks with the country's president, Hamid Karzai. Hollande's trip to Afghanistan takes place in the same month as President Barack Obama's visit to the country on the anniversary of the killing of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. "After 10 years of European military engagement in Afghanistan, now Afghan security forces are taking the responsibility of their own security, and it is time for us to leave," Hollande said.
