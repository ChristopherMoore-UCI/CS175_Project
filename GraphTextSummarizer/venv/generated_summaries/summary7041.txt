Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the South Africa's system of racial segregation. -- Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president 14 years ago, says the ailing revered statesmen will pull through. Mbeki is the second president in South Africa's post-apartheid era ushered in by Mandela. Mandela, 94, is considered the founding father of South Africa's modern democracy. A court document released recently revealed that Mandela's health had declined so sharply on June 26 that his family was considering whether to take him off life support.
