The Dean of Westminster will conduct the service, and Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams will marry the couple, the palace said. After the wedding, the couple will go to Buckingham Palace for the reception, which will have guests "drawn from the congregation representing the couple's official and private lives," the palace said.
