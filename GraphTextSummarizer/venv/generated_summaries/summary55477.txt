Kaltenborn, 41, has been CEO of Sauber -- sixth in last year's team championship -- since 2010, but in October she also took over from Peter Sauber as team principal, putting her in charge of performance on the track as well as the business operation. "As team principal you have a very exposed position at the track side," said Kaltenborn. Kaltenborn's first full season in charge begins with the Australian Grand Prix on March 17. The team is Sauber and the woman in charge is Monisha Kaltenborn, an Indian-born lawyer who has risen to the top in this male-dominated sport. The commission promotes women drivers in the FIA's karting and rally championships and has a network of national coordinators encouraging girls and women in their countries.
