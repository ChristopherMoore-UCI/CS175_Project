Spain Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, has been treated with the anti-influenza drug Avigan, hospital sources with knowledge of the case said Saturday. Health screenings to help prevent the spread of Ebola began Saturday for some travelers to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport but an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that nothing can "get the risk to zero. English medical professionals, such as doctors and ambulance drivers, participated in a nationwide drill on Saturday on the handling of Ebola cases. Those suspected of possible Ebola exposure will be referred to a CDC public health officer for additional screening. Health officials have warned the screenings will likely catch some people with fevers, but not Ebola, and could miss some with Ebola as symptoms can take up to 21 days to appear.
