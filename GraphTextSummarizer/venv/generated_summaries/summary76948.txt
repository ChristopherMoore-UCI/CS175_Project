"We are working to expedite new shipments of Tamiflu OS to distributors as new supplies become available." Genentech, which makes the antiviral known as Tamiflu Oral Suppression (Tamiflu OS), the liquid version of the drug, says there have been temporary delays in new shipments. "We experienced an increase in demand due to a higher prevalence of influenza Type B in the season," Genentech spokeswoman Tara Iannuccillo said in an e-mail. "Patients can speak to their pharmacist about the option of having the pharmacy compound Tamiflu capsules into a liquid," DeAngelis said in an e-mail. Ora-Sweet is a sweet and thick syrup that is the base of many liquid versions of children's medicine.
