Comparing his situation to that of Cristiano Ronaldo, who is poised to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid after a glorious spell at Old Trafford, the 22-year-old was quoted as saying: "The absence of titles at Arsenal is what angers me the most. The Spain midfielder has been linked with moves to former club Barcelona and big-spending Real Madrid in recent days, and was quoted in a report on Thursday berating his team-mates' "impotence" in their attempts to win silverware. "It is a fact that we have not won a trophy for four years and yes, I am angry about that, but that anger stems from the deep deep desire I have to win things with Arsenal," he said. However, Fabregas has hit back at suggestions he could be ready to quit the Emirates Stadium and told www.arsenal.com: "I'm not sure how many times I need to talk directly about my commitment to Arsenal as I continue to say the same thing over and over again, but it appears that every time I have spoken to the Spanish media recently, my words have bounced back to England, leaving question marks about my future. I am wholeheartedly committed to Arsenal and my future lies with this great club."
