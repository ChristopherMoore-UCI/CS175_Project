"I assume this is a business decision on the part of both Fox News and on Gov. Palin's part." Begala, though, did give Palin praise for her TV gig. "I do think maybe it suggests, sadly for Democrats, that she might not be running," said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. Mary Matalin, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, is now a CNN contributor alongside her husband James Carville and Begala -- top Democratic aides to then President Clinton. " On MSNBC, former Florida GOP Rep. Joe Scarborough now hosts his own TV show called "Morning Joe." "Let's first hope for [Fox News President] Roger Ailes' sake that she doesn't quit that job the way she quit her job as governor of Alaska," Begala joked.
