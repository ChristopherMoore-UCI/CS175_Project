Calzetta and juror Maico Cardona said they were haunted by pictures they viewed -- especially pictures of the Petit daughters. " Jurors recommended Monday that Steven Hayes, 47, should die for his role in the 2007 invasion of a home in Cheshire, Connecticut, that left Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, dead along with her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. Both Calzetta and Cardona said they did not buy the defense's claim that Hayes was merely a follower and KomisarjevskyCalzetta said. Jurors also praised the Petit family, saying they spoke to William Petit and others after the trial.
