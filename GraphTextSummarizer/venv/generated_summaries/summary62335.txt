Hundreds of airstrikes on Gaza followed, but the real victory here might have been the combat debut of Iron Dome, the U.S.-funded defense shield that kept dozens of Hamas rockets from hitting Israeli civilians. "For a civilian president in Egypt perceived as a weak leader, he has, much to everyone's surprise, delivered," says Aaron David Miller, a Middle East scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center. "Hamas has emerged stronger, it has consolidated its control over Gaza and it has gained now more legitimacy," explains Miller. Egypt and Morsy proved 'pivotal' in Gaza cease-fire talks Morsy proved he has the leverage necessary to bring Hamas to the table and get its leadership to agree to a cease-fire. And then there's Iran, on the outside looking in but always a player when it comes to Hamas.
