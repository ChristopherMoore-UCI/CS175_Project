" Strive for College pairs high-school students with college students for free, one-on-one consultation over a yearlong period. The former foster child had never considered college as part of her future when she was encouraged to attend her first Strive for College session in her junior year of high school. They just couldn't devote themselves to students who failed to approach them about college -- the very students who Carter felt needed this help the most. "But it's that amazing near-peer connection of young people with young people ... helping them through a process you just went through yourself, and taking the mystery and anxiety out of it, that I think is really important." Strive for College also aims to help students graduate with the least amount of student loan debt possible, ensuring stronger graduation rates and enhancing the college experience. With the help of high-school administrators, Strive for College targets youth who attend schools where 50% or more of the students are eligible to receive free or reduced lunch.
