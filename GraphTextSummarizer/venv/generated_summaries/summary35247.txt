And Bauer credited Sesame Workshop with finding a unique way of getting kids to stand in the best spot for the Kinect to be effective. Using the motion sensor and voice-recognition software in Microsoft's Kinect system for Xbox, children will be able to interact with two popular shows for young viewers: "Nat Geo WILD" and "Sesame Street." The idea behind these two new game/TV applications -- "Kinect Sesame Street" and 'Kinect Nat Geo TV' -- is to have characters in the programs talk to the kids and help them participate in show activities. Fitzpatrick said his company has worked hard to layer interactivity into their shows for "Kinect Sesame Street TV." Fitzpatrick said Sesame Workshop learned a lot about what kids will do in front of a television when prompted, which will help them develop new interactive content for the future.
