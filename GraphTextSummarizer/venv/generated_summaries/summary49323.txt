Rep. Peter Rodino said, "Every American who cares about other Americans, who cares about civil rights and equal opportunity, who cares about clean air and clean water, who cares about poor people and old people and helpless people, ought to care about the 1982 House elections." While many Americans don't like government, many understand and support the need for temporary assistance as people try to make ends meet. These tax positions create room for Democrats to challenge Republicans as being more supportive of helping the wealthy than average Americans. With economic concerns front and center for most Americans, Democrats won't be able to make much headway with talk about the foreign policy successes of this administration. At the same time, congressional Republicans have made it difficult to extend the payroll tax holiday that has benefited lower and middle income workers.
