Security forces need better equipment. The country's new Interior Minister, Mohammad Omar Daudzai, said that 1,792 Afghan policemen had lost their lives and more than 2,500 had been injured since March. -- Police deaths in Afghanistan have doubled this year after NATO forces handed over security responsibility to poorly equipped and poorly trained local security forces. The situation illustrates the difficulties local forces face as NATO and American troops largely exit the county by the end of 2014. Local police suffer because they lack modern weapons, armored vehicles and adequate training, he said.
