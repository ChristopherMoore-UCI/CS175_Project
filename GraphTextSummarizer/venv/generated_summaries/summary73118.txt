There are many people, my colleagues, who will confirm this," the news agency quoted Tamerlan Eskerkhanov as saying in Moscow's Basmanny District Court. Bortnikov said those detained are from the southern region of the North Caucasus, which for years has been a hotbed of unrest and rebellion against Moscow. Putin has been informed of the arrests in connection with Nemtsov's death, Russian media said, citing Federal Security Service director Alexander Bortnikov. Later Saturday, a southern Russian law enforcement official told state news agency RIA Novosti that two more men were arrested. One of those arrested claims to have an alibi, according to Russia's Sputnik News.
