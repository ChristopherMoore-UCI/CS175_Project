-- Manchester United, the world's most famous soccer team, fired manager David Moyes on Tuesday, less than a year after hiring him to replace football legend Sir Alex Ferguson. Moyes took over the team that won the Premier League last year. Soccer commentators have been pointing out for months that Moyes is actually doing slightly better than Ferguson did in his first season as manager, starting in 1986, but Ferguson was taking over a 20th-place club on the way up. Manchester United is on track for its lowest finish in Premier League history. 57 points: With 34 Premier League games under his belt, Moyes has won 17, drawn 6 and lost 11.
