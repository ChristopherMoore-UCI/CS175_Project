The device, suspected to be either a moored or contact mine, was discovered Tuesday evening by a swimmer off the coast of Bay Head, about halfway between New York City and Atlantic City. The Navy detonated a large device described as being similar to a mine off the coast of Bay Head, New Jersey, Wednesday morning, sending a plume of water more than 100 feet in the air. The device was mostly buried in the sand, which made it hard to identify, according to Mike Brady, public affairs officer for the Naval Weapons Station Earle. The team determined the safest time to detonate the large device, which Brady said weighed several hundred pounds, was during the next high tide at 11 a.m. Wednesday. "Out of an abundance of caution, we asked the local police to evacuate about 15 families from their homes in the immediate area while the detonation occurred," said Brady.
