About 20 people, including members of Parveen's immediate family, attacked her with bricks Tuesday outside a court building in Lahore, police said. In December, Parveen's mother died, and her father and brothers decided Parveen, who came from a village in Punjab, should instead marry a cousin, police said. Human rights activists said bystanders, including police, often don't intervene because the killings are considered family matters. Iqbal, a neighbor of Parveen's family, said he and Parveen were supposed to marry with the family's approval last year. The prevalence of violence against women in Pakistan became apparent Thursday when Parveen's husband, Mohammad Iqbal, revealed to CNN that he killed his first wife six years ago so he could marry Parveen.
