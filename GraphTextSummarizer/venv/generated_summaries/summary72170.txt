It seems that the way society views women in Mosul and much of the surrounding Nineveh province is reflected in the attitude towards women's participation in sports. "However, all the teams are found in Nineveh Plain because of the better security situation in the area as well as the positive social views about female athletes, which is almost free of perceptions of inferiority." Duaa Sabhan, 22, a talented and enthusiastic athlete, said that wearing the hijab did not prevent her from taking part in sports. "However, this did not prevent women from exercising and participating in sports tournaments. I also do not like the idea of women wearing sports uniforms." He also believes that family disapproval and social conditions prevent more women participating in sport, as well as more of them wearing hijab (head scarves)
