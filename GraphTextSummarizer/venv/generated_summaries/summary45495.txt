At least nine people statewide suffered injuries -- four minor ones in Oden, three in Clark County and two hurt by a lightning strike in Benton County -- state emergency management spokesman Tommy Jackson told CNN. The National Weather Service, in fact, noted there were reports of tornadoes in at least seven communities in western Arkansas -- as far west as Polk, as far south as Garland County, and as far north as Oden. There are personnel on the scene, but officials have no confirmed reports of damage from the incident, Tulsa County emergency management official Kaitlyn Cross said. Oklahoma weather experts also noted reports of half-dollar-size hail. CNN's Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.
