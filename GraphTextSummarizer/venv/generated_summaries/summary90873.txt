Xinjiang, a resource-rich and strategically located region in northwest China, for years has been beset by ethnic violence, which the government blames on "fenliefenzi" ("separatists"). The ETIM has been accused by the China and the U.S. of having ties with al Qaeda, but security analysts disagree on whether such ties actually exist. The police later blamed the knife and bomb attacks on members of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Islamist group founded in 1993 by Uighur militants seeking an independent state in Xinjiang called East Turkistan. Authorities blame separatists for fomenting violence, but critics of China's policies say the root of the problem is widespread alienation among the region's Muslim Uighur population who resent strict controls on religion and local culture. In 2006, the U.S. captured 22 Uighur militants fighting in Afghanistan with suspected links to al Qaeda.
