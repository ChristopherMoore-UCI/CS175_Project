Ryan Ferguson was just a teenager when he was arrested in Missouri in 2004, accused of killing Columbia Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt three years earlier. His release came hours after Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster announced he would not retry Ferguson. " "I feel like Jay Leno or something," a beaming Ferguson joked to cheering supporters after his release. Last year, the same friend admitted in court that he lied, as did a janitor who originally placed Ferguson at the crime scene. Implicated by a former friend who said he had dream-like memories of committing the crime, Ferguson was convicted in 2005 for Heitholt's murder and given a 40-year sentence.
