Soul singer Solomon Burke has died at the age of 70 in the Netherlands, his Dutch representative said Sunday. Burke died of natural causes after arriving at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, his family said in a statement posted on Burke's website. Hailed by Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler as "the greatest soul singer of all time," Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. He joined the Atlantic Records stable in 1960, putting him in the company of Ray Charles, Ben E. King and Wilson Pickett. He had top R&B hits in 1965 with "Got to Get You Off of My Mind," and "Tonight's the Night," the rock museum says in Burke's biography.
