"We were sitting around with some friends at work and we randomly ended up reenacting a scene from the Sistine Chapel," the pair wrote in an email to CNN. Both men are art lovers and avid photographers outside of work too. Chris Limbrick and Francesco Fragomeni started making what they call "painting remixes" in early November. The side-by-side mashups of everything from Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" to Frida Kahlo's 1943 self-portrait "Thinking About Death" have gathered thousands of followers on their website, Tumblr and Instagram pages. Chris texted the photo to his mom, who then stitched our shot together with a photograph from the actual Sistine Chapel and texted it back to Chris."
