The latest came Monday, when a 90-year-old man was found dead in his home in suburban New Orleans, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich said. Isaac struck the Gulf Coast south of New Orleans as a Category 1 hurricane early Wednesday, the seventh anniversary of the devastating Hurricane Katrina. -- Many residents returning to their homes in southern Louisiana after Hurricane Isaac will find little comfort. St. John the Baptist Parish, west of New Orleans, suffered extensive flooding after Isaac struck the northern Gulf Coast last week. Standing water can serve as ripe breeding ground for mosquitoes and the city of New Orleans urged residents to take care to protect themselves against West Nile virus, which has killed at least nine people in the state this year.
