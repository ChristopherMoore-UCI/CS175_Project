VNS reported that Vietnam's Foreign Ministry had sent "diplomatic notes" to the embassies of Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia in Hanoi, asking for assistance in finding the missing ship. The Sunrise 689 was carrying 18 crew and 5,200 tonnes of oil when it left Singapore's Horizon port on October 2, according to the Vietnamese News Service (VNS). Sunrise 689 had been expected to arrive at Con Son island in southern Vietnam on Sunday, October 5, VNS said. "The recent increase in the number of successful hijackings is a cause for concern," IMB director Pottengal Mukundanm said at the time. -- Vietnamese authorities are searching for an oil tanker feared to have been taken by pirates just 40 minutes after it departed Singapore for Vietnam almost one week ago.
