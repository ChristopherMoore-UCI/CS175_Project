While cities on the East Coast struggle to keep utility bills low for residents during cold winter months, our hot summer months can cause a significant economic burden on Phoenix residents. But the picture in Phoenix, Arizona, is clear: Because of ARRA, key projects are under way, our environment is improving -- and thousands of people are going back to work. The debate of whether or not the stimulus has in fact "stimulated" our economy will continue for months, and possibly years to come. The Lovato family in central Phoenix was the first family of 1,200 households that will benefit from the city's $7.2 million ARRA weatherization grant during the next three years. Scott Lovato, who lives with his wife, Angela, and two children, Christian, 13 and Sarai, 11, commented, "At a time when the economy really stinks and people were out of work, a lot of people were working on this," he said.
