Sarah Bajc, partner of American passenger Philip Wood, told CNN's "New Day" that she believes Malaysian authorities have more information they're not releasing. The Malaysian government's decided to release the data now, said Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce on CNN's "New Day." An international group of experts is reviewing the data from Inmarsat and examining an analysis of the plane's performance -- and that enterprise could take two to three more weeks, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan told CNN Tuesday. On Tuesday the Malaysian authorities published a 47-page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the airliner that went missing March 8 and Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company. "It is very technical and we are not experts, so we may ask some other people who can help us," said Steven Wang on CNN Tuesday.
