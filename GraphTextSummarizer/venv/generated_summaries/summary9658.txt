While little is known about Shalit's day-to-day conditions, the fact he appears healthy -- if thin and wan -- is promising, said Walter Busuttil, a physician and retired Royal Air Force wing commander who was part of a clinical team that rehabilitated British hostages released from Lebanon in 1991, among them Terry Waite, a former envoy to the archbishop of Canterbury. A few details emerged later as his father, Noam Shalit, addressed the throng of reporters gathered outside the family's home in northern Israel. The 477 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Shalit were also reunited with family and friends  -- many of them after long periods in detention. Only 19 at the time of his capture in June 2006, Shalit was known to few outside his circle of family, friends and fellow soldiers. Roxana Saberi, an Iranian-American journalist who was released four months into an eight-year jail term after being convicted of spying in Iran, offered some advice to freed American hikers Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal last month that may also be of use to Shalit as he seeks to make sense of his new reality.
