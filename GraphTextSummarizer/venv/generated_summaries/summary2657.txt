-- Mid-table English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers want to sign former world player of the year Ronaldinho and persuade football icon David Beckham to come to them on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy. Rovers' manager Steve Kean said the prospect of AC Milan star Ronaldinho and Beckham coming to Ewood Park during the January transfer window was a sign of the ambition shown by the club's new Indian owners. Ronaldinho, who was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 2004 and 2005, has struggled to recapture his best form at the San Siro and has also been linked with a likely return to former club Gremio in Brazil. "In some areas it has been perceived and written about as if it is something of a negative, but I just can't see that." Former Real Madrid and Manchester United midfielder Beckham, who has been linked with a return to England during the Major League Soccer close season, has emerged as another target for Rovers. Poultry giants Venky's took control of the Blackburn in November and sacked former boss Sam Allardyce the following month when they handed the role to Kean.
