-- President Barack Obama flies across the Atlantic on Wednesday for a trip that takes him to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office. Bush has made multiple visits to Africa since leaving office, and will be in Zambia next week, where he's working with his global health initiative to renovate a cervical cancer screening and treatment center. Mandela, who emerged from prison after 27 years to lead South Africa out of its dark days of apartheid, is considered the father of modern day South Africa. While the 44th and 43rd president are not scheduled to meet, first lady Michelle Obama and her predecessor, Laura Bush, will attend the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania on July 2. He arrives in South Africa on Saturday, where he will spend the weekend taking part in a host of activities, including meeting with the nation's leaders and visiting Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his prison term.
