The attack follows a restructuring of Yemen's security forces, which was insisted upon by the new president, Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, as part of the negotiated deal that saw Saleh given immunity from prosecution in exchange for stepping down from office. It was the latest attack in recent months by forces loyal Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down in February after protesters took to the streets in mass demonstrations calling for his ouster. Officials accused the former commander of Yemen's air force -- a relative of Saleh who was ousted in a military shakeup -- of leading an assault in April on the country's main airport. Sixty-two members of the Republican Guard will stand trial for their alleged roles in Tuesday's assault on the ministry in the capital city of Sanaa, said Gen. Ali al-Obaidi of the High Security Committee. In the wake of the attack on the ministry, a weapons ban was implemented across the city with only those participating in government missions allowed to carry guns.
