The images of Natalia Zakharova leading her photographer boyfriend, Murad Osmann, toward exotic, picturesque locations around the globe took off last year, and Osmann's Instagram account now has more than 1.1 million followers. All the images are taken in the same style: from Murad's perspective showing just his extended arm and Natalia's back against beautiful backdrops. The project started accidentally in 2011 during a holiday in Barcelona when Natalia got frustrated with snap-happy Murad, who was pre-occupied taking pictures of the city. Now, the Hong Kong Tourism Board has commissioned the pair to lure more Russian tourists to the city. Out of the 54 million tourist arrivals in Hong Kong last year, 223,664 came from Russia.
