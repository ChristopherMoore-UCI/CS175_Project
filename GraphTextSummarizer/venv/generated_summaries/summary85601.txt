He is now in Pinellas County Jail awaiting his initial court appearance. The suspect -- identified by the sheriff's office as Anthony Giancola -- was taken into police custody after being tracked down by K-9 unit members. The suspect fled the scene and headed toward a motel in nearby Pinellas Park, where a man and woman were assaulted, authorities said. Barreda explained that the sheriff's office is only responsible for levying charges in certain areas, adding that Giancola could face more charges from police in other jurisdictions for the alleged assaults and hit-and-runs. In February 2007, when he was a principal at a middle school in Hillsborough County, he was caught buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer -- an exchange captured on video that happened inside his principal's office while school was in session.
