In late October, Human Rights Watch released a report on Boko Haram violence against women and girls in Nigeria. In fact, members remained active in northeastern Nigeria, and actually carried out more attacks and child abductions. The women and girls who refused to convert to Islam were physically and sexually assaulted, HRW said, and some were forced to marry their captors. On November 1, a video appeared of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau saying no cease-fire been reached. Over and over, sources told CNN's Isha Sesay that negotiations between the government and Boko Haram, the group that snatched the girls in April, were getting somewhere.
