Monis shot and killed cafe manager Tori Johnson execution-style, prompting police to storm the cafe in the early hours of December 16, Gormly said. Of the five shots fired by Man Haron Monis, a self-styled Muslim cleric who took 18 people hostage, only one found a target, counsel assisting the coroner Jeremy Gormly told the inquest. Gormly described an execution-style killing, in which Monis ordered Johnson to kneel, then "simply shot him, without further notice or warning, in the back of the head. Addressing those at the hearing, which was closed to the public but open to hostages and victims' families, Gormly outlined the events that led to the deaths of Johnson, Dawson and the gunman. At least two police bullets or bullet fragments struck Monis in the head and 11 other police bullets or fragments hit his body, killing him instantly, said Gormly.
