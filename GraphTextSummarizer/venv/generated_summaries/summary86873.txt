While Chinese students may be strong in basic education and passing exams, they are weak in creativity and innovation. They consider overhaul of the education system to be critical to China's economic growth and to achieving its goal of competing with the U.S. and other advanced countries in science, technology and innovation. To relieve students of heavy load, the Ministry of Education last August issued a 10-point decree, stipulating fewer exams, no written homework, no teaching during spare time or holidays and a compulsory hour of physical exercise daily.
