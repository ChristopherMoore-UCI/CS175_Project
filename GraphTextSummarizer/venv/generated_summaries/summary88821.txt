The Yemeni government said the attack Tuesday -- which injured 13 students, three critically, at the Seventh of July school for girls, near the embassy -- could have stemmed from a personal dispute involving the school's headmistress. The source said Yemeni investigators are also looking at this as a terrorist attack and are "energetically pursuing that line of thought. "Since this is an ongoing investigation, we are not going to talk about the specifics of the case." Earlier, a source with knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Tuesday's mortar attack in the capital city of San'a -- but unauthorized to speak on the record -- told CNN there was a "clear and strong indication" the U.S. embassy was targeted. The American Embassy in Yemen was the target of a mortar attack Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said, contradicting a suggestion from the Yemeni government the attack targeted a school where 13 were injured. The San'a city council called the incident "a horrible terrorist work" and said "the attack goes against Islamic teachings and cultural values; and no one would do such a thing except those who have weak souls," Saba reported.
