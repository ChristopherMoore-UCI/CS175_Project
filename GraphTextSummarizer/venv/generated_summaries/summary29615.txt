While the store didn't say exactly how many Archbold consumed, the owner told CNN affiliate WPLG that he was "the life of the party." "He really made our night more fun," Ben Siegel told the station. The participants' goal: consume as many insects and worms as they could to take home a $850 python. " "The consumption of insects is widely accepted throughout the world, and the insects presented as part of the contest were taken from an inventory of insects that are safely and domestically raised in a controlled environment as food for reptiles," Lirot said. In the wild, cockroaches are scavengers that pick up various bacterial organisms such as salmonella while walking through spoiled food, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene explains on its website. Edward Archbold was among 20 to 30 contestants participating in Friday night's "Midnight Madness" event at Ben Siegel Reptiles in Deerfield Beach, authorities said.
