A lot of checks and money orders have said 'tornado relief to Moore public schools.' Plaza Towers and other schools in Moore have a special place in the heart of Robert Romines. It will be the first day of school since an EF5 tornado ravaged the town this spring, killing 24 people -- including seven students at Plaza Towers Elementary school. We are about rebuilding, moving forward -- not just for the school district, but also for the community," says Romines, who is himself a product of the Moore school system. And as Moore students prepare to hit the books this week, their teachers are stocking up on supplies and readying their classrooms, thanks to donations from corporations, charities and the public.
