British supermarkets are some of the best in the world at controlling, manipulating and delivering cheap food. About 30% of fresh food is thrown away in supermarkets every day, although they will deny it. The supermarkets are not delivering cheap food, it is the farmers and producers of Britain, and now the world -- and at a cost to the environment too. All of Britain's superstar chefs had turned out for this event, but none was more important than the gentlemen who stood watching the rest of us, as we rather arrogantly walked around the room as if food would always be available  to perform tricks with, to swear at and make jokes with. There is no money in food production in Britain: The supermarkets have taken the potential for a decent living away.
