In addition to Internet sales, the company says X-Rock is sold at retail locations in Nevada, California, Florida, New York, New Jersey, South Carolina "and a few more states." "These undeclared active ingredients pose a threat to consumers because sildenafil and hydroxythiohomosildenafil may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and lower blood pressure to dangerous levels," X-Rock Industries said. Tests conducted by the Food and Drug Administration found that the supplement X-Rock contained sildenafil -- an approved drug to treat erectile dysfunction -- and related substance, hydroxythiohomosildenafil, the product's manufacturer said in a statement annoucing the voluntary recall. The voluntary recall "is being conducted with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration," X-Rock said. The announcement from the product's manufacturer, X-Rock Industries, was posted on the FDA's website.
