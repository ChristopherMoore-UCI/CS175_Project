-- World No. 1 Roger Federer began his bid for a record sixth U.S. Open title with a straight-sets victory over American Donald Young on Monday, joining Olympic champion Andy Murray in round two. Japan's 17th seed Kei Nishikori also went through along with American No. 23 "Novak to me goes in as the favorite here still at the Open just because he's defending champion, he probably won the most titles on hard courts in the last couple of years, it's where he feels most comfortable," Federer said of the Serbian, who was to start his campaign on Tuesday. The Wimbledon champion, seeking to overtake Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors as the grand slam's most successful male player of the post-1967 Open era, won 6-3 6-2 6-4 against a player who reached the fourth round last year. Croatian 12th seed Marin Cilic earned a second-round clash with Germany's Daniel Brands, while France's No. 16 Gilles Simon beat American Michael Russell.
