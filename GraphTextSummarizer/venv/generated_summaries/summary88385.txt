"It fits the strategy of turning around 180 degrees," said German gaming journalist Stephan Freundorfer. "Game makers now have to make the decision whether to make games with the Kinect."

Microsoft originally bundled the Xbox One and the Kinect system together -- saying it was the best way to enjoy entertainment on the console. Hundreds of new games are expected as more creative talent takes advantage of ID@Xbox, a publishing platform for independent developers. Independent game makers were also highlighted by the computing giant.
