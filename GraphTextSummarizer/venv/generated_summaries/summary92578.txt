The protests led to talks between government officials and the Civic Forum, a group of dissidents led by playwright Vaclav Havel. -- Fireworks and rock 'n' roll echoed across central Prague on Tuesday as thousands of marchers commemorated the 20th anniversary of the "Velvet Revolution" that toppled Communist rule. The anniversary march was capped by a concert that featured dissident musicians of the day, along with American folk singer Joan Baez. "Many of our citizens who took part in the democratic changes died already with a feeling that they contributed to something that meant a lot," Havel said Tuesday. The protest was held a week after the opening of the Berlin Wall, as pressure was building on the Communist governments of Eastern Europe.
