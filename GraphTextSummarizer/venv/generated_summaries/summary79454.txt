-- Former Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has resigned as coach of English club Fulham amid reports linking him with the vacant job at Aston Villa. This decision to leave Fulham has not been influenced by any outside party." Hughes, a former Manchester United and Barcelona striker, spent 18 months in charge at Manchester City, as the club were taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour, who has since spent around $1bn. It read: "Fulham Football Club can confirm that Mark Hughes has provided notice, under the terms of his contract, to leave the club at the end of June. He led Fulham to eighth place in the English Premier League last season and the club qualified for UEFA's Europa League competition due to their standing in Europe's fair play table. But Hughes was dismissed in December 2009 after a slump in league performances before he returned to the game to coach Fulham -- a job he claims he has done well.
