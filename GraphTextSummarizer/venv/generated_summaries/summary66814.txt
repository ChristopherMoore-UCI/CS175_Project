And because Malala is a relentless advocate of education for girls, something the Taliban find very threatening. The Taliban, with all their bravado, seem to fear women most of all. The cravenness that has come to define the group -- also known as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP -- is easily matched by Malala's stunning bravery. The Taliban reportedly had destroyed more than 200 schools and ordered all girls' schools shut down when Malala slowly emerged from obscurity. The TTP aims to impose precisely the kind of rules the Taliban forced on Afghans.
