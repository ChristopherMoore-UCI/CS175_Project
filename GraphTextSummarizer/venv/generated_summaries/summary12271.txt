Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters Tuesday that investigators believe LaMar is dead, although they have not located her body. Forensic evidence has also linked Garcia-Torres to one of three unsolved assaults in Morgan Hill in March 2009, Smith said. Forensic evidence was found "in multiple places" on LaMar's possessions, Smith said. -- Forensic evidence found on property belonging to a missing California teenager led authorities to a man suspected of kidnapping and killing her, authorities said Tuesday. "We still need your support," the girl's father, Steve LaMar, told reporters Tuesday.
