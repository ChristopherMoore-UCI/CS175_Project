The fight to block construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline through east Texas stepped up Monday as protesters locked themselves to machinery. "The pipeline has come to symbolize something much, much bigger than just one energy project, it's come to symbolize what is our energy future, and what President Obama is going to do on climate change," said activist Jane Kleeb of the anti-pipeline organization Bold Nebraska, in a state where the Keystone XL project would cut through predominantly agricultural areas. "Some peaceful protesters doing nothing more than holding signs by the road were violently pepper sprayed," said group spokesman Ron Seifert. Bill McKidden, founder of 350.org, said a demonstration in Washington on Sunday was to remind the Obama administration of its commitment to preventing fossil fuel based projects that they say are causing increased climate change. Dozens of others formed a human chain to keep heavy machinery from moving around the proposed pipeline's path in Cherokee County, said Ethan Nuss, spokesman for the Tar Sands Blockade group.
