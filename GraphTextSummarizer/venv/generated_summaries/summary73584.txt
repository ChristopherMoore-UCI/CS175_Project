There are four kinds: administrative fees, marketing fees (sometimes called 12-b1 fees), investment management fees and trading costs. But the investment industry disagrees, arguing that such costs are justified because mutual fund expenses are regulated by the competition of the free market, and what consumers are paying is simply the cost of doing business. They invest their 401(k) account equally in a stock mutual fund and a bond mutual fund, each of which charges average market fees. We need a new type of retirement account that is somewhere between a traditional pension and a 401(k) that combines some of the best features of each. According to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, the average household approaching retirement has only $100,000 in total retirement savings among all of their accounts.
