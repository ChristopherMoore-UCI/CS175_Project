The groups behind Roll Back Malaria set ambitious goals to ensure universal access to malaria medication and treated mosquito nets in Africa by the end of 2010. "Since last year, we have achieved enormous progress in many countries by donating money, assistance and monitoring progress," executive director of Roll Back Malaria, professor Awa-Marie Coll-Seck, told CNN. Richard Feachem is director of the Global Health Group, an organization launched to design malaria control programs in developing countries. As the second World Malaria Day approaches, how successful has the Roll Back Malaria partnership been in its aims? Last year on April 25, the World Malaria Day initiative was launched to raise awareness of the disease and efforts to control malaria around the world, as part of the Roll Back Malaria partnership -- a global group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments.
