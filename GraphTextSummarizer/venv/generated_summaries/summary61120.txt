-- The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Green Bay Packers on Sunday in Arrowhead Stadium, ending the defending Super Bowl champions' quest for a perfect season. Sunday's win was the first under interim head coach Romeo Crennel. Despite the loss -- the Packers' first in 20 games -- Green Bay remains firmly atop the NFC standings. The Colts, previously 0-13, have been struggling without star quarterback Peyton Manning as he recovers from neck surgery. Kansas City executives on Monday fired head coach Todd Haley after the team lost four of its previous five games.
