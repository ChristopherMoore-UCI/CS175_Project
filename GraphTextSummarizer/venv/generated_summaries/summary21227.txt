Photos have already surfaced of a bro dressed as former Baltimore Raven Ray Rice and dragging around a lifeless doll meant to stand in for domestic violence victim Janay Rice. Janay Rice, a real person with actual feelings, weighed in on the tastelessness: "@TMZ it's sad, that my suffering amuses others. "Prom night toilet baby" was a popular costume after a spate of girls gave birth to secret babies at school, and a bloodied duo strolled into a party dressed as Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman just last year. This year, for just $59.99 on one costume e-tailer, sexy Ebola containment suit can be yours. So maybe shelve the brilliant ideas that involve dead celebrities, biohazards, missing plane passengers, terrorists and domestic abusers.
