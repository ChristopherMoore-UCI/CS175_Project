Once upon a time, the n-word and f-word were utterly acceptable terminology in undermining not only the basic rights but basic humanity of black people and gay people. Our notion of our nation expanded over time to include black people and women and gay people and others who were most marginalized previously. " Today, opponents of immigration reform attack undocumented immigrants as "illegal immigrants." When I tweeted that I was "consistently troubled by [the] number of people who seem to feel more compassion toward puppies on the Internet than undocumented humans," among the many blistering replies I received was, "Do the internet puppies have scabies...?" And as we look back on the 45th anniversary of the landmark gay liberation protests set off at the Stonewall Bar in New York, we remember protests where gay men and lesbians carried signs that simply said, "GAY IS GOOD." Today, most people find the n-word and the f-word incredibly offensive.
