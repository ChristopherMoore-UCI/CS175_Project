-- A leader of a high-profile campaign pushing for women to drive in Saudi Arabia says she's suing traffic police in order to get a driver's license. "It's just creating positive pressure on the officials to get back to us -- and it will encourage more women to apply for licenses and file lawsuits," she said. There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia. She was detained, spent nine days in jail and quickly became an icon of the "Women2Drive" campaign, an initiative demanding the right for women to drive and travel freely in Saudi Arabia. A Facebook page organizing a campaign for women to drive last June included a banner that read, "We are all Manal Sharif," and a quote from King Abdullah stating that "the day will come when women will be able to drive."
