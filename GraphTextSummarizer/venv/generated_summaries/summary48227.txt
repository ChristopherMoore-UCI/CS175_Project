A judge warned actress Lindsay Lohan Wednesday that the only way she can avoid jail on a theft charge is to be acquitted in a trial. Lohan lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley previously said her client would welcome a plea deal, but only if it did not involve jail time for the actress. If Lohan is convicted on the felony grand theft charge, her "ability at that time to have more input in the sentence could be lessened," the judge told Lohan Wednesday. The rehab stint persuaded the judge not to send Lohan to jail for failing a drug test. "Ms. Lohan maintains her innocence, and now that I've seen the police reports, I believe the case is entirely defensible," Holley said after the initial hearing.
