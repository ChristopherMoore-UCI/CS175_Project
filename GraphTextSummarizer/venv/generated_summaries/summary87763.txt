Republicans also offer Latinos a full menu of conservative selling points: strong defense, smaller government, lower taxes, pro-life judges and a defense of traditional marriage. As dysfunctional as the modern-day Republican Party is with regard to immigration -- in large part, because it has basically volunteered to be the party of white Americans who are freaked out over shifting demographics -- the GOP offers Latinos quite a bit in other areas. But the truth is that, despite what some liberals want Latinos to believe, the GOP offers a lot to that community. That's what Hillary Clinton did when, during the 2008 presidential campaign, she told Hispanic voters gathered in a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas that the problems of all Americans are interconnected despite that "we treat them as though one is guacamole and one is chips. Bill Clinton loved Mexican food and consumed it with gusto.
