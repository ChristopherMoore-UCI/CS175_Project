An El Nino event occurs about once every three to seven years, said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. An El Nino event would likely mean more shear -- wind speeds that increase with height -- in the upper levels of the atmosphere during hurricane season. Because El Nino warms up the atmosphere as a whole, we may see a mini global warming phenomenon, Trenberth said. California would also benefit if El Nino conditions develop and continue into the winter. The moistened atmosphere invigorates storms, Trenberth said, changing where hurricanes and typhoons occur.
