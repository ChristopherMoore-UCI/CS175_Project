Applied to Hollywood, the rule would stipulate that women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds be considered or even interviewed when hiring film directors. For female directors, the financing structure, subject matter, and even perceived confidence of filmmakers creates a barrier to career progress. It also comes from groups and individuals -- male and female -- who long to see more women headlining major Hollywood films. Interestingly, only 28% of movies in 2013 depicted a female lead or co-lead. Putting women front and center in film is the exception, not the rule.
