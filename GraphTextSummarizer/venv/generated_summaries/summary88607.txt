" Report shows lavish spending at IRS conference The move came just one day after an audit of the agency showed the IRS spent millions of taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos at the 2010 conference. The employees were not identified in a Wednesday statement from IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel, nor were the exact circumstances of their alleged wrongdoing detailed. The beleaguered agency -- already snared in controversy over its targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- spent $4.1 million on the conference, with "questionable expenses" comprising much of the budget, according to the report released Tuesday by the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration. -- The Internal Revenue Service has placed two employees on administrative leave in connection with a 2010 conference in Anaheim, California, which cost millions of taxpayer dollars. "When I came to IRS, part of my job was to hold people accountable," Werfel said in the statement.
