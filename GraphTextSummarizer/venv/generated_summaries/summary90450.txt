The dress that Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar last year for "Twelve Years a Slave," reported stolen Wednesday from her room in the swanky London Hotel off Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. You know, the white custom Calvin Klein gown that adorned actress Lupita Nyong'o when she attended Sunday's Academy Awards. This was an amazing collaboration between the brand and Lupita and the dress looked truly exquisite on her," Francisco Costa, Women's Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection, said in a press release. The L.A. Sheriff's Department got a tip Friday and looked in an abandoned bathroom on the second floor of the same London Hotel, the department said in a press release. Calvin Klein also expressed guarded enthusiasm over the dress's potential return.
