In a statement, the ANC Youth League called on the government "to urgently put in place measures that will remedy the situation of many prospective students and fewer admission spaces in institutions of higher learning not only in U.J. (University of Johannesburg), but across institutions of higher learning in South Africa. " The situation is reaching crisis level, with the number of places available for higher education students now far less than the number of people qualified to take them, the statement said. There are not enough jobs, places at university, or alternatives like vocational colleges, nor enough money to pay for it all," said Graeme Bloch, visiting adjunct professor for the School of Public and Development Management at Wits University, another Johannesburg university. -- A stampede on a university campus in Johannesburg Tuesday left one woman dead and several people injured, according to eyewitness reports. The country also suffers from high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people.
