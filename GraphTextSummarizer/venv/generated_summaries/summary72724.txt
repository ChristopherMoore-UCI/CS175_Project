The series, which features all the looks of that era -- thin-lapeled suits and skinny ties, crinoline-puffed dresses and pencil skirts, Peter Pan collars and subdued pinks and greens -- has attracted attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. "Mad Men" has gotten attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. Faye Dunaway's berets, scarves, trench coats, fitted cardigans and long pencil skirts were a hit at the time and remain so today. "Mad Men," which returns for its third season Sunday, isn't the first Hollywood creation to influence fashion trends. Star Diane Keaton wore baggy pants, dress shirts, a vest and tie in the 1977 Woody Allen film.
