Several buildings in the Mumbai area have crumbled this year, one of them with disastrous consequences. Housing rights groups say many old buildings in the city are rundown and neglected, while newer ones are often built using substandard materials and have structural problems. The building, an old construction in southern Mumbai, gave way around 6 a.m. Friday. "It's a pancake collapse," said Sachidanand Gawde, deputy commandant at the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). -- At least 13 people were killed and 26 more were injured when a five-story residential building collapsed in the Indian financial hub of Mumbai early Friday, a hospital spokesman said.
