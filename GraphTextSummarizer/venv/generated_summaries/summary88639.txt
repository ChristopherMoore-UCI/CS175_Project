Arthur Lampitt wouldn't consider himself a car aficionado, but his car was a part of him: He lived with a turn signal stuck lever in his arm for 51 years. "My bare arm set the detector off, and it raised the question of what was in my arm," Lampitt said. Lampitt, 75, of Granite City, Illinois, recalls the accident as a series of unfortunate incidents. "I got an X-ray, and it indicated there might have been some kind of tool left in there at the time of the accident. And it compared to what I remember the rod in my arm looking like on the X-ray, and I compared it to the pictures of the accident where there was nothing there, and I concluded that's what it was.
