The attacks occurred in parts of the country where armed rebel groups moved into areas considered to be pro-government but lacking in army or police protection, according to the U.N. Margot Wallstrom, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative on sexual violence in conflict, said recently that one distraught Congolese woman had told her that "a dead rat is worth more than the body of a woman. It also notes that their failure to prevent or stop the attacks was compounded by subsequent failings on the part of U.N. stabilization mission forces in Congo. Last month, a U.N. report slammed Congo's security forces for failing to prevent a wave of mass rapes over several days during the summer. "The scale and viciousness of these mass rapes defy belief," said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay. " "It was an expression of how human rights violations against women are still the lowest on a fool's hierarchy of war time horrors," she said.
