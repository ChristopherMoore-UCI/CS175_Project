-- Even though rising floodwaters were wreaking havoc along Colorado's Front Range communities on September 12, Mark Changaris and his roommate, Stephen Smith, felt safe in their upscale home high on a hillside adjacent to Flagstaff Mountain. After the rescue, Smith and Changaris worried that their own home was in danger. "There was a 4-foot wall of water with branches and debris in it," said Smith. Changaris had to strip down and dive into neck-deep water to unblock a drain filled with mud and debris. After the initial rush of water, Stephen and Mark went back to collect a few treasured items.
