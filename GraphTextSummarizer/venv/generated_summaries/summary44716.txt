The resulting data and images from radio astronomy (despite the "radio" part, you can't listen to these radio signals) have yielded a cosmic zoo of strange and exotic objects, including radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, masers, and cosmic microwave background radiation, which has provided compelling evidence for the Big Bang. The new, clever Dutch and EU-wide installation uses 15,000 low-tech receivers, supercomputer data processing and high-speed internet to form a mega-telescope capable of absorbing cosmic radio waves from the full sky at higher resolutions than ever before. But in the last 50 years, the ability to receive radio waves, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, and X- and gamma rays -- all of them at different wavelengths than visible light -- has provided new and completely unexpected information about the nature and history of the universe. With more resolution than any other telescope, the 1500 km-wide LOFAR array is opening this frontier to a broad range of astrophysical studies, including transient sources, ultra high energy cosmic rays, cosmic magnetism, and the wonderfully-named Epoch of Reionization, when the first stars and black holes made the universe hot. Hence the large footprint of most radio telescope projects, from the Giant Meter-wavelength Radio Telescope in India to the Very Large Array in New Mexico.
