-- Weeks after flooding devastated farmland and homes in the Midwest, officials in five states said Friday that initial steps are under way for possible buyouts of property in flood zones. The state of Iowa has sent a notice of interest for buyouts to affected communities, said Lucinda Robertson of the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management Division. In Indiana, people in several areas have shown interest in buyouts, according to Rachel Myer of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, and many cities and counties have begun the application process. Wisconsin Emergency Management spokeswoman Lori Getter said that state is in the "infancy stages" of what will be a one-year to 18-month process of buyouts. In Missouri, two communities have expressed interest in the buyout process, according to Susie Stonner, a public information officer for the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency.
