Leading Japanese golfers Ai Miyazoto, Mika Miyazoto and Momuku Ueda have joined forces in launching a website to aid the rescue effort in their native country following the recent earthquake and tsunami. All three players, who were in Japan when the disaster struck, have designed buttons with a Japanese logo which translates into: "Never Give Up Japan". World number six, Ai Miyazoto told a news conference: "My whole family lives in Okinawa which is way down south from Tokyo, so they are all safe. "But I went to high school in Sendai City, so I know many people over there. Current world number one Yani Tseng wore one of the buttons at her press conference for the tournament.
