The photographs are being shown as part of "Striking Resemblance: The Changing Art of Portraiture," an exhibition on display through July at Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Lokuta bought the prints a year or two ago at an antiques show in New York. Goranin bought those prints, which stand out because unlike the 445 that Lokuta has, Goranin's photographs show the man with children. He got in touch with Nakki Goranin, author of "American Photobooth." You bring to it what you know, and if we don't know anything, we sort of make up a story," said Donald Lokuta, a photography historian and owner of the collection.
