-- China's first aircraft carrier sailed out of the northeastern port of Dalian for sea trials Wednesday morning China once renounced aircraft carriers as tools of imperialism, but has been developing a blue-water navy in recent years, along with air power to back it up. Xinhua quoted military sources as saying the trials would be brief, and the carrier would return to Dalian for further refits. Only a handful of other nations operate aircraft carriers -- and only the United States, with 11, has more than two in service. It purchased the rusting, gutted shell of the Varyag, the Soviet-begun carrier now under way, from Ukraine in 1998.
