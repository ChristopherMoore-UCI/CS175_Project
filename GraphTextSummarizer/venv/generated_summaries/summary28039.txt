-- The attorney for a woman who accused Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston of raping her called Friday for a state inquiry into how authorities handled the now-closed investigation into her allegations. Carroll also questioned how investigators handled and tested evidence in the case and said investigators failed to get warrants to examine video surveillance, Winston's apartment and other potential evidence that could have proven crucial to the case. The woman came forward a month after making her initial report to accuse Winston, but Tallahassee's interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last week that she "broke off contact" with investigators in February and said she didn't want to go forward with the case. In a news conference Friday, attorney Patricia Carroll accused the Tallahassee police detective who handled the case of spending time and resources investigating her client instead of Winston. Last week, Willie Meggs, the state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit, which includes Leon County and Tallahassee, announced he would not file charges against Winston, whom the woman accused of rape in December 2012.
