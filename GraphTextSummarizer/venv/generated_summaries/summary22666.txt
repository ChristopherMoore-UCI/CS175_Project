Children with severe respiratory illnesses are flooding the emergency room of USA Children's and Women's Hospital in Mobile, Alabama, according to CNN affiliate WPMI. What parents should know about EV-D68 Doctors told WPMI that these patients are usually in the hospital for one to two days; others are being treated and released the same day. But doctors believe a particular type of enterovirus, Enterovirus D68, is causing more problems this fall than in years past. The virus is hard to track, as so many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms, and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. Enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma, which is leading to more hospitalizations.
