"We can thank crude oil for allowing gasoline to do what it has been wanting to do for weeks, which is drop," said publisher Trilby Lundberg. Even looking ahead to later in May, as the country enters peak driving season, prices might not jump if crude oil stays stable because gasoline supplies are flush, Lundberg said. As crude oil prices have stabilized, gasoline prices have fallen. Gasoline supplies are plentiful, but crude oil prices had been "propping up" gasoline costs, she said. The Lundberg Survey tabulates prices every two weeks at thousands of gas stations nationwide.
