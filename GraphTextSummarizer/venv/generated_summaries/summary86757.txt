-- Chris Brown doesn't have to worry anymore that bumping into ex-girlfriend Rihanna could get him locked up, but he still has to be careful about what he says to her. "He just can't bother her," lawyer Donald Etra, who represents Rihanna, said after Tuesday's hearing. Brown, 21, sat silently next to defense lawyer Mark Geragos in court during Tuesday's hearing. "I have told Rihanna countless times, and I'm telling you today, that I'm truly, truly sorry in that I wasn't able to handle the situation both differently and better," Brown said in the Web site statement. A protective order banning Brown from harassing, stalking or striking Rihanna stays in place, the judge said.
