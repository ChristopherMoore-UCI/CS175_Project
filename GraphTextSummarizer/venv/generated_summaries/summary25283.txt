The reality singing competition has had some upheaval at the judges table over the past few years as it's struggled with faltering ratings and the lack of any competitors who have reached the heights in the music industry of former winners Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood. That means host Ryan Seacrest and judges Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. will all be back witnessing some of the best, and worst, of America's singers. "I am thrilled our consummate host, Mr. Ryan Seacrest, is returning for Season 14, together with Jennifer, Harry and Keith," "Idol" creator and executive producer Simon Fuller said. Season 12 was rife with rumors of a feud between then judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj. Urban joined the show that season, replacing rocker Steven Tyler.
