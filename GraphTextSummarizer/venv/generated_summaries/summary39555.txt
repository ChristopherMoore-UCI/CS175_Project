Last year, after an elementary school mass shooting in Connecticut that left 20 children dead, some radio stations temporarily stopped playing Ke$ha's popular song "Die Young." And maybe that was the reason Malaysian authorities pulled the plug on her concert set for Saturday at a Kuala Lumpur stadium. -- Sultry singer Ke$ha is known for her party anthems about binge drinking and dating. Promoters Livescape Asia said they tried to comply with Malaysian rules. They even worked with the artist to "modify the show to suit the Malaysian culture and sensitivities, including having made adjustments to her song lyrics, wardrobe changes, and a set list that was modified to specifically adhere to the guidelines set forth by the authorities," the promoters said.
