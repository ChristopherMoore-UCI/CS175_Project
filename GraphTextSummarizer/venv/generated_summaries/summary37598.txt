Hartman's latest travelog begins in Minnesota, according to Bill Leeper at the Nassau County Sheriff's Office. A day after that, Hartman was again seen loitering around a security checkpoint, Phoenix police said. Hartman has been charged with fraud/impersonation, defrauding an innkeeper and trespassing and now has a complimentary room at the Nassau County Jail. Outside the courthouse, Hartman refused to detail to reporters how she got through security. Earlier that month, she pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of stowing away a flight from San Jose, California, to Los Angeles International Airport, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.
