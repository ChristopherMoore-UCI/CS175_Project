The ex-boyfriend of American exchange student Amanda Knox says he has returned to Italy to fight his new murder conviction in the death of Knox's onetime roommate, Meredith Kercher. Prosecutors said Kercher was killed after she rejected attempts by Knox, Sollecito and another man, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, to involve her in a sex game. Both Knox and Sollecito have maintained their innocence, and their 2009 convictions led to questions about the effectiveness of Italy's justice system. Instead, that court found Knox and Sollecito guilty for a second time last week, sentencing him to 25 years. Knox, who returned to the United States after her 2009 conviction was overturned, said last week that she "will never go willingly" back to Italy.
