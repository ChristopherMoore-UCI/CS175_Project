The Estonian parliament passed one of two necessary resolutions to ratify EFSF expansion earlier this week, despite attempts by the country's main opposition party to block the changes on the grounds that one of the eurozone's poorer states simply cannot afford to help bailout failing eurozone economies. Austria -- September 27 Just weeks after opposition parties blocked the government's attempt to fast-track the EFSF bill, lawmakers approved EFSF enhancements that are expected to be officially ratified on September 30. Approval of EFSF expansion measures by Europe's largest economy -- and largest holder of Greek debt -- was seen as necessary for the bailout fund's future success. Finland -- September 28 One of the most vocal opponents of EFSF enhancement in the early going, Finland has now dropped its demand that Greece put up some cash collateral in return for its approval -- a requirement that threatened to derail the bailout fund expansion and further destabilize global markets. Netherlands -- October 3-7 Once opposed to expanding the rescue fund, the Dutch are now expected to approve enhanced EFSF measures with a parliamentary vote by the end of the first week of October -- although hardliners in the government continue to call for the private sector to take on more of the debt burden.
