Led by former Clinton aides and supporters, the super PAC also began to dish out money to state parties, local candidates and other Democratic groups, as well as helping raise money for 2014 candidates whom Clinton has endorsed. Donating money to state parties has been a Ready for Hillary strategy for much of the year. Vice President Joe Biden also has been heavily involved with helping local South Carolina politicos raise money since 2013. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley moved political staff into South Carolina in August and has been raising money for state Democrats for months. But in the third quarter of 2014, Ready for Hillary also moved to do more than just raise money and began to raise its profile in the eyes of many longtime Clinton confidants by having a large presence at events like September's Harkin Steak Fry in Indianola, Iowa.
