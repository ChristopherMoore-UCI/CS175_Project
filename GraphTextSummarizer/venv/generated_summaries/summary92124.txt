A dedicated plan to cater to the needs of urban refugees in northern Iraq is currently being drawn up with partners including UNHCR. They followed in the footsteps of the only relatives who had already fled and moved into a large settlement of improvised homes, not far from Domiz refugee camp near Dohuk. I traveled to Northern Iraq with UNICEF to report on the growing catastrophe facing Syrian children. I was surprised to find that three quarters of refugees are in Yousef's situation and do not live in formalized camps. Domiz refugee camp alone was designed for 15,000 people and is already home to 45,000.
