In an accompanying Thompson Reuters Foundation report based on the survey, Mary Crass, head of policy at the International Transport Forum, an OECD think tank, said it was worrying that women were scared to use public transport in some major cities and the poll highlighted the need for more action. "(Women) tend to be more reliant on public transport and on non-motorized means, particularly in low-income or middle-income countries, in emerging economies. In Moscow, respondents reportedly had little confidence that authorities would investigate an abuse report, while 85% of Paris women doubted fellow public transport users would come to their rescue if they were in trouble. "The emerging interest in several countries on women-only initiatives should be seen as an opportunity for improving security in cities but not as a silver bullet for dealing with gender-based violence in transportation and urban settings," Babinard told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Julie Babinard, senior transport specialist from the World Bank, says they're a short term fix and not a panacea for harassment of women.
