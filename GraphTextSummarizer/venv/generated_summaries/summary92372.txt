Kal Penn, left, with Peter Jacobson on "House," is joining the Obama White House. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Dr. Lawrence Kutner killed himself on the latest episode of "House: MD," it was the beginning of a new career for actor Kal Penn. The demise of Penn's character cleared the way for the actor to move on to another "House," the White House. Penn played a teen terrorist on Fox's "24" before joining the network's "House" two years ago. Penn said he spoke briefly with Obama after the election about "trying to find the right fit" for him in the administration.
