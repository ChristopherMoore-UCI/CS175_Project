At the end of "Saturn Parkway" in Spring Hill, Tennessee, sits the huge plant where -- as the ads touted -- "a different kind of car company" produced a "different kind of car. At City Hall, the walls are decorated with old photos of the small town Spring Hill was before Saturn came to town and what it's grown into. The factory, along with the town, have played a major role in the company's image and advertisements, even hosting tours and "reunions" for Saturn car owners. The move to shut down Saturn has left some in Spring Hill, Tennessee, disappointed and perplexed. With Saturn gone and the local plant preparing to idle, Bowman said, "Of course, it's going to hurt, but it's not going to kill Spring Hill."
