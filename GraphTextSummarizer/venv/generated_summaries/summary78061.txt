" When Katrina hit three years ago, Ascencio and his family fled New Orleans for Houston, Texas. -- Roberto Ascencio has lived in the New Orleans area for 30 years, 28 of them on the West Bank of the Mississippi River. Praying is all he or anyone leaving New Orleans can do as Hurricane Gustav makes its away across the Gulf of Mexico towards the Gulf Coast. By Sunday night, more than 1.9 million people had fled the city and its surrounding parishes, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said, many of them, like Ascencio, spending hours in traffic. After 16 hours on the road, he was closing in on Biloxi, Mississippi, about 60 miles east of New Orleans.
