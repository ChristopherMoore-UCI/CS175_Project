Ladbrokes, a British online betting company, said Monday that bettors are placing their odds on baby No. 2 to be a girl. "Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to confirm they are expecting a baby in April 2015," the website of the Prince of Wales announced Monday. The condition involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy. While we don't yet know the gender of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second baby, we now know the royal couple will become parents in April 2015. The couple's first child, Prince George, was born in July 2013.
