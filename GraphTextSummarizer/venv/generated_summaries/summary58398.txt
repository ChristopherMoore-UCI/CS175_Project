I've heard several mention that their aversion to doctors stems from the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, the study conducted between 1932 and 1972 that monitored black sharecroppers who were infected with the disease but didn't treat them, much less inform them that they had it. Men are dying earlier due to prostate cancer, heart disease, stroke and other maladies, and their actions play a large role in it. Roland Martin says men are harming their health by their reluctance to go to the doctor. Watch Roland's commentary segment Â» My dad's story is all too common to a lot of you who must deal with fathers, brothers, uncles, husbands and male cousins, church members and co-workers, who are obstinate and absolutely refuse to go to the doctor. Black men in particular drive me nuts.
