-- Mexican President Felipe Calderon outlined a series of economic recovery measures Wednesday, including freezing gasoline prices for the rest of the year and lowering natural gas prices by 10 percent. Other programs he announced also carried hefty price tags. The government will set aside 750 million pesos ($55 million) to pay 50 percent of the costs of replacing old appliances. For example, Calderon pledged 2.6 billion pesos ($193 million) to improve a Social Security program for unemployed Mexicans, increasing from two months to six months the time they will receive medical and maternity coverage. He said Mexico is in better shape this year to fight off recession than it was in previous instances.
