"The Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2001 and were recognized as a masterpiece of human creativity both in their conception and execution, bearing eloquent witness to the living cultural traditions of the Buganda. " Buganda kings have always built their palaces on strategic hills to control the major roads to the palace and find easy ways to escape in case of an invasion or rebellion. It contained the tombs of four ancient kings of the Buganda people along with cultural relics, including the spears of past kings. The men were part of a group of Buganda tribe members who rushed to the site of the Tombs of the Buganda Kings which was destroyed by fire Tuesday night. -- At least three men died from their wounds Wednesday after they were shot in a confrontation with Ugandan security forces at a destroyed historic site, the Ugandan government said.
