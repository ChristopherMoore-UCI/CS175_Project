Every weekend in the spring and fall, she and her volunteers -- who include college students, senior citizens and suburban moms, all wearing matching T-shirts -- fan out across low-income communities in southern Florida, educating women about breast health. Breast cancer survivor Andrea Ivory is on a mission to educate Florida communities about the disease, one door at a time. The first three Saturdays of each month are devoted to outreach -- distributing educational materials and signing up women for free mammograms. Reflecting on how lucky she was to have health insurance and to have gotten annual mammograms, she realized that thousands of women without health care were likely falling through the cracks and putting themselves at risk. Since 2006, Ivory has helped provide more than 500 mammograms to eligible women.
