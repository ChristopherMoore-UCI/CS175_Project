"In order to make Africa (and) Nigeria competitive again and in order to make our schools competitive, to make businesses here competitive and ... to give young people access to opportunities, access to markets, access to ideas ... we need a society, as a population to be better connected to the internet," she adds. "When you think of Africa coming into the information age, you think of educational institutions, you think of business opportunities, you think of social awareness, better communication, transparency in government," says Opeke, a former executive at U.S. telecoms giant Verizon. The cable, which has a capacity of 1.92 terabits a second, first went live in July 2010, becoming the first subsea cable to bring open-access, broadband capacity in West Africa, according to Funke Opeke, chief executive of Nigeria's Main One Cable Company. Yet, slow connectivity and high internet costs are still major problems -- according to figures by the International Telecommunication Union, Internet-user penetration in sub-Saharan Africa was 10.6% in 2010, far behind the world average of about 30%. Today, Opeke says, the system has helped improve the availability of internet services, especially in Lagos and Accra, as well as lowering wholesale prices significantly, by up to 80 per cent.
