Sixteen San Fernando police officers were arrested last week for allegedly protecting those responsible for the mass graves that had been uncovered, according to the Mexican attorney general's office. Zapata and his partner were ambushed in the state of San Luis Potosi while traveling from the northern city of Monterrey to Mexico City. The grisly discovery comes in the same week that authorities in Tamaulipas, a Mexican state that shares a border with Texas, confirmed they have so far found 116 bodies in multiple mass graves. Another presumed member of Los Zetas identified as Jose Manuel Garcia Soto was arrested earlier this month as a suspect in the death of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata. Another 72 bodies were found in San Fernando last August.
