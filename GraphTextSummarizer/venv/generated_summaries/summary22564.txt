While regional politics are at play, numerous other major factors are as well -- including oil prices, ISIS, Iran's nuclear dispute with the West and the threat of Hezbollah terrorist attacks around the world. If Israel and Hezbollah's skirmish descends into war and Hezbollah rocket fire, then the Israelis might figure in for a penny, in for a pound" -- in other words, fighting back against Hezbollah might mean going after Iran's nuclear sites. In 2006, war broke out after Hezbollah militants crossed into Israel, killing three soldiers and kidnapping two others, then killed another five Israeli soldiers. Israel also evacuated a town that includes a popular ski resort following Hezbollah attacks in the region. But the next day, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said, "The precise cause of death is as yet undetermined and remains the subject of investigation." All this follows an Israeli airstrike last week in the Syrian town of Quneitra that killed six Hezbollah operatives and at least one member of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
