-- UEFA president Michel Platini repeated his support for moving the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the winter Friday with a sideswipe at the English Premier League (EPL) who are opposed to the change of date. But the change to a winter date has been met with opposition from the major European leagues, with the EPL the most outspoken. "I was very happy to learn that FIFA president Joseph Blatter wants to move the 2022 World Cup to the winter, something I've long advocated," said Platini, who was addressing the media in Monaco as the Europa League draw was made. FIFA's executive committee meets in Zurich on October 3-4 to approve any change and begin a consultation with key stakeholders such as the EPL. Platini, who heads Europe's governing body, has previously gone on record to call for a switch from the summer when temperatures soar in the Gulf region.
