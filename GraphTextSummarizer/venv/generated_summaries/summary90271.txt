Of course, many children diagnosed with autism and other developmental disorders do not have any seizures or abnormal EEG activity. The proprietary database contains EEG data on more than 2,000 fully screened, healthy subjects, making BEAM a unique and powerful investigative tool in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. Abnormalities in brain function have traditionally been detected using electroencephalography (EEG), which involves the measurement of the ongoing electrical activity generated by the brain. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that one-third to one-half of children with autism may be prone to abnormal seizure-like activity in their brains, and up to one-third of children with autism may develop epilepsy by the time they reach adolescence. This system adds complex display schematics and statistical analyses to the traditional EEG recordings to provide more information about brain dysfunction.
