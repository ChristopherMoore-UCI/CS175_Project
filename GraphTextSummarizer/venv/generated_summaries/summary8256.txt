On my trip to Indonesia and Vietnam in February, I met P26 and other rescued pangolins at the vastly underfunded rehabilitation center in Vietnam. The generous researchers at Vietnam's Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program have agreed to let CNN's readers suggest and then vote on a new name for P26, who was recently released back into the wild after being rescued from the black market. " You can follow P26's journey on a blog written by Fletcher and other staff at the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program in Vietnam. They're shipped around the world for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for their meat, which is a delicacy and status symbol in Vietnam and China. You can also tweet this to encourage friends to vote: Pangolins like P26 are endangered, and they're thought to be the most-trafficked mammals in the world.
