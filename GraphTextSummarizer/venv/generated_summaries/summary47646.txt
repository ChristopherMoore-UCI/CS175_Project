New York sent additional samples from patients with severe respiratory illness to the CDC for confirmation of Enterovirus D68. More than a dozen cases of Enterovirus D68 have been confirmed in New York state, according to officials. "It is important that we follow common sense rules to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for flu and other contagious illnesses," said New York acting State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker. But doctors believe this particular type of enterovirus, Enterovirus D68, is causing more serious problems than others have in years past. Other states, including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Utah, are also investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses.
