While Arpaio already has reasonable security, Allen said, "we are going to have to augment" it either by getting more personnel or adding electronic security. "I can confirm the FBI is involved in the investigation," said FBI spokesman Manuel Johnson in Phoenix. According to the complaint, the sheriff's office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against Latinos that includes racial profiling, unlawful detention and searches, and unlawful targeting of Latinos during raids. " Arpaio, well-known for his hardline anti-immigration policies that have led to accusations of civil rights violations, vowed that he would not be brought down by his enemies. His critics say he has a long history of launching bogus criminal investigations against political opponents and anyone else who gets in his way.
