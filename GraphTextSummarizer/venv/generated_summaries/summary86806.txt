-- Netflix Co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings made a public apology in his blog Sunday after a customer outburst against a hike in prices. Hastings posted the mea culpa after a barrage of customer backlash that caused Netflix stock to plunge. Hastings also assures customers the price hike is over. Netflix subscribers quit the service in droves last week after the unexpected increase. Enraged customers flooded the Netflix site with tens of thousands of comments, as well as a barrage of tweets under the hashtag #DearNetflix.
