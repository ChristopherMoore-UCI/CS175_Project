An official with Lufthansa, the parent company of the budget airline Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. Lubitz suffered from "generalized anxiety disorder," with severe depression symptoms dating back to 2009, according to French newspaper Le Parisien. Die Welt, a German newspaper, over the weekend cited an unidentified senior investigator, who said Lubitz suffered from "severe subjective burnout syndrome" and severe depression. While the main medical clinic in Dusseldorf denies it was treating Lubitz for depression, German investigators found antidepressant medications in Lubitz's apartment, according to published reports that CNN has not yet been able to independently confirm. Many people have been asking how likely it is that depression could result in this sort of horrific action.
