In announcing Bryson's medical leave of absence Monday night, Carney said in a statement that Bryson had notified the White House of the leave and, "The President's thoughts are with Secretary Bryson and his family during this time. U.S. Secretary of Commerce John Bryson, under investigation for possible felony hit-and-run after allegedly causing two weekend car accidents in California, will take a medical leave of absence "as he undergoes tests and evaluations," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday night. "Secretary Bryson was involved in a traffic accident in Los Angeles over the weekend," said a statement by Commerce Director of Public Affairs Jennifer Friedman. The Commerce official said Bryson flew back to Washington on Sunday night and was in the office Monday. Carney provided no further details, noting the Commerce Department statement about Bryson suffering a seizure.
