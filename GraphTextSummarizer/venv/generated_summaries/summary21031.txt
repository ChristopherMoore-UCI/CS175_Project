Wardlaw lives in Santa Barbara, but says he and his wife, Tricia, still make about five treks a year to the Copco Lake cabin, staying one or two weeks each trip to relax and fish. Wardlaw and his fellow graduates of Santa Barbara High School received worldwide attention after CNN wrote a story about their extraordinary friendship, captured in photographs they took sitting in the same order on the cabin deck near Copco Lake. "I feel angry and violated," said John Wardlaw, the owner of the lakeside cabin. Wardlaw owns the California cabin near the Oregon border through a trust created by his grandfather, John Laux, an executive in the early years of radio and television. The cabin is a special place for Wardlaw, who does the carpentry to keep the cabin from falling apart in hot summers and frigid winters.
