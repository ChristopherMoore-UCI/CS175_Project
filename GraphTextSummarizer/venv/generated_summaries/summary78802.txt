"It's like looking at the phenomenon with new eyes, with a new set of instrumentation, which give us the detail to say, 'Yes, there is this hard, fast boundary,' " said John Foster, associate director of MIT's Haystack Observatory and a study co-author. "Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on 'Star Trek' that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons. This invisible shield, which was found at the inner edge of the outer Van Allen belt, protects against high-energy electrons, which have the potential to fry satellites, threaten astronauts and degrade space systems during intense solar storms. The discovery of this barrier in the Van Allen radiation belts suggests a new explanation for how "killer electrons" are held at bay. "It's almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space," said Daniel Baker, director of CU-Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space.
