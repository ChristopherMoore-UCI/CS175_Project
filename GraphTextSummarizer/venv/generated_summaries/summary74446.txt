The men escaped about 9 p.m. Thursday, Bonnett said, and the escape was not discovered until a resident and Covington police reported seeing what appeared to be inmates in jail uniforms walking down a street. Bonnett said he could not speak to how long it took to plan the escape, but that "it clearly was a situation where there appeared to be a great amount of planning and forethought." Police returned Murray to the St. Tammany Parish Jail in Covington, north of New Orleans, Louisiana. Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, has been recaptured, authorities in Louisiana say. -- A three-day manhunt ended when officials caught a murder suspect who escaped from a southeastern Louisiana jail with three other inmates, a police news release said.
