Here are a few big developments -- from both on and off the pitch -- from Friday in Brazil: Reigning champ goes down, hard The last time Spain and the Netherlands dueled on soccer's biggest stage, in 2010 in South Africa, they went scoreless for 90 minutes of regulation, then 25 more minutes of extra time. Andres Iniesta broke the deadlock, giving Spain its first ever World Cup title. While there's no indication of any fix in the Spain-Netherlands' matchup specifically, Interpol Secretary General Rob Noble did tell CNN's Richard Quest on Friday that members of his international investigative agency are in Brazil and other places due to serious concerns about match-fixing and illegal betting during this year's tournament. Netherlands thump Spain Interpol eyes alleged match-fixing Considering Spain's success in recent world tournaments, one might think that Friday's rout is impossible to believe. Netherlands pumped in four goals within 30 minutes in the second half, crushing the reigning World Cup champs en route to a convincing 5-1 decision.
