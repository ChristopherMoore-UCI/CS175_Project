In the main privacy settings view, you can make some bulk privacy settings by limiting old posts so they are only viewable by certain people, or setting the default privacy settings for your future posts. Profile details for minors are only viewable to their friends and friends of friends, and friends of friends will only see them in searches if they are also under 18 years old. Next, narrow it down with qualifiers like location, dates, friend recommendations or profile information. Then narrow the results using the detailed categories like age, education, home town or religious views. If you want a date who shares your hobbies, try something like "Single women who live in San Diego, California, and who like pages I like."
