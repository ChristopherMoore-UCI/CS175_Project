A CBS News poll earlier this month showed Rubio trailing Romney and Bush, but besting several other serious potential primary rivals, including Cruz, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Given that Bush and Rubio both hail from Florida, you have to wonder if both will actually end up running for president next year; things could get a little crowded in the primary. After landing on the cover of Time in February 2013 under the headline: "The Republican Savior," Rubio spent the next several months getting hammered by conservatives -- on cable television and talk radio -- for joining the Senate's "Gang of Eight" and proposing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The fire-breathing Cruz wasted no time in railing against "amnesty" and quickly became the anti-Rubio, someone who conservatives could trust to keep the border secure (and the immigration debate safe from honesty and common sense). In fact, last summer, a Republican strategist who knows Rubio fairly well told me that not only was it not a foregone conclusion that the one-time GOP golden boy would seek the presidency in 2016, but he might even hang it up altogether and not even run for re-election to the Senate.
