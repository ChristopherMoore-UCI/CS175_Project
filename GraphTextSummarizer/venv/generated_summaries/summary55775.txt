In response, security forces killed 10 militants and injured five during a search operation in Khyber, intelligence officials told CNN. The bombing during Friday prayers in Ghondi was a reprisal attack for local resistance against the Taliban, a spokesman for the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan group said in a statement. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts of northwestern Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering war-torn Afghanistan and has seen many casualties in recent years. Khalid Kundi, a senior Khyber official, said the bomber blew himself up in the courtyard of the mosque with 8 to 10 kilograms of explosive material. CNN's Shaan Khan contributed to this report.
