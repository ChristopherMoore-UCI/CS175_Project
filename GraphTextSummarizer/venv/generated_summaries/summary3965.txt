Their judgment didn't improve during this summer's trial, with Ortiz accusing Bulger of playing "an elaborate game of 'Let's Pretend'" by denying being an FBI informant while at the same time insisting the federal government "had given him full immunity." -- Calling him "one of the most violent and despicable criminals in Boston history," prosecutors argued Thursday that convicted mob boss Whitey Bulger should never set foot on the streets of that city -- or any city -- again. "Having now been convicted of 31 felonies, including ... counts involving multiple murders, Bulger richly deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail," U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a sentencing memorandum filed Thursday. "There are no mitigating factors, and defendant Bulger has no redeeming qualities, which would justify any sentence below the one called for by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the applicable case law and statutes," Ortiz wrote. " "Presiding over a massive criminal enterprise, Bulger extorted dozens of individuals, flooded South Boston with cocaine, shot innocent people, strangled women, murdered his competitors, corrupted FBI agents, and then ran away and hid for 16 years," the prosecutor said.
