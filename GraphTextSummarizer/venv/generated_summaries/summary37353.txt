When you combine spy with family man, it becomes even harder not to love him! The most-famous James Bond, Sean Connery, really set the bar high in movies like 1967's "You Only Live Twice," where Bond brought his spy skills to Japan to find a rocket that disappeared in orbit. He also plays the best kind of spy, relying on his charisma and smarts instead of crazy gadgets. Clive Owen really steamed up the big screen with Julia Roberts in "Duplicity" as rival spies engaging in espionage and foreplay. In one of the best movies ever, "Charade," Cary Grant plays a name-changing government official who offers to help Audrey Hepburn find her dead husband's fortune, which was stolen from the government during World War II.
