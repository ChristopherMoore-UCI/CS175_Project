The charges carry a potential maximum of 12 years in prison if Corbett is convicted, Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall told CNN last month. Sandra Bullock came face-to-face with a man who allegedly scaled a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire to get into her house last month, according to a police search warrant. The finding of the weapons led to 19 felony counts, including seven counts of possession of a machine gun, two counts of possession of an assault weapon and 10 counts of possession of a destructive device, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office told CNN last month. DA: Sandra Bullock's stalker owned 'arsenal' of machine guns Bullock said she slammed the door and called 911. The warrant, obtained by TMZ, said that Bullock, upon hearing banging inside the house around 1 a.m. June 8, found the intruder in the hall outside her bedroom door.
