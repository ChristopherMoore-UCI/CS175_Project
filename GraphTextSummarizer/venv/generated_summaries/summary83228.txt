-- Four severely burned bodies have been recovered from an Indian navy submarine that sank in Mumbai this week after an explosion and fire on board "The feasibility of locating bodies of personnel in the forward part of the submarine is also very remote, as the explosion and very high temperatures, which melted steel within, would have incinerated the bodies, too," it warned. Salvage work on the diesel-electric submarine won't begin until the search for bodies is over, the defense ministry said Friday. The Indian government warned that there was almost no hope of finding any survivors among the 14 other sailors who were in the submarine when it was hit by the unexplained blast at a naval dockyard early Wednesday. It took place just days after two events hailed as big steps forward for the Indian military's technological capabilities.
