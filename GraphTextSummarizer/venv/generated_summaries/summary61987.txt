Harry toured an open air exhibit in Nassau's Rawson Square Sunday, before boarding a speedboat for a visit to several Bahamian islands to meet with locals. -- Prince Harry, the third in Britain's line of royal succession, worshiped in a Bahamian cathedral Sunday as part of his Caribbean tour to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his grandmother's accession to the throne. Harry's Diamond Jubilee celebrations began Friday in the Belize capitol Belmopan, where the prince danced and drank in a street party along the newly-named HM Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard. The prince is expected to attend military exercises conducted by the Royal Bahamian Defence Force, responsible for patrolling about 1,000 islands in its 100,000 square miles of territorial waters. The 27-year-old son of Prince Charles and Diana had a quieter day in Belize Saturday, climbing to the top of Xunantunich, a Mayan temple.
