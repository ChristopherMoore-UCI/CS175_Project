-- An American Airlines plane en route from Seoul, South Korea to Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas diverted to Narita, Japan, Tuesday after several passengers and crew were injured by turbulence during the flight. "Note there is a very strong storm, similar to a Nor'easter, just east of Japan which is causing severe turbulence in the region," said Brandon Miller, Senior Meteorologist for CNN International. American Flight 280 departed Incheon International Airport near Seoul in route to Dallas-Fort Worth when an intense winter storm shook the cabin and caused injuries that forced the aircraft to divert. The flight will not continue on to Dallas-Fort Worth on Tuesday, Huguely said. Medical personnel have been able to evaluate the 14 passengers and crew members who asked for medical attention, said American spokeswoman Andrea Huguely in statement.
