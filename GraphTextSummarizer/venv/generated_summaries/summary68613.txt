The director of the Tijuana checkpoint told Mexican media last month that Mexican agents at the border gave Tahmooressi a chance to surrender his weapons and return to the United States without incident. He was detained by Mexican border officials for possessing a .45-caliber pistol, a 12-gauge pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. Although he didn't gain his client's freedom, attorney Fernando Benitez said progress was made. "He is strong, he is confident and he is very privileged to have Mr. Benitez defend his innocence," she said. The order was dated three days before the incident, according to Benitez, who said that at least 11 pages were missing from the record presented in court.
