A controversial advertisement that critics say is hateful toward Muslims will appear in New York City subway stations starting next week, despite the city's attempts to halt the campaign. "We're trying to make sure MTA has policies to discourage hate speech." Awad wants to ensure that anyone seeing the ads next week are aware that the message is not sanctioned by the city of New York. "Millions of people will see this, we want to make sure they realize that it is not (promoted by) the city of New York." While his council cannot stop the ads, Awad hopes transit officials will put a disclaimer on the advertisements and redirect any funding of the ad to the Human Rights Commission. "These hate ads are part of a larger problem," said Muneer Awad, executive director of the Council of American-Islamic Relations. The American Freedom Defense Initiative, which produced the ad, has been fighting to place the message in New York's subway system since last year after the authority refused to display it.
