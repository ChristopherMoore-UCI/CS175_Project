David J. Lavau, 67, of Lake Hughes, California, was found in a ravine a week after losing control of his car on a rural road and plunging 500 feet down an embankment into heavy brush, according to a report by the California Highway Patrol. The CHP said Lavau's accident and the one involving the dead driver are under investigation. While Lavau's family searched for him, he "remained at the bottom of the hill surviving on leaves and water from a nearby creek," the report said. Lavau's family began searching for him when he failed to return home, driving the route and stopping at all the curves in the road from Castaic to his home in Lake Hughes. Sean Lavau hiked to the bottom of the canyon to find his father, the report said.
