After a tip received by the state attorney general and The One Fund Boston that Gause was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, an official investigation began, Coakley said at a news conference on July 19. Audrea Gause, 26, was indicted on charges of larceny over $250 and gross fraud by a Suffolk County Grand Jury, according to a statement from the office of Attorney General Martha Coakley. The One Fund Boston divided payments between four classifications that were based on the severity of injuries or loss of life, according to the fund's statement. Coakley's office said two other individuals have been charged with attempted fraud of The One Fund Boston. Investigations also revealed that Gause signed up for a cruise, named the "Heroes Cruise," which was being offered free to victims of the Boston Marathon bombing by a Boston-based travel company, according to the statement.
