And because 77 percent of the women in the House and Senate were Democrats, women were in a particularly precarious position as they faced an anti-Democratic, anti-establishment electorate. The National Republican Congressional Committee ran women in only three of the 30 races that presented the best opportunities to gain seats. Second, a net loss of women in Congress was a likely outcome heading into election night. With a record number of women running for the U.S. House (138) and U.S. Senate (15), pundits, pollsters and politicians assumed it was the dawn of a new day, one in which Democrats and Republicans understood the importance of electing women. But only if women win all of these races (an unlikely scenario) will the total number of women serving in the House hold steady at 73.
