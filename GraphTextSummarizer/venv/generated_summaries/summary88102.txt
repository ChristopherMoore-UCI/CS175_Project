Obamacare, the effort to extend health coverage to every American, has already achieved some of its biggest goals: no more denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions, allowing parents to keep children on their policies up to age 26, the eventual phase-out of the "doughnut hole" for Medicare's prescription drug coverage. Obama and other administration officials say those plans offered substandard coverage, leaving people at risk of bankruptcy if they were hospitalized or developed other major medical needs, and that the 80% of Americans who are covered through their jobs or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid won't see any changes. Obama also was forced to admit that his longstanding reassurance that people could keep their insurance plans if they liked them wasn't holding up, as insurers began sending cancellation notices to an estimated several million people whose individual policies don't meet Obamacare requirements for comprehensive coverage. But they are now qualifying the pledge by saying that people who had individual plans dating back to before the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act can keep their plans as long as the policies hadn't been changed by the insurance companies; the ones that have been changed must now meet new minimum standards set in the law. But the big enchilada was the rollout of the online federal and state exchanges for Americans to shop for insurance coverage, and that has been plagued by delays since the October 1 launch.
