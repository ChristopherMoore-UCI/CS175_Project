If a Defense Department agency wants its employees to focus on a particular type of hacker training, EC-Council will perform customized training. Now every Defense Department agency and unit is required to include hacker training as one option for employees involved in cybersecurity. The basic concept is Defense Department employees would use the training to hack into the department's computers, Bavisi said. Bavisi said that Defense Department employees who complete the training and certification will not be assigned to use their new knowledge to hack into privately owned or civilian computers. Almost 45,000 attacks on Defense Department computers were reported in the first half of 2009, according to a government report.
