-- From Dallas, Texas to Dabancheng, China, energy companies are staking fortunes on harnessing wind power. The companies are hoping to take advantage of a landmark ruling on Friday that gave Texas preliminary approval for a $4.9 billion plan to build transmission lines to carry wind power from West Texas to urban areas. "Wind power is ... clean, it's renewable. "It is widely believed that wind power will be able to compete with coal generation by as early as 2015." Texas is already a leader in wind energy and this is the next step in maintaining that leadership position.
