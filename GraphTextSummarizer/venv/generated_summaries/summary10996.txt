Deer Valley Resort Park City, Utah Once the snow melts and the skiers go home, Deer Valley turns up the lights on its Snow Park Outdoor Amphitheater, where the Deer Valley Music Festival sends melodies ringing through the Wasatch Mountains twilight. The elegant park also hosts a lively carnival on July 21 as part of the Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival. In 1946 three public concerts were held on the estate; they became Caramoor's Summer Music Festival, which has grown in scope and fame in the decades since. In late June, the two-day Paradiso Festival will feature DJ headliners Kaskade and TiÃ«sto. Millennium Park Chicago This section of Chicago's historic Grant Park opened in 2004 and showcases some of the best urban design and public art in the country.
