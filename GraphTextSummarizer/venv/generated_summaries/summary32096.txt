According to the lawsuit, Altman and other Oregon personnel knew about Austin's background and basis for his seasonlong suspension. At the time, the Daily Emerald, student newspaper of the University of Oregon, reported that Laura Fine Moro, Austin's attorney, said the lack of charges exonerated her client. A woman who alleges she was gang-raped by three University of Oregon men's basketball players in March has filed a Title IX lawsuit against the university and head men's basketball coach Dana Altman. The lawsuit says that Altman knew one of his players, Brandon Austin, had a history of prior sexual misconduct allegations at another school but that Altman recruited him to play for the Ducks anyway. On Wednesday, a woman who accused Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston of raping her in 2012 filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court in Orlando against the university, alleging the school violated her rights under Title IX.
