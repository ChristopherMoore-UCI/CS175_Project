The statement said the group had approached U.S. agencies in January 2010 and informed them they had initiated a review of historic U.S. dollar transactions and compliance with U.S. sanctions. Standard Chartered allegedly falsified business and official records to mask transactions with Iranian customers that were subject to U.S. economic sanctions, the New York State Department of Financial Services said. Under federal law, banks are obligated to ensure that such transactions do not violate U.S. sanctions. Iran has argued that its goal is to produce energy and medical isotopes, but U.S. officials say the Iranians are developing weapons. Standard Chartered refuted the charges, saying "well over 99.9%" of the referenced transactions complied with U.S. regulations.
