By around 8 p.m. Thursday, snow was falling at about a half-inch for hour, according to the National Weather Service. National Weather Service spotters reported more than 32 inches in communities east and south by Thursday evening. While still meddlesome, it paled compared to the 3-inch per hour rate late Wednesday as well as the intense, concentrated snow that continued through much of the day Thursday. Still, this being upstate New York, the National Weather Service is calling for a chance of snow showers every day through next Thursday. " Still, while packing a punch, the storm was hardly a record-setter: Over 76 inches of snow fell in Buffalo in late December 2001, including 35.4 inches in a single 24-hour period, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
