Russ Whitmarsh, chief operating officer of NovaPro, referred all questions about the officers' allegations to city officials. They are part of a group of officers alleging that NovaPro, a San Diego-based private insurance company, has refused or made it difficult for them to get the medication they need to alleviate pain and repair or replace medical equipment. Atlanta officials this month renewed the city's agreement with NovaPro for $3.7 million over three years, saying no other company they're aware of was in position to do a better job. They say they've made repeated calls for months to city officials to get help with their medical claims and have been ignored. He said he suffered with kidney stones, made more painful due to his paralysis, because NovaPro either ignored or rejected his claims for months.
