Corwin didn't go to Joshua Tree National Park on the day she disappeared, police said in a statement of probable cause written in July. According to the court document, several people, including a friend of Erin Corwin's in Tennessee, told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair. He faces a murder charge and the special circumstance allegation of "lying in wait," which means he could face life in prison without parole or death, if found guilty, according to San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael Ramos. Erin Corwin, 19 and three months pregnant, had been missing since June 28 after she said she was going to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails. Detectives found footprints next to Corwin's abandoned car that led to tire tracks.
