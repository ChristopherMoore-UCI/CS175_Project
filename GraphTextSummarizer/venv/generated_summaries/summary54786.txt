However, if Congress passes a bipartisan Social Security reform, then the momentum of that accomplishment can prompt leaders of both parties to tackle Medicare reform. Just as Social Security and Medicare programs were enacted with broad bipartisan support, securing and saving these programs will require nothing short of both parties of Congress working together. It should be no surprise that the payroll tax-supported trust funds that pay out Social Security and Medicare benefits are speeding toward a financial collapse. Last year, I introduced the Defend and Save Social Security Act, which would ensure that Social Security is solvent for the next 75 years, through very gradual yearly increases of only three months per year in the retirement age and a modest adjustment to the annual cost-of-living increases . Medicare reform is far more complicated.
