-- A CBS correspondent was brutally attacked Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square after the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the network said in a statement released Tuesday. " Logan spoke with the magazine Thursday night as she boarded a plane for her return to Egypt, saying that her interrogators accused her and her crew of being "Israeli agents," kept them in "stress positions" throughout the night and only reluctantly gave her medical treatment for an illness. She was promoted to chief foreign correspondent in 2006 and to chief foreign affairs correspondent in 2008. CBS said it would have no further comment and that Logan and her family requested privacy. "We were not attacked by crazy people in Tahrir Square," Logan told Esquire's The Politics Blog about the February 3 incident.
