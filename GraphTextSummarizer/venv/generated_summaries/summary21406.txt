-- The International Criminal Court handed down its first-ever sentence Tuesday, sending Thomas Lubanga -- the Congolese warlord convicted of using child soldiers and turning them into killers -- to prison for 14 years. Prosecutors said Lubanga led a rebel force that recruited child soldiers. Lubanga's case marked the ICC's first trial and first verdict since the court was established in 2002 to address offenses of international concern, such as genocide and war crimes. Former child soldiers testified that Lubanga recruited them to kill, rape and rob. In March, the court convicted Lubanga of conscripting and enlisting children under age 15 and using them to participate in "hostilities" during a civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
