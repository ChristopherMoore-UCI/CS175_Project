The difference with LevelUp, says Priebatsch, is in ease of use and game mechanics. It's an app called LevelUp, and it's launching in two new cities -- New York and San Francisco -- on Wednesday, Priebatsch said. The app generates a unique QR code (those black-and-white checkerboard things), which can be scanned at stores to make a payment and to earn LevelUp deals. The app has 100,000 users in Boston and Philadelphia, he said, and LevelUp deals are available in about 500 businesses in those two test cities. Instead, he said, LevelUp charges participating businesses a monthly fee of $55 after an initial three-month trial period during which the service is free.
