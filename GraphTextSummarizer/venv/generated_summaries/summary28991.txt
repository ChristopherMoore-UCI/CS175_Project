NFL chief Goodell faces intense criticism after Rice video Will Rice go to jail? The facts never changed -- Rice knocked Janay Palmer (now Janay Rice) unconscious. "We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including any video that may exist," NFL Vice President of Corporate Communications Brian McCarthy, said, specifically citing New Jersey State Police, Atlantic City police and Atlantic County prosecutor's office as places where the NFL inquired. Revel Entertainment Group, which owns the casino where the incident happened, said it gave copies of the video to Atlantic City police, the prosecutor's office, the Division of Gaming Enforcement and Rice's attorney. The Ravens had stood by Rice throughout the fallout, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell did not alter the two-game suspension, even after admitting he made a mistake.
