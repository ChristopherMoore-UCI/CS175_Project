Recently, the government's internal guidelines for placing someone on the no-fly list and other watch lists were leaked to the public, revealing for the first time just how prone to abuse the secretive list can be. "I do not want to become an informant, but the government says I must in order to be taken off the no-fly List," Sajjad told us. The FBI -- which in the post 9/11-era measures success by the number of informants it can list -- told them if they were to spy on their neighbors and community, they might get off the no-fly List. According to Algibhah and Sajjad, FBI agents privately offered an alternative option to get off the list. Second, the decisions of agents who nominate people to the list are accorded a significant amount of deference.
