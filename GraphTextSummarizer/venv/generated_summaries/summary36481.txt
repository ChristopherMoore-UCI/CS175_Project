There are two art park locations, both an easy walk from the casinos, one between Martin Luther King Boulevard and Indiana Avenue and another on the Boardwalk at California Avenue. -- There's a standard Atlantic City itinerary: arrive at one of the many casinos along the Boardwalk, head straight for the card tables and slot machines, drink some complimentary cocktails and proceed to empty your wallet. From July 1 through Labor Day, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., there are lifeguards stationed on the beach from Caspian Avenue to Jackson Avenue. If you're in the mood to do some historical sightseeing in the greater Atlantic City area, there are several interesting landmarks. It's located right on the waterfront at historic Gardner's Basin, where you can dine at dockside restaurants and check out the Atlantic City artists' colony.
