A groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction on the third and final section of the park was held last week, hosted by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Friends of the High Line co-founders Joshua David and Robert Hammond. "An extraordinary" accomplishment Friends of the High Line, which advocates for preservation of the historic structures, was founded in 1999 by  David and Hammond in response to a group of property owners who called for its demolition, according to the High Line website. "In the decades to come, long after the final section is open to the public, the High Line will serve as a profound reminder of the extraordinary things we can achieve when the public and private sectors work together for the common good," said Bloomberg. Part of the West Side Improvement Project, the High Line opened in 1934 and allowed train traffic to run on tracks elevated 30 feet to put a halt to the years of accidents that had occurred at street level. The first phase, expected to be completed in 2014, will cost an estimated $90 million, financed by a combination of public funds and private donations.
