While many artists around the world experiment with long-exposure photography and light art, Sola coined the term "lightbombing." The popularity of Sola's light art has offered the photographer some exciting opportunities in the last few years, including working with commercial partners such as Nike for ad campaigns and traveling to Dubai for a three-week collaboration with local artists. Despite the near freezing temperatures out on city streets tonight, hours fly by as we move from location to location. Do beautiful work with more people in them.
