"I think that a great debate has been created using Beatriz, using her problem to promote the legalization of abortion," said Regina de Cardenal of the country's Yes to Life Foundation. Anti-abortion groups counter that Beatriz is being used by abortion-rights advocates as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws. The life of the woman, known only as "Beatriz," is in danger if the pregnancy goes full term, but abortion is illegal in El Salvador with no exceptions, women's rights groups say. "We are outraged at their abdication of their role to protect and defend Beatriz's life and health," said Esther Major, Central America researcher for Amnesty International. Although she is at the center of a national debate over abortion, Beatriz has declined to give interviews.
