Los Angeles police arrested Corbett, 39, at Bullock's home in the early morning hours of June 8 after he allegedly climbed a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire that surrounded it. The discovery of the arsenal during a search of Corbett's Montrose, California, home has led to 19 felony counts, including seven counts of possession of a machine gun, two counts of possession of an assault weapon and 10 counts of possession of a destructive device, the prosecutor's spokeswoman said. The man arrested at Sandra Bullock's home last week allegedly owns "an arsenal of weapons" that included a half dozen illegal machine guns. The charges carry a potential maximum of 12 years in prison, if the suspect is convicted, Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall said.
