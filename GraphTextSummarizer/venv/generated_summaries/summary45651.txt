Evra's lawyer Jean-Yves Foucard told reporters: "Patrice Evra wanted to express himself, which he did at great length, and the commission listened to him very attentively, and asked good questions. " Evra was one of four players banned following France's World Cup debacle in which they failed to qualify for the last 16 of the competition, collecting just one point in three matches. Nicolas Anelka, who was sent home after a row with coach Raymond Domenech was handed an 18-match suspension, while Franck Ribery received three and Jeremy Toulalan a single game. An FFF statement read: "The superior appeals commission, which met today to consider the appeal by Patrick Evra, decided to uphold the sanction of five matches of non-selection for the France team handed down on August 17 by the federal disciplinary commission. The French Football Federation imposed the ban for Evra's part in the France squad's training boycott during the World Cup finals in South Africa.
