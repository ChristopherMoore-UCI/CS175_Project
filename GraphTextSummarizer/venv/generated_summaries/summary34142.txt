In a press release, the Hatay governor's office said Atakan was killed in a fall during a clash between police and demonstrators. Crowds of demonstrators gathered in the cities of Istanbul, Ankara and Hatay to denounce the death of Ahmet Atakan, a 22-year-old who recently graduated from accounting school. They said it was a weekly protest in honor of Abdullah Comert, another young man from the same neighborhood who was killed in a clash with police last June, barely 3 blocks from where Atakan was fatally injured. Crowds of protestors chanted "Down with the government" and "Solidarity with Armutlu" referring to the neighborhood in Hatay where Atakan was fatally injured. There is still controversy over how Atakan, the protester in Hatay, died.
