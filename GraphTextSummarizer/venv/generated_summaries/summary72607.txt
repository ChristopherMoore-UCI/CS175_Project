The song was written in 1932 by teacher Marion Sinclair, and Australian music group Larrikin Publishing bought the copyright to it in 1990 after Sinclair's death in 1988. In February, Federal Court judge Peter Jacobsen found that the flute riff in "Down Under" did mimic the Kookaburra song. Jacobsen found that Ham deliberately included the bars from Kookaburra into the flute line, but accepted that Colin Hay didn't realize it was from the nursery rhyme until early in the last decade. "Down Under" was composed and performed by Men at Work founding member Colin Hay in 1978. Larrikin had sought 40 to 60 percent of the royalties earned by "Down Under" in Australia since May 20, 2002, the limit imposed under Australian law.
