Italy's Valentino Rossi edged out Yamaha teammate and title rival Jorge Lorenzo to claim pole position for the French MotoGP at Le Mans. Lorenzo is hoping to double up after winning at Le Mans last year. Rossi, who has won three times at Le Mans, trails Lorenzo by four points in this year's title race after both have secured wins in the opening two races of the season. Rossi lapped in one minute 33.408 seconds to edge championship leader Lorenzo by just 0.054 seconds. Australian Casey Stoner also strongly challenged on his Ducati, but had to settle for fourth fastest, just ahead of teammate Nicky Hayden.
