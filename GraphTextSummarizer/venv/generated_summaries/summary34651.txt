-- Pedro Passos Coelho, a businessman and opposition leader, is set to succeed Jose Socrates as Portugal's prime minister after his party scored a convincing victory in Sunday's election. "We have lived through extraordinary national and international circumstances but the facts are the facts: We lost," said Socrates, who wished Coelho and Portugal well going forward. "I hope this is a new step for Portugal to re-establish confidence." Coelho, who was born in Coimbra and spent five years of his childhood in the then-Portuguese colony of Angola, will bring a business background when, as expected, he assumes the prime minister's job from Socrates in the coming weeks. " But Coelho, in a March 30 guest column in the Wall Street Journal, headlined "Our Plan to Fix Portugal," criticized Socrates' plan for failing to spur growth while "imposing unacceptable sacrifices on the most vulnerable members of society. The cost of Portugal's borrowings has gone up drastically since Socrates resigned in March.
