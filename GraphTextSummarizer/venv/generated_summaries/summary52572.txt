-- Stuxnet is viewed as potentially the most dangerous piece of computer malware discovered. Despite that denial, O'Murchu stands by Symantec's numbers and explained that the figures came straight from the logged traffic on one of the Stuxnet control servers that Symantec took control of. Fortunately, this code won't have a major effect on home computers and if some do become infected, it is likely that Symantec will get in touch with the owners. Symantec has estimated that 60 percent of the infected computers are located in Iran. Once the malware infects the system it can spread to other computers on the local intranet.
