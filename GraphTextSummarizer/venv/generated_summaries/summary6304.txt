The majority of us know that the quick fix is not going to work, yet we feel compelled to throw ourselves into the despair of broken diets, broken resolutions, broken promises and worse, a pervasive sense of shame that attacks the core of our being. "Body Wars" keep women in their place and are economically driven. But of those who lose weight through dieting, 98 percent gain it back again in two years. As a psychologist who has been treating eating disorders since 1985, I worry that there could be a connection between dieting parents and teenagers who develop anorexia or bulimia. There is also a political reason for women to be held to a high "thin" standard of perfection.
