Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist Georgian territory, on August 7, 2008. The report noted that the actions "stood in contrast to the failure of the international community, including the U.N. Security Council, to act swiftly and resolutely enough in order to control the ever-mounting tensions prior (to) the outbreak of armed conflict." Georgian armed forces shelled the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali the night of August 7. The EU said in a statement it welcomed the report and hopes its findings can contribute to future international efforts at "preventive diplomacy." The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another Russian-backed breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions.
