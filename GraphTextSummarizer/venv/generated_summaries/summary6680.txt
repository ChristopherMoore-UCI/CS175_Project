A week after giving away a U2 album to most iTunes users, Apple has announced a way for customers to get rid of it. At the end of Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch announcement last week, the company trotted out the rock supergroup to announce a major marketing collaboration. Apple was giving away U2's first new album in five years, "Songs of Innocence," to 500 million iTunes customers for free. It was a clever way to get more people to sign up for iTunes, and Apple even produced a special ad to promote the collaboration. The people who have their iTunes account set up to automatically download any purchases saw the files on their computers and mobile devices.
