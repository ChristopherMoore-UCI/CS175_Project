-- It took 27 years, but Gary Lauder eventually came up with what he sees as the solution to the problem of unnecessary stop signs: a new kind of road sign that tells drivers at some kinds of intersections to "take turns. Lauder's idea, described in his 4Â½ minute talk at TED, is that the new sign could take the place of some stop signs and, in certain circumstances, avoid unnecessary stops, saving time, fuel and carbon emissions, while promoting smooth traffic flow. Some of the people who commented on various Web sites noted that there have been signs that urged people to take turns, but those had been in merging situations where there are two lanes that are merging into one. The whole issue of stop signs making you stop for no one in particular or no one at all, which is often the case, made me think: What is this trying to achieve?
