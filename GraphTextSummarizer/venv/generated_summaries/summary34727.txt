-- Israeli police and security services have arrested four Palestinian men in connection with the December slaying of American tourist Kristine Luken, authorities said. The four suspects are Palestinians from the villages of Tarkumieh and Tzurif near Hebron in the southern West Bank, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. They also will be charged with the attempted murder of Luken's friend, Kay Susan Wilson, and the attempted murder of another couple, Rosenfeld said. Luken's body was found after Wilson stumbled into a picnic area with her hands bound, bleeding from multiple stab wounds and asking for help. Luken and Wilson, a British citizen living in Israel, both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England.
