He had just flown back to Damascus with his younger brother to visit family and prepare for the start of the new semester when he was held for questioning by security officers, said Nashef, a dentist in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills. Syria's government released 21-year-old Obada Mzaik to his father Wednesday evening, said his uncle, Firas Nashef. "We're grateful that he's back with his family, and we're grateful to the community for showing support to the family during difficult days," Nashef said in a statement issued on behalf of the family. Mzaik was taken into custody after flying from Detroit to Damascus on January 3, Nashef said. Nashef said his nephew had been arrested last summer and held for 37 days for "spreading fliers about the revolution," and his family feared the worst after he was picked up again.
