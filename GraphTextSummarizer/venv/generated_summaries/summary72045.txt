Currently on a mini tour of the United States, Butterfly Boucher fluttered (sorry) into CNN this week to talk about heartache, grand pianos and nicknames. " Born in Adelaide, Australia, Butterfly Boucher (rhymes with "voucher") is the middle of seven sisters and spent much of her childhood moving cities with her family in a motor home. And in a show of support, fellow Aussie Nicole Kidman recently showed up at one of Boucher's gigs in Nashville, Tennessee, where Boucher now lives. Boucher: Ah, Nashville! She's also gotten some breaks: "Grey's Anatomy" has used several of Boucher's songs.
