If you are an iPhone owner who is pondering an upgrade to the new iPhone 5, here are some things to consider: Do you long for more screen space/watch a lot of movies? After testing its tallness we've found that there is more space on the screen, which is no longer as short as the previous iPhone screens. Each iPhone is typically faster than its predecessor, and phones tend to slow down over time. Thanks to decent image quality and the ability to share photos and videos instantly, the iPhone is probably more popular as a camera than a telephoning device. Third-party applications must now redesign their apps to fix the new aspect ratio -- which requires time and resources -- so until then, older apps will be shown at normal size, the bar of unused screen space cloaked in mourning-black.
