While the trial thus far has largely focused on key players involved in Jackson's comeback "This Is It" tour, it now turns to Rowe, who has largely shunned the spotlight since divorcing Michael Jackson in the 1990s. She and Jackson met while Rowe was working as a dermatology nurse in Los Angeles for Dr. Arnold Klein. Then in 2005, during Jackson's highly publicized molestation trial, Rowe came to her ex-husband's defense and claimed in court that he was a supportive and loving father, though she admitted she had not seen Jackson or her children for several years. Since Jackson's passing, Rowe has reportedly become a permanent fixture in her children's lives and has grown close to daughter Paris. Shortly after the trial, Rowe moved to Palmdale and continued to live a life out of the limelight until Jackson's death in 2009.
