-- A Minnesota man arrested after investigators found weapons and explosives in his home was scheduled to appear in federal court in St. Paul Monday afternoon. "The FBI believes that a terror attack was disrupted by law enforcement personnel and that the lives of several local residents were potentially saved," the FBI said in a press release. Buford "Bucky" Rogers was arrested Friday after a search of his Montevideo, Minnesota, home turned up several explosives including Molotov cocktails and a suspected pipe bomb, according to the affidavit written by an FBI agent. The documents do not provide any information on what Rogers allegedly intended to do with the explosives and guns. According to court documents, Rogers told investigators he had fired the assault rifle at a gun range on two separate occasions.
