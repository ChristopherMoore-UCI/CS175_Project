Simple mode took me through the battles quickly and let me get familiar with some of the new abilities and characters. "We chose Marvel characters that Japanese fans would think were cool." As one of the most anticipated games of 2011, "Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds" (Capcom) doesn't disappoint with new characters, a story line with uber-villain Galactus and a new mode designed to make it easy to get involved in the action. The missions take characters through different stages where they work on a particular attack to get its sequences right. Characters also have powers and abilities that come out only during specific times in a battle.
