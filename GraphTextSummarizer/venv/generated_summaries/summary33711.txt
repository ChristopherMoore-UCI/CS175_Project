Anthony has been in seclusion since her July acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter and her subsequent release from jail. -- The Orange County, Florida, Sheriff's Office spent $293,123.77 on detective work in the disappearance of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony in 2008, according to authorities, and it wants to be reimbursed. A court hearing on that request was set to take place Thursday, but it was rescheduled to September 2, court spokeswoman Karen Levey said Wednesday. But in the same case, a Florida jury convicted her on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. Prosecutors are also seeking reimbursement for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's investigative expenses of $71,939.56 and the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation's expenses of $10,645.38, according to court records.
