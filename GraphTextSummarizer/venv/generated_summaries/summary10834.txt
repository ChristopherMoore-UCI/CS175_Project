The screenplay is a globe-hopping fantasy perpetuating the fashionable, paranoid myth that Central American drug barons are the natural allies of Jihadi terrorists. Whatever you make of its reactionary politics, at least the action scenes are choreographed and filmed by Shane Hurlbut with a level of coherence that's become rare in this genre -- even if the elaborate raids and skirmishes look more like a series of war games than actual combat. Francis Coppola had to go to the Philippines to get the helicopters he needed for "Apocalypse Now," but "Top Gun," "Transformers" and even "Black Hawk Down" have benefited from the Pentagon's largesse in terms of hardware and expertise. A single squad of SEALs connects the dots between a school bombing in Indonesia, a kidnapping in Costa Rica, covert meetings in the Ukraine and Somalia and suicide bombers tunneling into the United States from Mexico. There's nothing equivalent to the Danish war documentary "Armadillo," either, in which we witness European peacekeepers unthinkingly break the Geneva Convention by murdering enemy casualties in the heat of battle; nor the scenes in the Oscar-nominated documentary "To Hell and Back," in which a seriously wounded American vet struggles to get his life back together on home turf.
