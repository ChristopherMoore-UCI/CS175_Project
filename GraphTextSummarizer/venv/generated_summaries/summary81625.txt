-- Nine Ohio veterans have tested positive for hepatitis after undergoing routine dental work at a Dayton clinic, according to Ohio Veterans Affairs Communications Officer Todd Sledge. Veterans could still receive care at other facilities found through the medical center, Sledge said. Seven of the 375 have since tested positive for Hepatitis C and two for Hepatitis B, according to Sledge. Sledge had said the clinic is taking full accountability. No additional information on other employees involved in the case has been released, according to Sledge.
