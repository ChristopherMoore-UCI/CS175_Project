" More than 7,000 gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM, leaked into Charleston's water supply after it leaked out of a Freedom Industries storage tank. "Given the small percentage of PPH in the tank and information suggesting similar water solubility as MCHM, it is likely that any amount of PPH currently in the water system would be extremely low," it said. Faced with numerous lawsuits as a result of the spill, Freedom Industries filed for bankruptcy protection last week. The state Department of Environmental Protection gave Freedom Industries until Wednesday afternoon to disclose "any and all information" related to the January 9 spill. PPH is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of Charleston, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
