Red Bull, who along with the Lotus and Caterham teams use Renault engines, had to cut short Vettel's track time because of problem with the energy recovery system on his car. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel was stopped in his tracks by an engine failure after completing just eight laps in the new Red Bull racer Wednesday. Engine gremlins also affected Toro Rosso, Red Bull's sister team, and driver Daniil Kvyat was not able to take his car out on track because of an electrical problem. " Vettel, who only managed three laps in the box fresh car on Tuesday, has now returned home to Switzerland and handed the keys of the 2014 Red Bull over to his new teammate Daniel Ricciardo for the remainder of the Jerez test. Could reliability be an Achilles heel for Formula One world champions Red Bull this season?
