"LRPD detectives have engaged in subterfuge and have violated both the meaning and the express language of a standing court order in their successful attempts to interrogate Mr. Vance outside the presence of counsel." They went to the jail and waited at the inmate entrance in hopes of seeing him as he arrived but police "deviated from normal practice and took him through an entrance on the opposite side of the building from that which is ordinarily used, thereby avoiding the possibility that Mr. Vance would see his attorneys." Although police claim that both of the interviews were initiated by Vance, "the detectives' lack of candor with Mr. Vance during the interviews violates his Sixth Amendment right to counsel," the defense motion said. Prosecutors also note that despite requests by the defense to speak to Vance, "As counsel knows ... law enforcement is under no obligation to allow an attorney access to their client under these circumstances unless the defendant asks for the attorney." Vance's trial has been set for September 9, according to court documents. A judge issued an order directing that police provide sufficient notice to defense counsel before transporting Vance.
