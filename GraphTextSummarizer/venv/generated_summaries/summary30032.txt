"Chrysler Group has concluded that 1993-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles are neither defective nor do their fuel systems pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety in rear impact collisions," said a Chrysler statement obtained by CNN. This week the NHTSA expanded the investigation to include Jeep Cherokees from model years 1993 to 2001 and Jeep Liberty models from 2002 to 2007. Federal investigators initially looked into the Jeep Grand Cherokee following complaints by the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog organization founded by Ralph Nader. Fiery fuel-tank crashes have resulted in 48 fatalities in the Jeep Grand Cherokee model since 1993, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but so far neither the federal government nor Chrysler has announced a recall. Palese said that Chrysler made the move to allow more cargo space, not due to safety concerns.
