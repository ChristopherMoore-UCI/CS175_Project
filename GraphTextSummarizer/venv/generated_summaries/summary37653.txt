Carney said U.S. officials had told Hong Kong authorities that Snowden's passport had been revoked "in plenty of time to have prohibited travel." "We are just not buying that this was a technical decision by a Hong Kong immigration official," Carney said Monday. U.S. officials have yanked Snowden's passport, but he left Hong Kong on a "refugee document of passage" issued by Ecuador, according to Julian Assange, founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which is aiding Snowden's efforts to find a safe haven. Lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as Snowden lands in Russia But an online petition calling on the White House to pardon Snowden passed the key threshold of 100,000 signatures over the weekend and had more than 110,000 early Monday. "The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States," he said. Snowden told Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa that it is "unlikely that I will have a fair trial or humane treatment" if handed over to U.S. officials to stand trial, according to a letter from Snowden read by Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino.
