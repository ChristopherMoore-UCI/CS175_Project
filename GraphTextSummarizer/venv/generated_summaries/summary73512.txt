The goal of the periodic review, and of human rights reporting in general, is to boost human rights compliance all over the world with powerful nations leading by example. And it should go even further to create a concrete program of action to make sure state governments are aware of their legal obligations to protect and promote human rights. Brewer should acquaint herself with the requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the U.S. Constitution, and commit to upholding human rights "close to home." Brewer's bizarre statement that this country's participation in a human rights reporting process is "internationalism run amok" and "unconstitutional" ignores the fact that human rights reporting requires countries to report on issues at the federal, state and local levels. -- Since World War II, Democratic and Republican administrations alike have consistently held the United States out as a worldwide model for the protection and promotion of human rights standards.
