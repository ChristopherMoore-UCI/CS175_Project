Our new connecting tool, or application programming interface, allows other committees, candidates and vendors to receive our data automatically and send data back to us in real time. In addition to all these data resources, field staffers like Aurora are given a communications playbook with media lists, information on important surrogates, suggested events to attend and messaging on key issues, as well as access to media training, research and social media help. It's the story of our field staffers across the country -- state directors, data directors, and Hispanic, black, and Asian-American engagement staffers. We've collected data from commercial and political organizations to make sure that we have the most current information needed to contact voters effectively. Not only are we making the data better, we are improving how other Republicans can access our data and provide data back to us.
