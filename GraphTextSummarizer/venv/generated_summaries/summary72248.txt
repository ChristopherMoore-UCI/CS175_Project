The Air India plane had flown in from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, carrying 160 passengers and six crew members. A rescue worker could hear the screams of a passenger on Air India Flight IX-812, but the plane was consumed with flames. Fire was leaping in every part of the Boeing jet that crashed early Saturday in southern India. I missed the flight and survived," Shetty told the Press Trust of India news agency. And then there were those who counted their blessings on Saturday for not having boarded their ill-fated flight in Dubai.
