At $13 for one adult, the admission is more than is typical for Florida state parks, but it's worth it. I heard a symphony of birds and insects on my hike, and every turn of the trail revealed another splendid mix of green pines, brown marsh grasses, white sand, dark blue water and pale blue sky. I had the cool swimming area to myself on a weekday in October, but I imagine it's filled up with splashy, happy children in northern Florida's hot summer weekends. Wakulla Springs State Park Florida is truly blessed with freshwater springs, and Wakulla is another standout. There's still a Sunshine State for folks like us -- it's "Old Florida."
