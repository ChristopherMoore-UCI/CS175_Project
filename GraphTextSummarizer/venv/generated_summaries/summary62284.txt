-- To feel the vibrancy of Ho Chi Minh City, all you have to do is step out onto a bustling city street. It's also worth a return trip later on in the evening when the market closes and street side restaurants spring up, offering great meals at cheap prices. You shouldn't have to do too much motorbike dodging down Lei Loi and after just a 15 minute stroll from City Hall is the famed Cho Ben Thanh Market. Despite mass consumption of bottled water and the finest sunscreen, you'll need to find a way to beat the heat in Ho Chi Minh City. Is Ho Chi Minh City the most exciting city in Asia for a short break?
