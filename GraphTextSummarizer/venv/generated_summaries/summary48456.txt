"There's nothing to suggest that these kids were criminal masterminds -- this wasn't an 'Ocean's 11' caper," Los Angeles Police Department Officer Brett Goodkin told CNN in 2009. The indictment alleges that, between September 2008 and August 2009, they took more than $3 million in jewelry, clothes and accessories from the homes of Orlando Bloom, Paris Hilton, Brian Austin-Green and Megan Fox, Lindsay Lohan and "The Hills" reality star Audrina Patridge. At first, police treated each robbery as a separate incident, but after noticing similarities on surveillance video from the homes of Patridge and Lohan, they concluded that the incidents were related. That could involve picking up trash from the side of the road, said DA spokeswoman Jane Robison. Lee was sentenced last year to four years in prison for burglarizing Patridge's home.
