Since then, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap, some 5,500 people have been indicted on adultery charges, though that doesn't mean they ended up behind bars. And if a man was charged criminally, that would give women more leverage in divorce proceedings. "Women are active socially and economically, and women no longer apply as economically weaker," these judges wrote. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from South Korea, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. But that's changing because South Korean society has changed enough "to lose many parts of (the anti-adultery law's) reason to exist," the prevailing judges said, according to a news release summarizing their decision.
