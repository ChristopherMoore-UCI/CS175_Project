Johnson also condemned attempts in Europe to build financial trading hubs away from London. "I think the key reason is actually in the end most sensible people in other European capitals know that it is in their interest, in the interest of the EU, to have a massive global powerhouse in London rather than in Singapore or New York." "I think if you ask most international business leaders, bankers whether they wanted to abolish elections to remove any element of uncertainty in the commercial world, well of course they would love to do that," Mayor Boris Johnson told CNN's Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, which he described as the "cyclotron of egos. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius used similar language in an interview on France Info radio saying Europe could not be "a la carte," Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported. Last month, the governor of the Banque de France told the Financial Times the City of London should be deposed as the euro's main financial center so the single currency club can "control" most financial business in the eurozone.
