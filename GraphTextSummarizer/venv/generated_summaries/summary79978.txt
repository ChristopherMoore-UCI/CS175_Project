"The defense, through Mrs. Zimmerman, lied to this court about the amount of money that they had," said trial prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda. O'Mara told CNN on Friday night that he had discussed the judge's decision with Zimmerman, who was not in court on Friday. Meanwhile, Zimmerman's defense team and prosecutors were both on the same side in court Friday afternoon fighting media companies' request to release more information in the case.

De la Rionda is also requesting a judge seal statements Zimmerman made to law enforcement officers, some of which may be used against him at trial because they were "inconsistent with the physical evidence and statements of witnesses.
