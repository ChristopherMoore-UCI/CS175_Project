As The New York Times' Manohla Dargis points out, we've become used to seeing Cruise walk on screen fully equipped as the grim action hero, and his "Edge of Tomorrow" role is essentially the antithesis of that. If Cruise doesn't re-emerge as box office king, he can at least rest easy knowing he's won over several critics once again. But with Friday's "Edge of Tomorrow," critics are placing their bets on Cruise. USA Today calls her Cruise's "action-hero equal," making "Edge of Tomorrow" "better for it" -- and, as a whole, Time's Richard Corliss was impressed. "It's been years since Mr. Cruise felt this light on screen." Blunt as his co-star is no slouch, either.
