Wright and her business partner, Mark Strong, sparked uproar in the quiet Maine town last year when a prostitution ring became public and a list of clients was released and spread around town. In February 2012, Wright's Zumba studio was raided, as well as Strong's offices. -- A 29-year-old Zumba instructor was sentenced to 10 months in jail Friday for engaging in prostitution out of her fitness studio in the picturesque town of Kennebunk, Maine. Through tears on Friday, Wright told the judge that she planned on helping other women who were in similar situations. According to Strong's sentencing memo, Wright would not engage in a prostitution session unless Strong had "prior knowledge of the session and was actively watching via the Skype connection."
