Each port of call brings another familiar face: Gwyneth Paltrow looking green and jet-lagged, Matt Damon as her tired and bewildered husband, Laurence Fishburne coordinating the response for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kate Winslet (wonderful), who is first in the field as the American fatalities begin to mount.

Marion Cotillard is a World Health Organization scientist collecting data from the initial carrier in China.
