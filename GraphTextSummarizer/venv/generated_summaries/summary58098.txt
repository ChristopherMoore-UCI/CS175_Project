Ben & Jerry's has apologized for putting fortune cookies in pints of its "Taste the Lin-Sanity" frozen yogurt sold at its Harvard Square, Massachusetts, location in honor of basketball sensation Jeremy Lin. "We are proud and honored to have Jeremy Lin hail from one of our fine, local universities and we are huge sports fans. Lin, 23, came off the bench earlier this month to guide the Knicks to win after improbable win. An anchor who used the same phrase was suspended, the sports network said last Sunday. The misstep isn't the only one that has surrounded the hype over the Asian-American guard for the NBA's New York Knicks.
