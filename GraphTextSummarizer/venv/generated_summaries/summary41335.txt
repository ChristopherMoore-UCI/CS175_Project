We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar. In these cases, air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens. Throughout most of the world, air traffic controllers still track airplanes with radar -- which uses technology dating back to the 1940s. There are numerous technical details that need to be worked out, but moving from spinning radar domes to orbiting satellites could eventually make blind spots in airliner tracking a thing of the past. Flight 370 had eight ways to communicate with the ground while in flight: â€¢ Five very high frequency and high frequency radios that could transmit and receive voice and data transmissions.
