-- Leroy Fer's second half header and a late strike from Memphis Depay fired the Netherlands to a third consecutive World Cup win following a hard-fought 2-0 victory against Chile. Chile, which reached the last 16 in 1998 and 2010, will play its next game on Saturday 28th June in Belo Horizonte. Chile's first defeat of the tournament condemned Jorge Sampaoli's side into second place. "I think that this was a match that we expected, with the Netherlands trying to use lots of people on the counter attack," Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli told reporters. And Depay, who became his country's youngest ever goalscorer at a World Cup during last week's 3-2 win over Australia, netted his second after great work by Robben.
