Boundary County sheriff deputies remain on site, but jurisdiction was being transferred to authorities from Lincoln County, Montana. -- A grizzly bear attacked and killed a hunter Friday in a remote part of northwestern Montana before being gunned down itself, authorities said. Officials from multiple government agencies were at the site by Friday evening, Weland added a short time later in an e-mail to reporters. The man who was killed had been part of a hunting party of three men, said Mike Weland, a spokesman for Boundary County, Idaho, which borders Canada and abuts the area where the attack took place. At that point, authorities determined that the incident -- initially believed to have happened in northern Idaho -- actually occurred on the Montana side of Buckhorn Mountain, according to Weland.
