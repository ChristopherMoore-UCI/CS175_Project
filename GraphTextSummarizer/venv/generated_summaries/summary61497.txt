Gunfire crackles and flames scar battlefields in eastern Ukraine -- signs, officials warn, of a crumbling ceasefire in the volatile region. Russia has amassed some 8,000 troops along the Ukraine border, Pentagon officials and the British security source said. But Ukrainian leaders and many Western officials have accused Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty in what amounts to an illegal land grab. "The sanctions have yet to sufficiently affect Russia's calculus as it relates to Ukraine," Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters. Russia has also stepped up shipments of heavy weapons to separatists in recent days, Pentagon officials say.
