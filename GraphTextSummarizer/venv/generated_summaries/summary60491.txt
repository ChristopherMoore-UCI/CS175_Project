Special agents and inspectors with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Postal Service began to investigate Koppler's shipments last March, according to the release. Koppler faces one count of illegally importing wildlife into the United States, the U.S. attorney's office for the district said in a news release. Koppler received about $300,000 as a result of tarantula sales around the world, according to the release. "I am shocked, I know him very well." Sheller, who exports hundreds of tarantulas each year, said it is important to follow the shipment rules. Koppler failed to declare to the Fish and Wildlife Service that he had shipped the tarantulas and that is why they are considered smuggled, Mrozek said.
