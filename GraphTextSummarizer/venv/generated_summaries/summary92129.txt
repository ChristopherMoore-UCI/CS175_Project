No thanks for the memories: The scientific study applied mild electric shocks to hermit crabs to determine if they could 'feel' pain. -- New research suggests that crabs not only suffer pain but that they retain a memory of it. "Such trade-offs are seen in vertebrates in which the response to pain is controlled with respect to other requirements. The study, which was carried out by Professor Bob Elwood and Mirjam Appel from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen's University, Belfast, looked at the reactions of hermit crabs to small electric shocks. Humans, for example, may hold onto a hot plate that contains food whereas they may drop an empty plate, showing that we take into account differing motivational requirements when responding to pain.
