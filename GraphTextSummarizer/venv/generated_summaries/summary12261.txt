On Monday, Cosby's wife, Camille, released a statement in defense of her husband, who has been accused of sexual assault by a number of women. Over the last month, many women have come forward to accuse Cosby of past sexual assault;  the star has never been charged. Even without any charges filed, the accusations have caused Cosby's public persona to be damaged, resulting in lost projects and tour dates. It defies common sense that "so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years," said Cosby's attorney, Martin D. Singer, in a written statement sent to CNN. Cosby has said little, though Friday he told a freelance New York Post reporter that he appreciates his wife's strength, and offered expectations on how the media should cover the story.
