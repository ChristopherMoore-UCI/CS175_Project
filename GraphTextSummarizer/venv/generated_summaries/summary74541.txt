But Chan says not to underestimate the practical advantages of having actual office space in Hong Kong, where high rent makes a permanent office out of reach for many who are just starting out. Thought to have first started in San Francisco in 2005 with Citizen Space, co-working spaces are now widespread in the U.S. and Europe and are making headway in Asia, courting mostly people in their 20s and 30s working on projects solo or in small teams. But for a little more than $100 a month, Hong Kong resident Ken Chan can develop his start-up, network with like-minded people and relax with a game of ping-pong -- all under the same roof. Yet people working on Internet start-ups do not get much support, as the field is still seen as unconventional in Hong Kong. "It's only becoming acceptable to take the risk of starting tech start-ups or being a freelancer," says Constant Tedder, the British founder of The Hive in Hong Kong, a co-working space that opened in May. The cost of going to The Hive ranges from $40, for a day pass, to over $750 per month for a dedicated desk.
