Over the years, many friends and family members expressed a desire to help other children in the system, short of becoming foster parents themselves. "Anybody -- anywhere, anytime -- can go on our website, and they can look at hundreds of wishes that are posted on behalf of children in foster care and children in vulnerable family environments," Gletow said. "I could pay the same respect as everyone else." One Simple Wish was started by Danielle Gletow to help grant the wishes of children in foster care. A lot of them decide that it's not worth wishing anymore because it isn't going to happen." Since 2006, Gletow and her husband, Joe, have been foster parents to several children, eventually adopting one of them. The Ohana Project helps foster kids, foster-care workers and families by providing 24/7 access to new baby supplies, bed linens and blankets, pajamas and other items that can ease a child's transition into a new placement or home.
