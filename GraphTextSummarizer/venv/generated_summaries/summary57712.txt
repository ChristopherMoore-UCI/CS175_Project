-- Once marred by conflict, Mozambique is slowly emerging as a popular tourist destination as people are drawn in by the tropical weather, beautiful beaches and rich culture. But a group of Mozambique artists are working in the building to transform reminders of Mozambique's more recent civil war into pieces of art. Nucleo de arte or Arms to Art is a creative form of demobilization. One of Mozambique's most important exports are prawns and they are available to buy fresh in nearby markets. Investment in tourism began in 1992, following a peace agreement, which brought an end to 16 years of civil war in the country.
