Cases are reviewed based on how sick a patient is, but even though someone such as Pearce is near the top of the list, about 117,000 other patients vie for potential donations, according to United Network for Organ Sharing. Typically, patients seeking organ transplants register as candidates for the national waiting list through the United Network for Organ Sharing after receiving medical clearance from their hospitals. Patients who need the organs of a deceased individual must also wait on the list, as United Network for Organ Sharing determines where to allocate these organs. But patients can take the initiative to find a family with a terminally ill loved one and have them consent to donate that person's organs after he or she has died -- an option the Flood sisters are exploring for Pearce. The Flood sisters help patients expedite that waiting period by providing them with a list of potential donors, helping them choose the right hospital and referring them to organizations that can assist with medical expenses.
