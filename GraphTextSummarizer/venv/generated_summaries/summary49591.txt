The journalists included Vatican communications staff and several Latin American reporters, mostly from Argentina. Francis will meet with his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, in a week, the Vatican said Saturday. This, writes CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, who's also a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, is the first clear signal that he may be serious about reform. " Francis wants "a certain period for reflection, prayer and dialogue before [making] any definitive nomination or confirmation," the Vatican statement said. On Sunday, Francis will celebrate Mass in Vatican City and for the first time deliver the Angelus, or noon blessing, from his papal apartment window to the crowds gathered below in St. Peter's Square.
