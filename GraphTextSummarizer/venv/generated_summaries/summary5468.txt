The shifting attitude comes as the Supreme Court could take up gay marriage as early as next year. Some, like Republican strategist and LGBT activist Margaret Hoover, say the party is changing too slowly and needs to put its opposition to gay marriage to rest. " Daly, whose daily Focus on the Family radio broadcast reach more than 2.9 million listeners weekly, is nowhere close to endorsing same-sex unions and insists that the legalization of gay marriage in the U.S. isn't a "fait accompli." The generational split is even more pronounced among the GOP: nearly two-thirds of Republicans under 30 favor same sex marriage compared to 39% of all Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center survey. "I think the fact that the majority of Republicans don't support same sex marriage or LGBT freedom is detrimental to reaching out and connecting to a new generation of voters," said Hoover, who is also a CNN political commentator.
