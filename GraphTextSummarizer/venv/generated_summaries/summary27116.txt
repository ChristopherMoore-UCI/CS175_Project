-- The day after little Jorelys Rivera's mangled body was found in a suburban Atlanta trash compactor, Ryan Brunn sat in a stark room for a police interview. But in front on Jorelys' sobbing mother, Brunn's apology fell far short. " Brunn tells Sitton that his family was originally from New York but he had been living in Dahlonega, Georgia. Before the video cuts off, Sitton asks Brunn about allegations he faced in Virginia before his move to Georgia. Sitton tells him that he is concerned about Brunn's marijuana habit.
