ZURICH, Switzerland -- FIFA hierarchy have voted to scrap the policy of rotating World Cup finals between the six continental confederations, following a meeting in Switzerland. Chung explained that all associations would be free to apply to host future World Cup finals, providing they did not belong to confederations that had staged either of the two previous tournaments. The rotation system meant that after Colombia dropped out of the 2014 race, Brazil was left as the sole candidate -- a situation FIFA president Sepp Blatter wanted to avoid in the future. "I believe that a U.S. bid will be very competitive." South Korea and Japan shared the 2002 World Cup and Germany was the host in 2006. " Tevez joined West Ham from Brazilian side Corinthians, who have since become embroiled in an investigation by Brazilian police.
