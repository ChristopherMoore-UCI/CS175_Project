Ansar al Sharia, an al Qaeda affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying on Twitter that its fighters targeted the U.S. section within Al Anad airbase in retaliation for attempts the United States made to rescue American hostage Luke Somers. Militants allied with al Qaeda fired rockets at Yemen's largest military airbase Thursday, claiming they were aiming at U.S. targets at the facility. Somers and another hostage, South African Pierre Korkie, were both killed in a failed U.S. military raid on militants over the weekend. Yemeni Defense Ministry officials said six rockets were fired at the airbase in the country's southwest. The rockets missed their intended targets, a Yemeni Defense Ministry official said.
