And if you're into more mainstream rock, or celebrity gossip, you've probably read about Mosshart and co-Kill Jamie Hince for other reasons. Other rockers might not remember the exact date of their first gig, but it's easy for singer Alison Mosshart to recall: She has the date tattooed on her hand. Despite their busy lives outside the Kills, Mosshart and Hince still passionately focus on the band that changed their lives. Mosshart soon moved to London to join forces with Hince, but there was one problem: She didn't play an instrument. When Hince and Mosshart first met, they bonded over a shared love of the Warhol scene.
