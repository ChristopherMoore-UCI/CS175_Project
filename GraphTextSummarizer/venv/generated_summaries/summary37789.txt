The first step in providing Afghans security and weakening the Taliban and violent extremists is to remove recruiting incentives. There is no reason to believe the U.S. military is in the best position to train Afghans, given huge cultural differences and past abuses by U.S. forces. While those in major cities live in relative security, rural Afghans fear violence from insurgents or U.S. and NATO forces. The U.S. mission in Afghanistan can then focus on rebuilding the country the U.S. partly destroyed eight years ago (through air strikes and funding warlords in the Northern Alliance), lifting Afghans out of poverty and making the country less of a haven or recruiting center for extremists. This is easier said than done, as U.S. border guards know from their own difficulties of securing the Mexican border.
