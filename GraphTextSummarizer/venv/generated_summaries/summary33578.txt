The Dutch entrepreneurs realized that if margarine were going to become a substitute for butter, it needed to look like butter, so they began dyeing margarine -- which is naturally white -- a buttery yellow. Paradoxically, the pure foods movement of the 1920s helped undermine natural butter and elevate the status of margarine. As any toast aficionado knows, margarine is a heck of a lot easier to spread than butter. Suddenly, butter makers couldn't tweak their products to make it easier to slather on breakfast, but margarine manufacturers could. There was no reason why they couldn't simultaneously sell consumers margarine and yellow dye, though.
