Ever rising oil and gas prices would make current renewable energy technologies, like wind and bio-fuels economic; and energy security would be enhanced through switching away from imported oil and gas. That, in turn, meant that energy policy should actively try to increase the security of the supply by increasing domestic energy production. Gas prices have more than halved in the last five years, and oil production is up over a quarter over the same period. Canada is having to look to export from its west coast rather than sell its oil and gas to the U.S. Indeed so great is the energy abundance that a process of repatriating energy intensive industries is now getting underway. The second was that climate change is best addressed by a top down international climate change agreement, and that within that framework, the U.S. should accept a cap on the amount of carbon it would release into the atmosphere.
