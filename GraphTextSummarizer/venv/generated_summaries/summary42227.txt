EW reported exclusively last month that Schwarzenegger's first post-governor gig would be the animated series "The Governator," a play off of the title combining "governor" and "Terminator" that became synonymous with his tenure running California's government before he even had the job. "When I ran for governor back in 2003 and I started hearing people talking about 'the Governator,' I thought the word was so cool," Schwarzenegger told EW last month. Arnold Schwarzenegger has given Hollywood agency CAA approval to discuss a potential new Terminator movie with studios, a source close to the star confirms to EW, but until Schwarzenegger sees a script and specifics about the project, he will not fully commit to it. The former California governor's last starring role was in 2003's "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" (global gross: $433 million), and he continues to be strongly identified with the cybernetic assassin that helped propel him to superstardom. Sony and Lionsgate had attempted to jointly bid for the property, but the bankruptcy judge awarded it to the Santa Barbara, California-based hedge fund management company instead.
