I anticipate the trends in 2013 -- increased time spent playing games on mobile devices and a shift to 'freemium' pricing in games -- will continue to grow in 2014. We will see more games on tablets, new business models birthed by the rise of digital distribution, the continued growth of eSports and exciting new ventures like Valve's Steam box. "What used to be a race between three console manufacturers for dominance has diversified into dozens of companies carving out their own market segments." Wallace Santos, CEO and founder, Maingear "2014 is going to bring a lot of new and exciting technologies to gamers. With new platforms and consoles available and more people playing games on smartphones and tablets, the future appears to be open to a vast array of possibilities. Gaming has expanded to represent around a third of time spent on connected devices, and I am confident gaming will confirm its position as one of the core uses on those devices in 2014. The majority of old-school developers I know now have gone into more personal, niche titles; (it) reminds me of when many of the great PC studios (BioWare, Bungie, Bethesda) started developing console games in the early 2000s.
