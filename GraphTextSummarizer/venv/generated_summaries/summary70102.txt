"The work of the construction and delivery teams, from the ODA and LOCOG (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games), has set a very high standard and I have no doubt that London 2012 has set a new benchmark for the management of Olympic and Paralympic Games in future. The process of transforming London's Olympic Park in the east of the Britain's capital from a world-class sporting venue into a brand new area of the English capital has already begun in earnest with the handover of the site to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) from LOCOG. "The UK hosted a spectacular Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer," LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said in a statement. The area, which will be known as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, will now undergo a Â£292 million ($467 million) redevelopment, including the creation of 2,818 news houses and apartments in the former Olympic Village site. A total of 250,000 temporary seats, 165,000m2 of tents and 140 kilometers of fencing have already been removed from venues across London, including the beach volleyball arena at Horse Guard's Parade and the Equestrian Arena at Greenwich Park.
