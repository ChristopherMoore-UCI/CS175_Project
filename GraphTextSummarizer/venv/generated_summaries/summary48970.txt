Watch a mother talk about the importance of her autistic son's 4 Paws service dog Â» Shirk says service dogs also give autistic children valuable emotional support. That's how Karen Shirk explains the ability of service dogs to help children suffering from autism. She developed a program to train autism assistance dogs, and of the 319 dogs she's placed since 1998, nearly 70 percent have been partnered with autistic children. "But I call it magic." Since 1998, through her nonprofit 4 Paws for Ability, Shirk has helped partner service dogs with people with a wide range of disabilities. Since many agencies have age restrictions, she now specializes in providing dogs to children.
