Those include new regulations requiring sterile compounding pharmacies to report volume and distribution to the state for the first time and the hiring of additional inspectors. "We are pleased that a significant amount of funds will become available for distribution to victims and their families as compensation for the deaths, injuries and suffering they endured as a result of this tragic meningitis outbreak," Moore said. In February, Massachusetts health officials ordered 11 compounding pharmacies to completely or partially shut down after unannounced inspections in the wake of the fungal meningitis outbreak. The settlement amount would be funded by cash from the pharmacy's owners as well as other sources, such as insurance, tax refunds and the sale of a related business. Following the outbreak, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said it launched "a series of aggressive initiatives" aimed at preventing a recurrence.
