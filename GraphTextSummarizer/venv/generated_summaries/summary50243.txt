"The culture has shifted away from conspicuous consumption, so if you are going to have a super expensive product this may not be the time for it," says Avi Greengart, research director for consumer devices at Current Analysis. Nuovo may have inadvertently hit on the real problem with luxury phones: Phones are still a very feature-driven products. After years of chasing the ultra-wealthy with exclusive devices that carry designer logos and promise craftsmanship from materials such as sapphire and stainless steel, luxury phone makers are now pulling back. "Phones aren't like a handbag where the fundamental utility remains the same and the design changes all the time," says Greengart. Luxury phones have never been a big phenomenon in North America, says Greengart.
