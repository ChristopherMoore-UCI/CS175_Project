Two of the bombers, including ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan, were trailed by security services for a year before the attacks, according to a report released last year by the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC). The investigation will hear from relatives of the victims, survivors, London Underground staff, police, and emergency services personnel. the report said that domestic intelligence service MI5 considered Khan a "small time fraudster" and "minor criminal" and did not link him to potential attacks within the U.K. at that time. John Reid, the home secretary at the time of the attacks, said the four bombers -- three British males of Pakistani descent and a Jamaican-born man -- were young "radicalized" Muslims whose motivation was "fierce antagonism to perceived injustices by the West against Muslims" and a desire to become martyrs. Justice Heather Hallett is probing whether the secret service or police could have prevented the attacks, which were carried out by British-born bombers backed by al Qaeda.
