Davis had walked about a half mile uphill last Friday, October 18, along a deserted trail in Phoenix when she found the black and white dog, suffering from bullet wounds, said Arizona Humane Society spokeswoman Bretta Nelson in an e-mail. Nelson said Elijah responded to Jessi as if "they had been best friends their whole lives." Elijah is now adjusting to his new foster home, where he is getting to know the other Davis dogs. "When my mom found our new dog on the mountain, my heart broke at the first sight of him," said Andi's daughter Jessi, 10, in a letter to Nelson and the AHS. Andi Davis was overwhelmed by the media attention and did not want to talk, but gave Nelson the permission to do so. Nelson said it's unlikely any investigation will be conducted to find the person who injured Elijah since there isn't a clear timetable and no witnesses have come forward.
