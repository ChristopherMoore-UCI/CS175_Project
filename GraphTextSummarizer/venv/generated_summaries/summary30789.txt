Finally, the government is increasing money for federal air marshals for domestic flights to replace those diverted to international flights following international plots uncovered in recent years. For border security, the budget includes funding for 21,370 Border Patrol agents and 21,185 Customs and Border Protection officers. Homeland Security officials called the changes modest Monday, saying that most increases were "follow-ups" to more ambitious initiatives announced last year. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a House committee the terrorist threat facing the U.S. "continues to evolve, so that, in some ways, the threat facing us is at its most heightened state since" September 11. It also includes $12.4 million to vet air travelers against watch lists and $14.1 million for enhancing screening of international travelers before they board U.S.-bound flights.
