I had come to a point where I needed a new "classroom" in which medical students could fully experience the reality of those who did not make it into effective medical care. The Street Medicine Institute provides consulting services to assist communities that seek to establish new street medicine programs and improve the care of their own street homeless populations. Students from all over the world now come to Pittsburgh to work with Operation Safety Net, many starting street medicine programs of their own in cities such as Rochester, New York; Detroit; Santa Barbara, California; Prague; and Ibadan, Nigeria. This will potentially make health care delivery more cost effective and efficient as the principles of "street medicine" are applied to other populations. We believe that by taking care of our own fallen citizens, but by doing it within a global vision, we reclaim the true spirit of health care and build better communities for ourselves.
