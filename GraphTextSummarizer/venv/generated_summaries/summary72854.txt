Ziyad Abu Ein died Wednesday after clashes with Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian village of Turmusaya, northeast of the West Bank city of Ramallah, longtime chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said in a statement. -- Young girls were sitting in the back of their family's car, with their backpacks and a Hello Kitty notebook, when a Palestinian attacker tossed acid at them Friday, Israeli authorities said. Meanwhile, there have been scattered protests in the West Bank over the death of a senior Palestinian Authority official after a confrontation with Israeli troops. Abu Ein -- a minister in Abbas' Fatah party and head of the Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements -- was there participating in nonviolent demonstrations to mark international Human Rights Day, according to Erakat's statement. The largest were in the West Bank city of Hebron, where hundreds of people clashed with security forces.
