Moody, who has served in Iraq and then Afghanistan as part of the California and then Nevada National Guards, had been released from jail on bail, but it was uncertain when he would be allowed to leave the United Arab Emirates. Nicholas Moody became an inactive Guardsman when he took his latest job in Iraq with a security company, which Lorina Moody declined to name. In a November interview, Moody's mother, Lorina Moody, said she was still coming to grips with how he landed in jail. Moody, from Nevada, was arrested September 29 during an 18-hour layover in Abu Dhabi while heading back from Iraq. "I understand the why, the things that I had were in violations of the laws," said Corporal Nicholas Moody.
