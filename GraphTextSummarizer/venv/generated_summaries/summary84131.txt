" In the strikes, known as "green-on-blue" attacks, Afghan security forces or militants dressed as local police or soldiers target coalition troops. -- A man in an Afghan military uniform killed three U.S. troops Friday in southern Afghanistan, the latest in a series of assaults against NATO soldiers by Afghans clad in security force garb. The problem has sapped troop morale, and coalition forces have been working to address it. "The U.S. military has become so concerned with the green-on-blue attacks that it has ordered units to designate 'guardian angels' in each unit whose job is to provide security for troops working with Afghans. Earlier this year, Gen. John Allen, commander of the NATO-led force, said the systems that Afghans and coalition forces had put in place to help prevent these attacks were having an effect.
