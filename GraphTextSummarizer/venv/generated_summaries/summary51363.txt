The shuttles are to be retired by September 30, 2010, but they won't be available until about a year later, NASA spokesman Michael Curie said Thursday. In January 2004, President Bush called for an eventual shift in focus from the space shuttle program to the new Vision for Space Exploration program, which NASA describes as "a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system. The space agency sent a notice this week to museums, schools and similar institutions to gauge their interest and qualifications for properly housing Discovery, Atlantis or Endeavour. Space Shuttle Endeavour comes in for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California last month. "These are national assets, national treasures and something that NASA feels the public would want to see displayed publicly for years to come," Curie said.
