Ali said he has reached out to animal rights groups and wants their help setting up a wildlife reserve in Ras Al Khaimah, since the animals' legal limbo makes repatriation difficult. Most big cats are sent to the Abu Dhabi Wildlife Center, which is privately funded by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahayan, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family. Ali manages the Ras Al Khaimah Wildlife Park, set up a few years ago under the patronage of Sheikh Taleb bin Saqr Al Qasimi, one of the Ras Al Khaimah's royals. None of the pet owners we approached would speak on the record about illegally purchasing exotic animals, but many amateur videos uploaded online attest to their popularity among young men in the Gulf. Kelaif said people buy exotic animals without understanding the unique needs they have and the level of responsibility involved.
