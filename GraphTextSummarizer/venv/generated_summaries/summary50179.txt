" Rust said the statement was authorized by Ethics Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, R-Texas, and ranking Democrat Linda Sanchez, D-California. " Rust noted that a database at clerk.house.gov makes publicly available all "detailed post-travel reports ... on the same page where the public can look up Members' financial disclosure reports." "As the House developed the new online financial disclosure system, the Committee's nonpartisan staff recommended a number of changes to the financial disclosure forms, including eliminating the need to report less information about private travel than the traveler had already publicly disclosed the year before," the statement continued.

Charlie Rangel, D-New York -- who narrowly won his party's renomination last week -- had failed to report an all-expenses-paid trip he took to China last year. "The new rule presented by the Ethics Committee for disclosure of travel must be reversed," House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California wrote in a statement. Why make this change in disclosure reports?
