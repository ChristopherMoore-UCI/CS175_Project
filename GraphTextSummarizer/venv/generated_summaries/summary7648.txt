Algerian government officials did not warn their U.S. counterparts about the raid, the official said. CNN's Dan Rivers, Elise Labott, David Mattingly, Athena Jones, Barbara Starr, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister and Faith Karimi contributed to this report, as did journalists Peter Taggert from Belfast and Said Ben Ali from Algiers. It was not clear whether that activity represented "mopping up and checking" or "something more active" being carried out by Algerian forces against the abductors, the official told CNN.
