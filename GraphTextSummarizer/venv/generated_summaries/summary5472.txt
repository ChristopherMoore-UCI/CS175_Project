Instead of watching the evolution of a man named Walter White (played by Cranston in "Breaking Bad"), potential fans will follow Walter Blanco, as played by Colombian actor Diego Trujillo. The RV where Walter and Jesse make their great escape in the "Breaking Bad" pilot is also replaced by a rickety school bus turned into a lab for "Metastasis." In September, Latin America will get its own, Spanish-language version of "Breaking Bad" called "Metastasis." Well-crafted symbolism, such as the noteworthy pink teddy bear that falls from a plane, appears in "Metastasis," as do other scenes well-known to "Breaking Bad" viewers. There are other factors that distinguish "Metastasis" from "Breaking Bad."
