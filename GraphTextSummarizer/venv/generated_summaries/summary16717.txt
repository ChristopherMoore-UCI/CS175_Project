Eisenberg will be arraigned Monday at a Hillsborough County courthouse on an escape charge, and then will be sent to state prison in Concord, state Department of Corrections spokesman Jeff Lyons said This is at least the second time Eisenberg, 52, left authorities wondering about his whereabouts. Eisenberg, who took hostages six years ago at one of Hillary Clinton's campaign offices, was arrested Monday morning at a community resource center in Manchester, New Hampshire, hours after officials learned he wasn't at a Manchester halfway house where he was supposed to be, police in the city said. Eisenberg has a history of mental illness and substance-abuse problems, authorities say. In an interview with CNN in 2007, Eisenberg said he took the hostages to raise awareness about mental health issues. "I wanted to sacrifice myself for mental illness and bring about the discussion about mental illness," Eisenberg said.
