For the short-term bill, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told reporters Friday the $4 billion in spending cuts would come from terminating eight programs that President Obama included in his proposed 2012 budget and the elimination of earmarks, the same two areas Senate Democrats said Thursday they were considering. -- One week before a potential government shutdown, Senate Democrats for the first time reacted positively to an offer from House Republicans that would keep the government running for two more weeks while cutting $4 billion. "The plan the Republicans are floating today sounds like a modified version of what Democrats were talking about" in a proposal made to Republicans Thursday, said Jon Summers, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Democrats have accused Republicans of wanting indiscriminate budget cuts that would hit a wide swath of government programs -- something that wouldn't happen in this latest short-term proposal from the GOP because it is more targeted. The positive reaction from Democrats elicited an equally positive response from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell who said, "There is now a clear path" to avoid a government shutdown.
