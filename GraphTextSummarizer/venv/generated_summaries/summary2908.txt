"Further economic integration [and] trade liberalization in Asia Pacific is vital to our own interests and our ability to export more and grow our economy here at home," National Security Advisor Mike Froman said ahead of Obama's Asia trip. -- U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Wednesday, where the leaders of top global economies will convene at the G-20 summit to try to stabilize the world's financial markets. "We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy," Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip. "America has a stake in an Indonesia that is growing, with prosperity that is broadly shared among the Indonesian people, because a rising middle class here means new markets for our goods, just as America is a market for yours," he said. Obama left Indonesia hours early, because volcanic ash from Mount Merapi could have grounded Air Force One, administration officials said.
