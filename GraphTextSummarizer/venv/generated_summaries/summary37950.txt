It was diverted to Tulsa due to an issue with the plane's left engine, American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Masvidal told CNN. If all goes according to plan -- this time around -- this aircraft should arrive at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport a few minutes after 11 p.m. local time. -- Those aboard an American Airlines airplane from London got to see a little more of America than they expected Friday, after their flight was diverted to Tulsa, Oklahoma, due to engine trouble. One problem -- besides whatever happened to the left engine -- is that Tulsa's airport doesn't have U.S. Customs and Border Protection workers on hand to handle incoming international travelers. The aircraft that will take them to Dallas was set to leave that Texas city around 9:15 p.m. for Tulsa.
