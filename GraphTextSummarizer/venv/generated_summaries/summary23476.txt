Weingarten also said the film's charter school success stories are not representative of charter schools as a whole: "Guggenheim makes only glancing reference to the poor achievement of most charter schools, despite the abundance of independent research showing that most charter schools perform worse than or only about as well as comparable regular public schools. Charter schools are similar to public schools in that they are free to attend and funded by taxpayer dollars. It found that 17 percent of charter schools reported progress significantly better than public schools, 46 percent showed no difference, and 37 percent performed worse. Charter school proponents say increased accountability -- as well as the freedom to innovate -- gives them an edge over traditional public schools. The film's website offers detailed instructions of how people can make a difference on a local level -- from writing public officials to volunteering at schools in their own communities.
