Because information obtained by intelligence agencies is generally not admissable in Spanish courts, Spanish police and security services had scramble in the past few days to provide sufficient evidence to bring a case, according to Reinares. Reinares said French security services had asked their Spanish counterparts not to share intelligence on the suspected cell with the Spanish judiciary, fearing that open exposure of such information in court -- as required by Spanish law -- could blow the whole operation. Reinares said Spanish security services have established that both Chechens received motor-paragliding lessons near La Linea and may have had some instruction before arriving in Spain. Adamov, the other Chechen, had received explosives training in Afghanistan, where he become an expert in managing explosives and may have participated in a recent bomb attack in Moscow, according to Spanish authorities. Spanish investigators found a video in which Yalcin was flying a remote-controlled airplane, according to Reinares.
