"We are doing everything, both the organizers and our athletes and fans, so that participants and guests feel comfortable in Sochi, regardless of nationality, race or sexual orientation," Putin said, according to RIA Novosti. Putin also said in an interview on state television in September that gay people would not be discriminated against at the Sochi Games. -- Russian President Vladmir Putin says everyone will be welcomed to next year's Winter Olympics in Russia, regardless of sexual orientation -- comments that come on the heels of a controversial Russian law on homosexuality.
