Listen to President Bush talk about bin Laden now, at the end of his presidency, a chastened cowboy at best: Larry King: ...Are we ever, ever going to find bin Laden? CNN's Campbell Brown says President Bush is now a chastened cowboy. Vice President-elect Joe Biden and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham are just back from a Middle East tour, including visits to Iraq and Afghanistan. Just a few months after the September 11 attacks, who can forget what he said about catching Osama bin Laden: President Bush: I don't care, dead or alive either way. Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's "Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays.
