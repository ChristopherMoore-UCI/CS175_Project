The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, meanwhile, said it "encourages parents and caregivers to consider acquiring an alternative car seat for transporting children until their Graco seat is fixed." Graco reports no injuries associated with this issue on seats, which sold for between $99 and $400. According to Graco's website, the recall models include these toddler convertible car seats:  the Cozy Cline, Comfort Sport, Classic Ride 50, My Ride 65, My Ride 65 with Safety Surround, My Ride 70, Size4Me 70, My Size 70, Head Wise 70 and Smart Seat. In a statement, Graco said the voluntary recall affects "harness buckles used on all toddler convertible car seats and harnessed  booster seats manufactured from 2009 to July 2013. According to the government, the seven models that Graco isn't recalling despite being asked to do so by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are all infant seats. The 3.7 million seats alone makes this recall the fourth biggest ever for car seats, according to the federal agency.
