" Biden endorsed Braley as the right choice for Iowa voters and, at times, attacked Republican Joni Ernst, Braley's opponent. Vice President Joe Biden delivered a wonky, populist speech on Monday in Davenport where he endorsed Bruce Braley for Senate and lambasted Republicans for forgetting about the middle class. Biden, who is known for being folksy and prides himself on relating to working class voters, attacked Republicans for what he called attempts to roll back Medicaid, privatize social security and stop any raise of the minimum wage. Polls have each campaign within striking distance of one another, a fact that -- coupled with Iowa being the crucial first-in-the-nation caucus state for the presidency -- has drawn out a number of big name Democrats and Republicans. "I hope he talks about what the Republicans are for." Then Biden turned to one camera on the riser next to him and acted like he was talking directly to Boehner: "Talk about what the Republicans are for John, it is your buddy Joe."
