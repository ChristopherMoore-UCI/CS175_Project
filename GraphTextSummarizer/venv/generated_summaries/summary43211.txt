-- Manchester United finally lost patience with manager David Moyes Tuesday after a disastrous first season in charge of the English Premier League champions. "Manchester United announces that David Moyes has left the club," said the English Premier League team in a statement on the club's official Twitter feed. Ferguson also implored United fans to stand by Moyes when he addressed them following his last game in charge at Old Trafford last season, which ended with his 13th league title in a trophy-laden 27-year reign. United also endured embarrassing exits from both domestic knockout competitions, losing at home to Swansea in the third round of the FA Cup and going down on penalties against another struggling Premier League team -- Sunderland -- in the League Cup semifinals. But pressure soon started piling up in September with league defeats against arch rivals Liverpool, Manchester City and, embarrassingly, West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford -- the Midlands' club first win at the "Theater of Dreams" for 34 years.
