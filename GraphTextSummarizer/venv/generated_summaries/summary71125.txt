Speaking just before Obama, Peres said,"The United States and Israel share the same goal: to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon is a national security interest of both Israel and the United States, President Barack Obama said Sunday in calling for continued diplomatic efforts but also pledging that all options -- including a military effort -- remain viable. Israeli officials say that if Iran was able to enrich weapons-grade uranium, it would potentially cross the "red line" of nuclear weapons capability that Israel fears. While Obama's position was consistent with his past pronouncements, his specific reference to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon -- rather than the capability of building a nuclear weapon -- maintained what some consider to be a difference from Israel's position. While some will embrace Obama's core message of an ironclad commitment to Israel, others will question why Obama didn't go further in specifying his intentions regarding Iran, Harris said.
