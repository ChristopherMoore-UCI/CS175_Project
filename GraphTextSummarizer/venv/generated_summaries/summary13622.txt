One witness said he saw attackers in a gunbattle with consulate security and police. All U.S. Consulate personnel were safe and accounted for following the explosion, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. In addition to the U.S. Consulate, the blast occurred immediately across the street from a strip of bars, cafes and shops popular with expats and consulate employees. At least four people were killed and 18 injured, police said. Security personnel fired at the car, which exploded but did not reach the consulate, a police official said.
