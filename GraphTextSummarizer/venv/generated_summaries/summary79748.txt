As World Bank leader, she would also give the emerging market nations a voice on the global stage, Okonjo-Iweala said, and reflect a changing world where those countries are increasingly contributing to growth. The bank should also focus on promoting growth in developing nations to create jobs, especially for young people, she said. Okonjo-Iweala said she welcomed the competition posed by Kim, whose background is in medicine, not economics or business as has been the case with most previous World Bank presidents. Okonjo-Iweala, a Harvard-educated economist and former senior World Bank official, said her role as head of the Nigerian finance ministry had provided a valuable practical grounding. She said her chief aim if picked to lead the bank would be to make it a faster and nimbler organization, able to respond swiftly to problems in developing countries.
