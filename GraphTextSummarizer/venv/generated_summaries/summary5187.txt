But you aren't going to be playing PS games on the 3DS XL or vice versa, so the visual appearance isn't going to be obvious. The XL's main screen is 90% larger than its smaller counterpart, while the 3-D screen on the top half of the clamshell design is nearly the same size as the PS Vita front touch screen. The larger screen and bigger controls make for easier game play, and the slightly increased weight is negligible. The 3DS XL shows it off nicely with brilliant colors, fluid motion and responsive controls. -- With Sunday's release of the Nintendo 3DS XL handheld console, Nintendo is hoping that bigger is better.
