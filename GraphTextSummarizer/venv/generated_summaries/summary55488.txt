He said women in Brazil's countryside are victimized by Brazil's ban on abortion. The abortion was performed March 4 during the fourth month of pregnancy, according to media reports Archbishop Don Jose Cardoso Sobrinho of Recife excommunicated the doctor, the child's mother and the medical team involved in the procedure. A new report by Brazil's IPAS, a non-governmental organization that works with the health ministry, indicates that more than 1 million women undergo illegal abortions in Brazil each year. Dr. Olimpio Moraes, one of the doctors involved in the procedure, said he thanked the archbishop for his excommunication because the controversy sheds light on Brazil's restrictive abortion laws. "This is why the Recife case is so important for women in Brazil," Jalli said.
