-- Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor has been given the American Bar Association's highest rating for "professional qualification," a political boost less than a week before her confirmation hearings begin in the Senate. Confirmation hearings for Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination are set to begin next week. The ABA's Standing Committee continued to rate Bush judicial nominees, but only after the president had made the choices public. Past administrations have quietly worked with the ABA to provide the identity of potential nominees before they were publicly nominated. The George W. Bush administration refused to consider or accept the ABA evaluations, saying the organization had given lower ratings for some conservative nominees, and that the ABA had publicly held liberal positions on social and political matters.
