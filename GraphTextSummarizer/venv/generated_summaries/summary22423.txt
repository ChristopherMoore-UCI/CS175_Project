Tuggle, a senior, has been in Beijing since July 6 as part of a group of international students who cover games and practices to get quotes for the Olympic News Service. "The Chinese don't have the same concept of personal space as Americans," Tuggle said. She has used the day-to-day interaction with the AFP staff to meet reporters and talk to them about their jobs to learn more and help her confirm that she wants to work for an international news agency. Neither she nor Tuggle had been to Asia before, so this trip was as much about seeing and learning about a new culture as it was about learning the nuances of sports reporting. -- Bethany Tuggle, Rachel Kurowski and 29 other North Carolina college students are going to be late for class.
