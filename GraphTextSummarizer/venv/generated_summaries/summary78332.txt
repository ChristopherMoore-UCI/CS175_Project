The South China Morning Post reported that 2,000 of the toys were made available in the Swedish furniture giant's Causeway Bay, Sha Tin and Kowloon Bay stores at a cost of HK$99.9 ($13) each. Modeled after the antagonist of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale, Lufsig went on sale at Hong Kong's three IKEA stores on Wednesday but quickly sold out as throngs of customers lined up early to get their hands on the toy, which has been out of stock since its rise to prominence in December. However, despite the immediate demand for the toy, the resell market hasn't caught fire, with dolls  selling on the Hong Kong portal of eBay for around HK$140-$150 ($18-19), a modest 40-50% markup. IKEA's wolf-like Lufsig doll, which played a cameo in local politics last year, quickly sold out upon its return to the city. Residents snapped up the stuffed toy in December after one was hurled by a protestor at C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's leader, who is nicknamed "wolf" for his political cunning.
