-- This wasn't how Penn State football coach Bill O'Brien hoped things would start. She's put them on for 18 seasons' worth of home games, most of them victories that were vacated as part of NCAA sanctions against the school. It was a disappointing outcome for the team, though there were many things stacked against them from the start. After nine months of clouds hanging over them they were ready to get the season -- and in many ways the healing -- started. In the wake of the child sex abuse scandal that rocked campus and saw former coach Jerry Sandusky convicted of abusing 10 boys over 15 years, the football program was rocked.
