Cuba policy is steeped in dysfunction on both sides. The pro-embargo folks are ignoring the policy's epic failure and fail to recognize that U.S. policy has played into the hands of the Castro brothers, who have sinisterly used it to make the case to their people that if Cuba is starving and the island economy can't grow, it's because of this U.S. policy. Five decades of failed policy later, our nation is being held hostage unable to have a cogent discussion on anything Cuba-related. Castor is part of a new group of audacious politicians, some from Florida, who are pushing to normalize relations and bring constructive dialogue with Cuba. Obama stands to make history by using his pulpit to encourage a more sensible dialogue around a Cuba policy that has been futile.
