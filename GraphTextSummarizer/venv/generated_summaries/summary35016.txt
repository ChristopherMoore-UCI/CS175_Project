Read more: London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier The soldier, later named as Lee Rigby, 25, a father of a 2-year-old boy, is wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo of "Help for Heroes," a military charity that in little more than five years has raised well over Â£100 million ($150 million) for members of the Armed Forces wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. A police helicopter then arrives to take the men under armed guard to separate London hospitals. This is suburban London on a quiet day in May 2013. A large section of Woolwich is sealed off for the evening by forensics officers who comb the area around Artillery Place for evidence.
