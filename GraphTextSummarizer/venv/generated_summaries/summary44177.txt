Lenny explains how it works: "Future Friday is so simple it's embarrassing. Lenny made sure she told all her friends about Future Friday so she could get extra support during the difficult weeks. Every time you tick off a Future Friday item Lenny says to give yourself a pat on the back. She was also contacted by a number of people "friends of friends, strangers" who had heard about Future Friday and started practicing it themselves. Called Future Friday it was a game she played with herself each week.
