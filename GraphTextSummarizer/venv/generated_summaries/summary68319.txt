See where the water was coming over levees Â»  Up to 6 feet of water spilled into an industrial park in the Upper 9th Ward of New Orleans at one point late Monday morning, pouring through small gaps in the concrete flood walls before receding in the afternoon. While water came over the top of other levees along the Mississippi River, the barriers were holding against the battering waves that Gustav brought to southeastern Louisiana. As the storm eased, inspectors from the Army Corps of Engineers and parish levee boards went out to check on the earthen walls and have found nothing to raise alarms, said Col. Greg Gunter, a Corps of Engineers spokesman. "The levees all held up," said New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin. In New Orleans, Gustav drove sheets of water over the protective levees around New Orleans' Industrial Canal early Monday afternoon, but the walls appeared to have held as the winds faded.
