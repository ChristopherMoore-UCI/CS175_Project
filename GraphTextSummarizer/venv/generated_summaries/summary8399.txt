Omar vanished after a U.S.-led coalition booted the Taliban and their leaders from power in Afghanistan in December 2001 for refusing to hand over bin Laden after the 9/11 terror attacks. With most of the country under Taliban control, he set himself the goal of transforming Afghanistan into the purest Islamic state in the world, declaring himself Amir-ul-Momineen, or head of the Muslims. Omar was a rural Islamic cleric when he became a leader of a group of students -- or "Taliban" -- who took over Afghanistan in the early 1990s and established a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network. The United States led an invasion of Afghanistan soon after the attacks, toppling the Taliban and sending bin Laden into hiding. Nonetheless what Omar said passed as law when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, and to challenge him was unknown.
