Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said Friday that he hoped to have the fleet up in the air within 48 hours after completing engine safety checks, but backed away from that statement Monday, telling Australian Broadcasting Corp., "We did find some issues that we are investigating further." "Hopefully over the next day or so we will have an understanding of when the aircraft can get back in the air," he added. And we are just trying to check what could the cause of that be." "These are new engines on new aircraft and they shouldn't have these issues at this stage -- Qantas Airways' fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft will remain grounded indefinitely after new problems with the planes' engines were uncovered over the weekend, the Australian airline's CEO said Monday. Rolls-Royce said in a statement last week that it has been working closely with Qantas and air safety authorities "to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions. "Our top priority is making sure that we have the continued safe operation of the aircraft and if this takes a bit longer, it will take longer." Thursday's incident began shortly after takeoff when the flight carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew members to Sydney, Australia, was forced to return to Singapore's Changi Airport.
