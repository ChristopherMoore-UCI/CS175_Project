-- Maria Sharapova produced a powerful performance to defeat world No.1 Victoria Azarenka in the final of the WTA clay-court event in Stuttgart on Sunday. The Russian took just 84 minutes to blow the Belarusian off court in straight sets 6-1 6-4 and claim her first title of 2012 and the 25th of her career. Azarenka wasn't at her best and needed treatment for a wrist injury in the first set, but Sharapova showed no mercy ramming home the advantage and closing out the set in 30 minutes. " The win was revenge for Sharapova who lost to Azarenka in the Australian Open final in January and more recently in the final of the Indian Wells tournament in California. Azarenka said her wrist had been troubling her all week but wasn't looking for excuses in defeat.
