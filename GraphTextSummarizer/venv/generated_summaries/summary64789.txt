Running away with the MotoGP World Championship in his debut season, the 20-year-old Spaniard has been handed a penalty point and his Repsol Honda Team docked their points scored for Marquez's Aragon Grand Prix victory following his collision with teammate Dani Pedrosa. " Repsol Honda Team boss Livio Suppo admitted the team penalty was down to what was considered a safety lapse -- the failure of their traction-control system and the back-up unit, which, along with contact with Marquez, caused the Pedrosa crash. "We are sending a message to Marc, very clearly," said race director Mike Webb. -- MotoGP's shining star Marc Marquez has been rapped over the knuckles and "told to take more care" when riding his bike by the sport's organisers. The pair had been scrapping for second place in the race two weekends ago when Marquez made contact with Pedrosa after misjudging the braking point at Turn 12.
