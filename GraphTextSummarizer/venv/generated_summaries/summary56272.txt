The markets didn't react when UK elections were called a month ago, but that may soon change after the polls are closed: For the first time, London traders have been allowed a special election night session to trade bond and sterling futures -- and they're expecting heavy action as banks try to stake out positions, rather than wait for the usual 8 a.m. open on Friday. The UK "is a financial mega-center, so for us as a financial institution we care very much (about the election)," said Julia Coronado, senior economic analyst for BNP Paribas in New York." What has been driving this is public sector stimulus and the difficulty is we have seen very little action in the private sector," said David Blanchflower, a former UK monetary policy adviser and economics professor at Dartmouth University. In the global banking world we are very aware, more than ever, about what's going on in continental Europe, what's going on in the UK, what's going on in China, all of these things are much more interwoven now. So far, the major parties haven't provided many specifics about how they plan to tackle the UK's growing deficit, which crediting ratings agencies have warned may eventually impact its AAA rating.
