About 1.7% of Force users reported cases of skin rashes after wearing the devices, Fitbit CEO James Park said in a letter to customers on Friday afternoon. -- Complaints of itchy, irritated wrists have prompted Fitbit to voluntarily recall all of its Fitbit Force wristband activity trackers. In 2012, Jawbone offered full refunds to customers who purchased its buggy UP wristband activity tracker. Fitbit still sells its other popular trackers, including the older Flex wristband and wearable trackers that clip onto clothes. "On behalf of the entire Fitbit team, I want to apologize to anyone affected," Park said.
