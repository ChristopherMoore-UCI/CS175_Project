Rather than see the current rush of migrants as something like the break of a dam, Frankfurter has watched the pressure build for decades -- as civil wars, trade policies and a booming drug trade combine to squeeze people from all sides. "People would tell me: 'Well, we've kind of accepted, or, we're used to being robbed and beaten and raped,' " photographer Michelle Frankfurter said. "It sheds some light on just how bad things are in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala." Between 2009 and 2014, Frankfurter took several trips to Mexico to document migrants' journey from the country's southern border to its northern one. "It seems like a story that just keeps mutating in a way, but just keeps on going, and that there is no real end to it." Michelle Frankfurter is a photographer based in Maryland. Frankfurter found people to follow at shelters.
