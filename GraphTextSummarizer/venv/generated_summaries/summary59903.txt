" Bieber has had several encounters with law enforcement authorities in recent months. Harold White jumped into action when he heard a rumor that Justin Bieber might be eyeing a mansion in Atlanta and could become his neighbor in the affluent Buckhead neighborhood. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering whether to charge Bieber with felony vandalism in the egging of a neighbor's house on January 9. He also faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving on an expired license after being stopped by police in Miami Beach, Florida, last month. The retiree and longtime resident is worried about unwanted attention should the singer indeed move to Buckhead, known for its vast old-money mansions.
