-- Shandong Province High People's Court in eastern China is set to deliver the results of the appeal of convicted former Communist party senior Bo Xilai this Friday, October 25, the court announced on its website on Monday. From Gang of Four to Bo Xilai: Reporting from China's 'show trials' A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. China's Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal During the politically sensitive trial, which took place over several days in August, Bo, 64, denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February 2012 and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in a murder case, Bo's career began to unravel.
