Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillard said Tuesday she believes Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II dies. She had been Rudd's deputy prime minister, but Labor Party members of Parliament voted her into the top job as Rudd's public approval declined. Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd as leader of Australia's Labor Party, and prime minister, in June. Gillard made the comments on the campaign trail ahead of Saturday's general election, in which she faces a challenge from opposition leader Tony Abbott. Gillard said the country has a "deep affection" for Queen Elizabeth, but that she favors moving Australia toward a republic.
