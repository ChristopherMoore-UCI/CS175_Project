Getting in the Oscar bag can be a big boost for a product, said Asha Blake, whose Goldenheart Media partners with Gal. "It's something they anticipate from year to year," said Lisa Gal of Hollywood Baskets, who puts together a high-end gift bag that goes to 30 Oscar nominees and presenters who stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. A-list Academy Award nominees get thousands of dollars in gifts from companies hoping to associate their products with their celebrity, while D-listers get bags of swag valued in the hundreds of dollars. Stars checking into the Four Seasons will find a KitchenAid mixer set up in their room, customized with 22K gold paint and Swarovski crystal by Nicole Dinardo and valued at $1,500, Gal said. "They can be in there with the big guys," Gal said.
