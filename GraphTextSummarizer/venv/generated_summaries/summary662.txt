The original Star Trek series predicted or even inspired these and many other technologies in only three seasons on television. As we say goodbye to Leonard Nimoy, let us remember him not only for his work as an actor on Star Trek, but for his remarkable role in the world of science and technology.

Spock first appeared on our television screens in 1966 with the premiere of the original Star Trek series. Portable and handheld computers were suddenly possible, and some scientists turned to Star Trek for inspiration as they sought to design the next wave of modern marvels.
