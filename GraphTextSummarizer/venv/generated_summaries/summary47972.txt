WFSB's reporting went on to say that state officials have examined other residents in the East Hartford group home but "found no bruises or other signs of recent abuse." On Tuesday, East Hartford police say, they received a suspicious act complaint from Options Unlimited Inc., the privately held nonprofit that operates the home, about a video it received. Angelica Rivera, 34, admitted she was the attacker in the video and turned herself in to East Hartford police Thursday, authorities said Friday. As soon as we became aware of it, we took prompt action and placed the employee on unpaid administrative leave." Terrence W. Macy, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Developmental Services, said he was also outraged by the video. Rivera, who has since been released on $25,000 bond, is also charged with assault, abuse and disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors.
