Whatever adjustments the company has to make, we'll have to wait and see how Verizon's 4G network handles the influx of new device activations. For a period of more than 30 hours from April 26 through 28, Verizon customers experienced nationwide downtime on the company's 4G LTE network. "Our philosophy has always been the same," said Verizon spokesperson Brenda Raney in an interview. Two Verizon employees from separate Bay Area stores told Wired.com the delay had to do with "4G network problems." One store claims it received its shipment "about two weeks ago," approximately the same time as Verizon's 4G network outage.
