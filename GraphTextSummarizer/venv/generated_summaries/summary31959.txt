How Google Glass Could Change Advertising Once engaged, Glass is capable of taking photos, recording videos, looking up answers on Google, showing reminders (such as for a flight) and sharing whatever you're looking at â€” either via messaging or through a Google+ Hangout. Google also launched a contest with its own hashtag (#ifihadglass), challenging anyone to come up with creative uses for Google Glass that can be explained in 50 words or fewer. Still, the photos, posted on Google's Project Glass website, show more about how Glass works than any photo of the hardware could convey. Google answered that very question Wednesday morning, posting a lot more information about Project Glass, including the user interface, through a series of photos and videos. As Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself revealed previously, Glass will also have an automatic picture-taking mode, snapping pics at a preset intervals (such as every 5 seconds).
