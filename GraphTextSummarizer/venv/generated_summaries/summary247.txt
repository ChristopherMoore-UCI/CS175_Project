The Cruise Vessel Safety and Security Act requires large passenger ships to "integrate technology that can be used for capturing images of passengers or detecting passengers who have fallen overboard, to the extent that such technology is available. A man who fell from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship off the coast of Cozumel, Mexico, was rescued by a Disney cruise ship after passengers spotted him on the water, Mexican authorities say. " A website that tracks man overboard cases, CruiseJunkie.com, listed 243 cases since 1995. "There were no other guests or crew around at the time," said Cynthia Martinez, a Royal Caribbean spokeswoman. Fortunately, another cruise, the Disney Magic, saw him," said Cozumel Port Captain Alfonso Rodr√≠guez.
