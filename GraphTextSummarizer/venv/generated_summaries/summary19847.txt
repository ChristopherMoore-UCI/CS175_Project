The searing experience of Sandy, following Katrina, Irene and other major storms in recent years, will likely raise more questions about the wisdom and scope of coastal migration and development, especially as many climate scientists expect the intensity and size of storms to increase, and their geographic reach to extend northward. As coastal communities have become more crowded, so the cost inflicted by hurricanes, storms and storm surges has risen exponentially. Total government exposure to storm-related losses in coastal states has risen more than 15-fold since 1990 to $885 billion last year, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The forecast rise in sea level, water temperature and acidity is likely to damage more coastal habitats. Much of the development has occurred in coastal communities most vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms.
