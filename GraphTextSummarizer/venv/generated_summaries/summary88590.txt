-- Vice President Nicolas Maduro was sworn in Friday as acting president of Venezuela in a ceremony held in the National Assembly in Caracas, three days after the death of President Hugo Chavez. Asked if he swore to uphold the laws of the country and to follow the constitution, Maduro said, "I swear." Then, in a rambling speech that evoked the bombastic oratory of Chavez, Maduro said he would work to keep alive his memory and legacy. The opposition was arguing that Maduro should have served both as interim president, without being sworn in, and vice president, said Jennifer McCoy, director of the Americas Program at the Carter Center and professor of political science at Georgia State University. Maduro alluded to the United States, with whom Chavez had had prickly relations. "Maduro has to be very careful about the base of his party and following Chavez's policy toward the United States, which has been one of a lot of confrontation and aggression." Still, he noted, Maduro is a former union official, not the paratrooper military officer that Chavez was.
