On the night of October 14, Daniel's team, the Screaming Devils of Warren County, defeated the Mighty Bulldogs of nearby Hancock County. One school safety expert says that social media chatter and threats have a nationwide ripple effect that is forcing school officials to spend more time, money and energy on school security, at a time when dollars are hard to come by. " Warren County Schools Superintendent Carole Jean Carey said it was hard to tell what was going on because so many people were involved. There are family members on both teams," said coach Zachery Harris of Hancock Central High School. Carey, the Warren County schools superintendent, wants a full investigation to determine if Daniel was the target of an attack.
