CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad and Zahir Shah reported from Peshawar. Those killed in the attack at the Royal Artillery Bazaar include civilians, security personnel and at least one child, Rawalpindi police official Muhammad Maqbool told CNN. Police said that attack took place at 7:50 a.m., during a busy period for people traveling to offices and schools. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the Bannu attack and said he was canceling a planned trip to Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum takes place this week. The Royal Artillery Bazaar is in a highly sensitive military area close to the general headquarters of the Pakistani Army in Rawalpindi, a city that neighbors the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
