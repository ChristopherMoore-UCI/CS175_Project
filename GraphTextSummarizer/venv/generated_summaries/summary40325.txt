President Barack Obama sought to reclaim some ownership over an issue that is suddenly a hot topic among top Republicans, telling an audience on Friday that he welcomes his rival party focusing on income inequality, but questioned whether it was anything more than talk. "After spending the last six years growing Washington instead of the middle class, it's no surprise President Obama can only point fingers rather than point to meaningful success," said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short. " The President also seemed to lightly touch on recent comments by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said earlier this week that he doesn't think President Barack Obama "loves America. Before the speech, a White House official said Obama would use his DNC speech to call out Republicans for what he sees as hypocrisy. I am not making this up." To laughs from the Democratic National Committee audience in Washington, D.C., Obama added: "I am encouraged they are speaking about middle class and about wages.
