-- Sen. Rand Paul is appearing in a new wave of ads for Republican Senate candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire less than one week before Election Day. The ads appear to have been shot in the same setting as Chamber ads that he cut for GOP Senate nominees in Alaska and North Carolina, two closes races with for potential of a libertarian spoiler. Talking about the first round of ads, he told CNN in New Hampshire earlier this month that he thinks his appeal goes "beyond the Republican Party" and he can be helpful in bringing in independents. If he decides to run as expected, it could be a big boost for him to get this kind of exposure in Iowa and New Hampshire -- and the blessing of a major mainstream and respected Republican group like the Chamber. The Chamber of Commerce, which produces the ads and has featured Paul in a previous round of spots, says it's using the Kentucky Republican as a voice to appeal to independent voters.
