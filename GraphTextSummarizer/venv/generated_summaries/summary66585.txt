Not only is it the first time that an X-Men team has been all female (in a primary "X-Men" title, no less), but Storm, Rogue, Jubilee, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey and Psylocke join the Fearless Defenders as one of two Marvel female super-teams. Wood: X-Men is so rife with powerful female characters anyway, more so than any comic book universe or group. Through Jeanine's hard work at Marvel, this is "X-Men" #1. Never before has a household name team like X-Men been turned over to only women. And when Brian started on X-Men, his team was only women.
