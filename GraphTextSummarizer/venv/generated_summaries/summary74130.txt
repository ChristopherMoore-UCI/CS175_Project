Since 1965, Marvel superheroes have jumped from the pages of comic books to costume and toy stores, Saturday morning cartoons and blockbuster movies. Many of Lee's superheroes and villains are complicated characters, allowing him to weave social discussions into comic book story lines. In response to DC Comics' re-vamped version of "The Flash" and successful superhero team comic, "Justice League of America," Marvel created a group of superheroes. For all his success and fame and fortune, Lee reaches out to fans in a very personal fashion, fostering an in-the-club-like feeling while at Marvel Comics. Marvel became known for its collaborative creative efforts (called the "Marvel Method") and Lee sees it as one of the reasons his characters have been so memorable.
