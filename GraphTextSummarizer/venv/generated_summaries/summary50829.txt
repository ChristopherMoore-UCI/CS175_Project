Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi's allegation that Iraqi agents trained al Qaeda operatives in the use of chemical and biological weapons was "pivotal" to the Bush administration's case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. Al-Libi had trained al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan and was captured in Pakistan in late 2001, according to the Intelligence Committee report. The United States did not transfer al-Libi to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp with other top al Qaeda captives in 2006, and Washington had never confirmed what happened to him, she said. Al-Libi's death was first reported by a Libyan newspaper over the weekend and confirmed by Human Rights Watch researchers Monday, Sullivan said. -- The accused terrorist who said he was tortured into making a false connection between al Qaeda and Iraq
