Arguably the best-known traditionally rigged wooden 18th-century replica ship in the world, the Bounty belonged to the New York-based HMS Bounty Organization, which sailed it from port to port as a tourist attraction. Christian, drawn by the romance and adventure surrounding wooden sailing ships, claimed to be a descendent of Bounty mutineer Fletcher Christian. "As much as I would like to speak my mind, I can not make any comments as of yet," wrote Bounty owner Robert Hansen in an e-mail to CNN. Family members of deckhand Claudene Christian, one of two Bounty crew members who died in the sinking, filed a $90 million civil lawsuit this week against the owners of the three-masted square-rigger, which appeared in several Hollywood films, including the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise. Christian, a 42-year-old former teen beauty queen, had been hired as a Bounty deckhand just five months before.
