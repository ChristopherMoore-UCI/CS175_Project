Unfortunately, the new feature was accompanied by an unpleasant announcement; after August 2010, Skype will start charging a monthly fee for the 3G calling feature on top of whatever fee you're already paying your mobile operator for data transfer. Still, one cannot help but wonder how the users will react when faced with a double fee for mobile VoIP calls. I can't ignore the fact that consumers (currently) use us for free," said Russ Shaw, Skype's general manager for mobile. On Sunday, Skype 2.0 was launched for the iPhone 3G, bringing a long-sought feature to the table: making calls over 3G. Skype promises the fee will be reasonable.
