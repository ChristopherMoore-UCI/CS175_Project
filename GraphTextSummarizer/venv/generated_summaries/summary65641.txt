Sperm whales were hunted in the Gulf of Mexico in the 18th and 19th centuries for their oil, but were somewhat spared when petroleum replaced whale oil as an energy source. Oil could also contaminate or kill the fish and squid that sperm whales eat. Risk factors for the sperm whales of the Gulf are similar to those for the killer whales of coastal Alaska: They are swimming in oil; females and juveniles depend on critical habitat near the spill, and the population is already small and isolated. We do know that sperm whales depend on the deep ocean habitat. Routinely holding their breath for about 45 minutes, sperm whales can dive half a mile to hunt fish and squid.
