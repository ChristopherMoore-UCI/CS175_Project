Everton overtook Arsenal for fourth in the Premier League -- the final Champions League spot -- after blanking last-place Sunderland 1-0 for a sixth consecutive victory. Having given away a penalty early in the second half -- converted by Jordi Gomez -- Arsenal's Per Mertesacker then atoned for his mistake by scoring to send the game to extra time. Sanogo's header in the fifth minute from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's perfect cross -- Oxlade-Chamberlain sparkled in the first half -- was hit straight at Scott Carson and the striker's poor first touch when he was put through allowed the former England starter to make another save late in the half. Arsenal beat defending champion Wigan 4-2 on penalties at Wembley on Saturday to reach the FA Cup final and move a step closer to potentially ending a nine-year trophy drought. Fabianski stopped Gary Caldwell and Collison to put Wigan in an immediate hole and Santi Cazorla officially booked Arsenal's ticket to the final when he beat Carson.
