Several security experts and U.S. military officials say Siraj Haqqani has extended the Haqqani Network's reach to countries far from Pakistan and Afghanistan. An increased drone campaign against senior Haqqani safe havens in North Waziristan has disrupted the network's ability to plan and execute operations, and has targeted al Qaeda senior leadership and other foreign terrorists. For years, patriarch Jalaluddin Haqqani, who would be in his 60s, led the network. Their calling card is bold and complex suicide bombings, including high-profile attacks on U.S. and foreign personnel and assassinations of high level people in Kabul and northern Afghanistan, the Institute for the Study of War reports. "Siraj is a brutal criminal murderer," Gen. Jeffrey Schloesser outgoing commander of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division in eastern Afghanistan, told Jane's.
