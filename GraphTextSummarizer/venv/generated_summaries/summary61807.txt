Better drilling technology, some good oil finds in the area and the political push for oil exploration in the United States has spurred the boom here and in smaller nearby towns. The town sits in an area known as the Bakken Formation, a vast region below North Dakota, Montana and a portion of Canada that the U.S. Geological Survey says contains between 3 billion and 4.3 billion barrels of oil. "The continual amount of oil in North Dakota is three times as much as Texas," says Kevin Frederick, a geologist in the region. Herb Geving worked his whole life, but says oil changed his life.
