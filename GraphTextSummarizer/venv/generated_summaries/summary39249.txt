The pair discovered a shared love of science fiction films from the late 1970s and early 1980s, like "Silent Running" starring Bruce Dern. "It is a period of science fiction we are both huge fans of and we miss that kind of film." "Real, character-driven stories about working class, blue-collar people working and living in space," explains Jones. With a storyline about alienation rather than aliens, this retro delight is peppered with references to 20-year-old classics like Ridley Scott's "Alien" and cult films like "Outland," starring Sean Connery. Jones will continue to mine the rich seam of classic science fiction in his next film, "Mute."
