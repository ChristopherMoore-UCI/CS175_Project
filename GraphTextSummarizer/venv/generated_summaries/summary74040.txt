Last Monday, I joined a small group of U.S. Hispanic leaders in meeting with President Obama, ahead of his trip to Mexico and Costa Rica this week. I suggested to President Obama that he find a way to send U.S. Hispanic civic leaders and professionals as good will ambassadors. It's not often that U.S. presidents travel to Latin America without the specific purpose of participating in a summit or visiting an area ravaged by a natural disaster. Other issues, such as immigration, will always creep into a conversation about Latin America and U.S. ties. My friends there frequently tell me they feel neglected by "TÃ­o Sam." President Obama laid out a thoughtful and broad approach to the bilateral relationship with Mexico and Central America.
