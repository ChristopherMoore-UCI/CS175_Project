While Iraqi forces piled the pressure on ISIS in Tikrit, the Sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in Iraq's western Anbar province, where it is finding a support base among the predominantly Sunni population. Elsewhere in Anbar province, Iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of Karma, near Falluja, from ISIS, said Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council, on Wednesday. On Wednesday, joint Iraqi forces gained control of Tikrit Military Hospital, a few blocks south of the presidential palace. " If there are reprisals in Tikrit and it becomes a "Shiite-on-Sunni struggle," Cordesman said, then not only will Iran's influence increase "but you can see the country divide and Islamic State (ISIS) be replaced by a conflict between Iraqi Shiite and Sunni. The predominantly Shiite militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit.
