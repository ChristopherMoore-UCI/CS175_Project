Before the bombings, security officials said they had deployed more than 200 women to conduct searches in Kadhimiya, in northwestern Baghdad, because of the rise in female suicide bombers. -- Four female suicide bombers and a gunman killed at least 70 people and wounded almost 300 others during a string of attacks in central Baghdad and Kirkuk on Monday, officials said. The use of female bombers is an increasingly common method for staging suicide attacks in Iraq because male security forces will not search women and few women have been trained to conduct searches. They were attacked in a region that al Qaeda in Iraq controlled before Iraqi security forces gained control.
