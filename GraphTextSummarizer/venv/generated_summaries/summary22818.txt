At least six times this week, customers at Tim Hortons restaurants have paid for their own cups of coffee and cups of brew for the next 500 or more people in line, according to media reports. "As brilliant as this is, I can assure that Tim Hortons has nothing to do with the Good Samaritans that have been purchasing coffees across the country," Tim Hortons representative Michelle Robichaud told CTV. "(The staff was) thinking maybe he was so blessed that he wanted to share his blessing, or maybe he won the lotto or something," store manager Joanne Averion told CTV. The first 500 free javas were gifts of an anonymous donor at a Tim Hortons in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, on Monday, CTV reported. It's all great business for Tim Hortons, but the company says it's serendipity, not a marketing stunt.
