Lam Kok had completed the purchase of Chateau de La Riviere in the Aquitaine region of southwest France on Thursday, the vineyard's marketing manager, Thierry Disclyn, told CNN. The helicopter, which was also carrying the vineyard's previous owner, James Gregoire, Kok's 11-year-old son Charles, and a representative of Lam Kok, Peng Wang, crashed into the Dordogne River. According to the local Sud Ouest newspaper, about 30 police officers and a team of divers are engaged in the search, which resumed at 8 a.m. local time. On Friday, Kok introduced himself to all the employees, and at about 5 p.m. local time decided to tour the estate by helicopter, Disclyn said. Police have recovered the body of Charles Kok but are still searching for the other bodies, Disclyn said.
