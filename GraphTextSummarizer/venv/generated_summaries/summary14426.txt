According to a report by the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, the cruise ship Silver Shadow was cited repeatedly for using an "organized effort" to remove 15 trolleys of food from the ship's galley to individual crew cabins to "avoid inspection. Jim Walker -- a Miami-based lawyer who specializes in filing lawsuits against cruise lines for injury and wrongful termination -- said that, in his experience, it's common for cruise ships to hide food from government inspectors. That's three times more than the number of cruise ships that failed inspections in 2012. One crew member who was on board the Silver Shadow said that his superiors ordered him and other crew members to sleep with food inside their cabins. Colonna said food was hidden night after night to avoid health inspections.
