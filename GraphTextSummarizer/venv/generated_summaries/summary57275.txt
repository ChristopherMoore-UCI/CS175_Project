Clashes between security forces and suspected militants have erupted in Lawdar and Zinjibar, towns in Abyan -- a militant stronghold with a presence of Yemen's al Qaeda wing, SABA reported, citing a military official. " Yemen has been consumed with unrest for months as protesters demand an end to the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. A government spokesman said Thursday Saleh was in good health and would be returning to Yemen "within days." CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report. The official said troops are working to track down al Qaeda fighters and "cleanse the pockets and hiding places where terrorists are present. "The heroes of the armed and security forces in Abyan province caused the terrorist elements of al Qaeda heavy losses in lives and material after fierce confrontations with those elements that began in the early hours of the morning and lasted several hours and ended with the killing of a number of them and injuring many others," SABA reported.
