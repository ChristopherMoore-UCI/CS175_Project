He also hopes his trip reminds the rest of the world that Ebola, and many other diseases, are still a huge threat in West Africa. The last time Dr. Rick Sacra went to Liberia, he returned home to the United States in a medevac airplane, not sure if he would die of the Ebola he'd contracted while taking care of patients. He said now that the number of Ebola patients in Liberia has gone down dramatically, he's not needed to work in the Ebola ward. But it will be more difficult in another way: He knows many of his friends in Liberia lost family members and colleagues to Ebola this fall, and he won't be able to comfort them with a hug, because hugging, or even shaking hands, is forbidden in order to cut down on the spread of the disease. Sacra was evacuated from Liberia to Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, one of four hospitals in the United States with a biocontainment unit, where he received a blood transfusion from Dr. Kent Brantly, another American Ebola survivor, and the experimental drug TKM-Ebola.
