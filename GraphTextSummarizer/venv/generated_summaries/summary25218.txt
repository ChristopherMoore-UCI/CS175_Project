Nevertheless, Olga Mugyenyi and Nahida Beghani have injected new life into the plain white "tee" with Definition Africa, a t-shirt store based in Kampala, Uganda. "The t-shirts that we design are in theme with life in Uganda, things that we come across, statements, food, and people," says Mugyenyi. Currently, all of Definition's products are made and sourced in various African countries -- with blank t-shirts sent in from factories in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania to be printed in-house. Despite the seemingly globalized nature of the fashion world, Definition's success is largely inspired by regional quirks and local collaborations rather than the latest throwaway trend. Mugyenyi adds: "One of the things that makes Definition what it is, is that the products are supposed to be entirely African in subject matter and as well as where the material comes from."
