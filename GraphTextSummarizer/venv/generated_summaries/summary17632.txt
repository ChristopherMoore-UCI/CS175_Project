The controversy over the products used in the Korean reactors comes amid increased scrutiny of nuclear power worldwide following the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan during the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the country in March 2011. The plant operator, Korean Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., found that eight suppliers had sold it a total of 7,682 items with forged quality certificates between 2003 and 2012, according to the government. Their suspension will significantly reduce the amount of energy supply that South Korea holds in reserve each day during January and February.
