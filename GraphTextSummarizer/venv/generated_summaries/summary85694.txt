Kristi Cornwell, 38, was last seen walking along a road in northern Georgia the night of August 11, 2009. We are still pursuing investigative leads as they relate to Carringer," said GBI Director Vernon Keenan. In April, investigators were led to the home of 42-year-old James Scott Carringer, who was suspected of rape in Gilmer County, Georgia. Investigators believe Cornwell's disappearance could be related to a December 2009 incident in Ranger, North Carolina, in which a woman was attacked by a man driving a late model Nissan Xterra, the GBI said. The site where the bones were discovered is in Union County, in far northern Georgia.
