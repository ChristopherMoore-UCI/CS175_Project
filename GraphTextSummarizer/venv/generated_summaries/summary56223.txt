The group, which included one supervisor, went to lunch at a restaurant, where eight drank alcohol, TSA spokesman David Castelveter said. The marshals, who typically fly with guns to protect commercial flights, were in New York in February for training and were not scheduled to fly that day. "TSA holds all of its employees to the highest professional and ethical standards and has zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace," Castelveter said in a statement. -- Eight federal air marshals are being fired for drinking alcohol during training, and six others are being disciplined for not reporting it, according to the Transportation Security Administration. "TSA's decision to remove the individuals involved in the misconduct affirms our strong commitment to the highest standards of conduct and accountability."
