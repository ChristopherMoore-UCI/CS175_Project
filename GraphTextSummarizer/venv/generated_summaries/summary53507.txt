Thousands of Muslims, including Europeans, have joined the viciously violent ISIS which, by some accounts, enjoys the support of a rather large minority of French and European Muslims. Both extremes in this discussion have it wrong, and by perpetuating their distortions they harm efforts to protect tolerance from the intolerant; to make the world safe for Muslims and non-Muslims -- for everyone, including those lobbing grenades backs and forth in social media. A Pew poll of 14,244 people in 14 countries with large Muslim populations revealed a few months ago, significant minorities of Muslims believe suicide bombings are "justified to defend Islam from its enemies." From social media to the highest spheres of power, there are Muslims demanding reform, demanding reaffirmation of individual freedoms and rejecting violence. Those are alarming numbers, a sign that murderous extremism is indeed a problem, one that Muslims should view with urgency, not least because the vast majority of suicide bombings, of terrorism of all kinds, kills Muslims.
