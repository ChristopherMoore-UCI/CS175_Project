Under FIFA laws, clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the European Union, is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border. FIFA's investigation focused on several players aged under 18 who were registered and played for the club between 2009 and 2013. FC Barcelona's youth structure has enabled hundreds of young players to achieve their dreams and receive a decent upbringing. Barcelona has one of the most famous and successful academies in the game with young players from all over the world learning their trade with the club. The ruling comes after an investigation found the club had broken regulations regarding the transfer of young players from outside Spain.
