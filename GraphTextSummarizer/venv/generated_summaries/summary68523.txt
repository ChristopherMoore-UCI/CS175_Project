" Pakistan is considered the only country that is "off track" in meeting its target to stop polio transmission, according to the WHO. Pakistan has seen major challenges in recent years, reporting 80% of polio cases this year. "You have disruption of health services, vaccination services are broken where areas are no-go because there is mistrust and health teams are not allowed within the conflict area," said Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who is co-director of The Hospital for Sick Children in Canada and also works in Pakistan. This may divert the vaccines and human resources from Pakistan communities that need them the most, to the huge number of travelers, Bhutta said. In 2014, the World Health Organization confirmed 74 new cases of polio -- 59 of them were in Pakistan.
