In China -- home of manufacturing companies central to global production of Apple iPhones and iPads -- the death of Steve Jobs' death brought immediate reaction from Chinese netizens and captains of industry. " Inside four hours of the announcement, nearly 35 million messages on Sina Weibo on Jobs' death and 23 million messages of Tencent QQ Weibo, China's first and second largest microblogging sites. The revelation in recent months that as many as 22 fake Apple stores had cropped around China set new standards for piracy -- even in a nation known for counterfeit technology. " "Jobs said, 'Remember that you will be dead soon'," said Lee Kaifu, venture capitalist and founding president of Google China, referring to Jobs' famous 2005 Stanford University commencement speech. Jobs revolutionized tech industry "Jobs is the spiritual leader of our time," wrote @Xiongpeiyun on Sina Weibo.
