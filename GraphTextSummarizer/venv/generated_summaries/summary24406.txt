EW: 'Mad Men' creator dishes on the season 6 finale "This approach has worked well for many programs across multiple networks, and, most recently for us with Breaking Bad which attracted nearly double the number of viewers to its second half premiere than had watched any previous episode," said AMC president Charlie Collier in a statement. The final season of "Mad Men" will be expanded to 14 episodes, but you'll only get half of it next year. AMC announced today that it will split the seventh season of the Madison Avenue-in-the-'60s drama into two parts, with the first half airing in spring 2014 and the second half debuting in spring 2015.
