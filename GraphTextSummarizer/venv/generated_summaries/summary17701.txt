Four of the six numbers drawn in the estimated $380 million Mega Millions lottery matched the numbers immortalized by the Lost character Hugo "Hurley" Reyes, who hit a $114 million jackpot off them -- only to be haunted by the same numbers in later episodes. If you played Hurley's numbers, you won $150, according to a payout table on the Mega Millions website, though the same table noted that fixed prizes such as the $150 one "may be paid on a pari-mutuel basis and (be) lower than" that amount. Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number). Two tickets matched all six numbers, according to a news release from Mega Millions. But at least two people fared better than Hurley after Tuesday night's drawing.
