Domestic weekend box office estimates are from Exhibitor Relations Co. -- "The Maze Runner" ran away with the weekend box office, ringing up the best debut since early August. Its lukewarm total of $13.1 million was still enough to hold off the weekend's other new wide release, "This Is Where I Leave You," which stars Jason Bateman, Tina Fey and Jane Fonda as a dysfunctional family reunited by a funeral. Opening in a sluggish second this weekend was R-rated thriller "A Walk Among the Tombstones," starring AARP action hero Liam Neeson as an alcoholic former detective turned unlicensed private investigator. The film's strong opening should help restore some of the faith in YA novel adaptations after the recent weak performance of "The Giver."
