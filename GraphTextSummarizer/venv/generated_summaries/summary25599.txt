Politics, food, history -- they all differ among various Latino groups in the U.S. Andres Duque, a gay Latino activist and journalist, says those differences  can make it difficult to mobilize support for Latino gay issues. A 2007 survey conducted by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network discovered that at schools where a Gay Student Alliance club existed, 59 percent of gay Latino students participated in the club, says Elizabeth Diaz, a senior researcher at the network. While many gay Latino students still face physical and verbal harassment from classmates and teachers, more are becoming bolder about affirming their sexual identity, a recent survey found. Hilton says deep-seated homophobia within the Latino community has forced many gay Latinos to go underground, but attitudes are shifting. "While harassment in schools for Latino gay students remained high, we also know that these students have more support than in past generations," Diaz says.
