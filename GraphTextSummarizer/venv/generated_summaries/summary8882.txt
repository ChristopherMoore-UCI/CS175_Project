Chris Arendt, a former guard at Guantanamo Bay, says the Obama administration must rethink and reform the way it detains and prosecutes future terror suspects -- and do more than just close Guantanamo. Moazzam Begg says that during intense interrogations at Guantanamo Bay, he would have confessed to anything. Earlier this month, the retired judge in charge of determining which Guantanamo detainees should be tried by a U.S. military commission told The Washington Post that al-Qahtani was tortured and therefore could not  be put forward for prosecution. Watch what Begg thinks of Guantanamo Â» The new administration  has said that waterboarding, which causes the feeling of drowning, is torture. "Guantanamo Bay is the most notorious prison on earth," Begg said.
