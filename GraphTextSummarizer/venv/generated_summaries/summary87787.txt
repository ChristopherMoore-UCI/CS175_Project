Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April. One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico, specifically tailored to the military and [saying] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas," Reyes said from his Washington office, where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas. The U.S. government says Los Zetas is "the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico." Los Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. Inside the United States, one of the instruments of assassination Los Zetas unleashed was teenager Rosalio Reta. And now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government.
