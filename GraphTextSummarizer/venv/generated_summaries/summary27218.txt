In an unusual public raid in India, thousands stormed a jail and dragged out a rape suspect before beating him to death on the streets, authorities said Friday. The 35-year-old suspect, who was described as an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh, died from severe injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, a police official in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. Thousands of protesters demanding cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex  Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. New Delhi police said the interview was banned because of its potential to breed disorder. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack,  according to authorities.
