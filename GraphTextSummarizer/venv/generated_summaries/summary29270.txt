Lee has been active from North Korea on Instagram as well, posting snapshots of street scenes, food and government propaganda posters. But on February 25, Jean H. Lee of the Associated Press became perhaps the first person to send a mobile tweet from North Korea when she posted a message on the country's new 3G wireless network, available only to foreigners. As the AP's bureau chief for both South and North Korea, Lee is the only American news reporter granted regular access to the secretive nation, which she has visited more than 20 times. At a time when North Korea is responding to tougher sanctions from the U.N. Security Council with angry rhetoric and threats, Lee described a country with two parallel digital worlds -- one for residents and another for foreign visitors. The country lags behind much of the world when it comes to digital adoption, but there are signs that North Korea is trying to catch up, Lee said.
