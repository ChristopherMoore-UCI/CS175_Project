Charges were brought Wednesday against three sergeants and a specialist with the 13th Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Bliss, Texas, accusing them of engaging in "verbal abuse, physical punishment and ridicule of subordinates," according to Olson. There is no confirmed evidence that the suicide, which involved a fifth subordinate in the unit, was a result of any mistreatment, said Lt. Col. Kevin Olson, a spokesman for Multi-National Division-South, who said the military is looking into that possibility. Olson said the Army does not believe the maltreatment of subordinates went beyond the soldiers' unit. Olson said Army officials have spoken to the four subordinate soldiers and are offering them any help they need. Gen. David Elicerio, deputy commanding general for Multi-National Division-South.
