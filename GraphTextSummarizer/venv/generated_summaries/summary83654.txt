During the lockdown, 21,000 volunteers will fan out across the nation to talk with people about how to protect themselves from the disease, as well as identify Ebola cases, Kanu said. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. "Large scale coercive measures like forced quarantines and lockdowns are driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers. The outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with a handful of cases in Nigeria. 21,000 volunteers to go door-to-door Sierra Leone set the lockdown date for September 19-21 to give the country time to train volunteers and get needed equipment, such as ambulances, Kanu said.
