The USCG's New York office told CNN they've received a steady stream of spurious calls this summer, but nothing out of the ordinary, and none they can trace back to the New Jersey incident. The estimated price of the rescue operation in the New Jersey was $300,000, and the Maryland case is already nearing $70,000. The U.S. Coast Guard says it has linked six bogus Mayday calls for help in Maryland to the same person, and officials are now asking the public for help finding the suspect. "It's still an active investigation," Charles Rowe of the USCG's New York office told CNN Thursday. In June, a false distress call of a yacht explosion prompted a massive rescue effort off the coast of New Jersey and garnered attention nationwide.
