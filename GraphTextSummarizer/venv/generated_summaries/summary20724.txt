Claughton competed in the same era as Ainslie's coach Sid Howlett and has been involved in America's Cup racing since 1983. The first testing boat (T1) is already out on the water, T2 is expected to be fully operational in May while the eventual boat on which Ainslie and his team will race for the Cup is set to be finalized in design terms by the end of next year's sailing season. "You're balancing pushing the design time but also the amount of time the guys can spend on the water." A myriad of different organizations are on board with Ainslie's team from the British Ministry of Defence to big players in aerospace and engineering company Prodrive, which boasts a rich motorsport history. " "In terms of setting structure and design philosophy, that happens now," says Ainslie as he reflects on the process of filling key management roles before steadily expanding the sailing, design and on-shore workforce . Ultimately, Ainslie is a fiercely determined sailor and he is adamant the team can "bring back the Cup to Britain" for the first time in the event's history.
