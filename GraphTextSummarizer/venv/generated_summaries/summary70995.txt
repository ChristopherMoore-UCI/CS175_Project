The indictment, filed September 21 in El Dorado Superior Court, allows the prosecution to circumvent a preliminary hearing, at which Dugard might have testified in open court. -- A grand jury has indicted a northern California couple accused of holding Jaycee Dugard captive for nearly two decades, authorities said Friday. "One obvious reason is that sometimes given the publicity in a case, it's a better way to get the case to a final conclusion and move it along to trial." Stephen Tapson, Nancy Garrido's attorney, said he did not imagine a trial would start before the end of next year. Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Officials have said Dugard does not want to speak to Garrido or his attorneys, and authorities have tried to keep her location a secret.
