One of the more troubling signs for Democrats, perhaps, is that liberal advocacy groups have been spending money on television ads targeting Democratic lawmakers on health care. -- Health care reform is a signature issue for Democrats, but the attempt to overhaul the nation's health system has pitted liberals against centrists, exposing fissures 11 months before the 2010 midterm elections. For Democrats, it is the party's political base -- voters who turned out in 2008 to help elect Barack Obama president and boost the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate -- which is demanding results. Liberal advocacy organizations wasted little time this week condemning Democratic leaders when news broke that a Senate deal had been struck to replace the public option with another proposal to help cover the uninsured. In October, a CNN/Opinion Research poll showed Democrats had an 87 percent favorable rating with liberals on the generic congressional ballot.
