Feeln's return to Rainbowland will star actress Emily Osment ("Young & Hungry") as Rainbow Brite and '80s screen star Molly Ringwald as the villain, the Dark Princess. Osment, who hadn't been born when "Rainbow Brite" was introduced, said in a statement that she's looking forward "to connecting with the audience, old and new." "Being cast as the voice of Rainbow Brite for the relaunch of this iconic show is truly an honor," added the actress, who's shared a photo of one of her scripts on Instagram. Feeln's limited-run take on "Rainbow Brite" will launch November 6. Feeln has revived the memorable cartoon, which was created by Hallmark in 1983 and spawned a TV series, a movie and of course millions of dollars worth of merchandise. The "Care Bears" are making a return over on Netflix, "Jem" is being turned into a live-action movie, and now Rainbow Brite, the spunky animated savior of all things colorful, is making her own comeback.
