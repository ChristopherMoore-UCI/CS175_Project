"It's not just them writing articles and then a professional team taking that and making it pretty," said founder of Live Magazine South Africa, Gavin Weale. It's nearly deadline day and the Cape Town office is a buzz of activity as the finishing touches are made to the first magazine aimed at the mainstream youth of South Africa. Kenyan youth find their superhero Live magazine originated in the UK and after a decade in business and a circulation of 30,000 the success of the quarterly publication prompted Weale to bring the concept to South Africa. But the hope is for the magazine to become the authentic voice of South African youth and be entirely self-sustainable within one to two years. "It's a place for them to communicate to other young people in their age group about the political situation, education system and discuss what culture they are interested in," she said.
