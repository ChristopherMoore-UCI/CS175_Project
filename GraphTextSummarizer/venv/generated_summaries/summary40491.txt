Hours later, however, the Texas Supreme Court blocked other gay couples from obtaining marriage licenses after a legal challenge by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Goodfriend said she had emergency surgery after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in May. Paxton responded by asking the Texas Supreme Court to block any rulings that "seek to undermine the constitutionality of Texas' marriage law." "The Texas Constitution clearly defines marriage as between one man and one woman, as Texas voters approved by an overwhelming majority," he said in a statement on Wednesday. In a statement, Gov. Greg Abbott said the "Texas Constitution defines marriage as consisting 'only of the union of one man and one woman' and was approved by more than three-quarters of Texas voters. Activist judges don't change Texas law, and we will continue to aggressively defend the laws of our state and will ensure that any licenses issued contrary to law are invalid." Tobias said the Supreme Court stay essentially means the issuance of other marriage licenses to gay couples is unlikely.
