Casco Viejo, Panama City The orange-tiled roofs and Spanish colonial architecture of old town Panama City stand in slow contrast to the skyscraper skyline across the bay. Fish Market, Panama City Cuquita Arias de Calvo, one of Panama's best known chefs, described her country's cuisine as "joyful, happy and hot -- just like Panamanians." With a small boat cruise less than an hour from Panama City, it's possible to see capuchin monkeys, three-toed sloths and crocodiles. Panama Canal Tourist transits of the canal can be long and hot, but for the enthusiast nothing beats sharing water with an 80,000 ton cargo freighter. Emberra Indians There's no better way to understand Panama's indigenous roots than via dugout canoe up the Chagres River, where you'll pass thatch houses woven deep into the jungle before arriving at Emberra village, home to one of nine major indigenous groups in the country.
