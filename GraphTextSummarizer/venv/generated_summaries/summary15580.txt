Former Yankee pitcher Jim Bouton played on the 1963 American League All-Star team and in two World Series. Bulldoze the field where Mantle roamed and level the mound where Larsen pitched the only perfect World Series game. Unless it was Mantle's 9th inning walk-off home run in '64 World Series that beat the Cardinals 2-1, which also happened to be my first World Series win. I'll never forget my first day in The House that Ruth Built:  April 9, 1962, the day before opening day. I asked Pete if this was the same room that Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and all those guys used.
