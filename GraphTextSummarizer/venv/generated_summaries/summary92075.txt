-- North Korea pledged Wednesday to take steps to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Zone, the joint manufacturing complex where it halted the operations of South Korean companies during a period of high tensions this year. In its statement Wednesday carried by state media, North Korea said it would allow South Korean companies to return to the manufacturing complex. The North also said Wednesday that it would ensure "the normal attendance of its workers" at the South Korean companies' factories, as well as guaranteeing the safety of South Korean personnel in the zone. North Korea's decision in April to suspend activity at the industrial zone, a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, for the first time in its nine-year history surprised many observers. With 53,000 North Koreans working at more than 120 South Korean companies, Kaesong was considered to be an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un's regime.
