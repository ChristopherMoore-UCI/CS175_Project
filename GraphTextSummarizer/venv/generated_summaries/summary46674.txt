A KBR employee, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was "not aware of any security breaches involving the use of cell phones" and that employees were not given any reason for the order. " KBR says, "Any individual using a personal cell phone will be disciplined." Houston, Texas-based KBR Inc., formerly Kellogg Brown & Root, issued a statement saying the company had sent a message with the order to its Iraq employees, but it did not explain the concern that prompted it. He said the U.S. Army confiscates cell phones from Afghans who work at military installations and returns them when they finish their daily duties. "KBR has a communication system, but as with any system it does fail and we can only communicate with another installation by use of the cell phones," he said. "The matter giving rise to this message is still being reviewed by KBR management, so the company will not provide further comment at this time," the statement said.
