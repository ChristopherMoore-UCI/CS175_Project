Police stood guard at the entrance of Washington Square Park, sending protesters spilling out into nearby streets. Police hauled away protesters in various cities Sunday as Occupy Wall Street rallies continued for the 30th day. The arrests came hours after thousands marched to New York's iconic Times Square on Saturday night, hoisting signs and chanting. New York authorities arrested 14 people for violating a midnight curfew by sitting in a fountain with no water at Washington Square Park. In addition to the nationwide rallies, demonstrations have picked up steam, culminating in a global day of protests Saturday in Europe, Asia and Australia.
