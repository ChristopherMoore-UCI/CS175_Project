Hugo is also the patient tinkerer who works after hours in his clock-tower hideaway repairing the automaton, gear by gear. Hugo is played with jolting melodramatic pathos -- and the genetic blessing of bottomless, pale blue eyes -- by Asa Butterfield ("The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"). A mysterious mechanical man with the ability to write and draw holds a place of honor in "Hugo," Martin Scorsese's exquisite adaptation of Brian Selznick's magical, award-winning children's book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret. For a lay audience, the result is a haunting, piquant melodrama about childhood dreams and yearnings, enhanced with a pleasant survey course in early film history.
