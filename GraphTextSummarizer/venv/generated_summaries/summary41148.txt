"It's a landmark decision that clears the way for government to express its views and its history through the selection of monuments -- including religious monuments and displays. "It is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression," wrote Justice Samuel Alito. "Even if the Free Speech Clause neither restricts nor protects government speech, government speakers are bound by the Constitution's other proscriptions, including those supplied by the Establishment and Equal Protection Clause," wrote Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. " The ruling joins a series of decisions in which the Supreme Court has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments, taking a more case-specific approach. At issue was whether donated monuments on public property represent private or government speech.
