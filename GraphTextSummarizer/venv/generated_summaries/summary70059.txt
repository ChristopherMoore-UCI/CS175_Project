-- Britain will have four representatives on the Formula One grid next season after Marussia F1 announced they have signed Max Chilton for the 2013 campaign. " Chilton finished fourth in the GP2 series, which acts as a feeder competition for F1, and showed promise in his two performances in the Marussia car, in a young driver test and in free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. "It's hard to put into words how I'm feeling today, with the announcement that I will be racing for the Marussia F1 Team in 2013," Chilton said in a statement on Marussia's official website. John Booth, Marussia's team principal, said Chilton had shown enough potential to earn his chance, as Marussia try to improve on their 11th-place finish in last year's constructors' championship. "I am very fortunate to have spent the last six races with the Marussia F1 Team as reserve driver, which means that instead of a standing start, I am already up to speed and at ease with the people, the culture, the systems and of course, the 2012 package.
