-- Table topping Argentina were held goalless by Colombia in a fiery South American World Cup qualifier which saw both sides end the match with 10 men. Argentina started the match in the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires in frantic style and David Ospina in the visiting goal made a series of stunning saves. The first flashpoint came midway through the first half as Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain clashed with Cristian Zapata and both were dismissed. An earlier Aguero 'goal' was also chalked off for offside, while the second half introduction of Barcelona ace Lionel Messi, who is still nursing a hamstring injury, could not produce a breakthrough for Argentina. As well as the red cards, Escalante also gave out eight yellows, but with the draw Argentina still stay five points clear of Colombia, who move into second after Ecuador's 1-0 defeat to Peru.
