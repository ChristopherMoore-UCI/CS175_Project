Georgetown said in a statement on Wednesday that tests on McCarthy Hall for the presence of biological agents were negative, and there had been no reports of anyone being exposed to ricin. On Monday, Milzman allegedly showed a bag that he claimed to contain ricin to his dorm adviser, who notified school authorities. That submission said he learned how to make ricin on his iPhone and then bought ingredients at retail stores. -- A Georgetown University student was charged on Friday with possessing ricin after admitting he made the poison in his campus dorm room "The possession or manufacturing of illegal substances are issues we take very seriously and are violations of the university's student code of conduct," said media relations director Rachel Pugh in a statement.
