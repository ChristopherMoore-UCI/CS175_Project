The ex-madam and political candidate who claimed she supplied former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer with escorts pleaded guilty Friday to pushing prescription drugs, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Kristin Davis, 38, who ran against Spitzer for the office of comptroller, admitted in Manhattan federal court to one count of "distributing and possessing with intent to distribute controlled substances, specifically alprazolam, zolpidem and carisoprodol," Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. She never provided proof that she  arranged escorts for Spitzer, but she did spend four months behind bars for running an escort firm. , Davis ran as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City. Davis was arrested on the drug charges last August when she was running an unsuccessful campaign for comptroller against Spitzer.
