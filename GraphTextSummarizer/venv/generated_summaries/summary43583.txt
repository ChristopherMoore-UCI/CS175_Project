Barcelona have already completed the big-money purchase of Spain World Cup hero David Villa from Valencia this summer and on Friday sealed the signing of Brazilian utility player Adriano from Sevilla. " Fabregas has been publicly urged to join Barca by several of his Spain teammates and was embarrassingly forced into wearing the Catalan side's shirt as they celebrated their World Cup triumph in Madrid. -- Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola says a deal to sign Cesc Fabregas may be scuppered by Arsenal's reluctance to sell their captain. Barcelona president Sandro Rosell said Friday that Arsenal's determination to keep Fabregas may delay the deal for another season. Fabregas, 23, was a product of the Barca youth scheme before leaving to join Arsenal at the age of 16.
