A source with knowledge of matter said he was part of SEAL Team Six, members of which mounted the May 2011 operation that killed the al Qaeda leader in a third-floor bedroom of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. -- A Navy SEAL killed in a parachute training accident this week in Arizona belonged to the same elite squad that includes those chosen to go after Osama bin Laden in Pakistan two years ago, a source familiar with the matter said. On February 22, another seven Marines were killed in a midair collision of two military helicopters along the Arizona-California border, officials said. It was not clear whether or not he took part in the bin Laden mission. But it was not clear whether he was part of the same East Coast group.
