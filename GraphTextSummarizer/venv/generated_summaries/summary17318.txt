Pope Francis himself recently acknowledged that the church must grow and change, including in how it trains its clergy, lest the church find itself â€” these are his words -- "creating little monsters." In Pope Francis, I see a leader who lives every day in the image of Jesus. These nuns who kept Philomena from her son may very well have been examples of the "little monsters" that Pope Francis fears. Quite simply, I believe the lessons found in Philomena's story are lessons that many of us hope to be the cornerstone of a new era of Catholicism under Pope Francis. I, like Philomena, am a lifelong Catholic, and still regularly attend church.
