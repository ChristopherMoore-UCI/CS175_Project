Fears are still high that fires could join to form a "mega-fire" and endanger heavily populated areas of this popular natural retreat west of Sydney. Fires in the Blue Mountain range west of Sydney are a particular worry as rough terrain has impeded firefighting efforts. "It's only a matter of hours before we see a flare-up in fire activity and a breach of these tenuous containment strategies," said Shane Fitzsimmons, Rural Fire Service (RFS) commissioner, in Sydney earlier in the day. With high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds forecast, fire officials have urged residents to evacuate from the path of the fires. Scores of fires now have burned 25,800 hectares (310,859 acres) -- an area greater than the size of Los Angeles.
