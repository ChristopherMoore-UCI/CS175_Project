TV host Wallace Souza is accused of ordering hits on criminal rivals and then covering the deaths for ratings. The Amazonas State Justice Tribunal, which held a hearing on the accusations, said the criminal complaint was based on testimony by former Souza associate Moacir Jorge da Costa. Raphael Souza has been convicted of homicide, drug trafficking and illegal gun possession. But prosecutor Pedro Bezerra told the news outlet he could not bring murder charges against Souza for lack of concrete evidence. Wallace Souza, a state legislator and former host of a police TV show called "Canal Livre," also was a drug trafficker, officials say.
