Ten years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the "People's Princess." Diana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. " Clarke, who was 21 and had no previous experience, was given "sole charge" of Diana and her younger brother Charles. While other 13-year-olds loved pop stars, Diana's boarding school room was decorated with pictures of Charles. Diana's broken home made her feel different from her classmates, Clarke said. Clarke remembers observing Diana's impartial love at a young age.
