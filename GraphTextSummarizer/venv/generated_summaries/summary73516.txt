"You're not going to die," self-help author and speaker James Arthur Ray told participants in the sweat lodge that day, they later recalled. Ray's defense attorneys maintain the deaths were a tragic accident and said he took precautions to forestall harm to the sweat lodge participants, including positioning a nurse and several employees and volunteers trained in CPR outside the sweat lodge and making water, oranges, watermelon and fluids available to participants. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. Those who had lost consciousness were dragged out between rounds, participants said. Neuman died from "multisystem organ failure due to hyperthermia due to prolonged sweat lodge exposure," her autopsy report said.
