Just like the friction with Japan, there have been increasing incidents of tension between China and its South China Sea neighbors over island claims. -- When Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping called Tokyo's territorial claims on a group of East China Seas island "a farce," he echoed national sentiment of protesters who took to the streets in anti-Japan protests in recent weeks. At the heart of all these island disputes in China Seas is a term of international maritime law known as "Exclusive Economic Zone," where nations are allowed sole rights to fish and develop resources within 200 nautical miles of a country's shores. Beijing said that Vietnamese vessels have been illegally surveying in Chinese waters and harassing Chinese fishing boats. In 2011, Vietnam claimed that Chinese patrol boats cut cables from PetroVietnam boats during oil and gas surveys in disputed waters.
