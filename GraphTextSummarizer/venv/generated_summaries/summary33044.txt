In addition to the two smartphone models, Amazon is also said to be working on a device for streaming music and a set-top box, the latter of which was also reported by Bloomberg BusinessWeek last month. Until now, Amazon's hardware efforts have centered around its Kindle e-readers and tablets. The Journal reported Thursday that Amazon is "developing a wide-ranging line-up of gadgets," including two smartphones, one of which will have a 3D screen. Amazon's stock was up by about 1.5% on the day as of publication. Despite a fair amount of hype a couple years ago, 3D-technology has had mixed success at best in the consumer technology market.
