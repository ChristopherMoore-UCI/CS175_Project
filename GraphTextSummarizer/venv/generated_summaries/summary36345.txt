Many women footballers in Asia wear headscarves, Jilong says while pointing out that many new designs of headscarf make safety far less of an issue. Jilong, who is also a member of FIFA's executive committee member said the review, which will be presented to the IFAB members by FIFA vice-president HRH Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, has the full backing of the AFC. "I would like to request the IFAB to favorably consider FIFA's proposal and review the rule and allow women players to play wearing a safe headscarf that covers the neck," Jilong said in a statement on the AFC website. FIFA banned the wearing of a headscarf or hijab on the field of play in 2007 and extended the safety rule to include neck warmers or snoods in July 2011. Soccer officials defend hijab ban "I have personally seen the new designs with a Velcro joined at the neck, which releases if the headscarf is pulled, ensuring the player's safety," Jilong said.
