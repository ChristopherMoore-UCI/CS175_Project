"This is the largest project of Turkey ever under the republic era," said Mehmet Ali of Dia Developers, the development company charged with taking Bilkent from the drawing board into construction. Neslihan Aybar, the regional director for Aecom, an architecture and engineering firm that specializes in healthcare projects, says part of the Bilkent strategy is to tap into this market. "(But) we plan to recruit highly qualified health professionals, including doctors and nurses trained in the west, especially Greece and wider Europe." Bilkent will also feature a hotel resort and conference area. There are currently 36 medical facilities under development with the giant Bilkent Integrated Healthcare Campus in Ankara earmarked as the flagship project -- a site for science and knowledge.
