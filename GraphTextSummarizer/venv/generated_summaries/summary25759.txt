"We do not believe any money was moved out of the National Weather Service." Richard Hirn, the general counsel and legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, said Monday that most of the shifted funds helped make up a shortfall between rising salaries for weather forecasters and the amount of money appropriated to pay them. "National Weather Service employees engaged in the reprogramming of funds without congressional notification as required," said a statement Monday by Scott Smullen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the weather service. Specifically, Snowe's statement said that the chief financial officer of the National Weather Service "was misappropriating funds from his program accounts and redirecting them to 122 weather offices nationwide, which conduct critical forecasting of weather events and major storms. However, Hirn said that a failure to approve the reprogramming of the funds could force unpaid furloughs of weather forecasters across the country. The investigation found no evidence of corruption or personal financial gain in these actions.
