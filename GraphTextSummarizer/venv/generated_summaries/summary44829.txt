"He just didn't fit." John, his wife, Christa, and another couple, Mike and Mary Young, were out on horseback when they happened upon DiMaggio and Hannah on Wednesday twice, once on a trail and once at a lake. " That's how Mark John, an Idaho man who spotted and helped lead authorities to James DiMaggio and 16-year-old Hannah Anderson, described the pair. At some point, a "confrontation" ensued between authorities and DiMaggio, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. He might have been an outdoorsman in California, but he was not an outdoorsman in Idaho," John told reporters Sunday. After their group passed DiMaggio and Hannah, he turned to the others and said he thought something wasn't right.
