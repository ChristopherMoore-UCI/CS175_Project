Still in its early stages of development, Skype Translator, as it's being called for now, will provide voice and text language translation for calls between people speaking different languages. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Gurdeep Pall, the vice president in charge of Skype, demonstrated the technology Tuesday night in California at the Code Conference, sponsored by tech-news site Re/Code. "It is going to make sure you can communicate with anybody without language barriers," Nadella said at the gathering in suburban Los Angeles. Skype users soon will be able to expand the list of people they can connect with, says Microsoft, owner of the popular Web-chat tool. At the demo, Pall, speaking English, and a colleague speaking German conducted a Skype video call.
