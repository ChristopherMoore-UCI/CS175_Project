Upwards of 305,000 people left their homes in eastern China's Fujian province, according to state-run China Daily, citing the provincial flood control headquarters. -- Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated Saturday along China's southeastern coast as Typhoon Soulik struck, where the storm was expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain. Soulik also lashed Taiwan on Saturday, where it dumped up to 8 inches of rain on the capital city of Taipei and up to 14 inches in the island's mountain region in a single day, CNN meteorologist Samantha Mohr said. More than 5,000 Chinese soldiers have been deployed in the province in advance of the storm to help with possible rescues, China Daily reported. This week in south-central China, downpours triggered flooding and landslides that killed dozens and wiped out thousands of homes.
