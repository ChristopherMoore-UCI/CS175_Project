Nadal had won the first set 6-4 but Djokovic, who has dedicated his victories from previous rounds to the victims of floods that have deluged both Bosnia and his homeland Serbia, fought back to clinch a memorable victory. Djokovic had endured something of a torrid time in Rome, struggling to defeat the young, big-hitting Canadian Milos Raonic in a three hour, three set epic in the semi-finals. After breaking Nadal's serve early in the second set Djokovic powered on to win the next two sets and his 19th career Masters title. "He's one of the best in the world, he's playing great," Nadal said of Djokovic after the defeat. After the match, Serbia's most famous sportsman described how he had been keeping abreast of events back home, sent a message of support and even criticized Western media outlets for not covering the floods adequately.
