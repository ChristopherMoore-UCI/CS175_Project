But their mission was anything but godly, say Las Vegas police, which released images of the men on Tuesday. A hand went around my mouth, and I screamed for my wife," Terence Delucia told CNN affiliate KTNV. Dressed in black pants, white shirts and black ties and carrying backpacks, the two men walk up a driveway and step though a gate. The two men took about $3,000 the family had been saving for a trip to Disneyland, along with three iPads and an iPod, KTNV reported. They knocked on the victim's door asking to talk about religion, police say.
