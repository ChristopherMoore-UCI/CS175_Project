In the best, most daring sequence, she picks up a guy in a bar (Eric Stonestreet as Big Chuck) and persuades him back to their motel room to have sex with her in front of her husband, Sandy, who "likes to watch." Her first star vehicle, "Identity Thief," is not likely to be remembered as anyone's triumph (it's scoring in the 20-something percentile on the critics' aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes), but at least it does enough to show that McCarthy has what it takes. But McCarthy has the personality to subvert this, because her Diana may be lonely, but she is still more vital, more spontaneous and more fun than Sandy is ever likely to be. Mustering enough cash to fly down there, Sandy decides to apprehend the imposter himself and escort her back to Colorado so that they can straighten out the mess before he loses his job and his home. Written by Craig Mazin ("The Hangover Part II") and directed by Seth Gordon ("Horrible Bosses"), "Identity Thief" borrows too much from the likes of "Midnight Run" and "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" without giving enough back -- especially since "Due Date" already went that route quite recently.
