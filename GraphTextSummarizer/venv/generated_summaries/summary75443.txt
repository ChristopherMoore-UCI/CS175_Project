Armed with high-tech equipment, a team of archeologists and divers and using the information given to him by a researcher he has hired -- Croce set about combing the seabed in an area off the Panama coast. Dressed in armor, Drake's body was placed in a lead casket and thrown overboard off the coast of Panama. While Drake would return to England with stolen Spanish treasure, for Croce he says his lost treasure is Drake's coffin and the history behind it. It is Croce's dream to one day see Drake's body eventually returned to Britain and buried in Plymouth with drums sounding and overseen by Queen Elizabeth II, the monarch who shares the same name as the royal who thought of Drake as her own private. For the moment though, another mission will require a permit from the Panama government to continue diving off its coast.
