For the foreseeable future, it seems, Chinese Catholics will just have to continue the balancing act between church and state. "Father Francis is creating new urban congregations and that is exactly what the church in China should be doing -- continuing to minister in the old existing churches, or building new churches in old villages." After years of quiet diplomacy and a tacit agreement to jointly appoint Chinese bishops, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association -- which oversees the country's state-sanctioned church -- in recent days ordained one bishop over the Vatican's objections, while another was reportedly detained after resigning from the CPA. He later enrolled in British and Belgian universities, where he studied philosophy, psychology and church management. Zhang disagrees, diplomatically, with Beijing's defiance of the Vatican in the ordination of bishops.
