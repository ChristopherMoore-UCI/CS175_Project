" UK police are concerned about the number of girls and young women trying to head to areas of Syria controlled by ISIS, Walton said. Pictures released by police show the three girls walking together through London Gatwick Airport, carrying travel bags. In October, three teenage girls from Colorado were intercepted at Frankfurt Airport in Germany as they were trying to make their way to Syria to join ISIS. UK police appealed for help Friday to find three teenage girls who are missing from their homes in London and are believed to be making their way to Syria. Besides being forced to lead a very limited life in Syria, he said, they often are denied the choice of returning home, leaving few options for their devastated families.
