Rangers say some visitors take part in dangerous practices such as hiking treacherous trails in flip-flops, or climbing over safety rails to get better pictures or swimming in waters that are perilously close to waterfalls. Witnesses said the three hikers who were swept over the waterfall in July had climbed over a safety rail. Bill Ott, a hiker, says he has seen people swimming in dangerous waters. Authorities at Yosemite National Park are still searching for two of the bodies from that deadly July accident. This year, 16 people have died from incidents at Yosemite, rangers say.
