Pope Benedict XVI led an open-air Mass Sunday before throngs of faithful Catholics in central Mexico. The Archbishop of Leon asked the pope to deliver a message of hope to crowds gathered Sunday, noting that Mexico faces "events of violence and death that have created a painful sensation of fear, impotence and pain. The pope urged Mexican Catholics to remain true to their faith, and called on the Virgin Mary to "continue accompanying and protecting her beloved Mexican and Latin American children, so that Christ reigns in their lives and helps them to boldly promote peace, harmony, justice and solidarity. Nationally, the number of Catholics is 83 percent, according to Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Guanajuato state, which is hosting the pontiff, boasts the highest percentage of Catholics in Mexico -- well over 90 percent.
