Police say Col. Russell Williams confessed that he murdered two women, sexually assaulted two others, and broke into dozens of homes in search of women's lingerie. Williams divided his time between his home in Ottawa and a country cottage in southern Ontario, both of which he shared with his wife, Mary-Elizabeth Harriman. It doesn't make any sense at all for those that knew him," said George White, a neighbor and friend of Williams for 14 years. Most troubling for victims and their families is the great lengths police say Williams went to to preserve the video, pictures and mementos from his crimes. -- A Canadian air force colonel and pilot who was entrusted with flying Queen Elizabeth across Canada has pleaded guilty to charges of murder, rape and dozens of sexually motivated break-ins.
