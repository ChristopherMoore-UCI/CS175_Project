so we have seismic joints in the tunnels, especially between the immersed tube tunnel and the bore tunnel," says deputy project manager, Mehmet Cilingir. Despite the setbacks, the project is scheduled for completion next year -- a target that will be met, Yildirim says. Train drivers, like Mustafa Berker, are already getting to grips with the new trains that will operate on the line. The joints between the tunnels are flexible and will protect the structure from seismic movements, Cilingir says. "We are very comfortable that the project is going to be complete by the end of next year.
