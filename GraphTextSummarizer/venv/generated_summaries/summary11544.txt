Robert Jason Owens is accused of killing former contestant Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, and her husband, Joseph Codd, 45. Cristie Codd was five months pregnant, according to CNN affiliate WHNS in Greenville, South Carolina. "We responded and were able to locate items that we knew belonged to Cristie Schoen Codd." When investigators did an initial interview with Owens, he confessed to taking items from the victims' home, authorities said. Cristie Codd was a finalist on season eight of "Food Network Star," which airs on the Food Network. Duncan said they obtained a warrant to search Owens' home and found human remains.
