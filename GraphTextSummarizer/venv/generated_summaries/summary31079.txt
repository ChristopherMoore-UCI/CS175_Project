"Tennis is going to lose a little bit because of Rafa not being there and playing, because he's somebody that has made a history of this sport," said U.S. Open champion Djokovic, who began his Cincinnati campaign with a hard-fought 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 win over Andreas Seppi of Italy, having retained his Toronto Masters title on Sunday. Djokovic, last year's Cincinnati runner-up, is seeking to improve his form in his next match against Russian veteran Nikolay Davydenko. Former No. 1 Nadal won a record seventh French Open title in June after his customary busy clay season, but lost in the second round at Wimbledon and was unable to defend his Olympic singles title at London 2012. "In the immediate aftermath of big wins or good tournaments, normally you'll feel quite confident and comfortable going for your shots in the important moments and even at the beginning of matches," he said after setting up a third-round clash with France's Jeremy Chardy, who beat Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan 6-4 6-3. Montreal runner-up Li Na joined the Czech in round three, where the Chinese ninth sed will play Swedish qualifier Johanna Larsson, while Polish top seed Agnieszka Radwanska and former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki also progressed.
