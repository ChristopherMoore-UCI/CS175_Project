Young is known as a flamboyant dresser and Larry Yarrell, the Tech principal, said school staff had been trying to get him to "tone down" his accessories. After six other students surrounded him at school on April 16, calling him names and threatening to beat him up, Young pulled the stun gun from his backpack. "I got kicked out of school for me bringing the weapon to school, but I honestly don't think that that was fair," Young said. School officials are investigating the incident, but none of the students who allegedly surrounded Young have been positively identified. The district also offers Gay Straight Alliance groups on multiple campuses, including Arsenal Technical High School, where Young attended, Bewley said.
