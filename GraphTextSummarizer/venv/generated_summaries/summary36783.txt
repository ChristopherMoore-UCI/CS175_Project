OutKast will kick off Coachella with acts such as the Replacements, Zedd, Girl Talk, Ellie Goulding and Haim, with Muse leading the second day along with Lorde, Foster the People, Pet Shop Boys, Queens of the Stone Age, Skrillex and Sleigh Bells. Joining OutKast, Arcade Fire and Muse will be a number of newer faces, such as Lorde and Haim, plus established artists such as Nas, Motorhead and Pharrell. Coachella will run the same lineup across two weekends in April: the first edition is scheduled for April 11-13, followed by the second stretch from April 18-20. Closing out the event on both weekends will be Arcade Fire, Beck, Calvin Harris, Disclosure, Lana Del Rey, Chance the Rapper and more. As suspected, OutKast will indeed reunite at Coachella 2014, headlining the three-day music festival in Indio, California, along with Muse and Arcade Fire.
