This ruling comes a week after Egypt passed the Terrorist Entities Law, which spells out how to declare a group a terrorist organization, according to Ahmed Ragheb, head of the National Group for Human Rights and Law. Egypt's Urgent Matters Court based its ruling on Hamas in part on claims the organization had supported insurgents who have staged attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, a region that has been fraught with instability in recent months. The armed wing of Hamas, the al Qassam Brigades, was designated a terror group by the same court last month. Morsy was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization that shares deep ties with Hamas. " CNN has attempted to reach Mousa Abu Marzouk, the Hamas representative in Egypt, for comment.
