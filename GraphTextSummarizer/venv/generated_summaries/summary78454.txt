See our first-blush take on Homeland's big shakeup (and whether the show's ratings will continue to stay high given last night's events) and stay tuned for our Q&A with showrunner Alex Gansa coming soon. Homeland is Showtime's top-rated show and season 3 has now exceeded seven million viewers per week in all cumulative viewing â€” that's a record performance for the network, even surpassing Dexter. Quite a big drop-off from Homeland, but the period drama is averaging 4.8 million per episode in cumulative viewing, which is higher than the first season of Homeland.
