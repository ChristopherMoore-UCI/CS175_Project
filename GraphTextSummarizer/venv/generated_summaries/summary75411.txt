The image was snapped at Miami International Airport  -- not at Simón Bolívar International Airport outside the Venezuelan capital -- by Miami Herald staffer Carl Juste in November 2013, the newspaper said. Venezuelan authorities at the time said he was detained for failing  to have the proper media credentials, the Miami Herald reported Friday. But Telesur officials apparently believed it was a fitting image to promote tourism in a South American nation where chronic shortages of basic goods had led to protests. A photo of the Miami Herald correspondent, smiling and embracing a woman, was featured Thursday as part of Venezuelan state-run television's online tourism campaign. @teleSURtv has me in promo using pic from when I got OUT of Venezuela after 48hr detention.
