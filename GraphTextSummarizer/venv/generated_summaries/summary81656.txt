The sisters and cousin -- all granddaughters of Mandela and all raised in Boston -- set up Leed with two South African companies, New Vision Pictures and Out of Africa Entertainment. Dlamini-Manaway, her sister and a cousin met Rey's executive producer, Rick Leed, according to information provided Thursday by Cutting Edge Communications, which is working with two South Africa-based production companies on the program. The program possibly will air in the United States starting in January, said David Manaway, who is married to one of Mandela's granddaughters involved in the production. The spotlight will soon shine on three granddaughters of South African and global icon Nelson Mandela, as the women become focal points of a new reality TV show. Leed also is known for feature films including "Where the Heart Is" and "Company Man."
