Paul told CNN on Friday that May -- who was killed by police during Thursday's shootings -- had asked him and several others for their mailing addresses in a November 15 Facebook message. Victim released from hospital May, 31, fired shots in FSU's Strozier Library around 12:30 a.m. Thursday, wounding three of the 300 or 400 students inside -- one of them critically, police said. In September, May called police in Las Cruces, New Mexico, convinced that someone had placed cameras in his apartment and complaining that he was hearing voices through the walls, according to an incident report provided by the department. A preliminary review of these documents and videos demonstrates "that Mr. May was in a state of crisis," DeLeo said. Officers who encountered May outside shot him when he refused to drop his weapon, police say.
