Valero referred to news reports suggesting the ambassador's wife and son were also suspected of wrongdoing. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero commented on the case Tuesday but did not name the envoy or say what country he came from. -- Bahrain's ambassador to France has been accused of sexually assaulting a former employee and is under investigation by prosecutors, authorities in France said Thursday. "To my knowledge, the ambassador and his wife are in the diplomatic list and therefore have diplomatic immunity, and the son does not," Valero said Tuesday. Al-Belooshi "forcefully" denied the allegations, calling them "inaccurate and unfounded," according to the official Bahrain News Agency.
