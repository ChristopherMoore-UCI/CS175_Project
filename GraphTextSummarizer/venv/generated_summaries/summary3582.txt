Obama transition aides met with Democrats on that committee Wednesday morning to discuss various proposals, according to another Democratic aide. -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that House committees will begin action on President-elect Barack Obama's proposed economic recovery package in the next couple of weeks, with a vote in the full House slated for the week after Obama's inauguration. Watch Obama call for "dramatic action" on the economy Â» "I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible," Obama continued. " Key members of Obama's own party, however, said they opposed central tax measures of the president-elect's proposals after emerging from a closed-door meeting of the Senate Finance Committee. Who is going to hire in the auto industry if you give them a $3,000 credit to make cars that people are not buying?" A second Obama tax proposal that several Democrats were down on is payroll tax credits, amounting to about $20 per paycheck and totaling $500 per person and $1,000 for couples earning less than $200,000 a year.
