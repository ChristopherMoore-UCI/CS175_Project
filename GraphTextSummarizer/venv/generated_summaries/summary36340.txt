The actress gave her fans a scare on Wednesday when she said in an interview with DuJour magazine that she's ready to give up performing for directing. Obviously, one of those movies she wants to see through is her 2015 film "By the Sea," which she wrote and directed, and also stars in with husband Brad Pitt. "It's a heavy film, and it's not easy for us," Jolie told DuJour of her upcoming project. "I see myself moving into directing more and doing much less as an actor," Jolie later clarified to Entertainment Weekly. "I've never been comfortable as an actor; I've never loved being in front of the camera," Jolie said.
