The Swiss master, appearing in his 126th tour final (of which he has now won 84) was at his imperious best, frustrating Djokovic who could do little to stem the variety of forehand, backhand and volleyed winners coming from the other side of the net. Federer then took the final game on serve to ensure he would win the Dubai title for the seventh time. Federer edged ahead in game seven of the first, breaking Djokovic before confidently serving out for the set. Novak Djokovic 6-3 7-5 to take the Dubai Tennis Championships title Saturday in little over one hour and 36 minutes. "I don't think I could have played much better," Federer said on court after the match.
