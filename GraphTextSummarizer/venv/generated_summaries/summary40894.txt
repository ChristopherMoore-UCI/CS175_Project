In designing products, we consider these two attributes -- along with other factors such as budget, material capability and consumer response -- and add them to the mixture that constitutes design. Two frumpy ladies were standing in front of a cubist portrait of Gertrude Stein, or at least the label said "Gertrude Stein." One woman turned to her friend and said, "It doesn't look like Gertrude Stein." The Apple Store design, the product design, the hardware design and software design all come down to innovation -- something not tried before. For most designers, good design is neither just a well-functioning object nor a good-looking object, but rather both.
