Though the settings in some of these looped animations show the scars of Liberia's civil war (the once five-star Ducor Intercontinental Hotel, which today stands empty, is a regular backdrop), Beaurain's films also feature smiling, upbeat locals. "Honestly, the goal of this is that maybe in a few months, or a few years, when people stop to Google Liberia or Monrovia, they will find my GIFs, instead of images of child soldiers," he says. The search results did not paint a pretty picture of the country: images that popped up were mainly of civil war, blood diamonds, and child soldiers. To put his subjects at ease, Beaurain made a point of returning with the GIF on a smartphone, both to prove that the image would stay in Liberia, and to demonstrate his concept. For Beaurain, an important aspect of the project is showing that Liberia is capable of creating powerful, thought-provoking digital works.
