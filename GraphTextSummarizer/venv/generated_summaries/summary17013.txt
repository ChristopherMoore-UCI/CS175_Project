According to a criminal complaint, several text messages sent between the couple suggest Ferrante urged Klein to try using creatine to get help her get pregnant. One day before Klein fell ill, Ferrante had used a credit card to place an overnight order for more than a half-pound of cyanide. At the time the order was placed, there were no active projects at Ferrante's lab that involved the use of cyanide, according to the complaint. For many on the outside, there seemed little amiss in the lives of Ferrante and Klein. More than a week after her collapse, after being told that she'd been fatally poisoned with cyanide, Ferrante himself asked detectives, "Why would she do that to herself?"
