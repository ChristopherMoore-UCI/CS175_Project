Baez said that Caylee was not murdered, but drowned in the pool belonging to Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, on June 16. The evening of June 16, the last day Caylee was seen, Anthony was "the way she was every day," her then-boyfriend, Anthony Lazzaro, testified. "George Anthony maintains that he never had anything to do with the death of Caylee Marie Anthony including what happened to her remains after she allegedly drowned," Lippman added. Baez dropped another bombshell when explaining Anthony's behavior in the month before Caylee was reported missing on July 15 -- partying at clubs and lying about the child's whereabouts. Baez asked Campana and Lezniewicz the same question: Whether they were present at the Anthony home on June 16 when Caylee allegedly drowned in the pool.
