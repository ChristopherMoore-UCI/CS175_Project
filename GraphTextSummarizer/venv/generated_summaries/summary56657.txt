Countries around the world have launched massive aid operations to help victims of the Nepal earthquake, but distribution of aid faces challenges as Nepal is still trying to come to terms with the scale of the disaster. "Typically what we see, also in other emergencies, is that it takes a few days for supply lines, distribution lines to stabilize," UNDAC's Werne told CNN. Even the planes which have landed, goods haven't been offloaded," Jagan Chapagain, the Asia Pacific Director of the IFRC (International Federations of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies) told CNN. Nepal relies on only one international airport to receive and deliver aid. The operation to get aid to survivors in Nepal is still "very ad hoc" and it will be a few days before the distribution becomes organized because the government is still constrained by the scale of the disaster, says Chapagain.
