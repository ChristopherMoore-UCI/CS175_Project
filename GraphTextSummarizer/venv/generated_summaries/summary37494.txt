" In a letter to passengers, Costa Cruises CEO Pier Luigi Foschi disputes that assessment: "The crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly in an extremely difficult situation and succeeded -- despite the terribly demanding conditions -- in evacuating more than 4,000 people in the shortest possible time: we are proud of our commitment and dedication to your safety." The CEO of Costa's parent company, Carnival Corp., pledged support to passengers: "I give my personal assurance that we will take care of each and every one of our guests, crew and their families affected by this tragic event," Micky Arison said in a statement. In addition to arranging lodging, transportation and counseling for passengers, Costa will address possessions lost on board and is in the process of refunding cruise fares and costs incurred while on board, the company said in a statement. Fleser said the lifeboat ride to the Tuscan island of Giglio was the last she saw of Costa Cruises employees until she, her husband and daughter reached a hotel in Rome on Saturday. " More than 1,100 Costa employees have been working to assist passengers and crew since Friday night, Foschi said in his letter to passengers.
