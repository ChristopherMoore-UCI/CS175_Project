A veritable credit card fee frenzy over the past decade meant many banks could easily offer free checking and other perks, subsidized by the big fees generated elsewhere. New analysis by Bankrate.com shows fewer banks offer free checking and the costs associated with your bank account are rising. Overdraft fees rose another 3 percent to $30.47 and the cost to maintain a checking account rose on average to $13.04 a month -- that's the cost for not keeping the minimum in an interest bearing account. Average ATM fees are up 5 percent, to an all-time high of $2.33, and the average out-of-network charge to use an ATM for another bank is $1.41. Shop around for bank accounts
