" Watson's arrival has already made a mark on the Wahoos' Pensacola Bayfront Stadium -- the bar and restaurant has been renamed Bubba's Sand Trap in his honour, and peckish fans will be able to enjoy a Bubba Dub Grilled Cheese,a sandwich that also includes hash browns. The Studers said they were delighted that Watson had come on board, with Quint Studer adding: "Rishy, Bubba and I all view the Wahoos as an investment in improving the quality of life for people. But the 36-year-old -- who last year took batting practice with Wahoos players before their game against the Mobile BayBears -- was quick to stress that majority owners Quint and Rishy Studer wouldn't be letting him live out his dream of playing for the team. "Together we will continue to create great experiences for all ages, make lifelong memories for our fans, be a super place to work and now, with Bubba's leadership, we will gain a national and international awareness for the Blue Wahoos and Northwest Florida. "Ever since I went to my first Blue Wahoos game, I have been a big fan.
