-- Ballistics test results link four shootings at U.S. military facilities in the Washington suburbs in October, and investigators are probing whether a new case at a Coast Guard recruiting office is related, police in Virginia said Tuesday. Ballistics tests have connected that incident to shots aimed at the Marine museum on October 17 and 29, as well as to an October 25 case in which shots were fired at a Marine Corps recruiting station in Chantilly, near Washington Dulles International Airport. The description is "relatively similar" to October cases in which shots were fired at the Pentagon, the National Museum of the Marine Corps and a vacant Marine recruiting station, said 1st "Employees of the Coast Guard recruiting station called to tell us there was some damage to the glass, and police arrived and determined it was probably done by a bullet," Chinn said.
