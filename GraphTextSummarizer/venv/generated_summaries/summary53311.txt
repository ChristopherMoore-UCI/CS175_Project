"Cindy was a beloved caregiver for the kind and compassionate support she provided for patients and families at times of impending loss and need," Kaiser Permanente said. "(Cindy) was a wonderful person who was very caring and put others first," the Yuille family said of the 54-year-old nurse who lived in northeast Portland. Information on the two emerged after they were killed Tuesday in a shooting at a mall in Happy Valley, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. "Our hearts are with Cindy's husband and family as they absorb this tragedy and grieve. "He was the kind of guy who if you went to his house, he never said anything bad about anybody." Kristina Shevchenko, 15, who also was shot, remained in stable but serious condition Wednesday afternoon at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital.
