The national rate of foreclosure increased by 79 percent between December 2006 and December 2007, according to RealtyTrac, a company that compiles data on home foreclosures. "You cut down on the ratio to make [home ownership] more affordable," said Anthony Sanders, a professor of finance and real estate at Arizona State University. "It's really a toxic mix of higher than anticipated prices on monthly payments combined with house values that have dropped makes it impossible for people to refinance or sell their homes," said RealtyTrac Vice President Rick Sharga. Foreclosure filings -- default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- continued to climb in January, though at a slower pace than the month before, according to RealtyTrac. Though administration officials are tight-lipped about details, one idea that has been floated is for the federal government to reduce monthly mortgage payments by modifying loans.
