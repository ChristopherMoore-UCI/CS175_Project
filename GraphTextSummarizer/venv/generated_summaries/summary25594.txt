The SkyMapper telescope is unique in its ability to find stars with low iron, which uses sophisticated filters to measure the color of the stars, a key indicator of iron levels. Keller said that most stars created in the early stages of the universe died in "extremely violent explosions," and that it is unlikely that more stars of a similar age will be found. The team used a technique for imaging stars to ascertain how much iron was present -- the younger a star, the greater the amounts of iron it had. The oldest celestial bodies discovered thus far have been 13.2 billion years old. Keller and his team used the SkyMapper telescope to find ancient stars as part of an ongoing project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky.
