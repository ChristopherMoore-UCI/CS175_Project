Future head of state Prince William knows he hasn't been the headline act of this tour, with the spotlight firmly fixed on his wife and son. On the face of things, this was just a play date at Government House in Wellington, New Zealand, but it had been organized for a future king and was the starting gun for a lifetime of official engagements for Prince George. During this tour we got to know a new generation of royalty (George) but we also saw an existing one (William and Kate) mature. It was a kingly side that I can't remember seeing in him before -- Prince William is a future head of state. They are doing it in their own way by focusing on events that reflect their personal interests (conservation, the military, sport, young people and hospices) and they've done so to rapturous praise in the Australian media and amongst the political leadership.
