Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum will speak in Tampa, but other Republicans who challenged Romney for this year's GOP nomination -- including Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Godfather's Pizza chief Herman Cain -- have not been announced as convention speakers. "The speakers have been chosen because they make the best possible case to elect Mitt Romney and to show the American people the various positions and diversity of the Republican Party," GOP strategist Ron Bonjean said. Putting Rubio, as well as Texas U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (also tea party favorites), in prime-time speaking roles at the convention also signals the GOP's push to bring in Latino voters, who overwhelmingly went for Obama in 2008 and polls show going the same way this time around. Donald Trump, the celebrity businessman and Romney supporter whose commitment to the "birther" movement that challenges Obama's place of birth leaves many Republicans queasy, said through a spokesman last week he would have a "memorable" role at the convention, but that it wouldn't include a prime time address. "Fundamentally, convention speaking lineups are meant to represent a cross-section of the party's faithful -- and I expect the 2012 Republican and Democratic conventions to be no exception," Burns said.
