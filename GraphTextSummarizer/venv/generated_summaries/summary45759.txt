While I listened to the streaming audio, I was scanning the news -- and I spotted a headline that should probably make News Corp. nervous about its new venture: Apple blocks Sony e-book app. This strategy skirts Apple's considerable 30% cut for in-app purchases -- and it's how Amazon's popular Kindle app has handled purchases from the beginning. Furthermore, Murdoch confirmed that the iPad will probably be the only provider for The Daily for this year and next year. We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app with in-app purchase." Eventually News Corp. will be developing editions for all tablet platforms, but for right now, it's effectively an iPad exclusive -- which means News Corp. is relying heavily on the terms of the deal it's worked out with Apple to make the economics of this venture pay off.
