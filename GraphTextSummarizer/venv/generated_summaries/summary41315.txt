El-Sisi, who was defense minister when the military ousted President Mohamed Morsy in July, had said he would run for president if the Egyptian people wanted him to, state media reported recently. Morsy was elected in 2012, a year after a popular uprising ousted longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. El-Sisi has yet to announce whether he'll run, but the move by Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces essentially is an endorsement of him, said Ehab Badawy, a spokesman for Egyptian Interim President Adly Mansour. Morsy's supporters say that he wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of Mubarak. The Arab world's most populous nation has seen months of political turmoil since the military deposed Morsy, of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement, on July 3 after mass protests against his rule.
