The family soon learned that Adame -- who had first been arrested on a drunk driving charge -- was one of more than 2,000 immigration detainees federal authorities released last month in a controversial move that officials said would cut costs as forced budget cuts loomed. "Ultimately, these nonsensical actions demonstrate the inability and lack of desire on behalf of the administration to enforce the law even against illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes." ICE officials have said the move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take the $85 billion in forced government-wide budget cuts, known as sequestration, into account. "The agency is never going to be able to detain and remove everybody as a matter of budget nor does it make sense as a matter of policy. So are more than two dozen others, according to federal officials. And they stressed that detainees released were non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories.
