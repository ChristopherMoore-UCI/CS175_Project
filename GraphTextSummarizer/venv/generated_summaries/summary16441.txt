But when the United States began hitting ISIS in Iraq, the Foley family knew it wouldn't help -- even though, as Michael Foley acknowledges, what happened to his brother underscores the evil nature of this group. That was the core of the message Friday from Michael Foley, the brother of the American journalist James Foley, beheaded this month by his ISIS captors. You wouldn't believe how difficult it was to get information (on) released journalists ... from the ways that we have these walls built." U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue Foley and other hostages held by Islamic militants, a U.S. official told CNN. Michael Foley noted that several European journalists have been freed, after their captors got paid ransoms -- something Washington refuses to do, saying it won't negotiate with terrorists. " "(U.S. officials) hands are tied, in many ways, by the rigid policies that we tend to follow," Michael Foley added.
