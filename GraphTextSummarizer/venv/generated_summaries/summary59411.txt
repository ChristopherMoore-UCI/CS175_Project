-- NATO forces in Afghanistan are investigating a report that a NATO airstrike killed Afghan security forces in a region rife with arms smuggling and narcotics trafficking. Afghanistan's Defense Ministry issued a statement saying seven Afghan security forces died and Afghan and international forces were injured in the Saturday incident, which occurred in Badghis province -- a swath of territory in western Afghanistan bordering Turkmenistan. The service members disappeared near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan, in the Badghis town of Bala Morghab, said Sayed Ahmad Sami, the provincial police chief. Fifteen Afghan soldiers, two Afghan police, five U.S. service members under ISAF, and a civilian working with Afghan troops were wounded, the statement said. ISAF and Afghan security forces personnel casualties were reported on Friday in several incidents during the search operation, a statement from ISAF said.
