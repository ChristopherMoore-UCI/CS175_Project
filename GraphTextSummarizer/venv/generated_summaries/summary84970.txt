U.S. Open champion McIlroy had led the 30-strong field from the opening day, but a wayward final round saw him having to dig deep to card a level par 72 to finish on a 72-hole total of 288 (-18). -- Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy is $2 million richer on Sunday after holding his nerve to beat American Anthony Kim in a play-off at the Shanghai Masters at Lake Malaren. Kim collected $750,00 for second place, with American Hunter Mahan and Korean youngster Noh Seung-Yul tied for third place five strokes behind the leading two. With both players sending their approach shots into the same greenside bunker, Kim missed his resulting three-foot putt, allowing world number three McIlroy to tap home from two feet to collect the richest current first prize in golf. It is the joint largest single first prize ever awarded in golf, equaling the fund offered in the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa.
