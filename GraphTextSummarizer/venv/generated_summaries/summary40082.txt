It is only by creating opportunities for other countries to voice their preferences and to shape American policy through joint decision-making that other countries will accept the unique leadership status of the United States, they believe. According to the Pew Research Center poll, 57% of liberals believe the United States should get United Nations approval before using military force, while only 38% of conservatives say this is an important step. By and large, Americans are upstanding, moral individuals who instinctively support noble policies in our relations with other countries. Nonetheless, conservatives are much more likely than liberals to believe that American values and culture are superior to those of other nations. Liberals see the United States as exceptional because of our principles of limited government, embedded in the Constitution.
