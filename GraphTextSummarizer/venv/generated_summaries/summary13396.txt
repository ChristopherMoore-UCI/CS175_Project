The President should underscore that passing real immigration reform will inject more than $700 billion into our economy over the next 10 years, and $1.4 trillion over the next 20, reduce the deficit by almost a $1 trillion in the next 20 years, raise wages, as undocumented workers will no longer be taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers, and boost our overall global competitiveness. There is a reason why most (even conservative) economists support immigration reform and why the business community has joined with the faith community, law enforcement leaders and labor in an improbable alliance of partners working toward this type of reform. When the President finally makes his announcement before the end of the year, the American people, understandably distressed about what has been happening at the border, will deserve a full accounting on the realities of border security, the undocumented flows into the country, why our economy needs immediate action and why we need to achieve real legislative reform in the long run. He should explain that in the long run, these immigrants should have to get right with the law, pass a background check, pay a fine and back taxes, learn English, and then get in line behind others who are following current legal procedures in order to become a U.S. citizen (key elements to real immigration reform). If not for GOP inaction, immigration reform would be a reality today.
