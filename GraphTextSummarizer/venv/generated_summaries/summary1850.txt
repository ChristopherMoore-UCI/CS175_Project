While national polling over the past few months suggests most Americans don't favor military involvement in Syria, some surveys indicate the public feels Washington would be justified in using military action against Damascus in the event of chemical weapons attacks by the regime. "I respectfully request that you, as our country's commander-in-chief, personally make the case to the American people and Congress for how potential military action will secure American national security interests, preserve America's credibility, deter the future use of chemical weapons, and, critically, be a part of our broader policy and strategy," Boehner's letter said. The United States has concluded Syria carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people, Obama said Wednesday. In all those instances, presidents -- both Democrats and Republicans -- sidestepped Congress and committed U.S. military forces without obtaining congressional approval. "The views of Congress are important to the president's decision-making process, and we will continue to engage with members as the president reaches a decision on the appropriate U.S. response to the Syrian government's violation of international norms against the use of chemical weapons," it read.
