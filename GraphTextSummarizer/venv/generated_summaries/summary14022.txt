According to the indictment, Rana helped Headley obtain a fake visa to travel to India as well as approve the opening of a First World office in Mumbai. David Coleman Headley, the only other defendant named in the suit, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges last year and is expected to testify against Rana. After the Mumbai attacks, according to prosecutors, Headley again obtained Rana's permission to use his company's name as a cover to conduct surveillance on a Danish newspaper that had publish the offensive cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Between September 2006 and July 2008, Headley made repeated trips to Mumbai where he made video recordings of potential terrorist sites, the indictment states. Rana is also accused of taking part in a plot to bomb the offices of a Danish newspaper that had published irreverent cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed and angered Muslims across the world.
