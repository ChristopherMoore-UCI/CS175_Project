For the first time since Pew began asking about the issue, more white mainline Protestants and white Catholics favor gay marriage than oppose it. In polls conducted in 2009, 37 percent favored gay marriage while 54 percent were opposed, Pew said. But for the first time since Pew starting asking about same sex marriage 15 years ago, fewer than half of those polled said they oppose legalizing the institution. -- Fewer than half of Americans oppose legalized same-sex marriage, according to a new poll on the issue released Wednesday, with significant shifts in public opinion on the issue just since last year. On gay marriage, the new poll found significant differences of opinions along age, racial and partisan lines.
