Dozens of Turkish hostages abducted by Islamist militants in northern Iraq were freed Saturday after three months in captivity. Militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria raided the Turkish consulate in June and seized 49 people, including Consul General Ozturk Yilmaz. Others abducted included his family, children and other citizens who were at the consulate in Mosul at the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. Of the total, three were local employees and 46 were Turkish citizens. It's unclear how they were freed, but Erdogan thanked Turkish intelligence officials in a statement on his website.
