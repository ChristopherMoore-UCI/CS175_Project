In recent times, as demand for calligraphy brushes has declined, Chikuhodo (founded in 1952, the company employs more than 100 workers) and other well known Kumano companies began producing high-end makeup brushes and paint brushes, while still using traditional artisan techniques. Kumano brushes are also sold at Japanese department stores, large stationery stores and Hiroshima Station. "Even today, Kumano brushes are all handmade," Takemori adds. -- Shin Takemori throws a handful of old brushes onto a fire on a flat stone "altar," where a mound of similar brushes is already ablaze. Kumano is 45 minutes by bus from Hiroshima JR Station and 35 minutes from Kure JR Station.
