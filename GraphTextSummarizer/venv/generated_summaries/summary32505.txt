"Last month it was Kanye West, this month it's Vegas fight promoters," Patterson said. San Antonio police said more than 500 people showed up -- some to see the video, and others to protest it -- but the screening never took place, CNN affiliate KENS reported. That's the view of Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who is less than happy with the attention, unwanted in his view, that the historic site is getting. Boxers Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Saul "Canelo" Alvarez appeared in Alamo Plaza on Monday night to promote their September 14 super-welterweight title fight in Las Vegas. The promotion comes five weeks after rapper Kanye West's plan to project a video for his song "New Slaves" on the facade of the Alamo failed to come into focus.
