Verbal harassment, which includes unwelcome sexual comments, jokes or gestures, made up the bulk of the incidents, but physical harassment was prevalent as well, and 30% of students experienced sexual harassment by text, e-mail, social networking sites like Facebook or other electronic means. In recent years, sexual harassment among students hasn't gotten as much attention as bullying, but Hill said the two are interrelated. Students said they were "sick to their stomach, had trouble sleeping, and even skipped school," when they were exposed to both forms of harassment, said Hill. "Many of us think of sexual harassment as an adult issue," said Catherine Hill, the director of research at AAUW and one of the authors of the report. But I would like sexual harassment in that conversation," said Hill.
