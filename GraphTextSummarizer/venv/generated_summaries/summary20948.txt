In southern Afghanistan, a member of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force died Tuesday after an attack by enemy forces, ISAF reported. Later Tuesday, the United Kingdom's Defence Ministry said that enemy fire killed a British soldier who was on patrol Tuesday in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province, northeast of the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. But this year, the joyous occasion Tuesday was marred by bomb blasts and deaths in violence-plagued Afghanistan and Iraq, and in civil war-wracked Syria. Before he served in Logar, he had been governor of eastern Afghanistan's Khost province. In the country's east, a bomb placed under a stage killed the governor of Logar province as he was delivering an Eid al-Adha speech inside a mosque Tuesday morning.
