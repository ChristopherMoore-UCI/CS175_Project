Jahjaga, who has no political background and is a relative unknown among the Kosovo public, came up as a compromise candidate only Wednesday night in a meeting that included Pacolli, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and the leader of the main opposition party, Isa Mustafa. Former President Pacolli's decision to withdraw as a candidate played an important part in ending the crisis, Thaci, Mustafa and Dell said Wednesday night. At a news conference Wednesday night, Thaci said a memorandum of agreement reached in the meeting calls for formation of a committee to alter the constitution so that the president would be directly elected by the people. Her election follows a ruling by the constitutional court that the process leading to the election of businessman Behgjet Pacolli as president on February 22 was unconstitutional. The agreement also calls for forming a committee to amend election law in time for parliamentary and local elections in 2013.
