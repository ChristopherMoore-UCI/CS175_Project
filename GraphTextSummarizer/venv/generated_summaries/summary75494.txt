Diesel has used his Facebook page to keep fans updated since co-star Paul Walker died in a high-speed car crash six weeks ago. Diesel posted a message and photograph on Facebook two weeks ago that showed the last scene he and Walker filmed together. "We always took pride in trying to make each one better than the last," Diesel said in a post on his verified Facebook fan page late Thursday. The key players in the "Fast & Furious" series meet Friday to discuss the future of the movie franchise, star Vin Diesel said. Universal Studios, which was planning to release the franchise's seventh installment this July, announced last month that it would hit theaters on April 10, 2015.
