No aid professional ever suggested that outside help was more important than private effort; on the contrary, foreign aid was intended to help lay the foundations for greater public confidence and private savings and investment. So, where -- despite decades of aid -- the conditions for private savings and investment are still forbidding, it is high time we ask ourselves why we are still trying to improve them. Only five percent of Kenya's budget comes from foreign aid, compared with 40 percent in neighboring countries. Other countries will need to wait -- or settle with only small amounts of aid -- until their politics or policies or attitudes to the private sector are more promising. An obvious solution is to focus aid on the small number of countries that are trying seriously to fight poverty and corruption.
