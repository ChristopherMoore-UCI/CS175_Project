-- An Orthodox Jewish man apparently preparing to pray prompted authorities to divert a Louisville, Kentucky-bound US Airways Express plane Thursday. US Airways spokesman Morgan Durrant said the diversion was a "security precaution" for the 50-seat ERJ 145. The flight had taken off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, the FBI said, and was diverted to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said there appeared to be no threat from the man, who was described as wearing something on his head that included leather pieces. ET, and the plane landed without incident at Philadelphia International Airport about 20 minutes later.
