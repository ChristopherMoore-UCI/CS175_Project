Lingering oil residue at the bottom of Gulf Coast marshes caused heart defects and hindered reproduction in a small fish seen as an environmental bellwether, researchers said Thursday. The latest, conducted by scientists from Louisiana State University and University of California-Davis, found killifish embryos that were exposed to oiled sediments hatched at a rate 40% lower than those cultivated in samples from un-oiled sites. These sources have existed for years in Louisiana marshes, and not all are associated with oil. Those that did hatch were smaller, had lower heart rates and had cardiovascular deformities that were likely to hurt their chances of survival, said Ben Dubansky, an environmental toxicologist at Louisiana State University. Oil company BP, which owned the ruptured well and is responsible for the cleanup, announced plans for nearly $600 million in restoration projects in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana this week.
