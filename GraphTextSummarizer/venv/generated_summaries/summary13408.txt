Pew noted that the growth of people using the Internet as a "destination for fun" coincides with the rise of broadband connections, social networking and video. But it's not just young web users that turn to the Internet during their down time -- about 58% of all adults or 74% of online adults said they use the Internet this way, up from 45% of adults who said they did so in a Pew survey conducted in 2006. A report from Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project found that about 53% of young adults ages 18 to 29 go online on any given day for no particular reason except for a diversion or just for fun. "These findings are one of our main signs about how deeply Internet use has woven itself into the rhythms of people's lives," lead author Lee Rainie told Mashable. The trend also suggests that the Web is becoming a competitor to other kinds of other leisure activities.
