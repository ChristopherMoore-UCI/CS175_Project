Dressage is an exercise in restraint, in beauty of form and synergy between horse and rider. Dressage is often called ballet for horses, look for the horse that has the best beat and you may find a winner. Look for calm horses with floppy ears and a relaxed demeanor. The energy to jump comes from the hind end of the horse- notice how the riders rock their horses back onto their hindquarters in front of successful jumps. Unlike dressage where the horse stays grounded, show jumping involves navigating a course of jumps often as wide as they are tall, without taking longer than the allotted time.
