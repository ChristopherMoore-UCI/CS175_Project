By Tuesday, TumbleDown Trails Golf Course was reporting death threats. The golf course in Verona, Wisconsin, placed an advertisement in Monday's Wisconsin State Journal offering to "commemorate" the 12th anniversary of the terror attacks with "9 holes with cart for only $9.11 per person or 18 holes with cart for only $19.11!" The management of a Wisconsin golf course said the idea was to remember the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, but the ad turned into a public relations disaster on social media. By Tuesday afternoon, many Facebook commenters were defending the course. The ad quickly began circulating on social media, and the golf course's Facebook page was flooded with angry comments.
