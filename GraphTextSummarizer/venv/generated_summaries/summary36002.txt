But Aden remains a city not fully in the hands either of Houthi rebels or forces loyal to the ousted government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. How we got to Yemen: 30 dangerous hours in a boat Saudi Arabia began airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen three weeks ago Thursday. The Houthis forced Hadi from power in January, though Hadi still claims to be Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to Yemen. But given how far along they are into the operation, the expectation would have been -- especially given the aerial cover the Saudis are providing for loyalist forces on the ground -- that the Houthi forces would have been pushed further back. But the reality is that a good portion of the armaments the Saudis send in on guided parachutes fall instead into Houthi hands.
