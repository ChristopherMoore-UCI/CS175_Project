"The idea is to create cemeteries for multilevel burial," says Tuvia Sagiv, who with his partner, Uri Ponger, is the architect behind 30 "high burial buildings" planned for the already crowded Yarkon Cemetery outside Tel Aviv. While the idea may seem odd to some, vertical cemeteries already exist where populations are dense and land is scarce, such as in China, Japan, Egypt and even New Orleans, where high waters make burial difficult. "The buildings will provide a solution to the problem of lack of burial space for more than the next two decades," says Itay Goor, a spokesman for Chevra Kadisha of Greater Tel Aviv. "A body is laid on earth, connected to the earth," Sagiv says, "so the building is full of earth, every body we put inside will be on the earth. Jewish law stipulates that the dead be buried separately on a layer of dust and earth.
