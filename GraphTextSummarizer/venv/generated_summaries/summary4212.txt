The suit alleges that screeners initially refused to review a printout that Armato provided of TSA guidelines pertaining to breast milk. According to the suit, Stacey Armato was traveling with breast milk for her 7-month-old son and requested alternate screening for the milk at a Phoenix International Airport checkpoint to avoid X-ray exposure. One said: "1) It has been frequently reported that TSA staff do not care whether or not something has been clearly stated on the website when they are imposing their own understanding of the rules; 2) It has been frequently reported that polite requests to speak with supervisors are treated as defiant behavior."

The policy explained on the site now explicitly says that ice packs and empty bottles are permitted through security.
