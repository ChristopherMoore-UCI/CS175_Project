" Had Djokovic lost -- and don't forget he entered the record books for the wrong reason last year when he was on the other side of the net as Andy Murray ended a 77-year British drought -- it would have gone down as one of the biggest chokes in grand slam history. Instead of winning in five sets, Djokovic could have won in three in the pair's 35th meeting and first in a grand slam final since the 2007 US Open. Ultimately, Djokovic also prevented Federer -- a month away from his 33rd birthday -- from becoming the oldest men's Wimbledon champion in the Open Era and claiming a record-extending 18th major. When Federer broke back early in the fourth set, Djokovic was dragged into another dogfight. Consistently in Federer's service games in the first, Djokovic nonetheless fell behind 3-0 in the tiebreak.
