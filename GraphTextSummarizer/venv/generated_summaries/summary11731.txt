Liam Neeson's "Taken 2" kicked its way back into the top slot for a second weekend with an estimated $22.5 million, and Ben Affleck's political thriller "Argo" and the Ethan Hawke horror flick "Sinister" were close second and third, respectively. While "Taken 2" continues to outpace the 2009 original — after 10 days, it's notched $86.8 million, in comparison to Taken's $53.6 million total in the same time frame — it still dropped a hefty 54.6 percent from its astounding $49.5 million opening weekend. The one-two-three punch helped boost the box office to a fabulous 47 percent gain over the same weekend in 2011, when "Real Steel" slugged its way to a second No. 1 finish. And the drama "Middle of Nowhere" — which won director Ava DuVernay the best director award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival — opened in six theaters to a healthy $13,000 per location average. The meta crime comedy "Seven Psychopaths," meanwhile, landed in ninth place, with a mere $4.3 million in 1,480 theaters for an unfortunate $2,889 per location average.
