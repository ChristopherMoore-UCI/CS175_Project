-- British world champion Amir Khan retained his World Boxing Association (WBA) light-welterweight title on Saturday night with a clinical stopppage victory over challenger Paulie Malignaggi at Madison Square Garden, New York. Khan, who was ahead on all three of the judges scorecards when the referee stopped the fight one minute and 25 seconds into the round, improves his record to 23-1, while Malignaggi -- who lost to Khan's compatriot Ricky Hatton in 2008 -- was slumping to the fourth defeat of his career. The 23-year-old Khan, who was making his big-fight debut on American soil, impressed throughtout with his speed and power before eventually stopping his opponent in the 11th round of the 12-round contest. Former Olympic silver medallist Khan told ESPN: "I'm making 140lb easy, I feel strong. " "We stuck to the game plan, we knew Paulie is a very awkward fighter, he's a great boxer, great at moving.
