Mitchell's improper extrajudicial communication with Dr. Lewis, then the trial court shall grant Mr. Smith a new trial," the Supreme Court ruled, referring to the juror by name, as well as Dr. Adele Lewis, the medical examiner who testified. The state court also said trial courts need to "give jurors specific, understandable instructions that prohibit extrajudicial communications with third parties and the use of technology to obtain facts that have not been presented as evidence. Conversations between jurors and people involved in a case have long been forbidden in state law. After the jury was set, jurors were told by the judge they "should not talk with any witnesses, defendants or attorneys involved in this case." Testimony followed, including from Smith's cousin, who said the defendant told her a pistol "went off" while he and Villanueva were arguing and again when Smith was trying to move Villanueva's body. Smith went on trial in March 2010.
