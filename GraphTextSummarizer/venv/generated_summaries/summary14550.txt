The Democratic sources also said that Obama's campaign focus, which positions him as champion of working Americans, made one of Daley's roles -- improving White House relations with the business community -- a lesser priority. -- President Barack Obama announced Monday that White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley is stepping down and will be replaced by Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew. Obama asked Daley to reconsider, but Daley decided to resign and recommended Lew as his successor, the president said. The chief of staff is in charge of White House staff and operations and is a senior adviser to the president. In particular, the aide said, relations grew tense after Obama tried to cut a major deficit reduction agreement with U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and congressional Democrats learned of it by reading about it in the news media.
