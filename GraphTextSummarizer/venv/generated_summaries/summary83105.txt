Fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and various rebel battalions destroyed several tanks and killed a number of regime soldiers as they fought for control of the Menagh air base, the Observatory said. Syria was high on the agenda in a meeting Friday between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and their Russian counterparts, Sergey Lavrov and Sergey Shoygu. A day earlier, the Observatory reported that Syrian rebels and an al Qaeda-affiliated group had captured a government air base near the key city of Aleppo. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said that Al-Nusra Front "terrorists" had been ambushed and killed in the same region and that non-Syrian fighters were among the dead. The Islamic State of Iraq is the rebranded name for al Qaeda in Iraq.
