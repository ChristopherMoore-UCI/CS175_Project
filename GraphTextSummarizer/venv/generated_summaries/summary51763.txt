A spokesman for Lebanon's powerful Mikdad clan said the Turk and 45 Syrians were abducted in response to the Free Syrian Army's abduction of Hassan al-Mikdad in mid-August. -- A Turkish hostage was released in Lebanon Tuesday following negotiations between officials and the powerful clan that had been holding him. The businessman's kidnapping was a high-profile example of how the Syrian conflict has been seeping into Lebanon, sparking concern across the nation and in other countries. "We wanted to put pressure by kidnapping people," family spokesman Maher al-Mikdad said Tuesday. Aydin Tufan Tekin appeared on local Lebanese TV shortly after he was released to the country's Interior Ministry.
