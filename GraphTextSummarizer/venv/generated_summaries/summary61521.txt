-- Legendary India batsman Sachin Tendulkar created yet another piece of cricket history on Tuesday, becoming the first player to score 15,000 Test match runs. The 38-year-old will be hoping to pass another landmark figure in the final two days of the Delhi contest and become the first player to score 100 centuries in international cricket. Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan is the only bowler to have taken more Test wickets than Warne with 800. Warne took 708 Test wickets during a 15-year career before initially retiring from cricket in 2007, only to return to play for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. "This is something that I'm passionate about, it's something that I think is unique to Australian cricket, it's city-based cricket teams, it's something new and that's what sort of enticed me," the 42-year-old told Cricket Australia's website.
