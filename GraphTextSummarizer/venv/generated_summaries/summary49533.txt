I saw Marines approach problems in Afghanistan as though they were characters in that novel -- or Peace Corps volunteers. Peace Corps service is largely an individual effort, and volunteers can go for months without being heard from by staff. While nation-building under fire certainly isn't a Peace Corps mission, I saw enterprising Peace Corps volunteers make a deep impact on the communities where they were invited to serve. The essence of the Peace Corps mission is to promote understanding between American volunteers and the people they serve. Peace Corps training includes learning to teach kids simple science experiments.
