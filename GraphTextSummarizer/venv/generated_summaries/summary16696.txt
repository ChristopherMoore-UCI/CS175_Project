The director Next Model Management, the agency who signed Lohan, told CNN Monday she could "confirm that Aliana Lohan has not had any surgery." "As a young girl who is growing up, it's natural for her facial features to change slightly, and we see this with many of the younger models we represent," Alexis Borges said. " Honig, in a written statement to CNN, said Lohan, who recently signed a modeling contract, has no reason to have plastic surgery. Recent photos of Lindsay Lohan's teenage sister sparked online speculation over the past week that the 17-year-old Ali Lohan changed her face, which her publicist denied Monday. Buzz about apparent changes in Lohan's face started on websites including Hollywoodlife.com, which said, "We love Lindsay's little sister, but these shocking photos make it look like her beauty is not all-natural! "Aliana has never had any type of plastic surgery in her life, nor has she ever considered it," said her publicist, Steve Honig.
