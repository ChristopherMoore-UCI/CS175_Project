Fatah leadership has had a great deal of support from the West and has been warned over the years not to join hands with militant Hamas, which several countries have deemed a terrorist organization. In advance of the rally there also was bickering between Fatah and Hamas over whether Hamas would allow Fatah supporters to gather in a large space that was highly visible. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians gathered in Gaza in a show of support for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah Party on Friday, the 48th anniversary of the party's founding. High-level Fatah Party officials also showed up for the event after entering Gaza for the first time since being ousted by Hamas. That is the year Hamas seized control of Gaza from Fatah, which now controls only the West Bank.
