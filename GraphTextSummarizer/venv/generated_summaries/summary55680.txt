-- New York City officials are proposing banning the sale of large-size sodas and other sugary beverages at restaurants and food carts. The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, in a brief last August, said sugar drinks "have been linked to poor diet quality, weight gain, obesity, and, in adults, type 2 diabetes. The New York City Health Department commissioner, Dr. Tom Farley, tweeted, "Big sugary drinks are major contributor to obesity epidemic. "The single largest driver of these alarming increases in obesity is sugary drinks, which have grown in size," the statement said. While the consumption of sugary drinks contributes to obesity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not name a single largest cause nationally.
