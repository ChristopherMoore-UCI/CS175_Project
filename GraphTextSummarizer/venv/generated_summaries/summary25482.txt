Both have major trade deals with Syria, and again Friday they refused to condemn al-Assad's regime formally by voting against a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution that condemns "appalling human rights violations in Syria." Friday's protests were promoted on Facebook, and they come a day after an al Qaeda-linked website posted a statement from a group calling itself Jabhat al-Nasra claiming responsibility for a recent bombing in Damascus. The United States, the EU, the Arab League, Turkey and Japan have already slapped sanctions on Syria in an effort to deflate al-Assad's ability to finance attacks on his own people. The women, among a dozen Syrians added to the sanctions list, are also banned from travel to EU nations, although London-born Asma al-Assad cannot be barred entry into Britain despite the EU ban. The European Union imposed fresh sanctions Friday on Bashar al-Assad's inner circle as the familiar sounds of gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria.
