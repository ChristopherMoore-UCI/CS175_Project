-- Brazilians are mourning the death of legendary soccer player and political activist Socrates, who died Sunday of septic shock due to an intestinal infection. Juca Kfouri, one of Brazil's most popular soccer columnists who knew Socrates well, said in his blog for Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper that Socrates had genius in his heels. Socrates, a rare picture of a politicized athlete, marched with trade unionists, artists and athletes to defy the military junta ruling Brazil with an iron fist, persecuting, jailing and often torturing many political dissidents. The Sao Paulo-based Corinthians football club, one of Brazil's heavyweight teams, was a launching pad where Socrates made his name. The man known as "Doctor Socrates," "Golden Feet" and "Big Skinny" is considered by the international football organization FIFA as one of the 100 greatest players of all time.
