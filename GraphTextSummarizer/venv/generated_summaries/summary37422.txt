-- Veteran infielder Miguel Tejada -- a former American League MVP -- has run afoul of Major League Baseball over the issue of prohibited drugs. But as he's bounced around the big leagues since then -- including stops in Baltimore, Houston and San Francisco, before landing with Kansas City before this season -- Tejada also has been dogged by performance-enhancing drug questions. Fast Facts: Performance Enhancing Drugs in sports Tejada told ESPNDeportes.com -- according to that website, which is tied to ESPN -- that the positive test stems from his use of Adderall, which he took for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Saturday's suspension comes in the wake of a large group of suspensions affecting players such as Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun tied to performance-enhancing drugs out of Biogenesis, a now shuttered south Florida clinic. Tejada tested positive for an amphetamine, the league said in a press release.
