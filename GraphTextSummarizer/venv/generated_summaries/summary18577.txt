A New York family's hope for an enjoyable outing high atop Manhattan ended abruptly when the group was escorted out of the Empire State Building for saying Muslim prayers, according to a lawsuit. Fahad Tirmizi, his wife, Amina, and their two young children were at the skyscraper's observation deck last July 2 shortly after 11 p.m., a time when the family's "religious beliefs require them to recite the evening prayers wherever they may be at the time," according to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan District Court on Tuesday. In play are two First Amendment rights: freedom of speech and freedom of religion. In response, an Empire State Realty Trust spokeswoman, Brandy Bergman, told CNN Wednesday, "The claims are totally without merit and we will respond to them in court. We hope that Hines investigates the extent to which security guards are expected to censor religious speech.
