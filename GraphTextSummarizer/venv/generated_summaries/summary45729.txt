Personalization isn't something new -- iGoogle, Gmail and other Google products offer this type of feature already. The new feature immediately reminds us of Bing, Microsoft's upstart search engine. The announcement, written by Google VP of Search Products Marissa Mayer, doesn't go into much detail as to why Google decided to add this feature. A new link on the bottom left-hand corner of Google.com will soon appear for all users that will give them the ability to change their search background. If all of that white space bothers you, your prayers have been answered: Now you can customize your background on Google.com.
