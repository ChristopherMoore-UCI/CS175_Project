"But it's hard for players to switch surfaces. Switzerland's Federer says the tournament should remain on an indoor hard court but Spaniard Nadal wants it played outdoors and on surfaces including his preferred clay. In an interview with CNN last week, Andre Silva, tournament director of the World Tour Finals and the ATP's chief player officer, said changing surfaces would make for an "interesting concept" but presented some problems. Federer and his attacking game flourish under a roof -- he was unbeaten on indoor hard courts for two years from late 2010 -- and the 17-time grand slam winner boasts a career winning ratio of over 80% when playing inside. "I know it's not going to happen for my generation," Nadal, who stepped down as vice-president of the players council last year, told reporters on Monday.
