Last May, Kayobotsi swapped business suits for casual clothes, and strategic pitches for delicious pastries as he decided to go into business on his own, opening up Brioche, a high-end bakery and coffee shop in Kigali, the bustling capital of Rwanda with some one million residents. Having worked at Deloitte, the African Development Bank and even as an adviser to the president of Rwanda, Kayobotsi's illustrious career had taken him to Europe, Latin America and Africa. "This is the first of many boutiques we want to spread across Rwanda, the region, and Africa," says Kayobotsi.

"I am a firm believer that Africa -- and Rwanda -- is in no need of aid or government programs but of private sector investments," he says.
