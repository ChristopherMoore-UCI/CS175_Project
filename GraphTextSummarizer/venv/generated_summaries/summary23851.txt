-- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that "we will not surrender," even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his compound in Tripoli. "I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me," Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television. Earlier in the day, NATO targeted a military base and Gadhafi's compound, state television reported. This week, the Libyan government said it had evidence that alliance airstrikes were harming civilians. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking Tuesday to British lawmakers, said the European Union has added six additional ports controlled by pro-Gadhafi forces to its sanctions list in an effort to starve Gadhafi's troops of military supplies.
