According to the government website Thaiflood.com, water from northern Thailand has finally reached lower parts of central Thailand, penetrating dykes in Pathumthani and Nonthaburi provinces and flooding outer areas of Bangkok, including the market in Nonthaburi and Chiang Rang road. In Bangkok officials beefed up flood prevention measures as waterways, including the main Chao Phraya River, became bloated by rising water. In addition, three new flood-prevention walls were being built at two locations in Rangsit, in northern Bangkok, and in Taling Chan, in the western part of the city. Multiple tropical weather systems have moved over the region in recent weeks, enhancing monsoon rains and leading to the flooding. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said plans were in place to evacuate people from nine areas, mainly in eastern Bangkok, if needed.
