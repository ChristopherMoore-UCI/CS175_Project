And as he had done at comedy clubs, Williams excelled in roles in films such as "Good Morning, Vietnam" and "Dead Poets Society." As a teen, Williams moved to Northern California's Marin County -- attending high school and college there before enrolling at New York's prestigious Juilliard School for performing arts. The character debuted on the sit-com "Happy Days," whose star Henry Winkler "realized I was in the presence of greatness" during Williams' first rehearsal. For all the admiration of his talents, other actors remembering Williams tended to talk first about his huge heart, as the type of person who made you feel special, made you feel loved and made you laugh. Chubby and sometimes bullied, Williams laid low growing up -- the latter being expected in his family, Williams told People in a 2009 interview, even if it's opposite of the bigger-than-life persona he'd cultivate through his career.
