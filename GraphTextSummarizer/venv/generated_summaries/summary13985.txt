A statement on the space agency's Rosetta blog says landing site "J" was chosen due to its "scientific potential" while posing less risk to Rosetta's lander module Philae compared to other possible sites. Project leaders had to find a landing site that avoids large surface hazards and allows Philae to continue to communicate with Rosetta. Before the prime landing site was chosen, Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor also explained that power was a crucial consideration. 3D animation: See how Rosetta met the comet "We will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site, giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition, structure and evolution of a comet," said a lead lander scientist Jean-Pierre Bibring on ESA's Rosetta website.
