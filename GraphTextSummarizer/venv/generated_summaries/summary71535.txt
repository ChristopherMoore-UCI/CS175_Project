Dr. William H. Cosby, Inc. Cosby had many achievements after "I Spy" ended its run. "Before Obama, There Was Bill Cosby," headlined a story in The New York Times in describing the "Cosby Effect." The Huxtable home in Brooklyn Heights also featured paintings by black artists -- an extension of a love of art by Cosby and his wife, Camille -- and even made colorful sweaters a thing. "He was the entertainer who helped black people and white people -- but beyond that, all people -- see that they had more in common than they had differences," says Whitaker. A "Cosby" spinoff, "A Different World," "created an explosion in applications, enrollment and graduation rates at black colleges," wrote HBCUDigest.com's Jarrett L. Carter.
