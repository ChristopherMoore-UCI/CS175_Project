Looking at night images, citizen scientists can tap their knowledge of local geography to match photos with positions on maps. Via The Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth, NASA is making available images ranging from the Mercury missions of the 1960s to photos recently snapped from the International Space Station. The "open atlas of nighttime images" can be used to assess economic conditions, Sanchez said. The hope, NASA says, is that the images "could help save energy, contribute to better human health and safety and improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. This is the trickiest, as it aims to identify cities in photos with 310-mile circumferences.
