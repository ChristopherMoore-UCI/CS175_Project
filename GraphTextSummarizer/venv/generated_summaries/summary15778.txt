Fort Carson chief of media Dani Johnson declined to elaborate Friday on the type of property allegedly removed. The property purportedly missing was from that unit, and base authorities searched outgoing vehicles Thursday to make sure property was not being removed from the base, the affiliate reported. -- The nation's oldest Army armor unit at Fort Carson in Colorado remained in lockdown for a second day Friday, after the post began investigating "the unauthorized removal of government property," the military said. The measure means that soldiers remain on-duty working on the base instead of being allowed to go home, CNN affiliate KKTV reported. Between 500 to 750 soldiers are affected "at most" at the 26,000-soldier installation near Colorado Springs, Johnson said.
