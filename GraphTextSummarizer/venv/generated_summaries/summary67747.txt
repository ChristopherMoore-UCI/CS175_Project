"They will give you objective feedback, and the things you often take for granted, other people will see very clearly." Guy Longshaw, an executive coach and management consultant, recommends strengths tests drawn from "positive psychology," a movement whose founders sought to "find and nurture genius and talent" by encouraging people to identify their strengths and play to them. While a little self-knowledge can go a long way, it is common for executives to be in the dark as to their own strengths and weaknesses. "I am a full believer that the first thing you do in a leadership role is to identify your own strengths and play to them," says Sheryl G Feinstein, co-author of "The Brain and Strengths Based School Leadership. " Sean McPheat, managing director of MTD Training, says the old conventional wisdom about strengths and vulnerabilities no longer applies. "Perhaps you have strengths in organization but are weaker when it comes to vision, to building relationships," says Feinstein.
