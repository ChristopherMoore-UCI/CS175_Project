"On behalf of the Gandolfini family, I would like to thank the Italian authorities for all of the assistance they have rendered in expediting the formalities necessary to repatriate James Gandolfini's remains to the United States," Kobold said. Gandolfini was in Italy to receive an award at the Taormina Film Fest in the Sicilian town of Taormina. -- The funeral service for "Sopranos" actor James Gandolfini will be held Thursday in Manhattan, a family friend told CNN on Sunday. Hotel staff broke down the door to get to him and called an ambulance, said Tiziana Rocca, head of a film festival the actor was planning to attend. The 51-year-old actor arrived in Rome with his son, Michael Gandolfini, a day before he died.
