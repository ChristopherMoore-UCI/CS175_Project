Trapped in a gunfight: CNN producer's harrowing account Protests delay elections in Bangkok district 10 questions: What's behind the protests in Thailand? -- After disrupting a national election, anti-government demonstrators in Thailand have vowed to keep up their campaign against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The anti-government movement draws it support from southern Thailand, Bangkok's middle class and the established elites. The demonstrators have been protesting since November, saying they want to rid Thailand of the influence of Yingluck and her older brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in exile. In Laksi, a Bangkok district of mixed pro- and anti-government sentiment, gunfire erupted Saturday between masked men amid demonstrations against the elections, witnesses said.
