She wants her Facebook page encourage airlines "to publicly post their explicitly clear pro-breastfeeding/pumping policies inside every airplane so the rules are not left to interpretation by an airline employee, and in turn harass/shame/bully a mother." United, Delta and other major U.S. airlines say breastfeeding is allowed on their aircraft, although United doesn't post its policy on the airline website. United Airlines spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm said that the airline reached out to Hilderman on Monday night via Twitter and that airline officials "look forward to speaking more with her and to our crew member to understand what happened. "As a result, airlines faced little pressure to improve and pave a better way for mothers and children." Though you can't please everyone in the air, women are allowed to breastfeed in flight, says veteran flight attendant and author Heather Poole, who is also a mother. Hilderman was feeding her 5-month-old son on board United Airlines Flight 438 as the aircraft taxied along the runway before taking off from Houston to Vancouver.
