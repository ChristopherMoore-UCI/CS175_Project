Shaffee Abdullah, the same UMNO lawyer brought into as a special prosecutor in Anwar's case also serves as Malaysia's representative to the regional human rights body, the ASEAN Inter-governmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR), and asserts how he has prevented any discussions of LGBT rights there. Malaysia is also a key partner in the US-driven Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade proposal that has gone to the top of the Obama legislative agenda, and it was Prime Minister Najib Razak who President Obama invited for a round of golf in Hawaii during the president's Christmas holiday. Watching from the observers' gallery last week, I could see Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim moving from hope, to exasperation and then finally to anger as the country's highest court dismissed his defense team's arguments against his sodomy conviction. Anwar's conviction last week may be a new low for the Malaysia government's rights record, but it should not be seen in isolation from the growing intolerance for civil and political rights emanating from Putrajaya. But there is huge gap between Malaysia's international engagements as a so-called "moderate" Muslim-majority nation and its domestic repression of opponents that sadly doesn't usually garner much attention -- except in instances when Malaysia imprisons a figure like Anwar who is widely respected and known internationally.
