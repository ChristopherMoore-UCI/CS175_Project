Tsarnaev's lawyers said they had not had a chance to review the many pieces of physical evidence, "including nearly 2,000 items that reportedly are still being analyzed by the FBI and items kept at additional locations." Judy Clarke,Tsarnaev's lead attorney, said "meeting the trial date will be impossible." Prosecutors to seek death penalty Prosecutors said they estimate the trial would last approximately 12 weeks. Rebuffing his lawyers' request, a federal judge has set the trial date for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for November 3. Federal prosecutors said last month they'll seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in "an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner" and lacks remorse. If Tsarnaev is found guilty, prosecutors expect the sentencing hearing would last approximately six weeks.
