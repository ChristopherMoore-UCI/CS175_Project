Shannon said the reports that she's dating McDaniel are "totally untrue" but confirmed that "as of right now, there will be no more production of the show." Speculation that "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" was headed for cancellation began Thursday, when some outlets reported that the show's future was in jeopardy because of Shannon's alleged relationship with McDaniel. " TLC began "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" in August 2012 as a spinoff of its child pageant reality show, "Toddlers & Tiaras." Alana Thompson was one of "Tiaras' " breakout stars, and "Honey Boo Boo" was launched to follow the spunky kid and her family at their Georgia home. TLC's "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" is ending its run. On Friday, TMZ reported that the network has canceled the series in light of claims that the program's newly separated matriarch, June "Mama June" Shannon, is dating Mark Anthony McDaniel, a man who served 10 years in prison after being convicted of aggravated child molestation in 2004 and who is a registered sex offender.
