I've been flying everything from light propeller planes to big jets for more than 30 years, and I've aimed for the wrong runway three times and a really big taxiway on a different occasion. To make matters more hair-raising, the 737 touched down on a relatively short runway even for light planes, never mind for airliners. When pilots see what they believe is the right runway, they're going to land there unless some big alarm goes off in their head. Modern airliners have two things going for them â€” great brakes and powerful reverse thrusters â€” and in the case of both the 737 and the 747 before it, it was a good thing they did. The problem is there are two distinct modes of operating an airplane, by reference to the instruments and by visual reference.
