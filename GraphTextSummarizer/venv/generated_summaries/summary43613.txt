Watch destruction in Floyd County Â» Bonnie -- whom everyone called Mrs. Bonnie -- was a retired veterinarian's assistant. I had been looking for a white female one, but Mrs. Bonnie would have none of that. Bonnie died, thrown 50 feet from her home as her husband, Michael, cried out her name, their neighbors Joe and Jamie Wheeler said. He spent hours making ornate clocks that decorated their home, and many more helping his wife oblige the physical rigors of taking care of dozens of animals. There was just simply no one better to turn to than the eccentric grandmother who loved animals so much that her 86-acre North Georgia farm was home to donkeys, goats, high-priced show dogs and even a few wayward deer.
