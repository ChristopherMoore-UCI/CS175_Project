-- Hosts Argentina needed a stunning late strike from substitute Sergio Aguero to salvage a 1-1 draw against Bolivia in the Copa America opener Friday night. Argentina could not break down the underdogs in the first half and just two minutes after the break it was Bolivia who took a shock lead as Edivaldo Rojas backheeled a corner past Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero. Aguero had a late chance to give the hosts an undeserved win but Bolivia goalkeeper Carlos Arias saved smartly. But Bolivia played to the standard that had seen them humiliate Argentina 6-1 in the high altitude of La Paz during the last round of World Cup qualifying. Argentina's arch-rivals Brazil will be looking to win their fifth Copa America title in six and open against Venezuela on Sunday.
