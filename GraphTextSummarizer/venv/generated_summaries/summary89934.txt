So I came with my crew, ready to roll, even an uplifting title in mind: "Detroit Hustles Harder." But it's also said liberally by young men and women who have been hearing about Detroit's good old days from their parents and grandparents. Although we did indeed encounter a small gang of young creative types and revitalization efforts inside Detroit's small Midtown area, beyond these few blocks of hope we found a citizenry fending entirely for itself. This burden of the past haunts even the 20-something Crystal Starr, who spends her time off prowling through abandoned buildings, flashlight in one hand and a book about Detroit's history in the other. And across town, there was David, who turned down an easy life in California to run the Detroit Opera House.
