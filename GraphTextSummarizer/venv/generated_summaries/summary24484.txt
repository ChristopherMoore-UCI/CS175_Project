Czech Republic midfielder Pavel Nedved has spent almost 15 years at the top of European football. 1 Pavel Nedved (Czech Republic) Nedved, who has announced his retirement at the end of the season, has become Mr. Czech Republic in the eyes of football fans of the last 20 years. Rennes spotted him playing for Sparta Prague while he was still a teenager in 2002 and two years later moneybags Chelsea spent $10M on him -- a fee that now looks like a bargain. After helping Chelsea to back-to-back Premier League titles, Cech fractured his skull in 2006, but he has returned -- headgear and all -- just as good. His touch, vision, movement, skill, strength and goal scoring prowess made it seem likely he would move on to a more successful club.
