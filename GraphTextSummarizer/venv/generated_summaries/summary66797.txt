CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr previously reported that U.S. troops would remain in Jordan beyond the training exercises that concluded Thursday. A senior U.S. military official told Starr that F-16 fighter jets "send a message" to Syria that the United States will defend Jordan if necessary. Senior U.S. officials have said there was continuing concern that eventually some type of military units will be needed to go into Syria to take control of chemical weapons stockpiles. "The deployment of this detachment has been directed in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, including the important national interests in supporting the security of Jordan and promoting regional stability, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations," Obama's letter said. The Patriot missiles would be used to defend Jordan against any missiles launched from Syria, according to Starr's report.
