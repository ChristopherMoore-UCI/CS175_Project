"Everything is going a little bit better than anticipated," Laurence Golborne told CNN about the three holes -- dubbed Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C -- being dug in an effort to open a passageway to safety for the men. " He added, "So, we're optimistic we will comply with our target date at the beginning of November and, if everything stays on path and we have no big problems, then it could be earlier." Plan A and Plan B each require two holes to be drilled -- a small hole first and then a wider one about 26 to 28 inches (65-70 centimeters) in diameter. According to Golborne, the first stage of drilling on Plan B has reached a depth of 1,640 feet (500 meters) and will pierce the ceiling of the mine shaft where the men are trapped this weekend. Golborne said the second pass would be slower progress than the first pass. Drilling under Plan A will stop this weekend once the drill bit reaches 1,247 feet (380 meters), then the drill will receive scheduled maintenance before resuming early next week, engineer Rene Aguilar said.
