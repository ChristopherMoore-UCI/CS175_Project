The vice president of Iraq -- the country's top Sunni politician -- pleaded for calm Monday following his death sentence in absentia, while lashing out at Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki over what he described as a politically motivated case. As late as July, the U.N. Security Council called on Iraq to carry out long-postponed political reconciliation talks, saying all sides need to refrain from making statements that could aggravate tensions over efforts to push for inclusive political talks and national reconciliation in Iraq. "The verdict is unjust, political and illegitimate and I will not acknowledge it," al-Hashimi told reporters in Ankara, Turkey, where he has been living since fleeing Iraq five months ago. The timing of al-Hashimi's death sentence also threatens to upend Iraq's fragile power-sharing agreement that has been mired for more than a year in political infighting. The fallout over the death sentence handed down to Tariq al-Hashimi has generated a political split along sectarian lines in Iraq, raising fears the conflict will translate into violence in the streets.
