Karzai has been forging reconciliation efforts to seek peace with Taliban members and end the nine-year-old Afghan war. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been in talks with high-level Taliban members, but the effort has failed to yield "practical reconciliation" or the "resolution of many issues," a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. This week, political figures from Pakistan and Afghanistan sat down in Kabul for talks in what one Afghan official called a "new phase" in building bridges and making peace with the Taliban. Peace negotiations would not happen until the Afghan government met the Taliban's precondition to withdraw foreign forces from the country, the spokesman said. A Taliban spokesman has told CNN that the group was not interested in peace talks.
