-- Three U.S. Army soldiers have received reprimands for misconduct in a prostitution scandal involving the U.S. Secret Service and other federal agents in Cartagena, Colombia, in April, the military said on Friday. Two members of the Navy refused non-judicial punishment and are awaiting court-martial, Southern Command said. The soldiers are among 12 service members who brought prostitutes to hotel rooms just prior to a visit by President Barack Obama to the city for the Summit of the Americas. But the news that some Secret Service agents were drinking heavily and taking prostitutes back to their hotel rooms raised security concerns and tarnished the reputation of the agency. All three soldiers received letters of reprimand for their actions, U.S. Southern Command said.
