On April 11, the cruise line's Crown Princess was on a seven-day Caribbean cruise when a blockage within the ship's vacuum toilet system rendered 410 stateroom toilets inoperable from 5 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., according to Princess Cruises spokeswoman Karen Candy. This time, Carnival Corp. subsidiary Princess Cruises had passengers feeling the impact of toilets that wouldn't flush. "Toilet problems can happen on any ship when passengers flush the wrong things down the toilet," wrote member Astro Flyer, who was not aboard the Crown Princess. In February, an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, with passengers reporting overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship. The ship's itinerary wasn't affected by the flushing problems, and affected passengers were offered $50 apiece in compensation, Candy wrote.
