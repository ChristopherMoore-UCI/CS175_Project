The seizure by American Navy SEALs of multiple thumb drives, storage devices and hard drives full of data raise questions about whether bin Laden was continuing to receive information about al Qaeda operations and whether he was in turn passing on instructions through couriers. While bin Laden's charisma inspired a generation of recruits, al-Zawahiri is a self-styled intellectual whose long-winded video and audiotapes must be tedious to even the most committed of al Qaeda members and whose arrogance has alienated many in al Qaeda ranks over the years. Benotman, who was in touch at the time with Libyan fighters in Gardez, said that no sooner had the group reached the safety of the town than infighting broke out among Egyptians, Saudis, Uzbeks and Libyans, and between al Qaeda members and fighters from other groups, over who should assume command. Though al-Awlaki has emerged as a powerful charismatic preacher for bin Laden's cause and an important figure within al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, he possesses none of the combat track record that al Qaeda members over the years have so prized in their leaders. The challenge that al-Zawahiri now faces in keeping al Qaeda from fracturing were demonstrated the last time al Qaeda fighters feared their leader may have been killed.
