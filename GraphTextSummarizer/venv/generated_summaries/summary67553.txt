Forecasters expect Rick to lose some of its punch as it curves northeast toward southern Baja, California, and then toward mainland Mexico later in the week, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. A satellite image shows Hurricane Rick in the Pacific, bearing down on the southern tip of Baja California. Hurricane Rick weakened Sunday as it churned up Pacific waters on its track to strike Mexico later in the week. Rick remained a Category 5 hurricane with its center about 450 miles (725 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Forecast models show that Rick could make landfall on the tip of Baja California by Wednesday morning.
