Curtis had been accused of sending letters containing "a suspicious granular substance" to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi. "It looked like a scene out of a movie," said Curtis, adding that there were hooded men with machine guns. What did I do?'" Curtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, said her client has been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media. "It's like a train has been lifted off my shoulders," Curtis told CNN's "Piers Morgan Live" on Tuesday. Thrust into the headlines last week, accused of sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and two other officials, Paul Kevin Curtis is a free man again.
