Ledezma was "virtually kidnapped," Estacio said, calling it "a violation of the most fundamental principles of Venezuelan law and international law." Political chaos roiled oil-rich Venezuela Friday after intelligence agents in the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro arrested the mayor of Caracas. The accusations and the Caracas mayor's arrest come as opposition protesters mark the one-year anniversary of a wave of anti-government demonstrations that rocked Venezuela and led to the arrest of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. In a televised address, Maduro said Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma was captured by order of the Attorney General's Office. Ledezma denied it, calling it the government's latest attempt to manufacture controversy and target political opponents.
