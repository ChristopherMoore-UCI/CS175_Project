-- Serie A leaders AC Milan have agreed a deal to sign unsettled Italy international striker Antonio Cassano from Sampdoria in the January transfer window. Rafa Benitez's old tricks backfire in Italy Neither club has confirmed the deal yet, but Italian media reported that Cassano's contract will run until 2014 and that a â‚¬5 million sell-on clause due to his former Spanish team Real Madrid will now be divided between Milan, Sampdoria and the player. Italian news agency Ansa confirmed on Tuesday that the 28-year-old will finally be leaving the Genoa-based club following his highly-publicized row with Sampdoria owner Riccardo Garrone in October. Although Cassano cannot officially sign for Milan until next month, he can join his new team at their winter training camp in Dubai from December 27. Cassano joins an already star-studded attack which includes Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexandre Pato, Robinho and Ronaldinho, with speculation already mounting about the latter Brazilian's future following his failure to command a regular place at the San Siro this season.
