The infective form of Toxoplasma gondii deposited in cat poop are called oocysts; a single infected cat can deposit millions of oocysts, each of which may survive in moist soil for 18 months or longer. The pair on Tuesday published a paper on the dangers of Toxoplasma oocysts, which are found in cat poop, in the journal Trends in Parasitology. In no way have we established Toxoplasma gondii as a cause of these disorders, but it has led us to rethink the possible risks of cat poop. Keep in mind cats are no respecters of property lines so a neighbor's cat could deposit Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in your garden or children's play areas. It is true that some cat poop contains Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite for which cats and other felines are the definitive host.
