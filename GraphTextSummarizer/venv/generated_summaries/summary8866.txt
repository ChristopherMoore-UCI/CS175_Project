Once in the field, robots that enter nuclear hot zones aren't necessarily expected to make it back out, as contamination could render them unsafe for later. One such initiative comes from U.S. military contractor iRobot, which will help Japan's army incorporate robots into their recovery efforts. " In Japan, the PackBot will be outfitted with HazMat sensors and deployed in areas of nuclear uncertainty, such as the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, to search for chemical, biological or radiological anomalies. "Not every robot works in every situation," says iRobot Vice President Tim Trainer, "so they have to be configured appropriately. Because Japan's relief workers face massive piles of impenetrable rubble, the robots might also play a key role in general search-and-recovery efforts, as the PackBot did at New York City's ground zero in the aftermath of 9/11.
