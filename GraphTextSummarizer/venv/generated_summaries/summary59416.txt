"If you like what you see, over the next few days you'll be able to switch to the new look by clicking on Switch to the new look in the bottom-right of Gmail," writes Google user experience designer Jason Cornwell. Heavy Gmail users will also be pleased to learn that there's a new search function -- that is, you can now access Advanced Search by clicking on the search bar. The changes, officially announced in a blog post Tuesday, allow Gmail users much more control over the look of the service. The new-look Gmail that Google accidentally told us about last week is now rolling out to all users. These are more features than Google offered in its sneak peek of the new Gmail, which started in July.
