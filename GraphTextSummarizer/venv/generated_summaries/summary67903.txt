BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: U.S. and Afghan forces in the remote mountains of eastern Afghanistan. CAPTAIN JAMES HANZALIK, U.S. COAST GUARD: You can actually go in, you can trample oil into the marsh, where it would make it even worse than what it would have been if you would have just left it alone. The war in Afghanistan started in 2001 following the September 11th terrorist attacks on the U.S. A U.S.-led coalition removed Afghanistan's Taliban leaders from power. There are currently around 100,000 U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan. The U.S. is scheduled to start pulling some of those troops out of Afghanistan later this year.
