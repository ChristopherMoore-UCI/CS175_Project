My husband has been dead for 32 years and his voice was taken from him by Abu-Jamal," Faulkner told CNN in a phone interview. Goddard spokesperson Samantha Kolber told CNN, "We spoke with Mrs. Faulkner and expressed our deep sympathies, and while he felt for her loss we also felt the students had the freedom to listen to Mumia." This is the second speech Abu-Jamal has given for Goddard students. Thirty-two years ago Mumia Abu-Jamal, born Wesley Cook, was convicted of shooting and killing Faulkner's husband, Daniel Faulkner, a five-year veteran with the Philadelphia Police Department. " "He (Abu-Jamal) is a despicable, callous, dangerous man and people try to put him on a pedestal and make him into something he is not," said Faulkner.
