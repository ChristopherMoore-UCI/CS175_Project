And with the President of Guyana, Bharrat Jagdeo, committed to the idea of the international community intervening in forest life, in return for environmental protection and aid, the prospects for Canopy Capital so far look good. Mitchell, who combines his work at Canopy Capital and the GCP with research at Oxford University's Zoology Department, has been studying tropical forests -- in particular their canopy -- for 35 years. Last month, a deal was struck between London-based venture capital company, Canopy Capital and the Iwokrama International Center for Rainforest Conservation and Development (IIC) in Guyana, South America. Andrew Mitchell, Director of the Global Canopy Program (GCP) and a partner in Canopy Capital, says the deal is about; "creating a whole new paradigm for the way in which the world economy values the environment." The prize asset is the 370,000 hectares of the Iwokrama Reserve, which lies in the heart of the Guiana Shield -- a vast area of tropical forest which stretches over 2.5 million square kilometers across the north-east of South America, crossing six state borders.
