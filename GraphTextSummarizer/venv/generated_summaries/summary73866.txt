Sunday's fixtures see Liverpool take on West Brom, Manchester City travel to Sunderland, Aston Villa host Everton, while Bolton and Birmingham face each other at the Reebok Stadium. Goals in either half from Florent Malouda and Didier Drogba -- the Ivorian's fourth goal this season came from the penalty spot -- was enough to see off Stoke City and gives the English champions a two point lead at the top of the table after only three games. The result lifts Alex Ferguson's team to third in the table, level on points with Arsenal. Chelsea have maintained their 100 percent record in the English Premier League with a comfortable victory over Stoke City. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 victory over West Ham at Old Trafford.
