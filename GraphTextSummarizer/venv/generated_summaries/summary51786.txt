Why U.S. Ebola patients seem to be recovering faster In one section the memo says the U.S. has "an obligation to assist non-citizen employees and contractors of U.S. agencies and programs, as well as NGOs and private firms based in the U.S." State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki dismissed the memo on Wednesday as drafted by a "mid-level official, but not cleared by senior leaders." Saying there are "no plans" to transport non-Americans who contract Ebola in West Africa to the United States, Psaki said the U.S. has "discussed allowing other countries to use our medevac capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. "It's alarming that senior Obama Administration officials so vehemently denied the existence of any plans to transport non-U.S. citizens infected with Ebola to the United States for treatment when a leaked State Department document shows that such a proposal indeed exists and was approved by Obama Administration officials," Goodlatte said. But Congressional Republicans are seizing on an internal State Department memo outlining a possible joint State-Homeland Security department program to provide Ebola care at U.S. hospitals for non-Americans. The memo, obtained by CNN, is labeled "SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PREDECISIONAL" and drafted by State Department officials. " House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson last week asking if the Administration was developing any plans related to non-U.S. citizens, but complained on Wednesday he hasn't received a response yet.
