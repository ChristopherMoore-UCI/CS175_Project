Reports of military sex assault up sharply An Army investigation found that Harrison mishandled sex assault allegations reported to the command, Lt. Col. Alayne Conway said. Army Secretary John McHugh has directed that Maj. Gen. Michael T. Harrison "be retired" as a brigadier general, according to a statement. The Army said federal law requires that officers retire "at the highest grade" at which they served satisfactorily and McHugh determined that in Harrison's case, it was one step below his current rank, the statement said. -- A major general who formerly headed U.S. Army operations in Japan will be forced to retire and do so at a lower rank after the military concluded that he failed to "properly address" sexual assault allegations in his command, the Army said on Wednesday. Survivors of military sex assaults frustrated with legislation Under current guidelines, military commanders have the authority to decide whether their subordinates should face prosecution when such allegations emerge.
