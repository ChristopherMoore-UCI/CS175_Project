The DFB also confirmed that Low's backroom staff -- assistant Hansi Flick, goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke and team manager Oliver Bierhoff -- have signed new two-year deals. The former under-21 international has admitted that uncertainty over his future overshadowed last year's tournament in South Africa and said he wanted to avoid a repeat of that for the upcoming European competition. -- Germany coach Joachim Low has put an end to speculation over his future by signing a two-year contract extension which will keep him at the national side until after the 2014 World Cup. Low -- whose contract was originally due to expire after Euro 2012 --had been linked to the soon-to-be vacant position at Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, following the news that current boss Louis Van Gaal will step down from the role at the end of the season. Meanwhile, Bernd Schuster, the German coach of seventh-placed Turkish League club Besiktas has quit following the Istanbul-based side's string of poor results that has seen them claim just one win in their last seven matches.
