On the other hand, those seeking to delay the execution of Davis for reconsideration of the evidence promoted other virtues: deliberation and mercy. School prayer cases, for instance, sometimes balance two virtues reflected in the Constitution itself: The guarantee of free exercise of religion, and a bar on the establishment of a state religion. Other than the mention of capital punishment itself, it is hard to see much support in the Constitution for the virtue of finality. The Supreme Court has also repeatedly cited "finality of judgment" as an important value in cutting off appeals. The meaningful cases in law almost always involve a clash of virtues.
