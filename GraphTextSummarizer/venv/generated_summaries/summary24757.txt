-- Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano rumbled Saturday with explosions and expulsions of ash and gas, prompting authorities to bar people from getting close to a crater that is within sight of Mexico City and many of its 19 million residents. Last April, for instance, scientists observed a continuous column of water vapor and moderate amounts of ash rising from the crater. The country's National Center for Disaster Prevention reported that -- following 12 "low-intensity" emissions of a small amount of water vapor and gas -- there was "an exhalation with some explosive component" around 9 a.m. (10 a.m. ET). This was "followed by a spasmodic tremor ... with moderate to large amplitudes, which has been accompanied by a continuous emission of ... ash and water vapor," according to the government agency. Located in a national park southeast of Mexico City, Popocatepetl can be seen from there on a clear day.
