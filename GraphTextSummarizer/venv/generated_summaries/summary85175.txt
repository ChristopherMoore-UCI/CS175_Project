Amanda Bynes gets probation in DUI plea deal Last December, following her detainment for the mental health evaluation, Bynes was in custody of her parents in California. The 28-year-old actress was arrested on a DUI charge early Sunday morning in Sherman Oaks, California, Officer Juan Galvan with the California Highway Patrol confirmed to CNN. Bynes immediately pulled over for the highway patrol and according to police failed to pass a series of field sobriety tests. Her once controversial Twitter page -- where she posted photos in brightly colored wigs and professed her disdain for "ugly" people -- was most recently filled with sunny tweets about fashion and family vacations. She had earlier been charged with a DUI after an April 2012 inident in which Bynes' BMW allegedly sideswiped a police cruiser in West Hollywood.
