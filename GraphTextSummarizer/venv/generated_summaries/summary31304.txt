According to reports, Netflix is developing a small-screen version of the popular children's book series written by Daniel Handler, who crafted them under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The stories can be dark, but they're also engaging and humorous -- the kind of stuff that a family could enjoy together, said Netflix's Cindy Holland, vice president of original content. Paramount Television is producing this original series with Netflix, along with author Handler as the executive producer. We can't wait to bring it to life for Netflix members." Snicket, speaking from an "undisclosed location," told The Hollywood Reporter that he couldn't believe the news. Audiences have seen Snicket's tales brought to life before with Paramount's 2004 live-action movie starring Jim Carrey, Jude Law and Meryl Streep.
