But there's been no sign of Stacy Peterson, the 23-year-old fourth wife of former Bolingbrook police sergeant Drew Peterson. Stacy Peterson disappeared on October 28, 2007, and police consider her husband the prime suspect. But as Stacy Peterson's disappearance approaches the one-year mark, police seem no closer to solving the mystery than they were on October 28, 2007. Police confirm there was some activity on Stacy Peterson's cell phone around 9 p.m. on October 28, but her family and close friends say she would never leave her two children behind or go away without mentioning it to her family. In the days leading up to her disappearance, Stacy Peterson confided in friends and her sister.
