After more than 4,000 U.S. flights were delayed and 244 were canceled Sunday -- one of the busiest travel days of the year -- airports should be much less chaotic Monday. "This happens sometimes," Chicago Aviation Department spokeswoman Karen Pride said, according to CNN affiliate WLS. "It's going to take some time to catch up from this weather," airport spokeswoman Laura Coale told KMGH on Sunday. Air travelers Monday probably won't see a repeat of the enormous lines like one at Chicago Midway International Airport. As of early Monday morning, about 130 flights were delayed and 22 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com.
