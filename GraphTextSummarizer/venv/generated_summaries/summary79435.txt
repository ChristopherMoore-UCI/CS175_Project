-- Three times as many Asian-Americans have been running for Congress in 2012 than in the past two elections, a nonpartisan political group says, and it's a development that portends greater changes in demographic trends and reflects the recent political awakening of a minority group long confined to the margins of American society. "There's always been this question, 'How American are Asians?' " says Curtis Chin, board president of Asian Pacific Americans for Progress. " Rep. Michael Honda, D-California, is an Asian-American elected to Congress in 2001, and he agreed that some candidates try to leverage their opponents' perceived foreignness into electoral advantage. Honda is no stranger to anti-Asian sentiment in America. Their vote could prove crucial in some battleground states, where a growing and increasingly energized Asian-American voting bloc is realizing that -- at 6% of the population -- they have significant political clout.
