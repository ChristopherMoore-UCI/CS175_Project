In October, Fedotowsky downplayed rumors that their relationship was on the rocks, telling PEOPLE there were other reasons for putting their wedding plans on hold. "As they go through this difficult time, we ask that you respect the couple's privacy." The duo's romance unfolded in 2010 on season 6 of the reality show, culminating with a romantic seaside proposal on the season finale. "Ali Fedotowsky and Roberto Martinez have ended their relationship," the couple's rep tells PEOPLE. Sorry, "Bachelorette" fans: there will officially be no wedding for Ali and Roberto. We had a very short courtship and we only knew each other nine weeks before we got engaged," Fedotowsky said at the time.
