On Monday afternoon, a Piper PA-28 registered to a Federal Aviation Administration employee and a Beechcraft BE-35 owned by a National Transportation Safety Board employee collided in flight above Fauquier County, Virginia, authorities said. NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman consulted with FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta and requested the Transportation Safety Board of Canada investigate the incident, she said in a statement Tuesday. The midair collision of two small planes about 50 miles from Washington is under investigation by Canadian officials because one plane was owned by an FAA employee and the other by an NTSB employee, federal officials said Tuesday. "One plane has been destroyed by fire," Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said on Monday. The pilot and a passenger of the BE-35 were killed, but the owner and pilot of the PA-28 survived with injuries, authorities said.
