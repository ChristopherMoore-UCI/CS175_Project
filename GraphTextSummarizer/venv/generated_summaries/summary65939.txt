The defense claims the newest round of charges is part of the government's ongoing quest to convict Gotti. " Gotti's father, John Gotti Sr., was nicknamed the "Teflon Don" because prosecutors had trouble making charges against him stick. The government says it has learned since his previous trial, "that Gotti had participated in three murders, that Gotti had run a multi-million dollar cocaine trafficking network, that Gotti had overseen a systematic effort to tamper with trial juries, grand juries and witnesses, and that Gotti had participated in various other violent crimes," according to court documents filed by prosecutors. " The indictment alleges that Gotti was at times an "associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss" in the Gambino family, and also served on a "committee of captains" formed in the early 1990s to assist in family administration. -- The son of the late Gambino family crime boss John Gotti is set to stand trial in federal court in New York on Monday on murder and racketeering charges that could put him in prison for life if he is convicted.
