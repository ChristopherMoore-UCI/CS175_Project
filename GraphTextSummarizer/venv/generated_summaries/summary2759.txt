"Gov. Romney should be up and talking about this and really hammering it home, saying, 'Look, we're a nation of laws, we need to enforce our laws, and we can't let the president go around Congress and disregard how our legislative process is supposed to work,' " Quayle told Fox News on Monday night.

Mitt Romney spent the presidential primary campaign trying to convince conservatives of his right-wing credibility on immigration issues.
