Behind the scenes, it's been somewhat of a standoff between the CMAs and the Grammys, with each telecast vying for bragging rights to have Campbell perform. In November, he was the subject of a star-studded tribute at the CMA Awards show, and on Sunday night, he'll pick up a Lifetime Achievement trophy at the 54th annual Grammy Awards. Campbell's wife, Kim, watches serenely from the soundboard, knowing full-well that these incidents will occur from time to time. At the CMAs, Campbell beamed from the audience while Keith Urban, Brad Paisley and Vince Gill serenaded him with his biggest hits, but the Grammys will be a different story. -- Last June, Glen Campbell stunned fans when he revealed in a press release that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
