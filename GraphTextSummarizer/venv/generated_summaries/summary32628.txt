Both the company and the Japanese government have been criticized for failing to provide more detailed information about the situation at Fukushima Daiichi, one of three nuclear plants the company owns in northern Japan. " Yukuiya Amano, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, returned to his native Japan shortly after the crisis erupted to press Kan for more information. One critic is the Japanese government, which on Sunday pressed TEPCO for better information about the Fukushima Daiichi plant as it battled against criticism of its own handling of the crisis there. Tokyo Electric is Japan's largest utility. TEPCO representatives have held frequent press conferences since the March 11 earthquake triggered Japan's nuclear crisis.
