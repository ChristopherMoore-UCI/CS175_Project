She is set to sing at a free concert on Central Park's Great Lawn July 13, an event in association with Major League Baseball to benefit the Hurricane Sandy Relief. Carey dislocated her shoulder on Sunday while shooting her latest music promo for her single "#Beautiful" in New York City. " Despite her injury, it's rumored that Carey will still perform in upcoming shows. Then, after they put [her] shoulder back in place, bandaged her all up, she came back to the video early in the morning and finished out everything." Apparently when Carey went down she donned full diva attire.
