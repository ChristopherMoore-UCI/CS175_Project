Elin came across Los Angeles resident Nikki Renieris wearing a pineapple hat (unusual hats are prevalent at the Con) at an event for the TV series "Psych," and also interviewed cast members from "Lost Girl." Ryan "Agent M" Penagos from Marvel Comics gave Morrow the rundown on their oversized booth this year. Elin learned more about gaming at the Con from Konami's John Choon, and met Ksenia Solo from Syfy's popular "Lost Girl." Comic-Con spokesman David Glanzer discussed the past and future of the convention with Morrow. Another example of the random encounters at the Con comes from Lisa Hernke and Christiane Elin (who spoke to "Haven" fan Jon Allen from Riverside, California). From fans celebrating their favorite shows on Syfy, to the ever-growing phenomenon of cosplay, to the stars of the TV series "Impractical Jokers" talking about their favorite practical joke, Jack Black's cape, unusual hats, and yes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle stalking, here's a quick look at how the Con has evolved into a smorgasbord of pop culture. Andrew Garfield was in costume as Spider-Man for his panel on "Amazing Spider-Man 2." Women are driving the social media conversation at Comic-Con, according to a recent study, and have embraced cosplay more each year, as Morrow found in this series of short interviews.
