The amended law approved last year would permit five types of photo identification: a state-issued driver's license, a non-driver identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, military identification, a U.S. passport, or state voter registration card. Proponents say the drive is an effort to stop what officials contend is voter fraud and to purge voter rolls of outdated information. Federal officials cited figures that registered minority voters were about 20 percent more likely than white voters to lack state-issued photo identification. The Supreme Court in 2008 allowed Indiana's voter identification law to stand in 2008, saying the stated goal of stopping voter fraud was a legitimate exercise of legislative power. Obama administration officials have concluded there is little evidence of voter fraud in the state warranting the legislative changes.
