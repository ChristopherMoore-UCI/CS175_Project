"This new system will allow us to provide food assistance to more people, more quickly through a robust network of fixed distribution sites." CNN's Alec Miran contributed to this report. "Our long experience in food distribution tells us that by delivering food into the hands of women, it is more likely to be redistributed equitably among the household -- including the men," he said. Slightly more than 376 metric tons of rice were distributed to 100,368 people at nine locations during the day, World Food Programme spokesman Marcus Prior said. The food distribution plan, coordinated by the United Nations World Food Programme, international aid agencies and the Haitian government, was to hand out food at 16 identified points across the city. Ongoing emergency aid distributions to outlying areas will continue, Prior said.
