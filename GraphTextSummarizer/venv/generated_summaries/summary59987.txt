La Russa was the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals who, within days of guiding his team to victory in the World Series, announced that he was done. No manager before La Russa ever retired in the same calendar year his team won the Series. The Beatles stuck to their vow, and now, with John Lennon and George Harrison long dead, the vow is destined to last forever. It doesn't seem likely that he'll un-retire one more time, however briefly, to prove something to himself, but stranger things have happened. Somewhere today, someone at the very pinnacle of his or her career is thinking of doing in 2012 what Tony La Russa did in 2011: Get out on top.
