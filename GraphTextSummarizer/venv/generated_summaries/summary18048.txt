The Syrian Observatory's Rami Abdul Rahman said another 40 civilians were killed the same day "across Syria during house-to-house raids, arrests, and clashes between army defectors and the Syrian army." "Monday may have been a day with the highest death toll in Syria, between 100 and 110 killed in total," he said. "We need a safety zone to protect and prevent efforts by the regime to transform the crisis into a civil conflict." Five Arab League ministers drafted a resolution Saturday calling for the end of violence and approving an observer mission in Syria. -- Dozens more people were reported killed by government troops and police in Syria on Tuesday, a day after what opposition activists said was the single deadliest known day of anti-government protests. All had been shot to death by government forces, the group said. Monday's deaths came the same day that Syria signed an Arab League proposal aimed at ending the violence.
