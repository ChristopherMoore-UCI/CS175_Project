Some 200 firefighters battled the six-alarm blaze in Breezy Point, which was fed by high winds and made more perilous by downed electrical wires, according to witnesses and local authorities. People rescued from roofs of trailer homes in New Jersey "I'm not sure where to go from here besides calling the insurance company," said resident Richard Kohlbrecher. "I, along with many other Breezy Point residents, lost our homes last night and I am grateful that my family and I are safe after this destructive storm," Turner said. "The winds were just devastating, blowing from one building to another," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference. "There is nothing in this one cluster of homes," resident T.J. Gilmartin told CNN.
