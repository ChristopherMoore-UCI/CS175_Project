He added: "Whereas conservative leaning groups have so far mainly used their money to fund campaign advertising, the AFL-CIO and other unions have made it clear that their money will be spent on grass-roots get-out-the-vote activities." Indeed, Obama's campaign also realized it could benefit from super PAC money, despite the president's vocal opposition to the 2010 Supreme Court decision. "Once again, Governor Romney has fallen short of the standard that John McCain set, reacting tepidly in a moment that required moral leadership in standing up to the very extreme wing of his own party," Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said in a written statement. When McCain ran against Obama in 2008, the Republican nominee famously refrained from pursuing the Wright angle and called out supporters at campaign events who mocked Obama's middle name, "Hussein." -- Predictions of super PAC-fueled campaign ugliness seemed to come to reality on Thursday when reports broke of a potential conservative group's ad campaign aimed at tying President Barack Obama to a controversy many thought put to rest nearly four years ago. This cycle, super PACs have quickly become one of the defining markers of 2012, as the groups have played a pivotal role in doing the so-called dirty work for campaigns.
