In June, workers at the Toyota and Honda Motor plants in southern China went on strike, halting production and forcing pay hikes. "This is probably the most intense spike in worker activism since the wave of strikes that hit Chinese manufacturers in summer 2010," said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group that monitors labor issues in China. Workers can only turn to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a government-sanctioned organization whose primary mission is to support Communist party policies and seek basic compensation for workers. -- China's recent economic downturn is spurring a new wave of worker strikes, which experts say are the only effective channel for them to air their grievances. He Yuancheng, who works at the Laowei Law Firm, said workers typically go on strike due to lack of labor union or organizations that can genuinely represent their interests.
