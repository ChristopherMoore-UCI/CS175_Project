Devastated friends described Squires as a keen charity fundraiser who last month climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for the Royal Air Force Association "Claire was larger than life, fun-loving, bubbly, happy, cheerful, kind, giving, thoughtful. As news of Claire Squires' death spread across social media sites, so too did the link to her Just Giving fundraising page, sparking a flurry of donations reaching more than Â£400,000 ($650,000) and rising fast by Tuesday afternoon. "We desperately wish that it was not under these circumstances but we have been overwhelmed by the response from people donating in Claire's memory," she said. "These donations will be put into a tribute fund and, following discussions with the family, will go towards projects they feel would have been important to Claire." The 30-year-old, who had climbed Mount Kilimanjaro just last month, collapsed as she ran up Birdcage Walk -- the final stretch covered by competitors before reaching Buckingham Palace and turning on to The Mall.
