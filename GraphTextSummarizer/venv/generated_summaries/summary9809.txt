Before becoming interior minister, Blake Mora was an attorney from Baja California state who was chief of staff to the state government from 2007 until July 2010. The helicopter crash in Mexico that killed Interior Minister Jose Francisco Blake Mora and all seven other people aboard shows no evidence of an explosion, a Mexican official said Saturday. In July 2010, Calderon appointed Blake Mora to the post that oversees security efforts against drug cartels in Mexico. "He was very highly thought of both within Mexico and with his counterparts in the United States," Starr said of Blake Mora. "Today we remember Juan Camilo Mourino three years after his departure, a human being who worked on building a better Mexico," Blake Mora wrote in a tweet posted November 4, the third anniversary of the accident.
