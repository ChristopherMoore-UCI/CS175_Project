"Candidates will be provided water, notepad and pen." CNN did not allow campaign aides to accompany the candidates backstage, but Sink and Scott were permitted to use their own make-up artists during the debate. -- A campaign aide to Florida gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink has been removed after the Democratic nominee was sent a text message during a televised debate -- in violation of the rules that the candidates agreed to. Republican nominee Rick Scott, who was sitting next to Sink in the nationally televised debate, noticed the violation and notified a CNN official. "The rule was no one was supposed to give us messages during the break, and your campaign did with an iPad or an iPod." For the record, the device Sink read from was neither an iPad nor an iPhone but a Droid smartphone.
