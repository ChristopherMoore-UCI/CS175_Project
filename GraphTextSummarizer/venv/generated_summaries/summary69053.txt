Egyptian election commission spokesman Sameh al-Kashef said Tuesday that, although the committee had received numerous complaints, irregularities did not affect the results of the election. -- Egypt's largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, will boycott runoff parliamentary elections scheduled for Sunday, a member of the party said Wednesday. Mohamed Beltagy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a former legislative candidate, said the boycott is a protest against irregularities in the first round of voting last Sunday. Twenty-seven candidates affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood qualified for runoff elections. The runoff will involve 377 candidates from the National Democratic Party of longtime President Hosni Mubarak.
