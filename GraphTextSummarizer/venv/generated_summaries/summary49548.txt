Working with craftsmen in Fairfield County, Connecticut -- striking distance from Harris' home office in Silvermine -- she came up with a stylish collection of upholstered furniture and hardwood storage units in less than three months. Nowadays, most household furniture sold in the United States is imported, according to the American Home Furnishings Alliance, with the exception of upholstered furniture, because most of it is custom-ordered. They shuttered the business in the online boom, and Marcia Harris pursued interior design while Dean Harris went into online marketing. So Harris took matters into her own hands, designing banquettes that held pots and pans and turned into beds, a storage ottoman that doubled as a seat and coffee table and modular bedroom storage units that fit through the front door. "At that point, I said to my husband, 'I think there's a real opportunity and need here,'" said Harris, who has been working in interior design in New York and Connecticut for more than 30 years.
