U.S. officials are operating on the assumption that Chavez's forces have someone in custody, a U.S. government source told CNN on Friday. -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said authorities have arrested a U.S. citizen who "had all the appearances of a mercenary" working to destabilize the South American country's government. Chavez, who is running for reelection, has repeatedly accused U.S. officials and members of Venezuela's opposition of plotting to destabilize the country's government. Chavez said the passport the man was carrying had stamps from recent years in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. U.S. officials have reached out to the Venezuelan government on the matter, but haven't received information, the source said.
