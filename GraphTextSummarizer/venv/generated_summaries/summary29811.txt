Directly in Triesman's firing line was FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who at the age of 77 is in his fourth and, he claimed when re-elected in 2011, final term of office. I think the thing about old dogs not learning new tricks is true," said Triesman, who quit his FA role under a cloud of controversy after reportedly criticizing rival World Cup host candidates. That relationship soured once more in 2011 when Triesman's successor, David Bernstein, called for the 208 FIFA nations not to re-elect Blatter unopposed -- a move which failed dismally. Sometimes it is arrogant about FIFA and that's not good from the FA's point of view, although I hope in recent years we haven't been. I almost fell over laughing when Sepp Blatter announced he didn't know how hot it was in Qatar at that time of year," he said.
