Rape has occurred in history time and time again. Even among those who oppose abortion, most people support exceptions for rape and incest. It's been used for the most part to delegitimize the idea that exceptions to abortion prohibitions should exist for rape. If pregnancy from rape doesn't happen, then we don't need exceptions in the law. If they could, then many teen pregnancies wouldn't occur; few teens want to get pregnant.
