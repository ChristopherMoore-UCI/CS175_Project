Though most of the allied campaign has been conducted from the air, NATO warships reported fighting at least two brief sea engagements with pro-Gadhafi forces off the port city of Misrata in May. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report. NATO planes and warships joined the fight in March, pounding government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from reprisals by Gadhafi loyalists. A Libyan government spokesman said Thursday that forces loyal to embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi did not fire a missile at NATO warships, as he had told reporters a day earlier. Gadhafi's forces have been battling a nearly six-month-long revolt that has split Libya roughly in half. Ibrahim told CNN that military officials later told him they hadn't launched a missile at the NATO fleet currently off Libya.
