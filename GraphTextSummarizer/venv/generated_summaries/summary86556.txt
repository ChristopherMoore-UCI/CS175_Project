West caused a ruckus at the MTV Awards last month when he put down his bottle of cognac, jumped on the MTV Music Video Awards stage and grabbed the microphone from singer Taylor Swift as she was giving an acceptance speech. Concert promoter Live Nation said Thursday that West's concert tour with Lady Gaga, titled "Fame Kills," has been canceled just two weeks after it was announced. "I deal with hurt and, you know, so many, you know, celebrities, they never take the time off, and I've never taken the time off to really, you know, I just, music after music and tour after tour on tour," West told Leno.
