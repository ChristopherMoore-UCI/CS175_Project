Daniels, 76, found out he needed a pacemaker "to regulate his heart rate" after he checked into a hospital Monday to be treated for "a mild case of pneumonia," his publicist said Thursday. Legendary fiddle player Charlie Daniels got a new instrument Thursday -- a pacemaker to help his heart keep the beat. The surgery to implant the pacemaker happened in a Nashville area hospital Thursday morning, according to the statement from his publicist. Performances in New Jersey and Ohio set for next week will be rescheduled, but Daniels plans to be back on stage with his fiddle in Lynchburg, Virginia, on April 11, the statement said. "I just had not been feeling well and wanted to get checked out," Daniels said.
