The diagnosis of scoliosis means Richard III had a physical health condition in common with about 2% to 3% of the American population, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. "It's a twist rather than a forward bend," said study co-author Piers Mitchell of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge. Archaeologists determined at that time that Richard III had scoliosis, a condition characterized by a curvature of the spine. In up to 85% of people with scoliosis, including Richard III, there is no known cause, according to the National Institutes of Health. Researchers wanted to make sure Richard was like that in life, not just as a result of his bones having been buried for centuries.
