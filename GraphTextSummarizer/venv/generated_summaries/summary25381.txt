OpenSkies currently operates one Boeing 757 with 24 flat-bed berths in business class, 28 seats in premium economy and 30 in economy. OpenSkies, launched on June 19 between Paris Orly and New York JFK, already operated a codeshare agreement with L'Avion that flies out of Orly to Newark, New York. "L'Avion is a successful airline that has built up a premium business between Orly and New York in a relatively short period of time," said British Airways' chief executive, Willie Walsh in a statement. "It has many synergies with OpenSkies and buying it provides OpenSkies with a larger schedule and an established customer base in the Paris-New York market. -- British Airways has agreed to buy L'Avion, the French all-business class carrier and plans to integrate the airline into its recently launched subsidiary, OpenSkies.
