Not so much "Across the board, the networks and the PPOs (preferred provider organizations) are significantly narrower than people are used to," said Micah Weinberg, a senior policy adviser dealing with health policies for California's Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored public policy advocacy group. While providers are limited with these plans, in the long run Davis said she believes "it's actually a good thing to reward higher quality, lower cost providers" as that could ultimately cut the cost of health care as the reform legislation intended. Nationally the marketplaces offer tens of thousands of different policies with a wide variety of coverage, but Harte has noticed many have one thing in common: They cover a narrow network of doctors and hospitals. Davis gives the ACA marketplaces high marks overall since it is a lot easier to compare plans in these marketplaces than when consumers were buying insurance on their own. "Some coverage is better than no coverage," said Karen Davis, an economist and professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University.
