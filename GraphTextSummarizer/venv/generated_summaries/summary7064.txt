For six years, Head sifted through fossils of animals that lived 40 million years ago, looking for clues on climate change. "One of the things you can actually do is estimate past temperatures by looking at the body size of fossil reptiles," said Head, a paleontologist who studies the Earth and its atmosphere at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It's what the existence of the "Bearded King Morrison" tells us about the effects of climate change that's intriguing. Head says he hasn't found fossil records that show why the creature eventually went extinct. So when he happened upon one of the biggest lizards that ever walked on land, he found it fitting to name it after the band's frontman, Jim Morrison -- the original Lizard King.
