Tottenham has a large contingent of Jewish supporters, while Lazio has long had fans with right wing sympathies. -- Italian club Lazio has been charged over the "alleged racist behavior" of its fans during November's Europa League clash with Tottenham. It is not the first time this season that Lazio supporters have been accused of racism, with the club fined â‚¬40,000 (US$52,000) for abuse directed at Tottenham's black players during the clubs' previous meeting in London in September. His actions earned widespread praise, including from Milan owner Berlusconi himself, but FIFA president Sepp Blatter is not among those who believe that Boateng's behavior was a step in the right direction. The charges, which will be heard on January 24, continue a bad week for the standing of football in Italy, with the country's reputation having also been "damaged" in the eyes of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi after last week's racism walkoff involving AC Milan.
