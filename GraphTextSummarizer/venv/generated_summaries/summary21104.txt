While reading a story on this site about rare video games, Tanner Sandlin of Austin, Texas, recognized one of the games -- Air Raid for the Atari 2600. This is important because none of the other twelve people who possess Air Raid cartridges were the original owners -- they bought them at auction, secondhand stores, or through private collectors. Oddly enough, Sandlin remembered that this much sought after game wasn't really all that great. He and his friends used to borrow games from each other all the time --sometimes you'd get your game back, sometimes you wouldn't, and that was OK. Because his was the only known Air Raid box in the world, making it the only known complete copy of the game in existence.
