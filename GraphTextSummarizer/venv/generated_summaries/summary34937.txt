Banned under Franco, abortion was allowed again in 1985, and in 2010 legal abortion was extended radically by the left-wing Zapatero government. Contrasting view: Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban If, as predicted, the bill is passed, abortion will no longer be regarded in law as a "right" but as a crime.

These three elements send a message that abortion is not merely a medical procedure but an act of grave moral significance for all involved: Doctors, mothers and unborn children.
