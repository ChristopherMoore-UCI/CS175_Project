The FBI said Friday it will respond to questions from Congress on the use of FBI aircraft amid allegations that Attorney General Eric Holder is among officials who "may have used FBI planes for his own travel when aircraft were needed for FBI operations." Both the Justice Department and the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed FBI Director Robert Mueller himself intends to reply to the allegations. One of the major issues is the government's requirement that for security reasons, attorneys general, Homeland Security secretaries, FBI directors, and many defense and civilian intelligence officials must fly in government aircraft. In May, Grassley asked Mueller, who was testifying on Capitol Hill, if the FBI had to lease a plane because the bureau's jet was reserved for top Justice Department officials. The lawmakers want to know why the FBI pays for Holder's travel, even when he uses non-FBI planes such as Department of Defense or Federal Aviation Administration aircraft. A letter to Mueller from key congressional Republicans in the House and Senate said Thursday that in one case, Holder is alleged to have reserved an FBI aircraft, "upgraded to a larger aircraft owned by a different agency and left the FBI plane sitting idle because he failed to notify the FBI in a timely manner."
