King's 1991 beating by Los Angeles police officers after a traffic stop left him with skull fractures and brain and kidney damage. Two of the officers were later convicted of federal civil rights charges, and King won $3.8 million in damages from the city in a civil suit. -- Rodney King, whose videotaped beating by police ultimately led to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence on Tuesday, police said. King was behind the wheel of a 1994 Mitsubishi when he was pulled over in Moreno Valley, in Southern California's Riverside County, the city's police department reported. But their trial the following year led to three acquittals and a mistrial in the predominantly white suburb of Simi Valley, verdicts that set off three days of riots in African-American neighborhoods.
