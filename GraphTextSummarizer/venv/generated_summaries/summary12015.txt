According to a criminal complaint, Graham recently told a friend she was having second thoughts about marrying Cody L. Johnson. According to the complaint, Graham reportedly told a friend she planned to talk with Johnson about her reservations on July 7. Upset, they decided to go hiking in Glacier National Park in Flathead County, Montana, where they continued to fight. Jordan Linn Graham made an initial appearance in court Monday to face a charge of second-degree murder. "Graham stated she could have just walked away, but due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff," the complaint read.
