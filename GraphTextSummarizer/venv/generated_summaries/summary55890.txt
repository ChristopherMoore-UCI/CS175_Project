Scientists deduced that ultraviolet light from surrounding stars had penetrated that dusty cloud, breaking up molecules in it like carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide, which in turn released oxygen atoms. Those oxygen atoms attached themselves to hydrogen molecules, forming water. Scientists now hope to observe other carbon stars. The star is known as a carbon star, not thought to make much water, so scientists initially thought the star's heat must have evaporated comets or dwarf planets to produce the water vapor. -- European scientists say they've figured out the recipe for water in space: Just add starlight.
