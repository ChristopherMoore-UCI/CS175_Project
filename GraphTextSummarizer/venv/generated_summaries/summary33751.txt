They protested a decision by Turkey's electoral board last week, which disqualified Kurdish candidate Hatip Dicle for "not meeting the requirements for being elected into parliament." We "will not be a part of a group who do not allow elected parliamentarians to take the oath," said CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Kurdish lawmakers protested by gathering hundreds of miles away from the capital, Ankara, in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir on Tuesday. More than 30 lawmakers from the Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) boycotted Tuesday's session. The replacement AKP candidate was sworn into parliament on Tuesday.
