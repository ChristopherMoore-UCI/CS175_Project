Charlie Hebdo, and Salman Rushdie, and Theo van Gogh, the Dutch film director murdered for making a film about Islam, offended many people. Our first modern-day encounter with the threat of murder against artists who "offend" came in 1989, when Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa (that's when we all learned the word), a religious decree ordering the assassination of the writer Salman Rushdie over his novel, "The Satanic Verses." Attacks against them serve as an alarm about threats to other aspects of our lives. One group will urge us to respect religions, to refrain from crossing a certain invisible line that offends. Discussions about the need to "respect religions" became popular throughout the West.
