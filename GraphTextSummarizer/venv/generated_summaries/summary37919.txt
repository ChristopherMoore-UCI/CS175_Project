In his account to CNN, Wilson said that when the media pool accompanying Obama arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President. It also raised the question of whether the official can continue working in Afghanistan after the revelation in a White House media report sent to about 6,000 journalists. A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. The White House official asked if Wilson would write another pool report that would advise journalists to disregard the previous report, which contained the chief of station's name.
