-- Actor Stephen Collins, who is in the news for child molestation allegations, is best known for playing the clergyman father in the TV series "7th Heaven." According to divorce documents filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Grant says she learned that Collins had "been engaging in a long-term pattern of sexually molesting children." The recent scandal was precipitated by Collins' divorce from actress Faye Grant, whom he married in 1985. Grant said in the court documents that she was unaware of Collins' behavior until he told her in January 2012. Collins and Grant have one child, a daughter.
