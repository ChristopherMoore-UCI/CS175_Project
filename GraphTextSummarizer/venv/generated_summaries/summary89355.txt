Edward Herrmann, the versatile, honey-voiced actor whose roles included patricians and politicians such as "Gilmore Girls" father Richard Gilmore, "The Practice" law professor Anderson Pearson and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, has died. And then there was Richard Gilmore, the blue-blooded father of Lorelai Gilmore, whose snappy dialogue -- often with his daughter or his wife (Kelly Bishop) -- couldn't hide his big heart, especially when it came to his granddaughter Rory, played by Alexis Bledel. It was an honor and a joy to know him, a devastating blow to lose him," tweeted Lauren Graham, who starred as Lorelai Gilmore in "Gilmore Girls." He went easily from role to role -- his Internet Movie Database page includes 130 credits, including small spots in "American Dad," "30 Rock" and "Drop Dead Diva" -- and he reveled in the work. He was nominated twice for Emmys for his portrayal of FDR, first in the TV movie "Eleanor and Franklin" (1976) and then in the next year's "Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years."
