-- With a crushing right hand, Juan Manuel Marquez knocked out Manny Pacquiao in the sixth round of a non-title bout in Las Vegas late Saturday, scoring a definitive victory after three previous bouts that ended in close judgments. Public sentiment and the opinion of sports media on Marquez' and Pacquiao's previous bouts have fallen mostly in the middle. Actor Steven Seagal and Basketball legend Earvin "Magic" Johnson could be seen at the match, and former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson tweeted that he was also in attendance. Pacquiao shook Marquez' hand after getting back on his feet. Both fighters scored a knock-down earlier in the fight with Marquez sending Pacquiao flying onto his back and Pacquiao tipping Marquez enough off of his feet to cause one of his gloves to touch the mat.
