McCarthy was pronounced dead at 7:37 p.m. ET at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas, said department spokesman John Hurt. Texas has led the nation in the number of executions since 1976, but the number of states carrying out capital punishment continues to drop. Last year, Texas executed more people than it sentenced to death for the eighth straight year. They held signs that read, "Don't kill for me" and "End executions in Texas." Kimberly McCarthy on Wednesday evening became the 500th prisoner executed in Texas since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated in the state, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
