Everyone at CGI U -- including Brad Pitt and myself -- also worked on a service project in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, helping to prepare construction sites for new homes for people who had been uprooted by Hurricane Katrina. This year, we're building on this energy and expanding CGI to more people in more regions. We launched it in 2005 with a simple concept: Invite a diverse group of global leaders to New York City, challenge them to work together on the world's most pressing challenges, give them concrete opportunities to do so, and require that in order to return the next year, they make a commitment to take action to address a global challenge of their choice. In the spirit of building a world with more partners and fewer enemies, I'll be traveling to Hong Kong this December for the first meeting of CGI outside of New York. One of the most important conversations will be about global warming and the specific clean energy opportunities that we have -- at all levels of government and society -- to create jobs, increase growth, enhance security, fight global warming and sustain our sources of food and clean water.
