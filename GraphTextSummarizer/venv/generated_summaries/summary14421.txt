Officers met "complete chaos" when they tried to find out what happened not long after midnight Friday, Sheriff Frank McKeithen told CNN affiliate WMBB when interviewed on the scene. "It's time to stop the bloodshed," said council member Keith Curry, according to WMBB. The scene was so mixed up that deputies from five adjacent counties and officers from the Florida Highway Patrol and Panama City Beach police were called in to assist. They were taken to area hospitals, where three were listed in critical condition and three in stable condition, the sheriff's office said. On Saturday night, the Panama City Beach City Council held a special meeting to talk about the violence.
