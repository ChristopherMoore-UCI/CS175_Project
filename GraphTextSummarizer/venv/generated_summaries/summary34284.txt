Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi, "Prometheus," invaded theaters in second place with $50 million. Word-of-mouth doesn't suggest that "Prometheus" will become this year's "Inception," a thinky thriller-turned-box-office-smash, but its successful debut and ample international receipts (it's earned $91.5 million after two weekends) should have the suits at Fox pretty happy. Do you think "Prometheus" will crash and burn from here, or do you think curiosity and buzz will attract more audiences? "Men In Black 3" held on to fourth place, dropping 52 percent (after losing many 3-D screens to "Prometheus" and "Madagascar") to $13.5 million. With a $248 million overseas total, the dystopian thriller hasn't exhibited similar box office ubiquity overseas, although this may very well change with future "Hunger Games" installments.
