On Tuesday, a Morgan Stanley broker was placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation into Gristina, according to company spokesman Mark Lake. Prosecutors say Gristina was with the broker in his Manhattan office shortly before her arrest, saying the pair were there to discuss the creation of a website that arranges illicit encounters. She is suspected of running a brothel out of an apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side. -- A New York judge has denied a request to reduce the bail of a woman accused of running a multimillion-dollar escort service for high-powered clientele, according to court documents. The bail for Anna Gristina, a New York mother of four, is currently set at $2 million bond or $1 million cash.
