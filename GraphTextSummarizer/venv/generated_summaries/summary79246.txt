Tuck had recently given police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, Sheriff Tony De Meo said. Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly on Saturday: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency," he said. The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Tuck, of Nevada, allegedly showed the tape to others, and faces between 10 years to life in prison for exhibiting pornography and one to six years for possession of child pornography, said De Meo.
