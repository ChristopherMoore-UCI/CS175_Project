Walker is survived by his parents, Cheryl Walker and Paul Walker Sr., four siblings and 15-year-old daughter, Meadow. Roger Rodas' widow is suing Porsche for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of her race car driver husband and actor Paul Walker. Roger Rodas, 38 at the time of his death, spent his competitive racing career driving Porsche cars. Kristine Rodas filed the suit this week against Porsche Cars North America, citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40-year-old "Fast and the Furious" star on November 30 in Santa Clarita, California. According to the court documents, he and Walker first met on the race track when Rodas was driving a Porsche owned by the actor.
