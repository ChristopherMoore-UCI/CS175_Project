The government had increased security and checkpoints throughout the past week, including additional patrols in various areas of Jos, Choji said. On March 7, at least 200 Christians villagers were massacred near Jos, and more than 150 Muslims were killed in an attack in a nearby town, Kuru Karama, on January 19. In recent weeks, the governor's office had received letters purported to be from some Muslim organizations threatening attacks against Christians, Choji said. Hassan John, a Jos resident and journalist with the media department of the Anglican Diocese of Jos, described a scene of chaos in what was expected to be a joyous Christmas Eve. -- The Christmas Eve attacks in the volatile Nigerian city of Jos have claimed at least 31 lives, a bloody aftermath in a region long torn by Christian and Muslim hostility.
