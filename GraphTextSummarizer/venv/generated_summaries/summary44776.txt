The Clintons are also known for their close relationship with Democratic Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes. Former President Bill Clinton poked fun Thursday at his reputation as Democrats' "campaigner-in-chief" during a political swing through New Hampshire. A potential Clinton boost could be beneficial for Grimes, who is trailing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in recent polls and who no longer enjoys political support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee after it pulled out of the state. Hillary campaigned for their family friend earlier this week, and Bill will make his third appearance for Grimes in the Blue Grass state next week, according to WBKO. "I feel like an old racehorse in a stable, and people just take me out and put me on the track and slap me on the rear to see if I can get around one more time," Clinton told an audience of more than 1,200 at a fundraiser for New Hampshire's all-female slate of Democratic candidates for Congress and governor.
