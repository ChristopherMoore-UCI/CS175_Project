Verbier Festival; from July to August each year; tickets from 50 francs ($55) Port Eliot Festival, Cornwall, UK The word "twee" inevitably suggests itself when describing this festival of music and the arts set in and around yet another stately home.

Henley Festival; every July; tickets from £52 ($80) Verbier Festival, Verbier, Switzerland All pretty evening gowns and penguin suits, this elite classical music event takes place every summer in a little Alpine town in that home of all things pricey, Switzerland.
