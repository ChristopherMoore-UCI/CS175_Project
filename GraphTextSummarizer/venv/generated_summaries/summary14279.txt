Irene was moving through the southern Bahamas and will pass very near or over the Turks and Caicos islands later Tuesday night, CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen said early Tuesday evening. As of Tuesday, the most likely place for landfall appears to be on the Outer Banks of North Carolina as the computer models have continued to shift the track of the storm eastward, Hennen said. But she advised coastal residents especially to make plans and to prepare hurricane evacuation kits: "food supplies, medicine, water -- begin to think about your pets, begin to think about those things all around your home or business that can cause damage if there are high winds. " Irene became a Category 2 hurricane Monday evening, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. "People think hurricanes are a Southern thing but people in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast need to take Irene seriously," Fugate said.
