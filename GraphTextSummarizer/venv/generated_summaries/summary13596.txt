White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said it is not uncommon for staff to take people who are cleared for tours to other events if there is space available. Shapiro said the White House Office of Public Engagement, which Obama created to engage citizens in White House activities, was responsible for clearing in the Dardens, as well as the other breakfast guests. A White House spokesman said it was a "nice gesture" that has been done before for those have passed security screenings. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said agents performed the same screening procedures on the Dardens that were used for other breakfast guests. He went to talk to a White House aide telling the staffer that he may be in the wrong place.
