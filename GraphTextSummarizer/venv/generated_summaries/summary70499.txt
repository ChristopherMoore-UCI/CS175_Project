But people largely ignored the call and are voting "enthusiastically," said Election Commission spokesman Bir Bahadur Rai. "Except in a few places, elections are being held peacefully," police spokesman Ganesh K. C. said. Despite fears, officials and reports say that voters turned up in large numbers in the 18,438 polling centers across the country to choose assembly members. The army has been called in to help police provide security after an alliance of 33 parties vowed to disrupt polling. About two dozen people were injured in several incidents over the last week when petrol bombs were thrown at passenger buses.
