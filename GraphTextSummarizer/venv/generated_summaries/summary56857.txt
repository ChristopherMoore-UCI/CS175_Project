Guardiola put out a strong Bayern side for their cup match, but rested Franck Ribery and captain Philipp Lahm while new signing from his former club Thiago Alcantara also had to be content with a place on the bench. Remy had been expected to leave after QPR were relegated from England's top flight last season as he looks to secure his place in the French international side ahead of the 2014 World Cup. Meanwhile, France striker Loic Remy has moved to English Premier League side Newcastle on a season-long loan deal from Queens Park Rangers. It also followed a 4-2 defeat to arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in the Germany Super Cup last weekend in Guardiola's first competitive match in charge. Thomas Muller scored a hat-trick as Bayern Munich secured their first victory in a competitive match under new manager Pep Guardiola Monday.
