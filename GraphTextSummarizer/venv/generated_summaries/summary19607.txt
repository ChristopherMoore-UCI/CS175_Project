-- Billionaire Bill Gates has urged industrialized nations to honor aid pledges to developing nations despite the recession. Bill Gates Thursday said industrialized nations need to do more to help developing countries. Â» Trade was also key to developing nations being able to become self-sufficient, said Gates, rather than relying on foreign aid or philanthropy. Gates said that as industrialized nations cut their budgets over the next few years to get deficits down there would be a real question of whether aid money will be untouched or increase. Part of its remit is to help nations trapped by hunger and extreme poverty, donating billions of dollars on health aid during the past two decades.
