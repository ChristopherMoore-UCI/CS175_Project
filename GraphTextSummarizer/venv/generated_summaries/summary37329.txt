Technology has enormous potential to address educational needs more efficiently, help teachers improve their performance and enrich and individualize student learning. The idea that computers can ever replace teachers and schools reveals a deep lack of understanding about the role leadership plays in student success. Technology can be a powerful force in that effort when guided by leaders who understand what students and teachers need to do their best. Students spend up to two hours a day in a computer learning lab mastering basic math and reading skills through exercises and puzzles, freeing up teachers to spend their time on advanced skills and concepts. At Rocketship, technology strengthens the personal ties between students, parents and teachers that are the key to its success.
