-- Jim Kelly, who parlayed his martial arts skills into a successful but brief career in action movies, has died. " "RIP Jim Kelly, hero of my grind house youth," he posted on Kelly's Facebook page. In later years Kelly took up tennis professionally, becoming a ranked player on the USTA senior circuit. Kelly's former wife Marilyn Dishman told CNN that the actor died Saturday of cancer, but did not elaborate. Kelly worked as a martial arts instructor in Los Angeles when he was tapped for his first role in the action movie, "Melinda."
