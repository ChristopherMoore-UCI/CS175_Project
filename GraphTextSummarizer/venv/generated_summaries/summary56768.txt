The seven fatally shot victims, all from California, were: Katleen Ping, 24; Judith Ona Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia H. Sim, 21, of Hayward; Sonam Choedon, 33, of El Cerrito; Grace Eunhea Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris Ifeyinwa Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro; and Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, of San Francisco, according to prosecutors. Goh is also charged with the attempted murder of Dawinder Kaur, 19; Ahmad Javid Sayeed, 36; and Grace Kirika, 43, O'Malley said. District Attorney Nancy E. O'Malley has said Goh voluntarily left Oikos in November because he was upset. Goh "wanted some money back for tuition he had paid, and it is also clear that he focused on one particular administrator at the school who was not present at the school" on the day of the shooting, O'Malley told reporters. Goh, who is Korean-American, is charged with seven counts of murder with special circumstances and three counts of attempted murder in a mass shooting earlier this month at Oikos, a small college that caters primarily to the Korean-American Christian community.
