In an effort to help end a budget stalemate and avoid another government shutdown like the one in October, leaders in both parties last month agreed to a deal that funded the government but excluded an extension of jobless benefits. New year, same old fight over jobless benefits The Club for Growth had urged all senators to vote "no" on the proposal and cited the lack of spending offsets. Republicans have blamed President Barack Obama for the slow pace of the economic recovery on the one hand while claiming that the economy is now stable enough to withstand the impact of letting people go without benefits. Democrats feel like they are in a win-win position on jobless benefits â€” if they win this fight, they are the champions of those struggling to recover from the Great Recession; if they lose, they can blame the Republicans. As a result, Congress did not continue a 2008 recession-era law providing nearly a year of payments, footed by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out.
