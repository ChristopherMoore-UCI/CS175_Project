5 takeaways from Obama's speech After the speech, Colorado Sen. Mark Udall challenged the President's suggestion that he has unilateral authority to expand military operations. In the face of several tough upcoming Senate races, many Democratic candidates have found a multitude of ways to separate themselves from the President's most recent speech on ISIS. Tillis said after Obama's speech: "The job of a senator is to stand up to the President when they are wrong, something Sen. Hagan has repeatedly refused to do." Showdown: Jay Carney, John McCain face off "I pressed the administration to arm and empower moderate Syrian rebels and I am glad that effort will be accelerated."

Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina took an approach similar to Shaheen's.
