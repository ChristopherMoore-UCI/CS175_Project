Other players on the Lokomotiv roster included former NHL All-Star forward Pavol Demitra, a Slovakian who played 16 seasons for Ottawa, St. Louis, Minnesota, Los Angeles and Vancouver; longtime NHL defenseman Karel Rachunek of the Czech Republic, who played for Ottawa, the New York Rangers and New Jersey; Russian defenseman Ruslan Salei, who played 14 years in the NHL for Anaheim, Florida, Colorado and Detroit; Latvian defenseman Karlis Skrastins, who played 12 NHL seasons for Nashville, Colorado, Florida and Dallas; and Josef Vasicek from the Czech Republic, who played seven seasons for Carolina and the New York Islanders. "Though it occurred thousands of miles away from our home arenas, this tragedy represents a catastrophic loss to the hockey world -- including the NHL family, which lost so many fathers, sons, teammates and friends who at one time excelled in our league," NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. The KHL is a major Russia-based professional league that has attracted some NHL players, particularly those of Russian or east European descent, with large salaries and top-flight competition. " The news came as the NHL was reeling from the recent deaths of three current or former enforcers, players whose main contribution is to intimidate and fight. Though considered a step below the NHL, the KHL also has lured younger players from Europe and Canada who are unable to make NHL rosters right away.
