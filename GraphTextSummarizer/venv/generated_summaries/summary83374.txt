Noriega attorney Jon May told the court that his client wants to return to Panama and that the United States is obligated to return him under the Geneva Conventions. In court papers, the United States argues that "nothing in the Geneva Conventions suggests that a prisoner-of-war cannot be extradited from one party nation to face criminal charges in another party nation. Noriega, who was captured in Panama by U.S. military forces, completed his prison sentence for drug trafficking and money laundering in September 2007 but remains imprisoned until the courts can decide where he should go. "He will not look at this as a way to get Gen. Noriega, like the Bushes do." The controversy over the next step for former Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega is winding its way through the federal courts.
