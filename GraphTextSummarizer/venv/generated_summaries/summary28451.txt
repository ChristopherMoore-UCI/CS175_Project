"Gold is a popular choice in many markets, particularly in Asia where Apple has a stated goal of growth, so this seems to be a natural move," said Massimiliano Pogliani, CEO of luxury phone company Vertu, in an e-mail to CNN. Instead of building a phone from scratch, luxury retailer Stuart Hughes takes existing BlackBerrys and iPhones and creates new casings for them fashioned from gold, titanium and diamonds. "Gold in colour falls short of using gold as a material, though. " Gold phones have been used to show power and wealth long before they became mobile or even cordless. Nokia started its Vertu line in 1998, producing an array of phones slathered in precious metals and diamonds.
