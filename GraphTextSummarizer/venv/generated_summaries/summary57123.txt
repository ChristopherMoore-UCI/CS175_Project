Iran claims its uranium enrichment program is intended for civilian energy purposes, however the United States and others maintain Iran is seeking to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. -- Additional information received recently by a United Nations watchdog group raises new concerns about the intent of Iran's nuclear program. "Iran is not providing the necessary cooperation to enable the agency to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear materials in Iran is in peaceful activities," the report said. At a recent U.S. Senate hearing, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper appeared to allude to the latest assessment, telling senators that Iran "continues to advance its uranium enrichment capabilities along with what appears to be the scientific, technical and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons if its leaders choose to do so." However, it does discuss possible nuclear activities tied to Iran's military "including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile."
