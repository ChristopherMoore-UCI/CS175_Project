In some ways, today's Jihadist terrorists can be seen as harnessing various types of terrorism we saw in earlier decades: the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel terrorism of radical Palestinian groups and the anti-establishment, even anarchistic terrorism of homegrown groups whose aim was to sow fear and destabilize society as a means to bring down the system. Twenty years later, in 1988, a report by the Anti-Defamation League warned that a significant number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States now reflected "a politically-related anti-Israel component." In 1967-68, after Israel defeated Arab states in the Six-Day War, Poland's communist regime staged an "anti-Zionist" campaign that forced most of the remaining Jews out of the country. But -- unlike Poland's "anti-Zionist" campaign -- terrorism did not prove an existential threat to Jews and did not prompt a mass exodus. At least 13,000 Jews emigrated, according to Dariusz Stola, who is now the director of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews.
