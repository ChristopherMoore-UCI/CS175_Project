Two Pakistani intelligence officials said one suspected drone fired four missiles, killing 13 people at an alleged militant hideout in the area of Shawal in South Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. -- Two suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region killed 21 alleged militants Tuesday, intelligence officials said. Analysts say the areas are havens for militants fueling the insurgencies in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The overwhelming majority of drone strikes have targeted areas in North and South Waziristan. The second strike occurred hours later on another suspected militant hideout in North Waziristan.
