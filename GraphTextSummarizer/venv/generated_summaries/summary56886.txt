The greatest limitation of biometric voter registration is that it only counters the symptoms -- not the causes -- of electoral fraud. In Sierra Leone, there is no historical evidence of a deliberate strategy by any political party to rig elections through multiple registrations. An often overlooked aspect of the current electoral cycle in Sierra Leone is the use of biometric technology to capture thumb prints and facial features in the registration of voters. Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal and Somaliland have also used biometric technology to register voters. Biometric technology has been adopted to help address electoral fraud and increase the transparency, and credibility, of the electoral process.
