The free exhibition opened in Copenhagen, Denmark last week and will move to Arhus, Denmark on July 1st. Strange signs from around the world can be seen in Copenhagen, Denmark. The photos were then mounted onto real signs on metal poles standing in concrete bases. "Signspotting" is a collection of more than 100 signs found by travelers around the world and recreated by travel writer Doug Lansky. Â» Lansky started his collection almost 17 years ago, encouraged by friends who found his photos of strange signs more compelling than his treasured holiday snaps.
