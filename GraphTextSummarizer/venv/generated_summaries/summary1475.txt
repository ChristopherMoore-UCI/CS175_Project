But rescue crews revived the boy by performing CPR, said Arbin, who was at the scene. Butch Arbin told CNN on Wednesday. As he was being rolled into an ambulance on a stretcher, the boy -- perhaps not realizing the trauma he had just survived -- complained to his mother that he had sand in his eyes, Arbin said. "He basically went from dead to life," Arbin said, adding that the boy's mother called the rescue a "miracle." The child, whose family did not want to be identified, was initially taken to Atlantic General Hospital and later flown to the A.I. DuPont Hospital for Children in Delaware, he said.
