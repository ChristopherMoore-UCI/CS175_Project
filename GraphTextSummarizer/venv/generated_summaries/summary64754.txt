Also on Wednesday, Rampal's followers turned over the bodies of five women and a child who authorities believe died of illness, Haryana state Police Chief S.N. Vashisht said. The spiritual leader, Rampal Maharaj, was arrested Wednesday at his ashram without further resistance from his followers, said M.L. Kaushik, the regional administrative commissioner. After his arrest, the guru also was charged with sedition and waging war against the state, as well as attempted murder and rioting, Haryana state Police Chief S.N. Vashisht told CNN. The initial order to arrest Maharaj came after he repeatedly failed to appear in court in connection with a 2006 murder case, Kaushik said. A guru in India's northern Haryana state is in jail awaiting trial after 10 days of clashes between his followers and police seeking his arrest.
