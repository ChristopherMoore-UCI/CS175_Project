Free Tibet, which advocates Tibetan independence, also reported that two Tibetans were shot and wounded on Sunday by security forces during a protest outside a police station in the prefecture of Ganzi. "Most Tibetans live in fear because of suppressive and unfair government policies but they dare not speak up," prominent Tibetan writer and activist Tsering Woeser told CNN. The last attempt took place on Saturday when a 19-year-old former monk from Kirti monastery in Aba, another ethnic Tibetan area in Sichuan province, set himself alight in the central market in Ngaba Town but survived. A nun has died after setting herself on fire in southwestern China, the first Tibetan woman known to have killed herself in this way, the London-based Free Tibet campaign group said Tuesday. Tenzin is the ninth Tibetan -- all monks or former monks -- to commit self-immolation in protest against Chinese rule since March, the advocacy group said.
