With its latest software update for Apple TV, Apple is now offering easy streaming of MLB and NBA games directly through its $100 media-streaming unit. NBA League Pass has also been available for online streaming and directly mobile apps for Android and iOS, and the Apple TV bundle comes in two sizes: a $65 option if you pick seven teams to watch, as well as $100 for unlimited streaming. All you need an active subscription to either service, and you can have unlimited access to every baseball and basketball game through your Apple TV, subject to local blackout rules, of course. (Although, real penny-pinchers could just purchase the mobile version, which costs $70 less than the Apple TV version, and just AirPlay that to your HDTV, another new feature of iOS 4.3.) Millions of dollars over time, although much more Apple TV penetration will be needed before that comes to bear.
