-- When faced with bullies at school, one 11-year-old girl decided not to fight back with her fists. In her letter, Stokes described the bullying she saw and experienced at school. Instead, she sought help from a higher source: She wrote to President Barack Obama. "I would like to thank him for writing me back," she said, adding that things have gotten much better with the bullies at school. "My mom, she taught me violence never solves the problem," Zianey Stokes of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said Friday.
