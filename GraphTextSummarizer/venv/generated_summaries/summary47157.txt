" There were victories on the Rome clay Wednesday for Britain's Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, Germany's Tommy Haas and Russian Mikhail Youzhny. Spanish eight-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal opened his Rome title defense with a tough 7-6 6-7 6-2 victory over Giles Simon of France. There were comfortable wins for world No.1 Serena Williams, Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, Australia's Sam Stosur and Italians Francesca Schiavone and Sara Errani. It was the 32-year-old father of four's first match back since the birth of Lenny and Leo -- brothers to twin girls Charlene Riva and Myla Rose. Federer will be back on nappy changing duties sooner than he may have expected after losing 6-1 3-6 7-6(6) to Frenchman Jeremy Chardy Wednesday.
