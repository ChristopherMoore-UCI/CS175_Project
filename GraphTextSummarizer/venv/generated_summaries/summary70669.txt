"Our partnership with the USMC (U.S. Marine Corps) and Officer Candidate School has greatly benefited our students and the USMC, with Marine officers participating every year in our leadership conference" said Jeff Klein, director of the Wharton Graduate Leadership Program. The outdoor-based course, intended to show Wharton students how Marine-style leadership principles and teamwork can help in business, has proved enormously popular. The Captain Robert M. Secher Scholarship will allow one Marine Corps officer per year take a Wharton Executive Education course, something that would normally cost many thousands of dollars. -- There are many superficial similarities between the worlds of the military and business, something Captain Robert M. Secher of the U.S. Marines knew only too well. For example, the UK's Cranfield Business School has recently begun running a specialist MBA for senior military officers in association with the British military's own leadership college.
