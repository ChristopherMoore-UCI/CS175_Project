People with the condition are genetically male -- they have X and Y chromosome pairs -- but are "unable to respond to certain male sex hormones (called androgens), (so) they may have mostly female sex characteristics or signs of both male and female sexual development," according to the National Institutes of Health's Genetic Home Reference. On the show's second-season premiere Tuesday, Lauren -- stepsister of show protagonist Amy -- was revealed to be intersex, a condition in which a person is "born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male," according to the Intersex Society of North America. "Part of the overall theme of 'Faking It' is how hard it is to be your authentic self and how important it is to strive to do that," show creator Carter Covington told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month. The character, played by Bailey De Young, concluded last season with others gossiping about pills she was taking. The pills turn out to be hormones for Lauren's Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
