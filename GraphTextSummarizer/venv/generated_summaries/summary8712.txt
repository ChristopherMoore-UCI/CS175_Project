People who evacuated earlier this week from Rancho Bernardo, Scripps Ranch and Del Mar Heights can go home immediately, San Diego emergency spokeswoman Lynda Pfieffer said Wednesday morning. -- Many among the thousands of evacuees from California's wildfires were suffering from stress and worry about their homes after seeking shelter at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, said a pair of Navy medical volunteers Wednesday. Navy medics Daniel Brautigam, left, and Jacob Hackfeld volunteered to help wildfire evacuees. According to the San Diego's mayor's office, medical staff treated between 70 to 100 people since the stadium opened to evacuees. Of the thousands of people who've been sleeping, eating and passing time at the arena, many are showing symptoms of stress, said Petty Officer Daniel Brautigam.
