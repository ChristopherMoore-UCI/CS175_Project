Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. "It's going to take time to change some of this culture," Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month. "The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her," and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office.
