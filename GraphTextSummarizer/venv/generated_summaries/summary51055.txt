But after the fact, if it turns out you did cheat in the AFC Championship game? And I am only glad you have each other to collectively fester in your pool of myopic loathing (hyperbole added in the spirit of competition!). Lose your voice, burst your spleen, strain a hamstring; do whatever you can to get them into the end zone Sunday night. On the flip side there are Patriots-haters who think that Bill Belichick only lies when he speaks or breathes. Accordingly, until there is proof, I believe every Patriots fan should root like hell for them.
