Police Commissioner Bill Bratton hushed talk of the streak Friday on "CBS This Morning." "Shh ... we don't want to jinx it," Bratton told host Charlie Rose. New York City has gone 11 days without a homicide, its longest stretch without any on modern record, the New York Police Department said Friday. Police then responded to a 911 call about multiple shots being fired and found five individuals with gunshot wounds, New York police said. The last reported homicide was February 1, or Super Bowl Sunday, in Upper Manhattan, a police representative said Friday. The streak has been the longest since the New York Police Department began recording statistics with a computerized program called Compstat in 1994, the police representative said.
