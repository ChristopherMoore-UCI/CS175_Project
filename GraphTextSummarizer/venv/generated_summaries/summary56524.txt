The 2014 Winter Games cost Russia an estimated $50 billion and IOC members believe such an exorbitant cost has put off potential future bidders. Bach has also confirmed that sports will not have to wait seven years to be approved for a place at the Olympics, insisting the IOC can propose new events. After all, they say, the Olympic Games, the IOC, and the Olympic Movement have enjoyed many successes and we are in a very good position," said President Bach. "We have to look into the future and try to address the challenges which may arise in the future and the challenges we have already now," International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach told reporters. The IOC by itself can also take a decision that we are adding this or that event," Bach said.
