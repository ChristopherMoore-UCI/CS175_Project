The alleged victims hired Los Angeles lawyer Gloria Allred, who also represents a woman who accused Bieber of assaulting her at a Hollywood tourist spot when she tried to take a photo of him with her cell phone. "Accordingly, the charge against Mr. Bieber was withdrawn. His bodyguards have also faced charges and lawsuits after clashes with people following Bieber. "This is a serious matter that could have an impact on Mr. Bieber's probation status in California," Allred said in a statement last week to CNN.Â  "I have also made contact on my clients' behalf with the Hollywood branch of the Los Angeles Police DepartmentÂ  to make them aware of these new charges." "Investigation revealed that after colliding, the driver of the ATV and an occupant of the minivan engaged in a physical altercation," Ontario provincial police spokesman Kees Wijnands said.
