"There has been an intensification of armed violence across Syria over the past 10 days," said Gen. Robert Mood, head of the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria. The U.N. monitors, whose number gradually rose to about 300, were sent in to ensure that both President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters were abiding by a six-point peace plan brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan. He said U.N. observers will no longer be conducting patrols and will stay in their locations until further notice. "The lack of willingness by the parties to seek a peaceful transition, and the push towards advancing military positions is increasing the losses on both sides: innocent civilians, men women and children are being killed every day," Mood said. Violence has soared in recent days with reports of heavy government bombardment of town and chilling massacres of civilians.
