-- Ethiopia's hopes of making an unlikely appearance in the 2014 World Cup Finals suffered a major setback Sunday as a double from Emmanuel Emenike gave Nigeria a precious away victory in the first leg of their final African qualifier. Nigeria will need just a home draw in the return leg in Calabar to book their place in Brazil next month. Victor Moses might have leveled after being put clean through but they were on level terms after Emenike's shot found its way past Jemal Tassew. Ethiopia have been the surprise team in the 10 remaining African national sides bidding for five places in Brazil and dominated against their more illustrious opponents for over an hour in Addis Ababa. After the break the pattern continued but in the 56th minute they did go ahead in unusual circumstances as Behailu Assefa's cross was caught by Vincent Enyeama, but the referee ruled it had crossed the line.
