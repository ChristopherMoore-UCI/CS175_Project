It's the band's first album for more than three decades featuring vocalist Ozzy Osbourne along with fellow original band members guitarist Tony Iommi and bass player Geezer Butler. Osbourne recalls: "Black Sabbath was an after-thought cos originally we were a blues jazz band and someone said 'people pay money to see horror movies and get scared, why don't we start writing scary music?'" Playing scary music produced a legacy that has influenced generations of rock bands and labeled Black Sabbath as godfathers of heavy metal. As I was saying earlier on, it's like asking the Beatles to go back to 'Please Please Me' and they would have gone 'what?'" That first album was recorded in just two days in the English city of Birmingham in 1969. The record has provided the band with their first number one album in the U.S. and their first album chart topper in the UK after an unprecedented 43 years. Man had not long since set foot on the moon when Black Sabbath had their first number one album in the UK.
