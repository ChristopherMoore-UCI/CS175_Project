Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads. "At some point, it's gotten a bit much," Russell said, referring to online ads. But these ads also allow websites, including CNN.com, to offer content without charge, and ad-blocking devices like AdTrap could put that business model at risk. "We're not trying to be against all advertisers," said Julie Russell, Chad Russell's mother, who handles finances for AdTrap. So, Russell and Butkus set out to recreate the past and they came up with AdTrap.
