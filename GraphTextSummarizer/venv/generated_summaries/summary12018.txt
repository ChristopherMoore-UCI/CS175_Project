-- A co-defendant in the federal dogfighting case against Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick pleaded guilty Monday morning. He does, however, say that Vick accompanied the other three co-defendants to dogfights in other states on at least four occasions, and that the quarterback sponsored dogs in fights at his property on several other occasions, all between 2002 and 2004. Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, Vick and two other co-defendants -- Purnell Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Quanis Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia, were charged on July 17 with conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities, and conspiring to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture. In the court documents, Taylor says that he, Phillips and Peace "executed" dogs that did not "perform well in 'testing' " sessions, but does not mention Vick as having participated in the executions. The president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP criticized the prosecution of Vick at a news conference Monday morning.
