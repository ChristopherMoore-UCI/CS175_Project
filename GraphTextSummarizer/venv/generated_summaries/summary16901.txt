Livingston said Castellano considered it his lucky coin, but gave it away before he was shot dead in front of Sparks Steak House in New York in 1985. Other items included five original items collected off the floor of Bonnie and Clyde's car: A woman's silk stocking, an unused .45 caliber bullet and casing, a side temple from a pair of eyeglasses, a wood-handled screwdriver and an empty Bayer Aspirin tin, which sold for $11,400. Livingston said the posse officers were allowed to keep firearms and other possessions from the bullet-riddled vehicle, including the Colt that Barrow may have stolen from a federal armory in Texas. Barrow and Parker were known for kidnapping, auto theft, robbery, burglary and 13 murders, including the killings of two police officers, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The pistols are a small part of the arsenal that was found in Barrow and Parker's stolen car.
