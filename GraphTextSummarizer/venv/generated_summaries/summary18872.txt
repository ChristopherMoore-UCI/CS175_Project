This result seems unlikely, given the close associations found between modern dogs and ancient European wolves and dogs, Wayne said. "It's quite likely that the population of wolves that gave rise to modern dogs does not exist anymore," Thalmann said. The carcasses that ancient hunters left behind may have attracted wolves, which could have led to a relationship between dogs and humans, study authors said. Surprisingly, researchers did not find a population of modern wolves that might have given rise to modern dogs. In fact, modern dogs have more genetically in common with ancient wolves than the ones we see today.
