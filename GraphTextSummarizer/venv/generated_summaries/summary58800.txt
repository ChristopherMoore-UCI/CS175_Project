While entrepreneurship was the bedrock of their business success, their impact on the city in upstate New York extended far beyond corporate offices and financial reports. The couple helped lead and reshape Rochester, New York, for decades. Jane Glazer told Women Entrepreneurs Blog last April that she also found time to participate in a New York City Marathon, whitewater rafting and flying a plane. Glazer was playing tennis one day after graduating from Columbia University with an MBA at 22 in the late 1960s when a tennis partner suggested they go into the real estate business by buying a two-unit house in Rochester, the newspaper said in another story about him in 2008. Glazer also served as president of the TBM Owners and Pilots Association and was an active board member in several local organizations, including the Jewish Home of Rochester.
