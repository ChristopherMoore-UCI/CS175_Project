An explosive-laden car was detonated as a foreign embassy convoy was passing in the 9th District police zone, said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi. A suicide attack in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Thursday morning killed five people and wounded 33 others, including at least four children, said Hashmat Stanikzai, a police spokesman said. " Police in Kabul had earlier said that at least one British diplomat was killed after a large explosion damaged a convoy of foreign embassy cars in the capital. One of the dead was a British national, a civilian security team member, and the second was an Afghan national working for the embassy, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said in a statement. In a separate incident, armed insurgents attacked the office of a nonprofit organization in Kabul late Thursday.
