Bieber fled Miami late Friday, boarding a private jet for a flight to Panama City, Panama. Bieber already faces criminal charges in Miami stemming from an early morning traffic stop last week. Although Breathalyzer tests suggest Bieber was not too drunk to legally drive when he was pulled over by Miami Beach police early Thursday, it could be two or three weeks before tests are back from the lab that should give a more accurate blood-alcohol reading and could tell if he was high on pot. Other photos showed his manager, Scooter Braun, and mentor Usher Raymond with Bieber at the Panama resort. The Miami prosecutor said no date has been set yet for Bieber to return to court on the DUI, resisting arrest and expired license charges.
