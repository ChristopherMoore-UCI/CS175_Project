It's his evolving stance on foreign policy that Ron Paul supporters—at least the ones at this conference—most fear will drive Rand Paul too far to the left. Sankey, the conference attendee who also runs a t-shirt company called The Liberty Outfitters, said if Rand Paul trends more mainstream on foreign policy, that shift could become a deal breaker with Ron Paul supporters. It's clear many Ron Paul supporters don't view Rand as a replacement for his father. "You see Rand Paul compromise a lot more with Republicans and Democrats than you would with Ron Paul," said Andy August, another conference attendee. The eclectic group of activists who backed the Texas Republican in his back-to-back presidential runs still support him even as it appears many of them are ready to turn to his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, if he follows in his dad's footsteps and runs for president in 2016.
