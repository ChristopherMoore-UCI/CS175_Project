-- Prince Philip was hospitalized in Britain on Monday with a bladder infection, forcing him to miss part of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebration, Buckingham Palace said. After Princess Elizabeth became queen, Philip gave up his naval career to support her and embarked on a long career of charity work, notable for its initiatives for young people. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 in Westminster Abbey. Paul McCartney, one of the performers Monday night, addressed fans outside Buckingham Palace after news of Philip's hospitalization broke, wishing the prince a speedy recovery. Philip has made more than 5,000 public speeches during his working life, according to Buckingham Palace.
