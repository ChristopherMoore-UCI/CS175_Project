At 4Â½ years old, Tai Shan is more of a panda adolescent than a cub, but to Tai Shan fans, he will always be their baby. Tai Shan, the giant panda cub so many people have come to know and love, is about to board a flight to China. Over the years, some have even gone as far to say that Tai Shan was Washington's No. 1 resident -- even getting top billing over the president. Tai Shan will leave for China on Thursday via the "FedEx Panda Express." Tai Shan was born in the nation's capital, so you can confidently call him a Washingtonian.
