He saw Fryberg go up to a table of students, "came up from behind ... and fired about six bullets into the backs of them," Luton told CNN. Jaylen Fryberg, who witnesses said gunned down students at Marysville-Pilchuck High School, is the cousin of two of the wounded. Just a week ago, he had been named the high school's freshman homecoming prince, according to a YouTube video of the ceremony and accounts provided by students to CNN. -- When a teenage gunman opened fire at students in a high school cafeteria in Washington state, a relative said, he was not shooting at random targets. The Beretta .40-caliber handgun believed used in the shooting has been traced to Fryberg's father, a law enforcement source told CNN.
