Investigators found the 9-foot, female Burmese python in "dire condition" last week in a shack where the healer had set up shop in Cape Town, said Sarah Scarth, a spokeswoman for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. -- South African animal welfare inspectors say they seized an exotic snake that a traditional healer was using to try to influence World Cup matches. She said the SPCA would not be pursuing animal cruelty charges in the case because the sangoma, or healer, signed over ownership of the snake to the SPCA after meeting with officials. Local authorities tipped off the SPCA, Scarth said. Last week's seizure was not the first animal-related incident during the World Cup, Scarth said.
