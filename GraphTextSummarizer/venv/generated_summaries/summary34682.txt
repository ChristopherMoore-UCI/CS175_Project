" Cutts was convicted on February 15 of the murder of girlfriend Jessie Marie Davis and the aggravated murder of the unborn girl Davis had planned to name Chloe. During the guilt phase of the trial, Cutts sobbed on the witness stand as he admitted killing Davis and Chloe. According to testimony, Cutts, 30, rolled Davis' body in a comforter and dumped it in a park, leaving  toddler son Blake in the house alone at the crime scene in a soiled diaper. On the stand, Cutts said he went to pick up his son, Blake, and became agitated when Davis, 26, wasn't moving fast enough to get the boy ready. When he realized Davis was dead, Cutts said he panicked and put her in the back of his truck, so Blake wouldn't have to see his mother.
