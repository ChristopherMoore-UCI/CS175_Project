The theory is tied to a "piece of cloth" found near Johnson's body that investigators have sent for DNA analysis, according to court documents. Only after a FBI agent Smiedala showed her a surveillance photo of the couple entering the gates to Glacier National Park did Graham change her story and confess to pushing him off the ledge. The ruling followed a surprise appearance on the witness stand by Jordan Linn Graham, who faces first- and second-degree murder charges in the death of her 25-year-old husband, Cody Johnson. On July 11, according to an affidavit, Graham led a group of friends and relatives to a popular spot in the park called "The Loop," where they discovered Johnson's body. During her 15 minutes of testimony, Graham accused FBI agent Stacey Smiedala of making her uncomfortable by placing his hand on her knee during an interrogation.
