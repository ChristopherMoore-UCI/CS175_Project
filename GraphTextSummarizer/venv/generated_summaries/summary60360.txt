"Shadows," on the other hand, debuted on the (typically slow) weekend before Christmas, and is just now benefiting from a post-Christmas bump. That represents a 6 percent jump from Christmas weekend. This is because the first "Sherlock Holmes" opened on Christmas weekend, thereby inflating its initial figures. However, nearly every wide release saw their grosses rise compared to last weekend. Whereas most films dropped from Friday to Saturday this weekend (on account of Saturday being New Year's Eve), "War Horse" actually jumped 20 percent on Saturday.
