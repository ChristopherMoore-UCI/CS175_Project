Defiant Gordon wins 12th stage Compatriot Cyril Despres looks almost certain to win the motorcycle competition as he takes an 11-minute lead over nearest rival Marc Coma into Sunday's final stage in Lima after the Spaniard labored with gearbox problems. France's Stephane Peterhansel clinched the 13th and penultimate stage of the Dakar Rally on Saturday leaving him on the brink of claiming a 10th title in the event. "Today's stage was psychologically very tough," Despres said, AFP reported. Peterhansel, who has won the car event three times and the motorcycle event six times, has a lead of close to 43 minutes over Spain's Nani Roma. Driving a Mini, Peterhansel completed the 275 km timed stage from Nasca to Pisco in Peru ahead of South Africa's Ginel De Villiers driving a Toyota.
