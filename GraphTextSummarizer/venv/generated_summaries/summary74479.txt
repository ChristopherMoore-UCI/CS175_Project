The extremist group operating in Iraq and Syria has urged lone followers in the West to stage terror attacks in their home countries. Four of the men, who range in age from 20 to 24, were charged under the Terrorism Act and are accused of taking an oath of allegience to ISIS, according to a statement from police. A woman who was arrested was released on bail until next week, police said. The fifth man arrested was charged with a firearms offense, according to police.
