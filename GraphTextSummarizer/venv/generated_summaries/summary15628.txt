Assange and diplomatic asylum: A primer Standoff at embassy, after Ecuador grants asylum Opinion: Assange's stubborn grip hurt WikiLeaks Why Assange needs Ecuador and why Ecuador needs Assange -- Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa on Saturday defended his country's decision to grant WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange asylum, slamming Great Britain's behavior toward Ecuador as "intolerable" and "unacceptable."
