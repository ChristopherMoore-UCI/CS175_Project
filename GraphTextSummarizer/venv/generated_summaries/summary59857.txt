They lost 1-0 at home to Monaco which, in addition to Dortmund's defeat and those of both Bayern Munich and Schalke on Tuesday, meant Germany's four Champions League entrants all lost in the same week for the first time ever. Meanwhile, last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid created their own slice of history when progressing from the group stage in consecutive years for the first time ever. The jury may still be out for many Arsenal fans over the future of coach Arsenal Wenger but few can argue about the Frenchman leading the Londoners to the Champions League knockout stages for a 15th consecutive year. He achieved his latest qualification after goals from Yaya Sanogo, his first for the club at the 19th attempt, and Alexis Sanchez secured a 2-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund. The Italians need a draw to progress after winning 2-0 in Sweden against Malmo, with Fernando Llorente and Carlos Tevez earning Juve's first away win in the group stage for two years.
