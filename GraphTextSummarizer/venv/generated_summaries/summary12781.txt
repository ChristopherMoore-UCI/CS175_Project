Later, the studio found hits with "Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids," "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe," and "She-Ra, Princess of Power." Scheimer was a founder of Filmation, which began producing Saturday morning staples in the 1960s, including superhero stories and an animated version of "Star Trek." Lou Scheimer, a pioneer in Saturday morning and weekday afternoon television cartoons with hit shows such as "Superman," "Fat Albert" and "He-Man," has died at 84, according to his biographer. Scheimer died Thursday, said writer Andy Mangels, who said he spoke with Scheimer's family. Filmation's library was purchased by DreamWorks last year.
