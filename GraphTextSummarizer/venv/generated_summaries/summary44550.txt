During the sentencing, Judge James C. Hudson said he saw no signs of remorse from Laffer and requested that the Department of Correctional Services place him in solitary confinement without privileges, said James Saladino, principal clerk for Hudson. "He was given a maximum sentence of life in prison on five counts of murder and 25 years for each count of firearms charge, one for each victim," said James Saladino, principal clerk for Judge James C. Hudson. Laffer was charged with five counts of first degree murder, one for each victim plus one for multiple victims, and four counts of criminal use of a firearm in the first degree. Those things are for people like Gotti," he said, referring to the late mobster John Gotti. "They'll look at him closely and they'll do what is best for the Department of Correctional Services." Brady, who had pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree as an accomplice, was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison followed by five years of supervision.
