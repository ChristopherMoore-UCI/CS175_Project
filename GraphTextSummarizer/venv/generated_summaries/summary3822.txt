Borrell Associates, which tracks ad spending, predicts online ad purchases will make up about 1.5% of the candidates' overall campaign ad budgets. Moffat said that while TV ads are like hitting voters over the head with a hammer, Internet ads are more like using a scalpel. That means he is on pace to spend a record amount on digital ads, according to ad spending experts. In the first few months of 2012, Obama's campaign bought nearly $16.4 million worth of online ads after spending almost $2.2 million last year -- even though he didn't face a Democratic challenger. The campaign for Mitt Romney, who survived a heated primary race to become the presumptive Republican nominee, spent $7.8 million for online ads this year, in addition to the $500,000 it spent in 2011.
