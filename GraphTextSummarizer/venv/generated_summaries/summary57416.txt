The report noted a major increase in reports of sexual assaults in recent years -- from 3,604 in 2012 to 5,518 in 2013 and then 5,983 in 2014 -- and said it's "unlikely" the bump is happening because more crimes are taking place. Victims of sexual assault can file "restricted" reports, which allows them to access health services without launching investigations and legal proceedings, or "unrestricted" reports, which do trigger independent investigations. In the 136-page report due to be publicly released Thursday, the Pentagon said more victims are reporting sexual assaults. "Given the underreported nature of sexual assault, the department believes this increase in reporting is likely due to greater victim confidence in the response system," the report said. The number of active-duty women who said they were victims of unwanted sexual contact in the last year was 4.3 percent in 2014 -- down from 6.1 percent in 2012 -- the report said, citing surveys from those two years.
