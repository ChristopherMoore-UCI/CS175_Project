The expert's view Pedometers have what researchers call a "short feedback loop," which means they give you the opportunity to immediately impact the information they relay, according to Dr. Dena Bravata, a senior research scientist at Stanford University. A systematic review she conducted in 2007 on studies about pedometer use showed that participants who used a pedometer increased the number of steps they take per day by more than 2,000, when compared to people who didn't wear them. Walking 10,000 steps a day is one of the ways many people choose to meet their recommended guidelines for physical activity as set out by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. While many devices now offer high-tech features like data uploading, any simple step counter can be effective, Bravata says. Walking is one of the easiest ways to boost physical activity, but if you're like me, you probably don't do enough of it.
