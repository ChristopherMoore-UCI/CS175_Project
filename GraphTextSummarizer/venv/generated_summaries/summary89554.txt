Once retired from the series, the vessel was renamed Pacific and was used for Mediterranean Sea tours. Izmir Ship Recycling has to finish removing water and turn the ship off its side so authorities can continue the probe. The ship, which had just completed its final voyage and was scheduled to be dismantled, was damaged while entering the port of Aliaga in Turkey's Izmir province and began taking on water in a storage area under the main engine. Engine-exhaust buildup led to the toxic exposure, according to Izmir Ship Recycling Co., the firm that recently purchased the ship for 2.5 million euros (about $3.33 million). Six other people were injured and were released from the hospital after receiving treatment, according to Izmir Ship Recycling.
