"... Simply stated, under governing California law, Chief Judge Walker currently cannot marry his partner, but his decision in this case, and the sweeping injunction he entered to enforce it, would give him a right to do so." At no point prior to the entry of judgment did Chief Judge Walker disclose that he is in a now 10-year long, committed same-sex relationship. "Only if Chief Judge Walker had unequivocally disavowed any interest in marrying his partner could the parties and the public be confident that he did not have a direct personal interest in the outcome of the case," the motion said. "In this case, it is undeniable that Chief Judge Walker failed to make the required disclosure. "The fact that Judge Walker was biased in a generic sense was obvious from his decision itself," Sprigg said.
