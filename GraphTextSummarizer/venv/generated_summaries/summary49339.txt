In the months after the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, FBI agents conducted surveillance of U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and uncovered detailed information about his alleged use of prostitutes, according to newly released FBI documents. The documents obtained by Judicial Watch also include some handwritten surveillance reports by FBI agents. When interviewed by the FBI a day later, she said she thought al-Awlaki "looked like Osama bin Laden. By that time, U.S. officials said, he had become a key member of the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and was involved in two failed terror plots against the United States. He also may have had contact with one of those men and a third hijacker, Hani Hanjour, when he served at a mosque in Falls Church, Virginia, in 2001.
