The lighthearted travel documentary, originally produced by Gervais and longtime collaborator Steve Merchant for Britain's Sky TV, follows a reluctant Pilkington to the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramids and every "World Wonder" in between. He knew the comedian, who has been his colleague since Pilkington began working on the "The Ricky Gervais Show" on London radio station Xfm in 2001, had designed every step of the journey for maximum discomfort. "I kept saying, 'I don't want to do this,' but [Gervais] was making me go," Pilkington said. " Back in London, Gervais cackled at Pilkington's candid reactions. "She said I'd regret passing this up, and I can't say no to her." Much of Pilkington's reluctance stemmed from Gervais' habitual teasing.
