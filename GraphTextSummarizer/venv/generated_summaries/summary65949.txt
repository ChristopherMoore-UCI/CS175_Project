"You talk to any aviator in the world, ask what they would like to fly, and if they don't say the F-22 then they are lying," U.S. Major Derek Routt told The Atlantic magazine. A lot of its members want to see more F-22s taking off, to keep the U.S. air force ahead of potential rivals and protect thousands of factory jobs across the country. "We need to maintain that air superiority," said Congressman Phil Gingrey, whose district is home to the main F-22 assembly line. "The reality is we are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan," Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, "and the F-22 has not performed a single mission in either theater." Is the F-22 essential military spending or a waste of money?
