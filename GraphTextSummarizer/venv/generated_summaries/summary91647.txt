Chief Michael Maloney of the police department in Greenland, a town of about 3,500, was killed in a shooting that wounded four other officers on Thursday night at a home in the community, said Attorney General Michael Delaney. During a news conference Friday, Delaney was asked why a police chief would be part of a dangerous mission so close to his retirement. -- A police chief from southeastern New Hampshire who planned to retire in a few days has been shot to death while trying to execute a search warrant, authorities said Friday. The number of officers who died in the line of duty in 2011 increased 16% nationwide from last year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. " Two suspects, a man and a woman, were found dead in the home after a long stand off, Delaney said.
