Teams worked from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. over the past few months to install the fiber optic network, choosing late night hours in order to have minimal impact on bridge traffic. The final result is 25,000 LED lights strung up along the 1.8-mile stretch of bridge connecting San Francisco and Treasure Island. It's operating on a very primal level," said artist Leo Villareal, who has been working on the project for the past two and a half years. The Bay Bridge, which opened just six months before the Golden Gate in November 1936, can't compete with its neighbor's iconic touches: epic views, vivid orange paint job and art deco detailing. Relieved to finally hit the On button for the project after years of work, Villareal isn't thinking that far into the future at the moment.
