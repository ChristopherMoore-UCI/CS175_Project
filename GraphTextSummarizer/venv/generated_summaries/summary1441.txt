United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon handed President Clinton additional responsibility Wednesday for earthquake-ravaged Haiti, charging him with overseeing aid efforts as well as reconstruction. Ban asked Clinton "to assume a leadership role in coordinating international aid efforts, from emergency response to new construction of Haiti." He will help coordinate the work of U.N. agencies and other international partners in Haiti, including government donors, private investors and non-governmental organizations, the statement said. "I cannot find any other better suited leader than yourself, Mr. President," Ban told Clinton at the United Nations on Wednesday morning. "You have demonstrated extremely important leadership," Ban told Clinton, who is already the United Nations' special envoy to Haiti.
