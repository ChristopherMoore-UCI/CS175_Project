The biggest loss came Sunday evening when Canada's hockey team, full of NHL all-stars, lost to the United States, a team known for its youth and Olympics inexperience. The somber mood was made worse by the news that the 55-year-old mother of Canada's top figure skater, Joannie Rochette, died in Vancouver just a few days before she was her to see her daughter compete. It was a stark contrast to the prior Sunday, when fans spontaneously sang "O Canada" late into the night when many of them knew they had to work the next day and should be at home. Still, most observers feel that if Canada doesn't medal in men's hockey, its national winter sport, the Olympics will be a disaster. But with one week left in the Olympics, the United States has a leading 24 medals, but Canada has only nine.
