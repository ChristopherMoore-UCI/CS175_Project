-- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week condemned China's "unnecessary escalation" of tensions between the two nations over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. Asia in 2013 may not be sliding towards war and China and Japan understand how mutually beneficial relations have been, and how much they risk losing, but we also know the folly of assuming risk away. In January, a succession of prominent Japanese politicians visited China, signaling a thaw in relations. Like China today, Japan felt that the international status quo was biased and denying what it deemed its legitimate aspirations. China's Global Times pugnaciously dismissed Abe's allegations as a "self-directed and self-acted farce," staged in preparation for his visit to Washington later this month.
