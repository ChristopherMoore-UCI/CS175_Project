As the U.S. men's team played its way out of a tough opening-round group that included Germany, Portugal and Ghana, U.S. Web users spent a total of 847 years and 143 days engaged with FIFA content. FIFA, international soccer's ruling body, says that more than 1 billion people engaged with World Cup content through its website, social media accounts and mobile app. "This has been the first truly mobile and social World Cup," FIFA President Sepp Blatter said. "The carnival atmosphere experienced at the World Cup viewing parties, where fans filled whole city blocks across the U.S., shows the passion that JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann's side has instilled in U.S. sports fans." Compare that to the 7 million people in Argentina and 5 million in Germany, the match's actual participants, and you can see that U.S. interest in the tourney didn't disappear when the American side bowed out.
