Syrian security forces have killed, arrested, and tortured children in their homes, their schools, or on the streets," said Lois Whitman, children's rights director at Human Rights Watch. And where the state-run SANA news agency says armed terrorist gangs are to blame for the violence, activists point to images of children, their bodies studded by shrapnel, running fearfully in rubble-strewn streets or asking, from under thick bandages enveloping a tiny head, what they've done to deserve such violence. " As the world talks about how to respond to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's bloody crackdown on the uprising in his country, opposition activists in the country say his military and security services are engaged in a vicious campaign of destruction meant to wipe out the opposition. Throughout the country, government forces have taken over schools and hospitals to use as detention centers and sniper nests, Human Rights Watch reported this week. Troops raided Daraa in April, shortly after the uprising began, according to Syrian opposition groups.
