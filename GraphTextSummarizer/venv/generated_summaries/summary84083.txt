Baker nearly collapsed during a court appearance Monday in Catawba County, North Carolina, CNN Charlotte affiliate WSOC reported. Zahra Baker was reported missing from her Hickory, North Carolina, home in October 2010; some of her dismembered remains were found a month later. -- An attorney for Elisa Baker, the stepmother accused of killing 10-year-old Zahra Baker, said Monday he plans to file for a change of venue because of the publicity the North Carolina case has received. After standing in front of a judge for nearly 15 minutes, Baker, who was in shackles, became unsteady on her feet, nearly hitting her head on a table before her attorney grabbed her, according to WSOC. Defense attorney Scott Reilly told "In Session" he did not see most of what occurred because he was addressing the judge, but he confirmed Baker was taken from the courtroom to be checked by medical staff.
