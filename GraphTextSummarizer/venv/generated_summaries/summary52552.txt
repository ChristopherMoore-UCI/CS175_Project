They carry guns -- and misuse guns -- thanks to a national system of gun regulation that makes guns easily accessible to those least likely to use guns responsibly. The horrifying toll of gun violence on black America explains why black Americans are so much more likely than whites to favor gun control. They don't blame guns for gun violence. If you look at the world that way, gun control must seem a pointless diversion from the real problem: not guns, but one particular group of gun owners. The gun laws intended to put guns into the hands of "good guys" are the laws that also multiply guns in the hands of "bad guys" -- bad guys who might not have become such bad guys if the guns had not been available to their hands.
