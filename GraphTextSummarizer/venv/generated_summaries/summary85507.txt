Officials decided Sandy caused so much death and destruction when it hit the Caribbean and the U.S. East Coast in October last year that the name should be removed from the rotating list, according to organization spokeswoman Claire Nullis. The name has now been retired from the official list of names for Atlantic tropical storms, the World Meteorological Organization said Friday. The World Meteorological Organization is a U.N. agency that maintains the list of Atlantic tropical storms and decides which names to retire. Starting in 2018, the next year that Sandy was due on the list again as the "S" name in the annual alphabetical rundown of storm names, the name will be replaced with Sara, Nullis said. Sandy was a huge storm, with winds extending 175 miles from its eye, making it much larger than most storms of its type.
