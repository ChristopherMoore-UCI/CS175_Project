-- Disney star Demi Lovato had an "altercation" with a dancer on her concert tour before dropping out of the show to seek help with what her publicist called "emotional and physical issues," a source close to Lovato's camp said Tuesday. The same source denied media reports that Lovato fought with actress Ashley Greene, the current girlfriend of Joe Jonas. "People say sticks and stones may break your bones, but names can never hurt you, but that's not true," Lovato wrote on a anti-bullying website last month. Lovato left the world tour with the Jonas Brothers and checked into an inpatient treatment center last weekend, a statement released by her publicist said Monday. Lovato recently suffered a public end to a short romance with Jonas, one of the three brothers she had been traveling the world with.
