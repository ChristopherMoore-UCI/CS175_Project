The National HIV/AIDS Strategy, released in 2010, is the nation's first comprehensive road map with clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015: reduce new HIV infections, increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV and reduce HIV-related disparities. -- Last year on World AIDS Day, President Barack Obama said that we can achieve an AIDS-free generation "if we stay focused, and if we keep fighting," and challenged the world to "come together to set new goals" in the war against AIDS. About 50,000 Americans continue to become infected with HIV each year, with nearly 80% of infections among men and two-thirds of new infections nationally among gay and bisexual men. American investments through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) as well as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have been transformative in the global response to AIDS. The latest surveillance data show that new HIV infections have been declining among black women and injecting drug users.
