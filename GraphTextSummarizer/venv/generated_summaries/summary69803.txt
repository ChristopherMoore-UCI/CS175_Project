The guest list was kept to Hilton's friends and family, including her sister Nicky Hilton and her boyfriend Doug Reinhardt. The launch at the Thompson Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, lacked the typical Hilton entourage of paparazzi, media scrum and celebrity friends. Now she is in the second phase of the program, the disappearing act," said Samantha Yanks, editor-in-chief of Gotham and Hamptons magazines, two publications which often featured content about Hilton. Hilton leveraged her fame from "The Simple Life" by pushing the Paris Hilton brand into books, perfumes, shoes and nightclubs. The line includes the "Celebrity Styler" and the "Ultimate Styling Brush," in Hilton's signature pink.
