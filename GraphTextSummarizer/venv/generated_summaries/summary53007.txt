Separately, military trials of those who "committed criminal acts under the Gadhafi regime" began Sunday in the city of Benghazi, National Transitional Council member Mohammed El Sayah said. -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, the son of Libya's deposed leader Moammar Gadhafi, could go on trial "within weeks or months," the country's interior minister said Sunday. The investigations into the death of Moammar Gadhafi after his capture last year could also be completed soon, Fawzy Abdilal said. Moammar Gadhafi was killed in October, two months after he was deposed by rebel fighters. Benghazi was the center of resistance to the Gadhafi regime last year.
