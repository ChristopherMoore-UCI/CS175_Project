Pro-democracy legislator Fernando Cheung, who tried to physically stop the protesters, said it was a "major setback for the movement." "I threw myself in front of them, I told them this would only hurt the movement, that this whole campaign is about demanding genuine democracy which has nothing to do with breaking into Legislative Council," he told CNN. A small group of masked protesters stormed Hong Kong's government headquarters in the early hours of Wednesday, using metal barricades and hurling concrete slabs to smash through a glass door. Some members of Hong Kong's popular online forums, frustrated by the protracted stalemate, put out calls for protesters to storm the government building late Tuesday night. " Occupy Central for Love and Peace, the group that originated the idea for occupying downtown Hong Kong, now nicknamed the "Umbrella Movement" said it "strongly condemned" the attack on the complex. Hong Kong's Legislative Council said it would reschedule its meetings and canceled public tours for the day.
