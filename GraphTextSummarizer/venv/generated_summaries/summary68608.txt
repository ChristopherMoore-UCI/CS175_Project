In high school, I would wear it underneath my soccer and baseball jerseys. As you know, my goal is to complete the Nautica Malibu Triathlon in September with my fellow Fit Nation teammates. Share a photo of it on iReport or Instagram using the hashtag #TshirtTales. When I die, I want the people packing up my belongings to find my collection of old T-shirts. What would I find if I were to go through your stack of T-shirts?
