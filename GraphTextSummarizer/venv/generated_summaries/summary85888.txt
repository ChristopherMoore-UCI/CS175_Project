3 killed in Chicago weekend violence Blame weak gun laws for violence, Chicago's top cop says The Department of Justice points to the cross-state component of gun crime in Chicago as one reason for the federal-local partnership: Sixty percent of the guns seized in Chicago crimes originate from out of state. In announcing the reinforcements, Attorney General Eric Holder says that his office "will continue to do everything in its power to help the city of Chicago combat gun violence. The federal government will provide additional aid to Chicago's efforts to battle gun violence. These new agents are a sign of the federal government's ongoing commitment to helping local leaders ensure Chicago's streets are safe."
