They were beaten 2-0 at second flight Brighton, who had also put them out last year. They trailed 2-1 at Upton Park after a pair of headed goals by James Collins, but the prolific Robin van Persie, on as a late substitute, equalized in injury time. The other big upsets saw non-league Luton put out second flight Wolves, while Cardiff, who look set for promotion to the EPL, were beaten 2-1 by lowly Macclesfield. Tottenham Hotspur, among the favorites for the competition, thrashed third flight Coventry 3-0 at White Hart Lane. Spurs were shocked by Coventry in a famous 1987 final, but there was to be no repeat as United States international Clint Dempsey scored twice in the first half.
