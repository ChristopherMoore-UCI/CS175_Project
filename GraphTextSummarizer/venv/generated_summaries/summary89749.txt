As new cell phone video emerged Wednesday of the fatal confrontation that claimed the life of Kajieme Powell, a 25-year-old African-American man, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson tried to explain the officers' action in an appearance on CNN. He takes a few steps back as officers get out of the police cruiser and approach him, armed with guns. The incident took place Tuesday, less than four miles from the suburb of Ferguson where, just days earlier, a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen -- and touched off violent protests. Dotson said Powell was suspected of walking out of a convenience store with two energy drinks and a package of pastries that he didn't pay for. " Questions raised Dotson said Powell was "acting erratically, walking back and forth up and down the street."
