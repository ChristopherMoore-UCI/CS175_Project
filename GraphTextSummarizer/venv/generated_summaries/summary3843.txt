The statement issued Tuesday by Seevakumaran's family, initially to the Sarasota County, Florida, sheriff's office, didn't shed much light on his thinking. Instead of a mass killing early Monday morning, police reported only one fatality: Seevakumaran. Whatever his relatives and acquaintances thought of him, police said they believe that Seevakumaran had devious plans of his own. "I just slammed the door," the roommate told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night. "All indications are, just like the rest of his life, he was alone," UCF police Chief Richard Beary said Tuesday.
