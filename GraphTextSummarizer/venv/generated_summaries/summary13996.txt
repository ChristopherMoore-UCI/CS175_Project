Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Zhang Yujun was executed for endangering public safety and Geng Jinping was executed for producing and selling toxic food, the Xinhua news agency said. The tainted formula came to light in September 2008, after several babies fell ill from drinking formula that contained melamine. The tainted milk caused kidney stones and urinary tract problems in hundreds of thousands of children. Among them, Zhang and Geng were sentenced to death, and most others received at least 15 years in prison.
