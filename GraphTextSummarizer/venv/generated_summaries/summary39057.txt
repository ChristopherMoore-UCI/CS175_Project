A keen basketball player at high school, Inoue says drawing a basketball Manga was a natural way for him to combine his two loves, and he believes "Slam Dunk" readers could see the obvious enjoyment he took from drawing basketball. Inoue is credited by some with having popularized basketball amongst a whole generation of high school students. In 2007, his publisher inaugurated a scholarship that sends high school basketball players to study in America, and in 2010, Inoue received a commendation from the Japanese Basketball Association, for his services to the sport. In particular, Inoue says he pours himself into the task of capturing facial expressions. He also draws on first-hand observation: While working on "Real," an award-winning wheelchair basketball Manga begun in 2001, Inoue attended a Paralympic game to study the players' musculature and posture.
