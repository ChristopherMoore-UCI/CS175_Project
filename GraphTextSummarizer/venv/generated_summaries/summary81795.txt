Before "Akira," anime seen in America was cheaply produced and relegated to Saturday morning cartoons, said Joe Wos, founder of Toonseum, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, museum and website devoted to the art of comics and animation. His devotion to "Akira" started with an unassuming, purple-hued background cel that opened his eyes to the level of art that is possible through anime. Such detailed imagery was not always a part of anime, but in 1988, Katsuhiro Otomo's movie "Akira" ushered in a wave of creativity that has inspired fans ever since. Peacock travels to fan conventions and animation companies such as Pixar to give lectures about the art and influence of "Akira. By offering mature art and story lines, "['Akira'] saved anime," said Wos, who is collaborating with Peacock on the "Art of Akira" exhibit.
