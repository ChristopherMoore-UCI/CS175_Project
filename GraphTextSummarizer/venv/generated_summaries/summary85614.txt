The Galaxy Nexus provides a clear view of the next generation of powerful Android phones, and I look forward to seeing what comes next. But many older Android apps will stick a button, which looks like ellipses printed in Hebrew, on the end of those touchscreen buttons. The Galaxy Nexus' operating system takes many of the concepts that were designed for Android tablets, shrinks them and unlocks their great potential to an audience that will likely be much larger. Android tablets have not fared particularly well in the market, which means that this interface will look fresh to most people. These pictures are generally too small to be useful, unlike on Android tablets where this provides a handy visual cue.
