A road trip to the former Denmark across the bridge The southern tip of Sweden used to be Danish, and still looks it, so no wonder Copenhagen locals scoot across the bridge connecting the two countries on weekends to eat in the province of Skane, known for its organic farms, pottery and fine restaurants as well as its wild beauty. The lively town of Malmo, Sweden, can be reached by train in half an hour, but it's worth renting a car to explore both the area on the Danish side north of Copenhagen, where the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art is a main attraction, and the lovely coastal countryside of southern Sweden. Pay extreme care when getting out of a taxi; Copenhagen roads have two curbs, and only one of them is designed for pedestrians. Striking ultra-modern buildings include Copenhagen's Black Diamond conference center on the waterfront. Lagkagehuset is the pace for great Danish, as popular to start the day in Copenhagen as a post-partying hot dog is to end the night.
