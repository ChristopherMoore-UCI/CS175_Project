"The real question is, why is this institution continuing to protect him?" Eilender also noted that the majority of the women's basketball team at Holy Cross holds athletic scholarships, making them "beholden to the school." "Everyone is on scholarships," Eilender said. Gibbons is currently in his 29th season as coach of the basketball team, and according to the school's website, he is the most victorious coach in Holy Cross' history. Cooper has since transferred this fall to New York University and is not playing basketball, according to Eilender. According to Eilender, former players have now reached out to Cooper thanking her for taking a stand against something that has been going on for years without consequence. In the lawsuit, Cooper alleges that the behavior of Gibbons' exceeds that of former Rutgers men's basketball coach Mike Rice.
