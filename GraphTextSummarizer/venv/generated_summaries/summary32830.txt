He was referring to the recorded conversation released last month, in which he told friend V. Stiviano that she should stop bringing black people to his games. "It was like she was baiting me just to say things," Sterling told Cooper. In perhaps the most bizarre part of his interview, Sterling lambasted the retired Los Angeles Lakers legend, who was mentioned several times in Sterling's recorded exchange with Stiviano. And in 2003, the nonprofit Housing Rights Center and a group of tenants who lived in Sterling's properties sued, accusing him of "numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices," according to court documents. Sterling "vehemently denied" the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of "being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas," according to court documents.
