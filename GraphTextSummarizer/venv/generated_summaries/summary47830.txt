Passengers can expect items like Iranian caviar or stir-fried lobster in black bean sauce. In first class, Emirates focuses on regional menus. In an effort to really make it "worth it," airlines have started offering passengers everything from on-board apartments (yes, really) to post-boarding limo rentals and private jet access. Guests can avail themselves of a 25-minute "shower spa" treatment (though actual shower time is limited to five minutes). Cabins come with a personal minibar, adjustable lighting, private vanity table, mirror and wardrobe.
