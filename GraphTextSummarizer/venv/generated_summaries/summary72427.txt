The nurse who tended to Boston Marathon bombing victim Krystle Campbell near the finish line during her final moments of life would like to meet her parents in the hopes he could give them some solace in their grief. For the next 10 minutes, Segatore, who works in the intensive care unit at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, an EMT and a physician gave her CPR. While he was giving Campbell CPR, he noticed black marks on her face, which he thinks might have been gunpowder, indicating she was very close to the blast. Even though he knew she probably wouldn't understand a word he said, Segatore told the woman he was a nurse and would take good care of her. Stephen Segatore would like to tell Campbell's parents that she didn't die alone, and she didn't suffer for long.
