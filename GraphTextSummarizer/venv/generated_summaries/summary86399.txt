Zain Verjee: I cant' get image of Westgate bodies out of my mind Kenya's Counter-Terrorism Office said Nabhan was related to former senior Al Qaeda in Somalia operative, Saleh Ali Nabhan, who was killed in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia in 2009. Saleh Ali Nabhan was killed when U.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on his car in September 2009. Kenya's Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told PBS "NewsHour" that the attackers came from Kenya, the UK and the U.S. "The Americans, from the information we have, are young men, about between maybe 18 and 19." Sources within the group said as many as three attackers were from the United States, two were from Somalia, and the others were one each from Canada, Finland, Kenya and the United Kingdom. He was believed to be connected to the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
