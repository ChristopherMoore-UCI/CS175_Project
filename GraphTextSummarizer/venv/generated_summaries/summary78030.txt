" In New York, a representative of Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. secretary-general "welcomes the efforts of the League of Arab States to end the bloodshed and promote a political solution" and urged Syrian authorities to agree to the league's proposal to send an observer mission to protect civilians in Syria. -- Syria's failure to respond to Friday's deadline for it to allow Arab League observers into the country to monitor the government's response to civil unrest moves the country a step closer to economic sanctions from its neighbors, a senior Arab League diplomat said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the move by Arab League diplomats meeting in Cairo was unprecedented. The 22-country Arab League suspended Syria from its membership this month after President Bashar al-Assad's regime ignored demands to end its crackdown on citizens. "It will either continue this crackdown policy against its people and become isolated more and more, or it will say yes to this well-intentioned Arab League proposal, sign this protocol and observers will monitor the situation on the ground by going to all Syrian cities.
