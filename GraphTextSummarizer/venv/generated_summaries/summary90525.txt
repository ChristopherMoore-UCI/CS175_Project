For those of you who are owners, you know it is notorious for dropping calls, having terrible reception, and overall, they're really awesome for playing Plants vs. Zombies and Sudoku, but for actual phone use, my five-pound Motorola from 1997 worked better. Having your boyfriend live 1,300 miles away isn't ideal, but as far as problems in relationships go, things could be much worse: He could be in Australia or I could have caught him cheating on me with various tattooed women after I won an Academy Award and adopted a baby. I know there is Skype and video chatting, among other sources of technological-aided communication, but I'm stubborn, and I want to be able to call my boyfriend when I want to. Here's the real problem: a third party has entered my relationship, causing fights, miscommunication and anxiety. Eventually, we managed to reach each other and everything was totally fine, but if it weren't for our iPhones, those two hours of anxiety would have never happened.
