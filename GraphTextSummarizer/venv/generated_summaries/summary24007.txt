Some question whether Boren has the legal authority, as head of a public institution, to expel students on the basis of their free speech, even racist hate speech. David Boren can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen. Later, Boren said he'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because "we don't provide student services for bigots." Boren said that real Sooners are not racists or bigots; they believe in equal opportunity, treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family. And I've been thinking about it intensely,  not only because I care about race and civic leadership in America, but also because Boren was my first boss, when he was a U.S. senator.
