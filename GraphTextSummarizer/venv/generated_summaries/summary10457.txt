"We're going into the biggest season of our careers and it's going to be huge playing the Olympics," Edin told CNN's Human to Hero series. Edin has already visualized capturing gold at the Olympics. A world junior title followed and at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, not far from Victoria in British Columbia, Sweden finished a respectable fourth under Edin. " Edin decided to try curling after he watched the Swedish women win bronze at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
