CNN asked Hans-Georg Rodek, film critic of the respected German newspaper "Die Weldt" (The World), for his take on Cannes and the role of the critic. Loved and loathed in equal measure, these cinematic scribblers can influence film fans' decisions on whether or not to buy a ticket to the movie theater, so even in a world becoming increasingly dominated by amateur critics on social media there's still a degree of responsibility in delivering honest, considered opinion. HGR: It's something that humanity doesn't really need but it makes life easier because if you trust certain critics then you can say 'Ok, he says it's a good film and I never agree with him therefore it's a bad film and the other way around. If 'Grace of Monaco was a marvellous film and the critics say it's bad film it will still be successful. I'm just a film lover and I take that from my experience I'm entitled to talk a little authoritatively about films, that's all.
