The blast targeted a passenger van in the Lower Dir district near the village of Bunr, said Hussain Ahmed, the official. A roadside bomb killed 14 people and wounded six in northwest Pakistan on Sunday, a government official said. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. The attack took place in an area of the city where several international agencies have offices. In May 2011, a remote-controlled car bomb targeted a convoy of U.S. Consulate vehicles in Peshawar, killing one person and wounding 11.
