-- AC Milan reclaimed second place in Italy's Serie A with a tempestuous 2-1 victory at Napoli on Monday night which saw the home side reduced to 10 men for half the game before a near-brawl erupted late in the match. Abbiati was again called into action on the hour mark when he denied a fierce effort from Slovakia midfielder Marek Hamsik as Napoli continued to press forward, but Ibrahimovic made it 2-0 in the 71st minute with his third league goal since returning to Serie A from Barcelona. Napoli forced two corners in the five minutes of time added on but could not level despite De Sanctis joining in the attacks, giving Milan a morale-boosting win ahead of this weekend's clash with fifth-placed Juventus. However, Lavezzi almost equalized before the halftime whistle blew with a superb header that required a flying save from Milan keeper Christian Abbiati. Milan reduced Lazio's lead to two points after eight rounds thanks to a goal in each half from forwards Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, putting Massimiliano Allegri's team two clear of third-placed city rivals Inter. Napoli, who were left in sixth place, had midfielder Michele Pazienza sent off in first-half injury-time for a second handball offense but managed to reduce the deficit with 12 minutes to play with an ingenious effort from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi.
