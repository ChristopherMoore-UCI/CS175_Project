The Frisky: Ways men try to impress women I watch "True Blood" because chicks will dig it when I can talk about Eric and Maryann and Action Stackhouse; it's how I "open" a pick-up artist-style "set." Horror movies, books, and television shows reflect our collective fears, and "True Blood" is awesome because it sneaks male fears into a female-oriented program. When I try to explain my ardor for HBO's trashy-fabulous soap opera "True Blood" to my dude friends, they either shrug and change the topic, or question whether I've been writing for ladyblogs for too long and am suffering from a form of Stockholm Syndrome. And because, on some level, we know that besides being vehicles for sperm, our other important, if lesser, genetic imperative is to defend our loved ones from hordes of unthinking, flesh-eating metaphors for current social anxieties. Before any feminist blood vessels burst, let me explain that this fantasy goes hand-in-hand with a male-specific fear that speaks to ancient genetic programming.
