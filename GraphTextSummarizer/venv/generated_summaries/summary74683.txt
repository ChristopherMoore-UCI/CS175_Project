Well, that's easy, because when I grew up in Hong Kong my parents used to take me to hotels, and back in the '50s and '60s the hotels are where people went for nice dinners or nice brunches. Best Western hotels are independently owned and operated, what that means is when you check in to someone's hotel, you are really checking in to someone's home. There's many more hotels coming on board, so without all the supply, we need to be careful.
