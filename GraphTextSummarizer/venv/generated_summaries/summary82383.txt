-- "First, please let me apologize to my family, friends, staff and fellow Idahoans for the cloud placed over Idaho. "I love my wife, family, friends, staff and Idaho. In pleading guilty, I overreacted in Minneapolis, because of the stress of the Idaho Statesman's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around Idaho. I regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife, family, friends, staff, and fellow Idahoans. Over the years, I have accomplished a lot for Idaho, and I hope Idahoans will allow me to continue to do that.
