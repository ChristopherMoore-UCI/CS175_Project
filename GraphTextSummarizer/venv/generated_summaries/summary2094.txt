The lengthy list of openings includes positions in finance and accounting, security, intelligence analysis, training and education, nursing and counseling, physical surveillance, electrical engineering, physical and social sciences, and auto mechanics. The FBI's unexpectedly large number of job openings results more from attrition and a wave of retirements than from growing government appropriations, Bureau officials told CNN. The FBI routinely advertises openings for individuals with critical skills in computer science and language fluency. The FBI lists openings throughout the year, but seldom has anything close to the current number of available positions. "This is a great time to apply for a great job in the FBI," said the bureau's chief spokesman, Richard Kolko.
