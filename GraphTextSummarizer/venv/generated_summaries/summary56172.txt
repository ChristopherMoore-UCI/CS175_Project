In 2007, Daylight Saving got a few weeks longer, running from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November. Daylight Saving Time officially started at 2 a.m. on Sunday. Daylight Saving Time ends the first Sunday in November. Benjamin Franklin first thought up the idea of daylight saving in 1784. About 70 countries around the world observe daylight saving, but many countries near the equator do not.
