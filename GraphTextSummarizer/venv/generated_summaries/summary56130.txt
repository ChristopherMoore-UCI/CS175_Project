Despite a resolution passed in July by 370 members -- 180 Republicans and 190 Democrats -- that says the President "shall not deploy or maintain ... a sustained combat role in Iraq without specific statutory authorization," Congressional leaders have not yet determined if they will force Congressional authorization -- less than two months before the midterm elections. Three of the key anti-war members of Congress are considering supporting expanded military action against ISIS -- but the key word there is "considering." Rep. Barbara Lee said she "can't say" if she'd oppose expanded military operations. The California Democrat was the only member of Congress to vote against giving President George W. Bush -- and subsequent presidents that would follow him -- nearly unlimited authority to wage war just days after the September 11 terror attacks. "I've always regretted that vote," he told CNN of his vote that authorized U.S. intervention in Iraq. Rounding out the vocal antiwar trio, Massachusetts Democrat James McGovern, said he's "very uneasy" about the prospect of expanded war but stopped short of opposing it.
