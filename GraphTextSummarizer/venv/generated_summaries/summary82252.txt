It's not standing by and saying, 'Well, it's a family affair.'" Biden's remarks come as tribal authorities prepare to take on new authority in March 2015 to prosecute non-Native Americans who perpetrate domestic violence on tribal lands, which was included in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act last year. " Attorney General Eric Holder, who spoke after Biden at the conference, said already three tribes are part of a pilot program this year that has charged more than 20 non-Indians in domestic violence cases and touted increased collaboration between federal officials and tribal authorities. Vice President Joe Biden called on Native American leaders to continue fighting what he called an "epidemic" of domestic violence on tribal lands and throughout the United States. Native American women face the highest rate of domestic violence and abuse in the U.S. Biden tailored the message of the White House's "It's On Us" campaign against sexual assault to address the disproportionately high rate of domestic violence in Native American communities, emphasizing the need for bystander intervention and community action during the White House Tribal Nations Conference.
