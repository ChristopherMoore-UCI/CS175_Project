A controversial New York Police Department surveillance unit that cataloged information on Muslim communities has been disbanded, according to the department. When Bratton was introduced as New York City police commissioner, he talked about bringing the police and the public "together in a collaboration of mutual respect and mutual trust." "I will get it right again in New York City," Bratton said. The unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included Muslim-owned business and mosques across the New York region and has been the target of controversy and civil lawsuits. "While we welcome the dismantling of the Demographics Unit as a long overdue step towards reining in the unconstitutional excesses of the NYPD, what has to stop is the practice of suspicion-less surveillance of Muslim communities, not just the unit assigned to do it," said a joint statement by Muslim Advocates and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the lawsuit in 2012. That suit, Hassan v. City of New York, was dismissed in February and is currently under appeal.
