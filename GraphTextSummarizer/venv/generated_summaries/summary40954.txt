In a world now defined by the presence of multiple faiths inside many nations and as American Muslims learn to come together to protect their own constitutional rights in an old democracy, it would only be fitting if they were to raise their voice in defense of other religious minorities seeking to secure their basic rights to religious liberties in countries aspiring to become democracies. As much as the U.S. government is in the worst position to come to the Baha'is' aid, Muslim Americans are perfectly poised to voice their outrage against the abuse of religious minorities in Iran or anywhere else in the Muslim world, for they know what it feels like to be a political pariah and a religious minority in an overwhelmingly alternate context. While other religious minorities are specifically protected under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, this is not the case for the Baha'is. Having waged war on two Muslim nations, the U.S. government is in the least favorable position to defend the rights of non-Muslim minorities in their own homeland. The experiences of Muslims as a minority here in the United States, or in Europe for that matter, gives them a unique position to raise their voice against the abuse of non-Muslim minorities in Iran and the rest of the Muslim world.
