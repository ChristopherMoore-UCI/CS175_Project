There is no clear theme linking the fires, which have struck churches of different denominations, including Baptist, Methodist and Church of Christ Scientist, on different days of the week and at different times of the day. Authorities have issued sketches of three people sought in connection with the spate of eastern Texas church fires. Police patrols have been stepped up near churches, and in some cases church members are staying at their churches to protect them or patrolling around the churches themselves. At another destroyed church, Russell United Methodist Church in Wills Point, Texas, members are trying to salvage what they can from the ashes. A large brass cross that hung over the church's choir loft was recently found, church member Kay Crosby told CNN.
