The first Lytro camera also suffered from low-quality images, a subject the Lytro team eluded by insisting that Lytro photos cannot be measured in mere megapixels. Some social networks such as Twitter, Google+ and Pinterest have added special support for Lytro images. "We think that if you look at how pictures work today in the world and on the Web, we're really still tied to the legacy of print," said Lytro CEO Jason Rosenthal. Rosenthal says that if you were to export a Lytro Illum image into a traditional flat photo, it would be the equivalent of 4 to 6 megapixels. The Silicon Valley startup made a splash three years ago with its first Lytro camera, which let users refocus an image after shooting it.
