" The rescue by the Disney Fantasy follows recent claims that a ship operated by Princess Cruise Lines failed to stop for three Panamanian fishermen adrift at sea, despite passengers alerting crew to their plight. "We are proud of our Disney Fantasy crew members, who skillfully demonstrated their training and commitment to maritime protocols around saving lives at sea," she said. The Disney Fantasy was sailing from Port Canaveral, Florida, to Grand Cayman Sunday afternoon when it spotted the four men aboard a small raft, Rebecca Peddie of Disney Cruise Line said. Princess Cruises said it deeply regrets the loss of life and was investigating the incident. His lawsuit seeks compensation for physical, emotional and psychological injuries that it alleges he suffered as a result of the conduct of cruise line employees.
