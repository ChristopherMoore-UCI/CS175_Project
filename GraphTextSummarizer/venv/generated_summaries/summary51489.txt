Clooney is co-founder of the Satellite Sentinel Project, which uses satellite imagery to watch for aerial attacks and troop movements in Sudan and South Sudan, which became a separate country last year. Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile straddle Sudan and South Sudan's geographical and political lines. Both men traveled to South Sudan last week and worked their way across the border and into South Kordofan. For those people in areas of South Kordofan controlled by the opposition Sudanese People's Liberation Movement-North -- which has battled the Sudanese army -- the outlook is particularly dire, Lindborg said. Clooney said the attacks are being orchestrated by Sudan's government, led by President Omar al-Bashir, government official Ahmad Harun and Defense Minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein -- the same three men, he said, who previously orchestrated long-documented attacks in Darfur.
