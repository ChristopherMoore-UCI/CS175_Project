Frequent fliers who meet certain security criteria -- which TSA would not disclose "for security reasons" -- may be invited by their airlines to join at no charge, provided they pass certain background checks. The scheme, known as "Precheck," allows pre-approved passengers to pass through airport security much the same way they would have done prior to September 11, 2001. New protocols towards passengers aged 12 and under have been put in place that will reduce the number of pat-downs and allow them to keep their shoes on as they pass through security. The idea is that by removing low-risk, pre-screened people from the main security lines, security resources could be concentrated more closely on potential threats. The green-lighted travelers pass through a different lane for security screening, without being made to take off their shoes or jackets, or remove their laptop and bags of liquid from their luggage.
