" "Parallel markets" meant wealthy currency dealers in Benghazi, who apparently had many more dinar at their disposal than Gadhafi's Central Bank in Tripoli or the rebels' own Central Bank in Benghazi. On one occasion, according to the TFM's director, Mazin Ramadan, a currency trader arrived at Benghazi airport short of 20,000 dinar. TFM officials said the central bank simply did not have the available funds to exchange large sums of cash, so it designated exchange dealers to be used. One currency dealer in Benghazi, Ibrahim Salaby, said the TFM's dealings smacked of favoritism.. The TFM says all its dealings have been transparent. It says it had to use the "parallel" market and was sanctioned to do so by the rebels' "Central Bank," which was established in Benghazi soon after Gadhafi's forces were ejected from the city.
