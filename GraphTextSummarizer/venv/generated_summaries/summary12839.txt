Medicaid coverage will be extended for former foster youth until they reach 26, as long as the individual was in foster care and enrolled in Medicaid until the age of 18. " Former foster youth works on Hill to change child welfare system Lehmann recalls one of her past clients, who she said was "actively psychotic and suicidal": It took two years for her to obtain medication, Lehmann said, because of the difficulty in finding a psychiatrist who would take Medicaid. States will only be required to keep former foster children on Medicaid if they continue to reside in the state where they were in foster care originally. She, Lehmann and other child advocates wrote a letter, circulated by the Children's Defense Fund, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at the Department of Health and Human Services, which is working on the revisions before this part of the ACA is implemented in 2014, asking them to reconsider this limitation. Even if this part of the ACA is reinterpreted, former foster children like Cox-Reed may face other challenges with the existing system -- namely, not all doctors and dentists accept Medicaid.
