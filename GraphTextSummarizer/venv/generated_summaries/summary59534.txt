The Florida Board of Governors, which manages the state's universities, put out the report after drum major Robert Champion died following a beating he took in November 2011 aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida. The university has since created staff positions charged with implementing and monitoring FAMU's anti-hazing policy and is expected to provide additional training to school employees. The hazing was part of a ritual known as "Crossing Bus C," in which pledges attempt to run down the bus aisle while being punched, kicked and assaulted by more senior members of the school's famed marching band. It will develop a centralized database to better track complaints and conduct violations, while increasing collaboration with local police, according to the 27-page response submitted Wednesday.
