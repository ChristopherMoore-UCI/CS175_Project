Accenture's holiday shopping study this year showed a rise in consumer apathy toward the Black Friday shopping tradition, with more than half of consumers (53 percent) saying they were unlikely to or undecided on whether they will shop on Black Friday (compared to 48 percent in 2009). -- Today is Black Friday -- the longstanding cornerstone of the holiday season -- and many retailers are seeing the need to unveil even more incredible offers than ever to battle the growing suggestion of Black Friday fatigue. So instead of waking up at 4 a.m. -- or earlier -- and braving the elements with the rest of the die-hard shoppers for a couple of hours on Friday, for many consumers, it was a simple question: "Do I grab my laptop and surf the net for presents or sit in front of the TV to watch the game -- or both?" You can trace the increasingly lackluster consumer response to the Black Friday shopping tradition to the turbulent 2008 holidays. Traditionally, Black Friday, with its notorious "door-buster" deals, was the kick-off to the holiday shopping season, both for the store and the consumer.
