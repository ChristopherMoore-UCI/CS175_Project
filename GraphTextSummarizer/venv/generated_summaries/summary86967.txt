No longer grounded for battery problems, United's Dreamliner 787 Flight 1 gained takeoff speed down a Houston runway Monday, en route to Chicago O'Hare. The battery fix included a team of Boeing battery engineers and experts from outside the company. "We're very sorry about the delay caused by the technology workaround," said Boeing CEO Jim McNerney. The plane beat about 10 minutes off other airliners by the time it hit Chicago traffic. His counterpart at manufacturer Boeing apologized.
