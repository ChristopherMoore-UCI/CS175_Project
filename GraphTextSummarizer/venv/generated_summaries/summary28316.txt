Using cells from donated tissue or stem cells, Organovo is developing what it hopes will be authentic models of human organs, primarily livers, for drug testing. " An 'exciting new area of medicine' Bioprinting works like this: Scientists harvest human cells from biopsies or stem cells, then allow them to multiply in a petri dish. Many major medical breakthroughs have suffered moral resistance, from organ transplants to stem cells," said Titsch of 3D Printer World. Scientists are already using the machines to print tiny strips of organ tissue. Soon, however, 3-D printers may be spitting out something far more complex, and controversial: human organs.
