More barbaric ISIS videos expected after Kassig's death, analyst says ISIS foreign fighters prompt concern The ranks of ISIS -- the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State that's taken over vast swaths of Syria and Iraq -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region, including from the West. Dos Santos, according to the prosecutor's office, remains wanted on a October 2013 warrant as part of an investigation into French citizens who had gone to Syria to fight with ISIS. How foreign fighters are bolstering ISIS Intelligence estimates indicate that more than 100 of the foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria have come from the United States. The West is fighting back, with many countries -- including France -- allying with Iraq to conduct airstrikes targeting ISIS in that country. Last week, a United Nations panel stated what many consider obvious:  ISIS has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria.
