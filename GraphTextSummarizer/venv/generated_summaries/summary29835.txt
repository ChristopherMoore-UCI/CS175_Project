Women like Jennifer Aniston become girlfriends, or friends of friends, who we listen to, judge, identify with and commiserate with. Sure, it may last as long as the next headline, but we deeply hope love stays the course for her, because we want to believe that our own dreams will result in triumph over disappointment. Jennifer Aniston is getting married and this seems to be a matter of intense interest to women around the world. In 2008, millions of women were riveted to the divorce trial of Christie Brinkley, whose husband, Peter Cook, betrayed her with a teenage employee. She is no longer Jennifer Aniston, the star; she is Jennifer, a friend once removed and we talk about her among friends as if she were one of us.
