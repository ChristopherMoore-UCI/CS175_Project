Although he ambles around Whitechapel in his brown hat and green jacket with a six-shooter strapped to his waist, it was the mustache (he would never grow one for himself), and Warlow's larger-than-life concept of Jackson, that made things come alive for Rothenberg. The crew filmed the entirety of the show in Dublin, rather than London, and Warlow gives credit to production designer Mark Geraghty and costume designer Lorna Mugan for helping create the authentic edgy atmosphere of Whitechapel. In another twist, Warlow didn't want to lead the series with well-known Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline, often the main character in other Ripper stories. Bringing 1864 New York to life, grit and all Series creator and writer Richard Warlow ("Mistresses") wanted to tap into how the Jack the Ripper murders still resonate today. Set in 1889, "Ripper Street" explores the gritty aftermath of the Jack the Ripper murders in Whitechapel.
