-- Defense attorneys hoping to save former U.S. soldier Steven Green from the death penalty presented witnesses Thursday who described Green's childhood as troubled and stressful. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl. Testimony in the sentencing phase focused Thursday on Green's early years, with witnesses describing him as the middle child of a dysfunctional west Texas family, unwanted by his mother and routinely beaten to the point of injury by his older brother. But she said Green's mother had no interest in parenting and it fell to Green's older brother to take on the role of disciplinarian. Vogelsang characterized Green as the attention-starved second son among three siblings.
