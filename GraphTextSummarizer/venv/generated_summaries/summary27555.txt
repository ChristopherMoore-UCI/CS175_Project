In March, after a bomb injured four Israeli paratroopers in the Golan Heights, Israeli forces responded with artillery fire aimed at Syrian military targets across the frontier, the IDF said. In October 2013, Israeli warplanes struck a military base near the Syrian port city of Latakia, an Obama administration official told CNN. Asked for comment on that strike, an Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman told CNN, "We don't refer to foreign reports." Life in the rubble of Kobani Planes believed to be Israeli struck inside Syria on Sunday, the Syrian government and an opposition group said, but the two entities differed over whether the targets belonged to the Syrian military. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency characterized the strikes as "a flagrant attack on Syria, targeting two safe areas in (the) Damascus countryside in Dimas and near Damascus International Airport."
