In a world where so much goes to waste without a moment's thought, Kenyan artist Njee Muturi has made a livelihood out of upcycling rejected cutlery and transforming it into striking and inimitable jewelry. From his Nairobi home he trades under the name "Zanji Art," derived from Arabic, meaning "Black Art." "I see it, I see what I can do even before I start making it."

Out of old and unwanted knives, forks and spoons, Muturi crafts artistic and unique rings, bracelets, necklaces, as well as other household items. Muturi gets the old tableware sent to him in bulk from sources abroad, particularly his brother, a fellow artist.
