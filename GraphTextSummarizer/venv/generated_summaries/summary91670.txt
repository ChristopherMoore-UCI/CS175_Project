"What you're hearing is that as new openings come up, there are missed opportunities to bring women in at that level," said Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, which tracks women in elective office. Moreover, there are more men than women among names being considered for other Cabinet positions in Obama's second term. CNN has learned President Barack Obama is expected to nominate White House chief of staff Jack Lew as treasury secretary. Obama's two Supreme Court appointments so far have been women, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president speaks with a number of diverse candidates for various positions and selects who he thinks is the right person for the job. It is also about ensuring that female candidates are being considered for a variety of positions, said Jennifer Lawless, director of Women & Politics Institute at American University.
