Essam was released, but human rights groups have said more than 100 innocent activists -- Â­ all detained on March 9 -- are still in custody awaiting military trials without access to lawyers. Instead, Essam said, they detained him and scores of others and hauled him to the nearby Egyptian museum where uniformed soldiers tortured him for four hours and cut off his shoulder-length hair. Egyptian soldiers were on guard but they didn't come to his rescue. His scars are evidence, he said, that violent groups linked to ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime are trying to subvert the revolution. Presidential candidate Amr Moussa has said shadowy elements have also fueled recent violence between Egyptian Christians and Muslims.
