We were rich in big ideas and exceptional consultants but poor in concrete ideas and real boating knowledge. What Andy knew and we didn't was that boats typically look like boats and require structure. It was a hugely creative period with amazing sausage-type bottle structures and invertebrate raft ideas all on the table. This boat; conceived, designed and built out of plastic bottles, which has sailed over 4000 miles to be here today beneath this unbelievable sky. "It's a boat, made from plastic bottles," David de Rothschild said to me in December 2007.
