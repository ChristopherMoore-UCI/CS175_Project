I think there are disillusioned people everywhere, there are doubters everywhere, but I do think there are constructive people here; I do think that people believe in people. Connie Nielsen: Anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes, concentrate poor people there. I don't think people who are already burdened with social, economic, psychological situations, dysfunctional families, need to be burdened with other people with the same problems. A human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling, filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the old -- somebody who takes good care of things and of people. Connie Nielsen: I don't think I can remember a moment in my life where people didn't discuss politics.
