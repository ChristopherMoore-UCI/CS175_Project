By Monday night, however, the company, which says it is the "largest hosting provider of secure websites in the world," said most of its sites were working again. GoDaddy, the massive Web hosting company, went down for several hours on Monday, taking an untold number of websites with it. "I'm taking godaddy down bacause (sic) well i'd like to test how the cyber security is safe and for more reasons that i can not talk now," that person wrote in response to questions from a technology reporter at tech blog Mashable. The outage caused widespread Internet problems on Monday. The attack appeared to take down websites that use GoDaddy servers to host their information and also those that have registered their names with the company.
