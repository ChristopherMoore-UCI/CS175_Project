Buddy Elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin Anne Frank. He died peacefully at his home in Basel, Switzerland, at 90, said an announcement posted on the website of Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation that Elias headed. Elias told me that it wasn't just Anne who loved to write; everyone in the family did. "But I know I'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are." In another letter, Anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue, fur-trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with Elias. "That was the last sign of life I had with Anne," Elias told me.
