Anstein Gjengedal, of Oslo police district -- which pays for the national police helicopter service from its budget -- acknowledged it was flying less hours than it used to because of budget constraints. Less than two hours later, a gunman reached Utoya island, some 20 miles away, and proceeded to fire on the mostly teenage participants of a political summer camp for well over an hour. Responding to the situation in Utoya was "the highest priority" for local police, and was not affected by events in Oslo, she said. Sissel Hammer, chief of police for the Nordre Buskerud district, which covers Utoya, told reporters Wednesday that her officers and members of an elite police unit had done their best to get to the island quickly. A day earlier, police spokesman Johan Fredriksen rejected criticism of the police response to the massacre in Utoya.
