On "Larry King Live" Monday night, the senator's sons -- Ted Kennedy Jr. and Rep. Patrick Kennedy -- said times have changed, and that includes the no-tears rule of an earlier generation. -- When the late Sen. Edward Kennedy was growing up, there was a family edict: Kennedy men don't cry. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, left, and Ted Kennedy Jr. appear on "Larry King Live" on Monday evening. His brothers  -- President John F. Kennedy and  Robert Kennedy -- had their lives cut short by assassinations in the 1960s. After a July 18, 1969, party for those who had worked on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign, Ted Kennedy drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts.
