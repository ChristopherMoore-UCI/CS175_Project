" Boxing's first and only eight division world champion left his training camp in Genereal Santos City earlier this week to head to Macau, China, where his WBO International Welterweight title bout with Rios will take place. The typhoon hit the country earlier this month and has so far claimed over 5,000 lives, with boxing star Manny Pacquiao ensconced in his Philippines training camp for this weekend's fight with Brandon Rios. " Saturday's fight with Rios is Pacquiao's first since he was knocked out for just the third time in his career by Juan Manuel Marquez in December 2012, only his fifth loss in 61 professional fights. Pacquiao dismissed suggestions that defeat to Rios, the American who has lost just one of his 33 professional bouts, could see him call time on his 18-year career. "Right now we've sent them food, food is the most important thing," said Pacquiao, who is an elected official in the Philippine House of Representatives, serving Sarangani's Lone District.
