Tarver has been teaching Zumba and other classes that combine fitness and dance for the past four months, in addition to the classes she takes. She supplemented classes with one to two nights working out on the elliptical machine and lifting weights. She used a calorie counter app on her phone to track her intake, sticking to about 1,500 to 1,700 calories per day based on how fast or slow she was losing weight. She also offered to make her CDs with music she noticed Tarver liked in class. When Tarver started her weight loss journey in November 2012, at 235 pounds, she wore size 22 pants and was about 42% body fat.
