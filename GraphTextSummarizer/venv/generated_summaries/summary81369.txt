Police said the pictures of Malek were found in Harris' possession and that "it appears Harris had obtained and downloaded images of this celebrity because of the identical resemblance to the person of interest and his known associate." Howard, aka Yenesis Alfonso, is not a suspect in the shooting and accident, said Laura Meltzer, a Las Vegas police spokeswoman. -- Las Vegas police said photos they released of a "person of interest" sought in connection with a triple homicide show the wrong person. The photographs that police originally said depicted Tineesha Lashun Howard are instead of Tasha Malek, an account executive at a medical company who lives in Florida and appeared in the television series "Bad Girls Club," the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. Ammar Harris, 26, is being sought in connection with Thursday's pre-dawn fatal shooting of Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch. A woman who identified herself as Howard's mother told CNN that her daughter and Harris have been girlfriend and boyfriend for about a year.
