The sheer number of nominations makes the pair front-runners for best picture: In the last 20 years, the film with the most nominations has won 15 times, observes O'Neil. The nominees for the 84th annual Academy Awards were announced Tuesday morning, and if there's a theme, it's how many nominations hearken back to previous eras in film history. If either "Hugo" or "The Artist" -- two films-about-films -- wins, it would be a groundbreaker, says longtime Oscar watcher Tom O'Neil of GoldDerby.com. "No film about Hollywood has ever won best picture," he says, observing that classics such as "A Star is Born" and "Sunset Boulevard" couldn't pull off the trick. "The Hurt Locker," which won best picture two years ago, topped out at $17 million domestically.
