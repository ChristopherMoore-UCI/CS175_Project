San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro gave the most significant speech of his political career on Tuesday night when he became the first Latino to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. Castro's mother, Rosie Castro, learned a tough lesson at a young age while in school in San Antonio, where her teachers discouraged speaking Spanish. San Antonio Republicans are skeptical of Castro's broader appeal, with one San Antonio official calling him a "typical young, energetic liberal Democrat." And I'm confident that I can do a good job in articulating why President Obama ought to be the candidate that Americans select for the next four years." Since being elected in 2009, Castro has built a reputation as "a youthful and dynamic leader here in town," says Walter Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Texas-San Antonio. But she probably would've thought it extraordinary that just two generations after she arrived in San Antonio, one grandson would be the mayor and the other would be on his way -- the good people of San Antonio willing -- to the United States Congress," Castro said in his speech, referring to his twin brother, Joaquin.
