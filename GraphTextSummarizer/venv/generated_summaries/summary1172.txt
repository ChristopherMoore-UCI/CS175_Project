"Can't innovate any more, my ass," Apple Vice President Phil Schiller said when he unveiled the new Mac Pro in June. In some ways the Mac Pro, which will be available for preorder on Apple's website and Apple stores, is like the fancy haute couture dresses that get walked down the runways of Paris and New York. Packing a range of Intel Xeon processors, the new Mac Pro is more than twice as fast as its predecessor, released three years ago, Apple says. It was a response to some analysts who say rivals like Samsung and Google have been rolling out fresher ideas than Apple the past couple of years. Pro users are a small part of Apple's overall business.
