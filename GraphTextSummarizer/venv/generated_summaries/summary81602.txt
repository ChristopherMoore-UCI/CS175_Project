U.S. troops may have come close to rescuing Mueller in July when they staged a daring raid at an abandoned oil refinery near Raqqa in Syria in an attempt to find journalist James Foley, who was executed by ISIS in August, and other hostages. Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokeswoman, said, "U.S. forces conducted this operation as soon as the President and his national security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully and consistent with our policies for undertaking such operations." Other rescue efforts included a trip by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who went to Iraq and Qatar and met with Syrian rebel leaders to try to secure Mueller's release. A spokeswoman for the family said Mueller's parents often communicated with the White House in trying to free their daughter, who was taken hostage in August 2013. Troops found evidence the hostages had been there recently, including writings on the cell walls and hair believed to be Mueller's, one U.S. official said.
