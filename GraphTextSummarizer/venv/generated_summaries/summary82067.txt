-- Prince Philip, husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, underwent "exploratory" abdominal surgery Friday at a London hospital, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. He had been expected to accompany the queen as she formally opened the British Broadcasting Corporation's rebuilt central London headquarters, Broadcasting House, on Friday. Prince Philip: The man behind the queen Philip left Greece a year after he was born there, following the 1922 overthrow of his uncle King Constantine I. After the presentation, the queen and Philip hosted a garden party in the grounds of Buckingham Palace as part of celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the queen's coronation. Philip has had a number of documented health problems in recent years, including treatment for a blocked coronary artery in December 2011 and a hospitalization in June 2012 for a bladder infection.
