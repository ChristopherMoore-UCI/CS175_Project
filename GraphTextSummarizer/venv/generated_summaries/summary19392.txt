The new Chromebook will also be sold in Google Play, alongside Nexus phones and tablets. For example, the new Chromebook uses a Samsung Exynos dual-core ARM processor — essentially a chip designed for use in smartphones and tablets rather than traditional laptops — along with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage. Google is also giving Chromebook buyers 100GB of free Google Drive storage for two years, so they can store files in the cloud, rather than locally on the device. Pichai said that while tablets take care of quick, casual computing for most people — checking e-mail, using social media apps, maybe watching a movie or video chatting with a friend — the world still has a need for low-priced computers with a keyboard. With that in mind, the performance and specs of the latest Samsung Chromebook (officially called the New Samsung Chromebook) fall just a bit below that of the mid-range $450 Samsung Series 5 Chromebook launched in May.
