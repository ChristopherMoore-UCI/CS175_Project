-- A 40-year-old man who allegedly punched and shouted racial slurs at V. Stiviano outside a Manhattan hotel was released on his own recognizance Wednesday as prosecutors investigate possible hate crime charges against him. Dominick Diorio allegedly followed Stiviano -- whose audio recording of Donald Sterling ranting against African-Americans led to his NBA lifetime ban -- from a restaurant to a hotel and taunted her with racial slurs, according to a criminal complaint. Stiviano is known as the woman who recorded inflammatory remarks by Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, which spawned outrage among NBA fans, players and executives. Outside the hotel, the official said, Diorio allegedly directed more slurs at Stiviano, who got into a cab with her sister. Ms. Stiviano seems intent on keeping her name in the spotlight but I can assure you that if this case goes to trial, my cross-examination will last longer than her 15 minutes of fame.
