The use of antidepressants to battle insomnia could be influenced by cost, since generic antidepressants cost less than brand-name insomnia drugs, doctors said. Over the last two decades, doctors treating sleep disorders have prescribed more antidepressants than insomnia drugs, according to several published analyses. A sample of 3,400 physicians' prescription practices published in the journal Sleep in 2004 showed that antidepressants were approximately 1.53 times more likely to be prescribed by American doctors than insomnia drugs. The alternative to taking pills is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which teaches the patient how to get better sleep hygiene and ways to avoid sleep-disturbing behaviors. Some doctors prescribe antidepressants because their patients have both depression and insomnia.
