Fast facts on hurricane season Andrea chugged inland over northern Florida on Thursday night, with wind and rain bands "spreading northward well ahead of the center," the Miami-based center reported. Follow the storm on CNN.com's hurricane tracker All this comes from a storm that, as it passed through the Gulf of Mexico, never ascended to hurricane status -- it needed to have sustained winds of 74 mph or more to get that honor -- and then weakened, as far as wind speeds, as it passed over land Thursday evening. Despite warnings that storm surges plus torrential rains could equal major flooding, Taylor County Emergency Management Director Dustin Hinkel said Andrea was bringing precipitation and high winds, but little trouble. Such a warning means that tropical storm conditions -- with sustained winds in excess of 39 mph -- are likely within the next 36 hours. On Thursday night, a tropical storm warning extended from Flagler Beach, Florida, to Cape Charles Light, Virginia.
