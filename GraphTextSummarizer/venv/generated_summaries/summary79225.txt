The sale marks the 5-month anniversary of the death of Hammerl, who was last seen by fellow journalists on April 5, 2011, after being shot in the stomach by forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi. Hammerl, who holds South African and Austrian citizenship, was initially believed to have been detained along with Brabo and journalists Clare Morgana Gillis, a freelancer for the Christian Science Monitor, the Atlantic and USA Today; and James Foley of GlobalPost. Gillis and Foley said in the interviews they were traveling with Hammerl, following then-rebel forces toward the frontlines near al-Brega, when they were attacked by Gadhafi's forces. The two said in the interviews that Hammerl was shot in the abdomen by Gadhafi's forces. When Gillis, Foley and Brabo were released along with British journalist Nigel Chandler, they contacted Hammerl's wife to tell her what happened, according to interviews they gave after their release to GlobalPost and the Atlantic.
