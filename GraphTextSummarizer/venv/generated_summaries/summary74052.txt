The decline in strikes cannot be explained solely by declining union membership. That case brought a blistering dissent from Justice William Brennan, who found no basis for the court to favor crossover workers "unless it is perhaps an unarticulated hostility towards strikes." For much of the post-World War II period, employers generally accepted unions in sectors where they were already established. As a result, employers quickly adopted more aggressive tactics against unions and their strikes. In 1989, the court ruled that the federal Railway Labor Act governing transportation unions did not require employers to lay off employees who crossed picket lines in order to reinstate more senior strikers after an economic strike.
