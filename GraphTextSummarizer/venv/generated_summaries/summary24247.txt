Earlier this year, Sanders was mired in the infamous Ray Rice elevator beating scandal in which the football player was investigated for hitting his then-fianc√©e in an elevator of a New Jersey casino. The senior security director for the NFL team, Darren Sanders, was charged with a fourth-degree sex offense which is "not considered a sexually violent offense but sexual contact without consent of victim," according to the Maryland Attorney General's office definition. The record did not go into details about the charges but the address listed for the defendant is that of the team's headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland. Sanders played a role in explaining how he, on the team's behalf, requested the casino's video footage of Janay Palmer being beaten in the elevator. He said the casino officer would only describe the video to him, and he relayed the information to Ravens executives.
