-- Venezuelan federal authorities on Thursday dispatched their "best investigators" to track the kidnappers of Major League Baseball catcher Wilson Ramos, the country's justice minister said. In 2009, the number of reported kidnappings in the country doubled from the previous year, and police admit that many cases don't get reported. The targeting of baseball players by criminal groups is not unheard of in Venezuela, but Ramos' case could be the first time that a player himself was kidnapped. The FBI on Thursday informed the government of Venezuela that it is prepared to assist in Ramos' case if asked to, an FBI spokesman said. Ramos, a rising star for the Washington Nationals, was snatched from his family home in central Venezuela by gunmen Wednesday night, a team spokeswoman said.
