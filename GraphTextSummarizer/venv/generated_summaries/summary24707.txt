" McIlroy won $8 million in PGA Tour events and has â‚¬3,696,597 ($4.7 million) from Europe's almost worldwide swing -- though both circuits have several co-sanctioned tournaments. "I set myself a number of ambitious goals at the start of the year, and to have ticked so many of the boxes feels great," said McIlroy, who displaced Donald at the top of the rankings and won his second major title at the PGA Championship after recovering from a mid-season slump. He emulated Luke Donald's efforts from last year, but the Englishman needed to play in extra Fall Series events to clinch the American crown on the final day of the season. The 23-year-old can defend his Hong Kong Open title next week and then go to Dubai for the $8 million World Tour Championship without the pressure of the last three years, when he was twice the European Tour's No. 2. -- Since its inception in 2009, the Race To Dubai has provided European golf with a thrilling battle for big bucks that has gone to the final day of the season.
