In the opening scenes of "Safe House," you can tell what a good time Denzel Washington is having as Tobin Frost, an American spy in Cape Town, South Africa, who is five steps ahead of everyone else. His look is pure sleight of hand: In glasses, gray scarf, and overcoat, with an earring, a serious goatee, and his gray-flecked hair teased out, Washington resembles a hipster Malcolm X -- a great look for him, even if it feels like a costume. When thugs enter, yet somehow fail to find Frost tethered to a chair, he and Matt escape, gunning through the streets in a smash-and-grab car chase. As a crew of Langley officials (Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard) purse their lips with importance, Frost is placed in a CIA safe house overseen by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who's been twiddling his thumbs there for a year.
