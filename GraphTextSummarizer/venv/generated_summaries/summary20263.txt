-- Allegations of racial slurs and threats of violence against Dolphins lineman Jonathan Martin have left Pro Bowler Richie Incognito suspended from the Miami Dolphins and sparked widespread chatter about just what kind of behavior is tolerated in the NFL. Incognito 'weathering the storm' Does Jonathan Martin have a future in the NFL? Aside from the alleged threats and racial slurs from Incognito, Martin has rejected parts of the culture of the NFL, according to some reports. And while some NFL players and personnel believe Martin should not have made the issue public, they're also not defending Incognito, Trotter says. The NFL Players Association issued a statement saying it expects "that the NFL and its clubs create a safe and professional workplace for all players, and that owners, executives, coaches and players should set the best standards and examples."
