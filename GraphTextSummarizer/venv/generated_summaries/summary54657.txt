A human being would have sent minions out after the debate to note that his opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, broke the rules. In 1992, my compadres and I stole the stools Bill Clinton rehearsed on from a Williamsburg, Virginia, hotel and put them on the stage of the Bush-Perot-Clinton town hall debate in Richmond, so Gov. Clinton would have the home-butt advantage. What Gov. Scott demonstrated to the world is that, beneath that creepy exterior is an even more creepy psyche. But it was Florida Gov. Rick Scott who brought Thompson's maxim to life Wednesday. I have seen and done a lot of crazy stuff in political debates.
