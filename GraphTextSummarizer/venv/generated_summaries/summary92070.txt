On Wednesday, Cassim said he agreed -- up to a point -- with comments that UAE Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum made to the BBC, saying his detention was a mistake. Last month, UAE authorities sentenced Cassim and two of his friends to one year in prison for defaming the country's image. "My eldest-brother instincts kicked in, and it was a feeling of ... do everything we can to get him out,"  Cassim's brother, Shervon Cassim, said on "New Day." But without warning, Cassim said, he was interrogated and arrested in Dubai before being transferred to a maximum-security prison in Abu Dhabi. The 29-year-old from Minnesota had been working as a business consultant in opulent Dubai before authorities arrested him and four friends in April over a parody video about wannabe gangsters.
