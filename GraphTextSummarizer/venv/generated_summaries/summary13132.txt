In a 2006 study published in the journal Obesity, a group of overweight pet owners with obese dogs lost a greater percentage of their body weight over a year than a control group, which did not own dogs. And if doga (yoga with dogs) weren't enough, exercise videos are being made to get plump pets and their owners in shape together. In an age where man and animal have gotten obese, people are finding ways to battle the bulge alongside their cats and dogs. Obesity in cats as a result of overeating and under-exercising is a real health danger, said Dr. Fred Scott, director of the Feline Health Center at Cornell University. Even if the dogs and cats don't help the owner become fit, their furry companionship has therapeutic benefits for people.
