-- Brooke Mueller, the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen, will undergo drug rehab at home while caring for her young twins, her spokesman said Monday. The 2-year-old sons she shares with Sheen will stay in Mueller's custody and will "be cared for by Brooke and their longtime nanny," Honig said. Earlier, in April 2010, Mueller had checked into a treatment facility for help with stress management to prevent a "return to old problems," her representative said. But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen, with whom she has twin sons. The boys and Mueller were part of Sheen's volatile public fall-out with CBS earlier this year as he left his starring role on the network's "Two and Half Men."
