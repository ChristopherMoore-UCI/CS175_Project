One analyst said, "Turkey has been warning Israel for months that it would do this and Israel chose to ignore it." Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group, argued that Turkey made a concession earlier this year, by preventing the Mavi Marmara from leading a second proposed blockade-busting flotilla to Gaza. In contrast with Turkey's official view, the U.N. report on the flotilla incident said that Israel's naval blockade of Gaza was a "legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea."
