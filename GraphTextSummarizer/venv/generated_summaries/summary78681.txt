-- Oprah Winfrey gave her support to those suffering in the Gulf states, saying President Obama is doing the best he can to handle the oil disaster. "What's going on in my heart is the same thing, everyone feels for what is happening to all of the fisherman and families who, this time of year, would be hosting people from all over the country and all over the world there," said Winfrey, who was in Atlanta, Georgia, on Wednesday to speak at a middle school graduation. "I think the president is doing the best anybody can," said Winfrey, who campaigned for Obama when he ran for president. Winfrey said she has been saddened by television reports of those affected by the oil disaster. "We can only hope and pray that this will soon be resolved in a way that people can pick themselves up and move forward," Winfrey added.
