The case, which police are still investigating, evoked memories of a scene from the 1980s movie "Fatal Attraction," in which the character played by Glenn Close boils the pet rabbit belonging to the family of her ex-lover. Man killed, planned to eat girlfriend's dog, police say CNN's Lorenza Brascia and Tony Marco contributed to this report. "Diatchenko skinned the pet, cooked it and ate half of it while sending her step-by-step pictures of what he did," the district attorney's statement said. The ex-girlfriend wasn't identified by prosecutors. Prosecutors said they plan to ask for bail to be set at $90,000.
