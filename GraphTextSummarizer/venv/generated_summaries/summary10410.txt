Julio Acevedo, 44, was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the crowded parking lot of a mini mart in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne of the New York Police Department. The suspect wanted in connection with the hit-and-run crash that killed a Brooklyn couple and their unborn child this week turned himself in to authorities in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, New York police said. Police said Acevedo was cooperative and was taken to a Pennsylvania State Police barracks to await extradition proceedings. Acevedo was given a description of unmarked police cars to look for when surrendering, Browne said. He was arrested at 5:10 p.m. Video of the surrender, shot by CNN affiliates WFMZ and WABC and posted on their websites, showed Acevedo in a light blue hooded sweatshirt, his hands uncuffed, being helped out of a gray sedan and put into a silver SUV.
