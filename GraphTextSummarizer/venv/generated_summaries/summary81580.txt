The writing on the wall was clear for all to see in the immediate aftermath of Friday's defeat with federation president Giorgos Sarris openly admitting that Ranieri's appointment had been a mistake. But results since have been poor and an opening defeat to Group F leaders Romania set the scene for Ranieri's eventual departure. -- Claudio Ranieri paid the price for Greece's humiliating defeat to the Faroe Islands when it was confirmed Saturday that he had been sacked as national team coach. He has also been in charge of English Premier League Chelsea and a trio of Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Napoli and Roma. Ranieri took full responsibility after the defeat but said he would not resign.
