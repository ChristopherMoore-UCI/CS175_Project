Bowe Bergdahl, released from Taliban captivity last month, has been moved from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio to outpatient treatment for reintegration and medical care at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, the Army said Sunday. "Debriefings and counseling from Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) psychologists continue to ensure he progresses to the point where he can return to duty." Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. Bergdahl was at the medical center for 10 days, but his reintegration process will extend beyond that with the outpatient care at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston. The program began at Brooke Army Medical Center in 2006.
