Suleiman's husband, Abed Suleiman, has said that, after attending Friday prayers, he brought home four pizzas at his wife's request and the family ate dinner together. Others contained curses, including the f-word, he said, "She would never, ever send me a text message or use that word in front of me or to me at all," Abed Suleiman said Wednesday on HLN's "Nancy Grace." Millsap on Thursday refused to explain why Suleiman may have gone missing, saying only that "why she left is her business, and not ours. The husband said he thought Wazineh Suleiman had gone to a Walmart to rent a video. "The case of Wazineh Suleiman is closed," Bartow County Sheriff Clark Millsap told reporters in Cartersville.
