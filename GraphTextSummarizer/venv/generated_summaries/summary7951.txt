-- Robin Soderling will be hoping to improve on a dismal record at the Australian Open next week after an impressive display saw him clinch the Brisbane International title in Queensland, Australia. The Swede brushed aside Andy Roddick in straight sets 6-3 7-5 in Sunday's final at the Pat Rafter Arena to claim his seventh career title and raise expectations of a good run at the Australian Open, which starts in Melbourne on January 17. Roddick was taken to deuce in his first service game and then lost his second as Soderling seized early control of the match. I know I have a chance to do really well if I play good tennis like here," Soderling said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. Earlier in the week Roddick pledged $100 for every ace he served in the tournament to go towards Queensland's flood relief fund.
