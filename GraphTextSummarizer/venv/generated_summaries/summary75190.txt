Walker and Jenkins are expected to appear in court Sunday morning at the Bay County Courthouse in Panama City. The legal-looking documents contained bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of the Orlando-area State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton or the assistant state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry. They both went to the Orange County jail to register as felons -- Jenkins on September 30, Walker on October 11 -- as required by law. Authorities have been searching for Walker and Jenkins, both 34, after investigators discovered forged motions to reduce their respective sentences and forged court orders granting the requests. Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins were taken into custody "without incident" at 6:40 p.m. at Panama City's Coconut Grove Motor Inn, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said.
