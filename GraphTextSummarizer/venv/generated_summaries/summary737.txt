Since then, LRA attacks have killed 2,400 people and displaced 465,000, according to Resolve Uganda, a nonprofit group that monitors LRA activity. Reclaiming peoples' lives from that fear is as much a part of the job as capturing Kony, said the Special Forces captain. Part of the difficulty in tracking Kony stems from the fact he can move freely across porous borders, and not all countries in the region have joined the chase, said Ugandan armed forces spokesman Col. Felix Kulayigye. He's on the decline, and in survival mode, but he is still dangerous and he's going to be dangerous until the LRA are eliminated," said a captain with U.S. Special Forces. She was abducted by LRA soldiers, but released into the forest once they reached their base camp, she said.
