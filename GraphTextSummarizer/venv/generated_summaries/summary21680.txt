Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney are set to meet in Utah on Thursday for a meeting that Bush scheduled before Romney announced this month that he's seriously considering a third presidential run. CNN's Mark Preston reported earlier this week that two of Romney's former aides -- Megan Sowards and Matt Gorman -- are poised to play key roles in a potential Bush campaign. Romney spoke publicly at last week's Republican National Committee meeting in San Diego, for example, while Bush was also in Southern California courting donors. The source said the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times on Wednesday, was requested by Bush as a gesture of respect for Romney's leadership role in the party â€” much like a recent Bush-John McCain meeting that took place at Bush's request. Separately, two Romney sources and a senior Bush source confirmed that the meeting will take place.
