-- The streak of light that blazed across southwestern U.S. skies and stoked burning curiosity across the social media landscape was probably a tiny and bright meteor known as a fireball, a NASA spokeswoman said Thursday. NASA officials have announced the now-defunct Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite is expected to fall back to Earth in the coming weeks, but that is expected to happen in a week to 10 days, NASA spokesman Steve Cole said. Also, the society said, "those that occur at night also stand little chance of being detected due to the relatively low numbers of persons out to notice them." Veronica McGregor, spokeswoman at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, called it a rarely seen and exciting treat for the legions of people who glanced to the heavens on Wednesday night. McGregor told CNN the object eyeballed in the sky on Wednesday night was probably the size of a baseball or a basketball, based on descriptions reported to police and across the internet.
