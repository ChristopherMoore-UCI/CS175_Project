-- George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin last month, visited a gun manufacturer Thursday, TMZ reported. Kel-Tec manufactures the PF-9, the type of gun Zimmerman used to shoot Martin. A jury acquitted Zimmerman in July of second-degree murder in Martin's February 2012 death. His parents said Zimmerman and his family received many death threats after the acquittal. TMZ also reported that O'Mara went to the gun facility with Zimmerman, but O'Mara told CNN he was not there and was in court at the time.
