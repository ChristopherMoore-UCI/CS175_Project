Air pollution increases the risk of bladder cancer, the IARC said. The classification is an important step, said Dr. Christopher Wild, director of the IARC. "We know that it is causing cancer in humans," said spokesman Kurt Straif. The IARC called air pollution the most widespread environmental carcinogen and the worst. "The predominant sources of outdoor air pollution are transportation, stationary power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions, and residential heating and cooking," the IARC said.
