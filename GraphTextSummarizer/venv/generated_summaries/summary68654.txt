Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner, 35, also of Maryland, was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. According to a transcript of a police interview, obtained by CNN, Giordano told police that he feared for his life when he signaled for Gardner to turn back and didn't look for her as he swam for shore. Giordano also told authorities that he is the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy tied to Gardner, a local official told CNN. Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, told authorities that he was snorkeling with Gardner and signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. -- An Aruban magistrate ruled Wednesday that a Maryland man, detained in connection with the disappearance of an American woman, will remain in custody for another 60 days.
