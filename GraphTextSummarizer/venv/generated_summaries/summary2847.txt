NFL star Adrian Peterson turned himself in to authorities early Saturday in east Texas, one day after news broke that Peterson had in the local prosecutor's view hurt his child  "with criminal negligence or recklessly" under the guise of discipline. He returned Saturday to watch a high school football game in his hometown of New Rochelle, New York, which is a New York City suburb. Peterson hasn't spoken publicly since a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of child abuse. But his lawyer has, saying that Peterson used "a switch to spank his son" in doling out discipline much like "he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas." "(Peterson) will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing," the attorney, Rusty Hardin, said Friday. Peterson's 2-year-old son was found unresponsive last year in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and later died of what authorities said were injuries consistent with abuse.
