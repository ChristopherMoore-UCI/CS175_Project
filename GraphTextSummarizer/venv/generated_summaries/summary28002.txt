Although the statement stopped short of naming the specific organized crime connection between Australia and Mexico, they said, "opportunities brought by technology, by globalization ... and new information, brings with it opportunities for crime that were previously unimaginable. "Recent increases in cocaine arrests and reported use, as well as considerable seizures of the drug in recent years indicate potential expansion of the Australia cocaine market," the statement said. -- A majority of cocaine imported into Australia over the past two years came from Mexico, the Australian Crime Commission told CNN in a statement Thursday. Cocaine consumption in Australia is increasing, according to authorities, with a total of 359 importations detected between 2008 and 2009. "This is in part due to the strong links ethnic South Americans and Mexicans have with cocaine producers in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru," the commission said.
