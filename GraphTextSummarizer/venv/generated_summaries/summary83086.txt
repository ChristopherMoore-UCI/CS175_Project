In 2005, the United States denied Modi a visa because of his alleged role in anti-Muslim violence three years earlier in Gujarat state, where he was chief minister. In a statement, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Modi would get a visa to the United States once he takes office and forms a government. "We congratulate Narendra Modi and the BJP on its victory in winning a majority of seats in India's historic national election, which saw more voters cast their ballots freely and fairly than in any election in human history," Psaki's statement said. Now, however, Modi would be eligible for an A1 visa, said Psaki. Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have captured a landslide victory and he will likely become prime minister.
