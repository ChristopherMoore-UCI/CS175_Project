Since 1999, Means and her team have set up clinics inside Boston shelters to offer direct, free medical care to thousands of homeless women and children. It's just health care," Means said. "For women who are poor, homeless or battered, to deal with a system of health care becomes overwhelming," she said. Female victims of domestic violence are often reluctant to use identification that could reveal their whereabouts, and vulnerable women often avoid clinic waiting rooms where they might encounter hostile members of the homeless community, Means said. Means started her nonprofit -- Women of Means -- after working for seven years with the city's established homeless health care programs.
