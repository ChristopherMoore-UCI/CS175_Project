"The pipeline has come to symbolize something much, much bigger than just one energy project, it's come to symbolize what is our energy future, and what President Obama is going to do on climate change," said activist Jane Kleeb of the anti-pipeline organization Bold Nebraska, in a state where the Keystone XL project would cut through predominantly agricultural areas. One of the event's main organizers, founder of 350.org, Bill McKidden, said that activists may have been silent but haven't forgotten about the project and now they've organized to remind the administration of their commitment to preventing fossil fuel based projects that they say are causing increased climate change. -- Less than two weeks after Barack Obama won his re-election campaign, protesters gathered Sunday to call on the president and his administration to reject the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, and to act on climate change. Film director Josh Fox, whose documentary "Gasland" examined the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, also known as "fracking," was among protesters with camera in hand. "I'm here doing a film on (McKidden's 350.org's) "Do the Math," and the math tells us that we have more fossil fuels in the ground than is supportable by the atmosphere without total catastrophe and calamity," said Fox.
