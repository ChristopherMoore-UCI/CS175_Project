Noelle Velentzas, 28, couldn't understand why U.S. citizens like herself were traveling overseas to wage jihad when they could simply "make history" at home by unleashing terrorist attacks, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Thursday. Velentzas and Siddiqui did not enter pleas when they appeared in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday. Velentzas and her former roommate, 31-year-old Asia Siddiqui, were arrested and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said. The two U.S. citizens were charged in criminal complaints filed in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois with one count each of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization. Last month, an Army National Guard member and his cousin were arrested in Illinois and accused of conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, federal prosecutors said.
