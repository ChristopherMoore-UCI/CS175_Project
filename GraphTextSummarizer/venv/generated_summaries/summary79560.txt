The EPA's proposed first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants represent not only a huge step toward curbing the climate disruption that spurs this sort of mutant weather, but also an important milestone on the way to powering the nation with energy that will make our air and water cleaner and our families safer and healthier. Fortunately, we know that the same clean energy technologies that produce less carbon pollution can also create a new generation of clean energy jobs. Focusing on power plants, which are our nation's single largest source of carbon pollution, is a common-sense and essential step that we can take right now. Thanks to the Clean Air Act, we currently limit how much mercury, arsenic, soot, and other air pollution power can come from power plants, yet when it comes to carbon pollution, power plants have been given a free pass. Common sense demands that we close that loophole as fast as possible, which is why a February 2014 poll found that 7 of 10 Americans are in favor of setting limits on carbon pollution from power plants.
