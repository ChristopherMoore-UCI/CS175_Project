Meet Rick Weiland, the Democratic hopeful who's trailing former Republican Governor Mike Rounds in a four-way race that also includes former Republican Senator Larry Pressler, running as an Independent and Gordon Howie, also an independent. The investment in attack ads, rather than pro-Weilland ads suggests Democrats are confident either a Weiland or Pressler victory will help them keep control of the Senate. Those types of ads will likely help Weiland, but could also be a boon for Pressler, the independent who surged into second place in a SurveyUSA poll released Wednesday. Weiland, who has been turning popular music into campaign ads since the start of his campaign, was looking for a song that would connect more with millennials. When Weiland first started making music videos into campaign ads, he admitted it that it takes a lot of courage.
