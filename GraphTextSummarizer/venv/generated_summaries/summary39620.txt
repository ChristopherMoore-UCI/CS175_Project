The attorney for the alleged victims has told CNN that rumors of possible Pentagon or CIA involvement in the sex crime accusations against Assange are "complete nonsense." "The present investigation of issue (there are no charges), is one alleged non-sexual 'harassment,'" Assange wrote Thursday in an e-mail to CNN. Swedish authorities arrested Assange "in absentia" over the weekend on two charges -- rape and molestation, a non-sexual charge that is similar to harassment. "The damage they have caused me and WikiLeaks is enormous," Assange told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet in an article published Thursday. Leif Silbersky, the lawyer representing Assange, told CNN this week his client strongly denies all the accusations.
