"Now that we have filed charges, our primary focus is obtaining justice for Chelsea King and her family," San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie M. Dumanis said Wednesday. "There is strong likelihood that we have found Chelsea," San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference Tuesday. "Chelseas (sic) blood is on you move out," the message said, according to San Diego police spokesman Gary Hassen. The charges against Gardner make him eligible for the death penalty, the San Diego County district attorney's office said Wednesday. John Albert Gardner III, 30, pleaded not guilty to all charges, which stem from last week's disappearance of Chelsea King, 17, of the San Diego, California, area.
