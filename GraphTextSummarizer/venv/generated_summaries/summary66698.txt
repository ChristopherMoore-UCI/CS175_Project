At about 10:30 p.m. Monday, with generators failing and widespread internal flooding, hospital staff called the CEO of Mount Sinai, Dr. Kenneth Davis, and asked for help. The heart rate of tiny babies can suddenly drop, and they can even develop a complete heart block. The first time I held a premature baby was nearly two decades ago during medical school. I met Emma just a few hours after she arrived at Mount Sinai. As you watch the video of these babies being rushed through the streets of New York, you now have a better idea of just how involved all of this really was.
