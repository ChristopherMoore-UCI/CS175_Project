Reinvent Yourself Using Innovative Solutions," notes that when volunteering, you'll meet others, obtain new experiences and learn new job skills. Volunteering may help with professional growth as well -- by gaining new experiences and meeting new people, you may just end up with a new job. While volunteering can help connect you to new people and potential career opportunities, it shouldn't be the sole reason why you choose to give back. It allows you to develop new skills or foster existing ones. Even if the skills you learn don't exactly transfer over to a potential job opportunity, it'll show prospective employers that you are up for trying new things and taking on new challenges.
