"When President Reagan was shot, I walked over to CNN that day and asked to help," Lewine said in a 2005 article in a newsletter for Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. -- Frances Lewine, who covered the White House for The Associated Press during six presidential administrations and spent nearly three decades as a CNN editor and producer, died Saturday of an apparent stroke. A group of women reporters and sympathetic male reporters met regularly at her home to organize protests, she recalled. "It's amazing that at her age, Fran was still staking out administration and elected officials after weekend talk shows," CNN Washington Bureau Chief David Bohrman said. " She wrote that it was a "source of disappointment and anger" that the AP never considered her an equal to male White House colleagues.
