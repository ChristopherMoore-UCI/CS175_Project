We can barely imagine the reaction in the locker room when Beckham unpacked moisturizer, bronzer, and assorted hair products from his kit bag. Beckham was different, he was known for being Beckham and, in this sense, he was among the first generation of celebrities. Unlike traditional sport fans, they were not interested in how he played: they were interested in him -- just Beckham. Paradoxically, the alleged affair added rather than subtracted from his already iconic status, introducing a dash of devilry and rescuing Beckham from a kind of borderline piousness, and perhaps issuing a reminder that, despite all the affectations, his manhood was beyond doubt. Red-carded in a crucial England game against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup, Beckham was blamed for his team's exit.
