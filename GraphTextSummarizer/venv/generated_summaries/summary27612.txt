-- A body found Tuesday in Rhode Island's Providence River has been identified as that of Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student who had been missing since mid-March, police said. "He was seen on the 15th, Friday, hanging out with his friends, talking to family members, all normal activities, nothing out of the ordinary that anyone detected," his brother Ravi told CNN affiliate WPRI on April 10. It might take two months to determine the cause of death of the 22-year-old philosophy major, said Dara Chadwick of the Rhode Island Health Department. Tripathi was last reported seen early March 16, on a security video walking south on Brook Street in Providence, near his home. His relatives' search for Tripathi was detailed on a Facebook page, "Help us find Sunil Tripathi."
