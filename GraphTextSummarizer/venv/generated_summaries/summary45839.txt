-- Former Philadelphia Eagles broadcaster Donald Tollefson was arrested Tuesday on charges alleging that he embezzled more than $100,000 in charity donations, according to the Bucks County district attorney's office. Tollefson, a Glenside resident, is best known for his coverage of the Philadelphia Eagles and for hosting sports shows such as "Eagles Game Day Live" and "Eagles Game Plan." The police investigation alleges that on October 8, Tollefson sold Eagles game-day trip packages for $500 at a 5K memorial run for Brad Fox, a Plymouth Township police officer killed in line of duty. But Thomas Fox, Brad's father, said his son's charity has not received any money from Tollefson to date, according to the release. Tollefson fraudulently raised money for charities, such as the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania, the Salvation Army and the Brad Fox Foundation, and pocketed that money over the last three years, according to an investigation led by the Warminster Township Police Department.
