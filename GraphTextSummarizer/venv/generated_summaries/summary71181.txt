That small urn is arguably the most precious prize in world cricket with Australia holding it on 31 occasions to England's 30. "I know especially back in Australia, this is the pinnacle of an Australian cricketer, to play Test cricket in England, be part of an Ashes series and I'm sure there will be judgments made on our performances, and as captain of the team you should be accountable," said Clarke. Then there was wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, who scored the second fastest century in Test match cricket during Australia's 5-0 whitewash of England in 2006-7. On Wednesday, when England and Australia go head to head in cricket's biggest contest, the Ashes, two countries will hold their collective breath and prepare for a brutal battle. Anderson, who is particularly adept at swinging the ball in either direction, has taken 307 Test wickets in his career -- a number which ranks him joint-third in the all-time list of England bowlers.
