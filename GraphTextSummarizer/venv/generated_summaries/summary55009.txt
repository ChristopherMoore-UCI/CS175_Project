Only in Deen's altered universe could she think slaves were treated like family. Who knew that descendants of slave owners were less prejudiced ... because their relatives owned slaves? Somehow Deen cannot bring herself to even use the word, all the while taking credit for having slave owning relatives because that fact makes her and the rest of the South less prejudiced. Through it, viewers confront the horror of slavery, see the tearing of raw flesh from whipping, the rapes, the complete lack of privacy that slaves experienced. According to Deen, whites in the South treated their slaves like "family."
