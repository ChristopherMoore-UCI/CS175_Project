"We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst," Douglas Durst said. "As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death," Los Angeles Police said in a statement Sunday. Robert Durst has said the last time he saw her was when he dropped her off at a train station in Westchester, New York, so she could head back to medical school in the city. Durst is an heir to a fortune thanks to his family's New York City real estate investments. Investigators say they believe he was behind the 2000 slaying of Susan Berman, a crime writer and Durst's longtime friend, who was shot dead in her Beverly Hills home.
