Republican presidential contender Michele Bachmann defended her position on gay rights, the HPV vaccine and the debt ceiling as she made her debut on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno." Bachmann told Leno that Perry's action had been "an abuse of executive power" and had sparked concern over "crony capitalism," an apparent reference to the fact that a former Perry aide was a top lobbyist for Merck, the manufacturer for the HPV vaccine. Asking Bachmann why gay people shouldn't have the right to be happily married, Leno said: "That whole 'pray the gay away' thing, What? First up was the issue of the HPV vaccine, a subject on which Bachmann hit fellow Republican contender and Texas Gov. Rick Perry hard in this week's CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate. On Afghanistan, Bachmann failed to answer whether she thought American forces should withdraw, but paid tribute to the "unbelievable job" done by U.S. service men and women there.
