-- Oklahoma death row inmate John David Duty was executed Thursday using a drug commonly used to euthanize animals because of a nationwide shortage of the sedative normally employed in Oklahoma's lethal injections. "It's been used on animals and humans in an anesthetic way, not a killing way. The decision to use pentobarbital in place of sodium thiopental sparked an outcry from death penalty opponents over its questionable effectiveness. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with a district court's finding that another Oklahoma death row inmate failed to show "that the use of pentobarbital in Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol presents a constitutionally unacceptable risk of harm to the inmate," according to its December 14 order. Lawyers for Duty, who was sentenced to die for strangling his cellmate with a shoelace, claimed that pentobarbital is risky and unproven in humans.
