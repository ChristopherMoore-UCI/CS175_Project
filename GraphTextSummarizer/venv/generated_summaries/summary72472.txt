An al Qaeda-linked rebel group has wrested control of the historic Christian town of Maaloula from regime forces, opposition groups said Sunday. Antoinette Nassrallah, the Christian owner of a cafe in Maaloula, told CNN last year she had seen government TV images depicting radical Muslim attacks on Christians. Last year, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on leaders of  al-Nusra while the State Department blacklisted it as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. "But what I heard, in Aleppo, they are killing, destroying many of churches -- very, very old churches. They also fear the same fate as a number of Christians during the war in Iraq, where militants targeted them and spurred many to leave the country.
