In a separate report in February, published in Child Trends, data show that regardless of economic status, ethnicity or education, the single mothers who were regularly offered emotional support had "children and adolescents who were also more likely to display social competence and school engagement," compared with single mothers without social support. Particularly with input from different arenas, single mothers can envision the futures of their children in a very positive light. And several recent studies point to a range of factors -- from a mother's religiosity, external emotional support and a grandparent living in the home -- that can concretely contribute to single mothers' raising productive, happy children. Of course there are single mothers who fail their children. To be sure, single mothers are swimming against the tide in a culture that in its predominant narrative declares our children are liabilities in society, not blessings.
