To stay married we'll doubtless have to broker new deals, and newer ones after that...till death do us part. I begin to make deals with God: If it's benign, I'll sponsor an Indian schoolgirl's education. Making deals with God may be a nonstarter. That said, I know that even if love lasts, deals don't. Fairy princesses -- those perfect models of traditional passivity -- don't cut deals.
