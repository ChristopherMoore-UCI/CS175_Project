Pilots often order flight attendants to sit down if they know turbulence is coming or it's already hit; otherwise, the flight attendants are moving about the airplane cabin to prepare the airplane for in-flight service and landing. Commonly experienced as bumpiness in flight, "turbulence is rapidly varying or overturning air motions occurring across short distances in the atmosphere," Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University meteorology professor Curtis James said. Recent United Airlines and American Airlines flights have both been hit by unexpected turbulence that resulted in injuries. Planes are designed to withstand the pressure of the atmosphere in flight, even when it feels really bumpy, says Hogeman, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association air safety committee and a United Airlines captain with more than 20 years of flight experience. Convective turbulence can occur when an aircraft passes over an unstable air mass (perhaps near a thunderstorm) and experiences rapidly rising or descending air, according to Schneider.
