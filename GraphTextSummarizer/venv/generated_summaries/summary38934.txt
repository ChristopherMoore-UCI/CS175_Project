Unlike his two, more experienced colleagues, Amir confessed to deliberately bowling no-balls (foul deliveries) in order to make money in a betting scam, with the judge, Mr Justice Cooke, handing him a lesser sentence of six months, calling him ""impressionable". The trio, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were handed differing jail terms after being found guilty of plotting to cheat during the match at Lord's -- the home of English cricket. Speaking to CNN's Don Riddell, following the announcement of the prison sentences, Condon said: "These guys betrayed their country and betrayed millions of cricket lovers around the world. " Condon added: "In my time with the ICC, I always said the most powerful message was if cricketers were dealt with criminally for these matters, otherwise cricket loses and millions of people also lose their confidence in the game." However, while Butt and Asif have been roundly condemned for their actions, which resulted in sentences of 30 months and 12 months respectively, in some quarters there has been a modicum of sympathy for 19-year-old Amir.
