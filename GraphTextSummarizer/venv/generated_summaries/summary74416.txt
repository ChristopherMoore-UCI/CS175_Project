Animosity between Wade and Ludemann had gone back months -- and it centered on their mutual love interest, Joshua Camacho, then 20. Wade testified Thursday that she stabbed 18-year-old student Sarah Ludemann only after she herself was hit three times in the head during the fight. In an August 29, 2008, voice mail, Wade can be heard saying, "I'm guaranteeing you I'm going to ... murder you," and in another, she tells Ludemann, "You are a f***ing fat b*** * and I'm going to f***ing kill you, I swear on my life," Wade said in a voice mail left for Ludemann. " Wade testified that Ludemann had left similar messages for her, but that she had deleted them.
