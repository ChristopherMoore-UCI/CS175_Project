Earlier that night, Hernandez had dinner with his fiancee and two other couples at a bar in Providence, Rhode Island , according to testimony from Kelly Rose Belanger, the manager of the bar. About an hour and a half before Odin Lloyd was shot to death, the suspect in his killing, Aaron Hernandez, was captured on video dancing at a gas station south of Boston. In the video surveillance, Ortiz and Hernandez appear off balance. When customers complained about the smell of marijuana wafting inside the bar, Belanger asked Hernandez to stop smoking. Hernandez picked up the tab for the group, paying $243 plus a $30 tip, according to Belanger.
