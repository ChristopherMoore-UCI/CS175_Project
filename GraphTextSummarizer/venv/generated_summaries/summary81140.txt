-- Minor scuffles broke out Wednesday between demonstrators and police in Athens as thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest new austerity measures that critics describe as draconian. Police spokesman Panagiotis Papapetropoulos told CNN that some protesters had thrown Molotov cocktails in Syntagma Square, opposite the Greek parliament building in central Athens. "Where we need to concentrate today is not on further austerity measures, because there have been extreme sacrifices made by Greek people in the last three years. Last month, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to plead for more time to push through reforms to public finances. Live footage from the square as the trouble briefly flared showed smoke rising from burning tires, as police in riot gear faced hooded protesters lobbing petrol bombs.
