Supporters of the law say it forces insurance companies to pay legitimate claims in a timely and fair fashion and frees the courts from relatively minor cases that clog the system for months and even years. Former insiders say insurance companies began limiting or denying legitimate claims in minor injury cases and reaped billions in profits as a result. The strategy has tied up courts across the country -- over minor claims, judges told CNN -- for months and even years. "Insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they don't pay your claim,'' said Washington state Rep. Steve Kirby. Insurance companies are using the referendum process to try to strike down a new law in Washington state.
