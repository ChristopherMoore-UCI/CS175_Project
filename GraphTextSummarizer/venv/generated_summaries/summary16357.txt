"We're barred from discussing details involving a minor, but that doesn't stop a plaintiff's lawyer from exploiting a child and grossly distorting and fabricating 'facts,'" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne. The New York City Department of Education declined to comment because the incident did not occur on school grounds. Police said they have referred the case to Internal Affairs for further review. The family filed the suit last week, but the incident came into the spotlight early Wednesday in New York when the boy's mother released a photo of the boy being handcuffed. -- The family of a 7-year-old Bronx boy is suing the city of New York and its police force for $250 million, claiming the child was falsely arrested and handcuffed over a $5 theft.
