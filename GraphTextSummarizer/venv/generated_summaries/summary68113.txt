The results also will appear when Google users search for a local site using Google search or Google Maps. -- Google Places is gone, replaced by a new feature that combines its Google Plus social site and renowned restaurant reviewers Zagat. Announced Wednesday, Google Plus Local is the latest push by Google to incorporate its networking site into more of its other products, with the goal of creating a single, seamless Web experience. "What Google still lacks in Google+ is a way of getting different businesses' networks to interact with each other -- meaning, Facebook may have its own Facebook Places, but it also has a range of apps from others, like Gogobot and more, that enhance that experience," wrote Ingrid Lunden of TechCrunch. Results will include reviews from Zagat, which Google bought in September, as well as ratings and comments from friends.
