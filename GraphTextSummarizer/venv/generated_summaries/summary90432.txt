The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization, an Islamist group which helped propel ousted President Mohamed Morsy to power. Students at the university have been on "strike" following the killings of students and professors by security forces, the Muslim Brotherhood said. Supporters called his removal a coup and a blow to the democratic movement that toppled former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. The Brotherhood said security forces, "in an attempt to silence any voice of opposition," fired tear gas, live bullets and birdshot at the protesting students. -- Egyptian student protesters who back the Muslim Brotherhood are accused of torching the cafeteria of a Cairo university, state media reported.
