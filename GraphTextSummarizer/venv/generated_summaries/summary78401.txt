For 10 years, Stewart has dedicated her birthday to teaching other women about heart health and raising money for Go Red for Women. Go Red for Women is trying to raise $100,000 by the end of February in honor of National Heart Month to fund additional research and education programs on women's heart health. This year Stewart will don her red and gather with friends, family and other women at a suburban Atlanta restaurant to celebrate her 39th birthday, raise money for the association and teach women to take charge of their health. During her recovery, Stewart realized how important it was to educate herself and other women about the risk factors and warning signs of heart disease. Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women," said Dr. Mary Ann Bauman, medical director for women's health and community relations at INTEGRIS Health in Oklahoma City and also a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement.
