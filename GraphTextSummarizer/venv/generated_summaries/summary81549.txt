"Oh man, he was always cowboyed up," said former classmate Mike Prue. " Prue and his buddy Steve Plank said Wanless would help them with their homework, despite the differences. "There was a sign out there that said 'the ranch that God built,' " said Joe Prue, father of Mike Prue. Diane Linster, his math teacher, remembers Wanless coming early to school and staying late to pump up his grades. Wanless and his parents had recently moved into a camper on their ranch, after losing their home to foreclosure, according to neighbor Erv Figert.
