Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered an apology Thursday to the mothers, children and families affected by forced adoptions. Gillard pledged support for families that continue to be affected by such adoptions, committing $5 million Australian to improving access to specialist support and records tracing. Addressing those ripped from their families, she said: "To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you, and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin, and to connect with your culture, we say sorry." Gillard's comments came about a year after a Senate committee that investigated forced adoptions released its report, which included a recommendation for a national apology. "To you, the mothers -- who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice -- we apologize," said Gillard, speaking in the Great Hall of Parliament House in Canberra. The report found that some mothers signed adoption papers while under the influence of medication.
