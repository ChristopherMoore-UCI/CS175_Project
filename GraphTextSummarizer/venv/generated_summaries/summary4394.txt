While leaders could not ignore the tumult in Egypt, they stopped short Saturday of endorsing protesters' demands for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down. In view of the developments in the Middle East, the Quartet expressed its belief that further delay in the resumption of negotiations is detrimental to prospects for regional peace and security." The ongoing unrest in Egypt cast a long shadow Saturday over the Munich Security Conference, a gathering set up to address global security issues. "President Mubarak remains utterly critical in the days ahead as we sort our way toward the future," said Wisner, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt. However, the envoy who delivered a message from U.S. President Barack Obama to Egypt's leaders this week, Frank Wisner, told the conference via videolink that Mubarak must remain in office, despite protesters' call for his resignation.
