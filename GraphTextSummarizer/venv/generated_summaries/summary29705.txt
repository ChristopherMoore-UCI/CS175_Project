-- A retired American doctor who was working with Ebola patients in West Africa returned to the United States -- and put himself in quarantine. The World Health Organization says Ebola has been confirmed or suspected to have infected more than 1,300 people, with more than 700 deaths in West Africa this year. Despite the risks, Jamison said he'd return to West Africa to help combat Ebola. " Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. "I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on my arrival ... and informed them I had been in West Africa and my history."
