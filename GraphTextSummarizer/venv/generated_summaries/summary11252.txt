The carrier INS Vikrant, meaning courageous, was unveiled at a shipyard in Kochi in southern India, defense ministry spokesman Sitanshu Kar told CNN. Monday's launch comes two days after India announced activation of the reactor on its home-built nuclear-powered submarine, in what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described was "a giant stride in the progress of our indigenous technological capabilities. " "It is testimony to the ability of our scientists, technologists and defense personnel to work together for mastering complex technologies in the service of our nation's security," Singh said in a message on Saturday after the reactor on board the INS Arihant submarine was activated. Only the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia and France have the capability to design and build such warships, Kar said. Japan launches largest warship since World War II
