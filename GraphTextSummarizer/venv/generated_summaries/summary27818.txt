-- Romanian striker Adrian Mutu has been ordered to pay English Premier League champions Chelsea a record $20.7 million after losing his final appeal in a five-year case relating to his positive cocaine test. Mutu is currently serving a nine-month drug ban after testing positive for an anti-obesity drug in January. The Swiss Federal Court upheld the decision of FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in ruling that the player must compensate his former club for breach of contract. "The Cas had sentenced the professional Romanian footballer to paying a sum of more than 17 million euros to his previous employer, Chelsea Football Club Limited." A statement from the Swiss court said:"The Swiss Federal Tribunal has rejected the appeal filed by Adrian Mutu against a sentence by Cas.
