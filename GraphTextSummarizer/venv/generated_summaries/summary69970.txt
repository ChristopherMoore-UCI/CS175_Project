Arab League recognizes new Syrian opposition coalition The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is working to provide aid to residents who have fled Syria. -- France and the United States put their support behind a new coalition of Syrian dissidents Tuesday, but Damascus slammed the group, saying any effort to topple President Bashar al-Assad will be futile. Doctors Without Borders said it has treated more than 2,500 patients at four new hospitals in northern Syria since June. French President Francois Hollande said his nation "recognizes the Syrian national coalition as the sole representative of the Syrian people and therefore as the provisional government of the future democratic Syria, making it possible to bring Bashar al-Assad's regime to an end. "Defending Syria is a national destiny and not a political option."
