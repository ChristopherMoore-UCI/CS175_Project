After a war of words developed in the build-up to the game, it was Wales who dominated the early exchanges but they failed to get points on the board as Stephen Jones and then James Hook missed the chance to register three points with penalties. Jones slotted two penalties to bring the game within four points but Flood gave England breathing space with an early second half kick. Two tries from Chris Ashton, who plays for the Northampton Saints, two conversion kicks and three penalty kicks from Toby Flood, and a late penalty from Jonny Wilkinson, sealed an impressive victory. Flood then converted a penalty to give England a ten-point cushion but a yellow card for Louis Deacon forced him to sit in the sin-bin for ten minutes and brought the home side back into the match. But England's World Cup hero of 2007, Jonny Wilkinson, then slotted a late penalty to ease English nerves and seal the contest.
