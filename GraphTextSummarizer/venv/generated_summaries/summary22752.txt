Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding his record label in 1991 and signing artists who included Snoop Doggy Dogg (who now goes by the name Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. That prison time, along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others, contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In December 2010, Knight was arrested at a suburban Los Angeles outdoor shopping mall for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation. Knight was in Las Vegas with Shakur in 1996 when the rapper was shot to death. -- Marion "Suge" Knight was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles on a misdemeanor traffic violation and an outstanding warrant, police said.
