In a statement earlier Thursday, the chairman and vice chairman of the board of trustees said Paterno was removed as head football coach because he "could not be expected to continue to effectively perform his duties" amid sexual abuse allegations involving Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator. Then-Athletic Director Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, now face charges of perjury and failing to report child sexual abuse. Penn State was rocked by accusations that Sandusky had sexually abused young boys over 14 years and that school officials failed to take the complaints to police. Some university students, former players for the Nittany Lions and others were angered by the removal of Paterno, the 85-year-old coaching great who guided the team for 46 years and recorded the most wins in college football history. A Penn State graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, told the grand jury late last year that he had seen Sandusky "with a boy in the shower and that it was severe sexual acts going on and that it was wrong and over the line."
