Just four players made the squads for all three of Barcelona's Champions League successes of 2006, 2009 and 2011 -- and now the first is set to leave in the shape of club captain Carles Puyol. Puyol, who captained Barca to victory in the 2006 and 2009 Champions League finals, has made 593 appearances for Barcelona, more than any outfield player save for Xavi's 709. Iniesta, Xavi, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho may have lit up Barcelona's play with their sumptuous skills but it's questionable whether they embodied the Barca side during their years of dominance quite like Puyol. As he addressed the media on Tuesday, with another club legend -- Gerard Pique -- a notable attendee, Puyol explained that he will attempt to finish his Barcelona career with the attitude that has been his hallmark. After that, we'll see what happens." Puyol joined Barcelona's youth team in 1995 and has never played for any other club.
