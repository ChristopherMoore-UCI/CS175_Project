We are facing a new kind of crisis in the rise of radical Islamists who spread their ideology worldwide through the Internet and through human networking. The truth is that 13 years after the September 11 attacks, the United States does not have an effective strategy for dealing with radical Islamists and their deep commitment to waging war against us and against our civilization. Instead, the most important aspect about Islamic State is that it is a vector for attracting, training and preparing foreign terrorists from all over the world. Islamic State controls vast regions in two countries and has substantial military equipment. We need a new analysis with new language and new strategies that relate to defeating a viral system that spreads across national boundaries.
