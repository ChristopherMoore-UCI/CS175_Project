Arthur Douglas Harmon had gone to the building to discuss "some type of litigation," Phoenix Police Public Information Officer Tommy Thompson told CNN affiliate KTVK. Former astronaut Mark Kelly referred to the shooting during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington on gun violence. After the meeting, at about 10:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET), Harmon shot Steven Singer, 48; a 43-year-old man who was in critical condition, and a 32-year-old woman, Thompson said. Kelly and his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, this month launched Americans for Responsible Solutions, which seeks to raise money to counter the influence of the gun lobby. "We believe the two men were his targets," Thompson said.
