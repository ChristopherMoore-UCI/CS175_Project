The injured man -- in his late 30s -- was taken to Harborview Medical Center in critical condition, with burns over 50% of his body, fire department spokesman Kyle Moore said. Video showed what was left of the helicopter immersed in flames, as well as a line of fire in the street that engulfed several vehicles. "He always had a smile on his face," said anchor and reporter Molly Shen. What followed immediately afterward proved it, as a news helicopter tumbled to the ground and burst into flames, with those flames spreading to several parked cars in its path. Murray described KOMO workers as being "in a state of shock." KOMO identified the victims as Bill Strothman, a retired KOMO photographer who was working as a freelancer, and Gary Pfitzner, the pilot.
