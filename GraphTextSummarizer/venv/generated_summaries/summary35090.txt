We want peace and democracy -- universal suffrage in 2017 -- but we abhor and reject "Occupy Central" for trying to hold Hong Kong hostage in the fight for its brand of democracy. " You see, while as many as 70,000 students and "Occupy Central" group supporters occupy the streets now, only six weeks ago, 1.5 million Hong Kongers boldly came out from their cocoons to sign their names on a petition to demand peace and reject "Occupy Central." True, having faced police tear gas and efforts to dislodge them, students and the "Occupy Central" group have captured and are holding parts of Hong Kong -- main thoroughfares in Central, Causeway Bay and Mongkok. Unwilling pawns We believe "Occupy Central" and its vow to paralyze our financial center by occupation and blockages are for real, and it will hurt the middle class and common folks more than the wealthy. We do not want to be held hostage and be unwilling pawns in a political game, and we do not want the same fate as tens of millions in other parts of the world who suffer financial losses, injuries and even deaths in turmoil brought about by the politically aggressive and adventurous.
