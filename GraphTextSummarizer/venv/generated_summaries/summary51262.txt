Police said during the search Myers and his two sons repeatedly referred to the 7-year-old as "the princess." Myers, who was arraigned Wednesday, was charged with aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person and simple assault, as well as possession of a controlled substance and paraphernalia after police allegedly seized a container of marijuana and a smoking pipe with suspected marijuana residue during their search. All the while, the child told authorities Myers was filming him with a cell phone camera. Myers then allegedly followed the boy to the bathroom and poured nail polish remover over him. According to the criminal complaint, Myers initially claimed he had been cleaning hair dye from the sink and had spilled nail polish remover on the boy. The boy told authorities that at some point in the afternoon, Myers and his two sons had started shooting him with pellet guns and that Myers threw a substance from the stove that "felt like sand" at his face.
