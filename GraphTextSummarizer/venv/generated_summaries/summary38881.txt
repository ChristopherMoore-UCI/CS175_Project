The partial lower jaw is the oldest known fossil evidence of the genus Homo, to which modern day humans belong, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Science. Professor Kaye Reed, of Arizona State University, said the discovery was the result of years of searching in the area. Researchers have previously found fossil remains dating back 3 million years or more, such as the skeleton of "Lucy," the famous 3.2 million-year-old remains of the species Australopithecus afarensis. But until now there has been little fossil evidence from the 700,000 years in between -- a crucial period in the evolution from hominids like Lucy to the Homo genus. Scientists have also found fossils that are 2.3 million years old and younger, which are in the genus Homo and are closer to modern day humans.
