The 51-year-old has been sacked just six months after being tasked with turning around the fortunes of the top-flight team following an astonishing fight with young midfielder Adem Ljajic during the Serie A match against Novara. However, that was the bizarre situation in an Italian soccer match on Wednesday -- and it has cost Fiorentina coach Delio Rossi his job. Club president Andrea Della Valle dismissed former Lazio and Palermo coach Rossi immediately after the match, with no successor yet announced. It is not up to me justifying Delio Rossi, but he has never done anything like that. I know that at this moment Delio Rossi is suffering more than anyone else and I want to respect the work he has done here for us."
