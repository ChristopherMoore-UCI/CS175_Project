In the parliamentary speech, Rajoy promised to update pension payments, which were frozen under the Socialists amid much public outcry. -- Conservative leader Mariano Rajoy was sworn in Wednesday as SpainÂ¹s new prime minister, to begin work on what he lists as his top priority -- pulling the nation out of its deep economic crisis. Rajoy said most of Spain's national holidays that fall on weekdays would be observed on the closest Monday to improve productivity. In an effort to help cash-strapped professionals and small businesses, Rajoy said they would not need to pay value-added tax on their goods and services until they collect back payments. He said there would soon be labor market reforms to make Spain's workforce more flexible and competitive, and that there would be mergers and takeovers in Spain's troubled banking sector -- which holds a lot of bad debt from 750,000 unsold new homes that went up during the real estate boom but before the financial crisis and credit crunch set in.
