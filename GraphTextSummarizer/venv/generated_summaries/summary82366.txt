Attorney Maximo Alteza said he is not involved in the case of Holloway, the Alabama teenager who disappeared in Aruba after going out on the town with van der Sloot, and was reluctant to comment on van der Sloot's interview with The Telegraph. "I wanted to get back at Natalee's family," van der Sloot said from prison in the Dutch interview. -- Joran van der Sloot admitted in an interview with a Dutch newspaper that he extorted money from the family of Natalee Holloway, but his attorney in a Peruvian murder case suggested Monday that his client's comments may have been mistranslated. Alteza said van der Sloot was not paid for the interview. If that judge votes in favor of van der Sloot, a fifth judge will hear the case to break the tie.
