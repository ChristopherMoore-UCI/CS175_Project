The Pew Center on the States, through its Public Safety Performance Project, says it promotes "fiscally sound, data-driven policies and practices in sentencing and corrections that protect public safety, hold offenders accountable, and control corrections costs." "If you talk to judges and prosecutors practically anywhere in this country, they will tell you if they had stronger community corrections, they wouldn't have to send so many people [to prison] for so many low-level offenses," he said. -- A record number of Americans served time in corrections systems across the country in 2007, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Center on the States. Southern states tended to have higher rates, with Plains and rural Northeastern states coming in lower. Dealing out longer sentences and putting more people behind bars have been the hallmarks of Southern states, he said.
