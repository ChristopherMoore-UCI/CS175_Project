The agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the most important advance in the several decades-long history of international climate negotiations. And the new targets certainly represent a major policy change for China as well - even if it's one they were ready to make, recognizing a need to cut back on coal for air pollution as well as climate reasons. But while most climate scientists I know are still sharing a period of joy following its announcement, some substantive criticisms of the agreement have also been raised. Under the circumstances, this new agreement couldn't realistically solve climate as completely as the Montreal Protocol solved ozone. After decades of failed climate talks -- in which the U.S. was often a big part of the reason for failure and China was a big part of our excuse for dragging our feet -- this is every bit the political breakthrough it appears to be.
