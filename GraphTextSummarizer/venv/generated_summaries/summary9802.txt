Romney lays out 'aid with trade' in major foreign policy speech Following his remarks at the United Nations, Obama addressed the Clinton group on human trafficking, saying it "must be called by its true name -- modern slavery." The fresh batch of polls in Ohio, Florida, Iowa and Nevada - which together account for 59 electoral votes - were released by the Washington Post and American Research Group and were all conducted over the past six days, after the release of secretly recorded clips from a May fund-raiser, in which Romney casts Obama supporters as dependent on government. Both GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have in recent days challenged Obama's foreign policy record, which is perceived to be a strength for the incumbent. Obama called on countries worldwide to enact and enforce laws preventing and punishing human trafficking. In the battleground state of Colorado on Monday, Romney said Obama's characterization of the recent unrest in the Middle East as a "bump in the road" belittled the gravity of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11 that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
