-- Prosecutors in Boston, Massachusetts, say they plan to release their files on accused "Craigslist killer" Philip Markoff, who killed himself in jail in August, after formally dropping the murder case against him Thursday. " Conley is slated to discuss the case with reporters Thursday morning after requesting the case be dropped, a move his office said will set the stage for the release of "all relevant documents" at an unspecified later date. The case was short-circuited when Markoff took his own life August 15, but District Attorney Daniel Conley said at the time that the evidence against the suspect was "overwhelming. The Suffolk County District Attorney's office said Wednesday it plans to file paperwork requesting a dismissal of their case Thursday morning. "We expect that it will be ready for media review within the next few weeks." Markoff, 24, was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine when arrested in April 2009 in the killing of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel.
