-- Spain's Nicolas Almagro dashed American qualifier Brian Baker's hopes of a fairytale ATP title triumph in Nice when he beat him in straight sets in the final Saturday. "I played my best tennis in two years here," Almagro told the official ATP Tour website. " In other tennis action Saturday, Serbia won the World Team Cup for the second time as Janko Tipsarevic and Victor Troicki gave them a 3-0 victory over the Czech Republic in the final in Dusseldorf. His heroics in Nice where he beat a string of higher seeded players will see his ranking boosted ahead of the French Open where both he and Almagro are in action later this week. Baker has battled back to top form after a succession of injuries and setbacks over the past six years and came into the tournament as world number 216.
