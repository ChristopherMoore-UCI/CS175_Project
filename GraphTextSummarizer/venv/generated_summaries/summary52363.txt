Yasir Qadhi, who was an instructor at "Ilm Fest," said the 16-day conference organized by the Al Maghrib Institute was a series of courses and workshops to teach young Muslims "the nuts and bolts of Islam. Qadhi said the institute taught young Muslims a "orthodox Islam for the 21st Century," stressing the importance of the literal text of the Quran but imbuing those words with a modern meaning. After the Houston event, AbdulMutallab did not sign up for any more Al Maghrib events, said Qadhi -- perhaps a sign he was starting to become influenced by extremist ideas, he added. "We are trying to carve out a Western Muslim identity among conservative Muslims -- for Muslims to integrate into Western society but maintain their Islamic identity. " Qadhi, of New Haven, Connecticut, has been involved in de-radicalization efforts in the United States and was a leading participant in the U.S. Counter-Radicalization Strategy conference organized by the National Counterterrorism Center in the summer of 2008.
