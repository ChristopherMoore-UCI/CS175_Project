However, the rise of the celebrity press in France since the introduction in 2005 of magazines such as Closer, -- the French edition is published by Italian company Mondadori, part of the Berlusconi empire -- has proved that French readers have a taste for gossip too. -- When waking up this morning in France, one could be forgiven for not knowing that French celebrity magazine Closer had crossed the Rubicon and published topless pictures of Kate Middleton, wife of Prince William, heir to the British Crown. In an interesting cultural twist, the British media suddenly discussed the outrageous breach of the Royals' privacy by French photographers, invoking the fate of late Princess Diana in Paris, at the hands of French paparazzi. Only last week, ValÃ©rie Trierweiler, partner of French President FranÃ§ois Hollande, won a string of cases against publications having showed her in a bikini this summer. No doubt, the French public at large will have sympathy for the royal couple especially as their intimacy was breached in France while they were having some time off before embarking on a tour of Malaysia on behalf of the Queen.
