Ross, the executive chef at Bristol Catering in Louisville, Kentucky, started gaining weight after high school while working in restaurants, first as a waiter, then as a cook. These were the foods Chris Ross grew up on in rural Kentucky. After reading about a New Orleans chef who had lost weight, Ross decided to conduct an experiment. Still, Ross makes time to run at least four days a week as he trains for the Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon on April 19. Then in late 2004, Ross stepped on a scale for the first time in years.
