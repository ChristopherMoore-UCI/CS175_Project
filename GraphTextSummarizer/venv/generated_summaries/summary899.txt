"While we ensure the rehabilitation of the U.N. building, we will also bring all those responsible for this act to book," said Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Ggenga Ashiru on behalf of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. Omabegho Edward-Dede, the 12-year-old surviving son of Dr. Edward Dede, a national professional officer with the World Health Organization, told the grieving crowd at the ceremony at the U.N. House premises that he is taking solace in his memories of his father. Of the dead, 11 were U.N. staff and 12 were unrelated to the U.N. Two bodies were not identified. Officials representing the Nigerian government and the United Nations joined members of the diplomatic corps, the armed forces and family members of the victims at the ceremony. The 25 victims of the August 26 terrorist bombing of the United Nations House in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, were honored in a memorial ceremony on Thursday.
