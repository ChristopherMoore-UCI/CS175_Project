The minister recently launched a massive presidential campaign to support candidate Abdurabu Hadi, the country's current vice president. The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office when the attack occurred, spokesman Abdul Basit al-Qaedi told CNN. Al-Amrani told CNN the country is facing a critical time for change and all Yemenis must stand together to support Hadi. The minister's office said al-Amrani has been targeted recently in a hate campaign by pro-revolution groups. Executive powers have already been transferred to Hadi.
