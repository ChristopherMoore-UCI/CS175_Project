Signs of underground ocean found on Saturn moon Vance and colleagues did not visit Ganymede, obviously, but they performed laboratory experiments here on Earth to simulate what would happen to ice and salty water on the Jupiter moon. There is strong evidence that Europa, another moon of Jupiter's, and Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan have oceans under ice as well. There are many forms of ice, which makes modeling conditions on icy moons complex. We may learn more about Ganymede and other moons with the potential of life through a space mission called Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE. Computer models taking all of that into account suggest that Ganymede has as many as three ice layers with liquid ocean between them.
