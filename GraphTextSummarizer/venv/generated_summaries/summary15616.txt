Who's behind the Sony cyberattack The FBI has said that the code of the malware used in the attack on Sony is similar to what North Korea has used in other attacks. The U.S. government last week declined to say whether it was responsible for the Internet disruption in North Korea. "U.S. President Obama is the chief culprit who forced the Sony Pictures Entertainment to 'indiscriminately distribute' the movie and took the lead in appeasing and blackmailing cinema houses and theatres in the U.S. mainland to distribute the movie," North Korea's National Defense Commission said Saturday, according to state-run media. After Sony Pictures said film distributors had decided not to show "The Interview" for security reasons, Sony then arranged for direct distribution online via its own services, YouTube and through independent cinemas. Some U.S. cyberexperts say the evidence the FBI has presented isn't enough to isolate North Korea as the culprit.
