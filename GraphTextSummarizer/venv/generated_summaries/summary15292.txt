After all, airlines have had Internet on board for a couple of years now and it has become quite common. -- When United recently announced that it would install inflight Internet on all its mainline aircraft beginning next year, it might not have seemed like a big deal.

In fact, Southwest has been installing satellite Internet for a while now as well, but there is one big issue. This is the first effort by a U.S. airline to provide Internet on intercontinental flights.
