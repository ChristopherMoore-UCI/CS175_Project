"Last season saw a number of incidents where fans were targeted by allegedly far-right activists on the continent and subjected to anti-Semitic abuse by opposition fans," said a club spokesman. English football fans have been warned they face criminal prosecution if they continue to chant a word which has been deemed anti-Semitic. "Its historic association with Mosley's fascists and continued use by antisemites outside football mean that it has no place in football grounds or anywhere else. "We are committed to tackling discrimination in all its forms and that includes anti-Semitic behavior in football," FA general secretary Alex Horne said in a statement. "The FA appreciates that language is a complex issue: the use and meaning of words is constantly evolving," read a statement.
