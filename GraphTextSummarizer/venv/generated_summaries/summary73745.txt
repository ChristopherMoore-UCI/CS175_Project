But Merka is a key port city because it allows WFP to reach more of southern Somalia. On Tuesday, Al-Shabaab took control of two towns near Merka -- Bulo Marer and Quryoley -- giving it a strategic base in central Somalia, where it also controls Kismayo, the country's third-largest city. "Merka is a very strategic location for us, a natural beach port .. that we plan to continue using." Ninety percent of WFP's food for Somalia arrives by sea, either through Mogadishu or Merka. So far, Al-Shabaab's seizure of Merka has not affected the U.N. World Food Programme's aid shipments to the port city, WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon told CNN. Residents of Merka said hundreds of heavily armed Al-Shabaab fighters stormed the city without a fight, as rival militias who controlled the town had left Merka hours earlier.
