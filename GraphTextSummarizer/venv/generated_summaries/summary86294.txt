Critics had argued that the proposal favored the private health care system by allowing access to government funds while the state-funded system lacks financial aid. Protesters seeking the ouster of Romanian President Traian Basescu and early elections gathered for a fourth straight day Sunday in a main square of Bucharest, the capital, and 18 other cities in the Eastern European nation. The protests broke out Thursday after the resignation of Deputy Health Minister Raed Arafat, an opponent of health care reforms proposed by the government. Others carried signs reading "Liberty" and "Down with President Basescu." "The hospitals don't want the change, the (doctors) don't want the change and neither does the emergency health care system," Basescu said.
