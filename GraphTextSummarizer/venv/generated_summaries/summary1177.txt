Health care costs are growing out of control and government wastes money on programs that duplicate other programs or are just unnecessary. We can only do that by passing a comprehensive fiscal plan, like those put forward by the Fiscal Commission and the Gang of Six, which phases in the changes, contains real cuts that fix our mounting national debt problem and erases the uncertainty that afflicts businesses and other governments who hold our debt. We simply don't raise enough revenue to pay the bills for the level of government that an overwhelming bipartisan majority has consistently supported. Businesses know that spending cuts and tax increases are coming, but they do not know how, when or even why. Tax revenues stood at 15% of GDP last year, the lowest level since 1950.
