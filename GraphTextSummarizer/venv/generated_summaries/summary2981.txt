Many hotels pass these complaints along to the hotel and may fine it if the grievances aren't resolved quickly. After some discussion about the storm, the hotel told us both independently that, due to the extreme circumstances, we would receive refunds. Kristin Budden's hotel promises her a refund for her nonrefundable hotel room after a hurricane strikes. I contacted Holiday Inn on your behalf and it promised you a full refund. Lucky for us, the weekend that we were to be in San Antonio was the same weekend Hurricane Ike plowed through Texas.
