-- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, dogged by widespread speculation about his health, appeared chipper and energetic in a television appearance over the weekend. "This reporter has been told that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive cancer that has 'entered the end stage,'" Varianzas President Rafael Delgado told reporters in May that the October presidential elections will be very close, and trends could quickly change depending on campaigning styles and economic trends. Eleven months after Chavez first announced his cancer diagnosis, Venezuelan officials have released few details about his treatment. Recent polls have offered different assessments of how Chavez's health could impact Venezuelan voters when they cast their ballots on October 7.
