Which is all a longish way of saying that Apple's been offering iPhone repairs in-store for some time — and it looks like that repair program's about to expand significantly. The repairs should be free if you're covered under AppleCare, but you'll have to pony up if not — $79 for a new battery and $29 for Home button replacement, according to 9to5Mac's sources. The other items on the list of in-store replaceable parts are said to include volume buttons, the vibration engine, the rear-camera, the speaker system and the Home buttons — though in the latter case, it sounds like not on the iPhone 5s, which employs a more sophisticated Touch ID fingerprint button. 9to5Mac's sources say Apple is rolling out "special machinery" to allow the stores to replace and calibrate the touchscreens on the iPhone 5s and 5c, and that the cost for such replacement would be $149. Had those parts been distressed, I assume my only option would have been full phone replacement.
