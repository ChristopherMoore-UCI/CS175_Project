The lack of minorities in U.S. fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits around the nation. As part of United States of America and Vulcan Society Inc. vs. City of New York, a group of black firefighters alleged the city had intentionally discriminated against them, violating Title VII, the U.S. Constitution and state law. -- New York City agreed in a settlement Tuesday to pay $98 million in back pay and benefits to entry-level firefighters who claim the New York Fire Department used a biased entrance exam that kept African-American and Latinos off the job. Because of the hereditary nature of the fire department, white candidates were recruited and supported throughout the application process by family or neighborhood contacts, and whites consistently passed while minority candidates failed. "We look forward to a new era in which African-American and Hispanic firefighters are full and equal participants in the FDNY's proud tradition of protecting and serving the people of the city of New York," said Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
