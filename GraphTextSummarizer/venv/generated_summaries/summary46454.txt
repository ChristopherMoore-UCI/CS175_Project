Up until 2012, Boko Haram attacks appeared to be largely funded by bank robberies. Thus far, Boko Haram has shown little interest in the world outside of Nigeria and the Sahel. But the situation in Nigeria is dynamic, and it is possible that closer ties will develop between al-Qaeda and elements of Boko Haram. Instead of the international jihad, Boko Haram continues to be focused primarily on internal Nigerian issues. Should ties between the United States and the Abuja government strengthen under the guise of a common "war on terror," American interests -- though limited in Northern Nigeria -- could become a Boko Haram target, not least because "the friend of my enemy is my enemy."
