He said what is unique to Australian bush fires -- as against wildfires in the U.S. or forest fires in Europe -- was their ability to throw "spot fires:" that is, carry embers on the wind and start fresh fires at a massive distance from the fire front. With the pattern of bad fire weather recurring during the fire season, he said new fires are sparked by old fires with depressing regularity. "The thing to understand about fires, particularly landscape fires such as bush fires, is that they do follow physical processes ... where a fire appears to burn some houses and not others, there is a reason for that and that was because there was less fuel or a disconnection in the fuel." "There's a great potential for them to start new fires -- it allows bush fires to overcome breaks in fuel and topography. One of the biggest causes of bush fires in Australia are 'escaped' fires."
