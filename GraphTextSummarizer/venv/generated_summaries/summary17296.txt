The Spanish government - wary of ETA's unilateral cease-fire because the armed militants have broken previous cease-fires - has said it would not cease police operations against the group blamed for 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. -- Spanish police arrested 10 people early Tuesday for suspected links to the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA, just a week after the group's latest cease-fire announcement Spanish media reports said police believe the suspects were trying to rebuild Ekin, whose tasks include passing directives from ETA's leadership to a string of shadowy support groups. Since then, the government and opposition parties have been generally united in their stance that further ETA cease-fires would be insufficient and that the only statement needed was ETA's commitment to give up its fight. There are about 800 ETA convicts or suspects in prisons in Spain and in France, ETA's traditional rearguard base, the Spanish government has said.
