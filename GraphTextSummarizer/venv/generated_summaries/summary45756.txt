-- RadarOnline released another audio recording Tuesday of a vicious argument allegedly between actor Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, in which the man is accused of striking the woman and the couple's child -- an accusation the man does not deny. Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that he struck her in the face, according to her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. Gibson came under fire in 2006 when he admitted to making anti-Semitic remarks during a drunken driving arrest. " Grigorieva, 40, has acknowledged that the female voice on the recordings is hers and that the other voice is Gibson's. The Malibu Hills Police Department opened an investigation earlier this month into an alleged domestic violence dispute between Gibson and Grigorieva.
