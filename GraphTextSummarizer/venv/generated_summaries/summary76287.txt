With the reopening of the direct communication line, the two Koreas are able to discuss issues such as holding reunions for separated families and initiate contact for aid or inter-Korean talks. -- The South Korean Ministry of Unification confirmed Wednesday that it has reopened communication channels with Pyongyang, North Korea, in the border area of Panmunjom. North Korea said the strike was in retaliation to South's navy firing into Northern waters. South Korea and the international community blamed the North for the sinking, but Pyongyang has denied the accusations. Tensions rose again in November, when North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island.
