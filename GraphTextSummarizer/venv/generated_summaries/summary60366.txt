The poll found that urban Americans have a rosier view of the economy, with 43% saying it's in good shape compared to 39% of those surveyed in suburban areas and 31% in rural areas. But a slim majority of those surveyed said they're confident things will improve, with 52% saying they believe the economy will be in good shape a year from now while 46% said it'll be in poor shape. "With the economy remaining the top issue on the voters' minds, the downturn in positive views of the economy could not have come at a worse time for Democrats," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Just 38% of Americans believe the economy is in good shape, a CNN/ORC International poll of 1,018 adults, conducted Oct. 24-26, found. A CNN/ORC International poll released Tuesday found that 68% of Americans say they're angry about the way things are going in the United States.
