Fires in homes are responsible for more than 80% of fire deaths in the United States, according to the agency. Christmas tree fires are three times more deadly than home fire in general, according to the National Fire Protection Association. It was fed by a towering Christmas tree that was cut about two months earlier, fire officials said. "The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and heat to cause the fire to spread as quickly as it did," Deputy Chief Scott Hoglander said. Smoke detectors in homes are common but fire sprinklers are not, says the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
