So far this summer, 89 people have died in anti-India demonstrations in Kashmir, the predominantly Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir state where many favor severing ties with New Delhi. Protesters torched two Christian missionary schools and several government buildings, after which the Indian government imposed a round-the-clock curfew, forcing a complete lock-down on the region and creating shortages in essential items including baby food, milk and produce. All flights in and out of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, were suspended for the first time in a decade. -- Four people were killed and eight others wounded Wednesday when police fired on demonstrators in the town of Mendhar in India's Jammu and Kashmir state, a local official said. Divisional Commissioner Pawan Kotwal told CNN that protesters tried to burn down another school run by Christian missionaries in Mendhar, a Muslim town southwest of Srinagar that is in the predominantly Hindu area of the state.
