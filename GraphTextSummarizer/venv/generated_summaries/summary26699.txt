After visiting a group of health care workers who'd recently returned from the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa -- some still within the virus's 21-day incubation period, but showing no symptoms -- Obama said policies like states requiring three-week quarantines of doctors and nurses who treated Ebola patients could harm U.S. efforts to stop its spread. Obama's event Wednesday featured Kent Brantly, an American doctor who was infected with Ebola while working in West Africa and is now free of the virus. President Barack Obama took more thinly-veiled shots at governors like New Jersey's Chris Christie on Wednesday, saying the mandatory quarantine policies some states have imposed amount to "hiding under the covers" from Ebola. Introducing Obama, Brantly said more health care workers are badly needed there. Chris Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' Obama said doctors and nurses volunteering to work in the region demonstrates "American exceptionalism."
