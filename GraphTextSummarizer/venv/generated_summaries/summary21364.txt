The South Americans took a deserved lead after 39 minutes through Antolin Alcaraz's header but an error from goalkeeper Justo Villar gifted Daniele De Rossi the equalizer in the second half. Perhaps unsurprisingly the opening goal came from a set piece, with Alcaraz jumping above Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro and De Rossi to meet Torres's free-kick with a firm header into the corner. Italy raised the tempo of the game in the second half and Simone Pepe almost converted a fine cross from Gianluca Zambrotta. -- World Cup holders Italy came back from a goal behind to secure an unconvincing 1-1 draw with Paraguay in their opening Group F match. "I just regret that we did not get the points we deserved, but sometimes that's what happens, you get less than you deserve," Italy coach Marcelo Lippi told AFP.
