New Jersey citizens -- and Whitney fans and haters alike -- have been debating this question since Gov. Chris Christie announced he would fly the state's flags at half-staff for the singer Saturday as mourners attend her funeral in Newark, New Jersey. Franco and Zimbardo argue that we pay a cultural price when we praise athletes and celebrities as "heroes": We lose sight of the strong moral qualities that should define heroism, and we lose touch with what it takes to nurture more demanding forms of heroism. In fact, the sad truth is that for more than a decade, Whitney Houston sat on the end of the moral spectrum opposite from presidents and war heroes. But he has strongly defended the order, hailing Houston as "a daughter of New Jersey" who should be honored for her "cultural contributions. Indeed, giving this honor to Houston seems to illustrate what psychologists Zeno Franco and Philip Zimbardo have called our increasingly "watered-down" view of heroism.
