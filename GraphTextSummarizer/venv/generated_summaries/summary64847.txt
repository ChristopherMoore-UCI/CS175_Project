-- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II shook hands Wednesday with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness in a historic gesture marking a giant step forward in the peace process relating to British rule of Northern Ireland. Handshake the latest step on road to Northern Ireland peace "It went good, it went really well," McGuinness said afterwards, adding he is "still a republican" who opposes British rule of Northern Ireland. McGuinness has been a key player in ending the conflict between pro- and anti-British forces in Northern Ireland. There were also scuffles between pro- and anti-British groups in Belfast Tuesday night over an Irish flag put up on a mountain overlooking the city in protest of the Queen's visit, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said Wednesday. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles.
