-- Yemen formed a new unity government, the latest step in the implementing of the pact leading to the controversial president's departure from office, the state news agency said on Wednesday Yemeni Vice President Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi issued a decree forming the government and 35 ministers were named. Youth revolution activists, who've been leading the protests to remove President Ali Abdullah Saleh, greeted the move cynically. " "There are worrying reports of injured people being unable to reach medical facilities, and of facilities being attacked and damaged," said Eric Marclay, the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen. The others have been Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. But heavy clashes raged in northern Sanaa between government forces and opposition fighters loyal to the Ahmar clan in Hasaba district.
