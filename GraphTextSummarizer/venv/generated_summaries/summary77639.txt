-- A raging blaze at a fuel storage complex in Puerto Rico lit up the night sky Friday near San Juan as firefighters battled to keep it from spreading further. "This is a tremendous amount of smoke, and fire contains all kinds of irritants and this is oil that is burning," said Mary Mears, spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency region that includes Puerto Rico. Schools in Bayamon, San Juan, Toa Baja and Catano were closed, as was Puerto Rico Road 28. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent a team of fire investigators, but have yet to determine whether the fire was an accident or set deliberately, said Orlando Felix, ATF Resident Agent in Charge of the Puerto Rico office. "I don't think there's ever been a fire like this in Puerto Rico," Fire Lt. Jose Atorre told CNN affiliate WLII-TV.
