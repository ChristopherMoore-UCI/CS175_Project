Investigators for the Department of Justice began asking questions about Apple's business practices involving digital music at least three weeks ago, multiple music industry sources told CNET. In 2005, Apple CEO Steve Jobs said the top recording companies were "getting greedy"after music execs considered a music price hike. During the last decade, with its iPod digital music players and iTunes music store, the company completely remade the way people across the globe listen to, store, and buy music. Companies that dominate a market as much as Apple rules digital music often are accused of anti-trust violations. During the same period that Apple saw double-digit growth, Amazon also was grabbing greater market share in digital music.
