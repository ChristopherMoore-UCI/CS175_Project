Her round included 10 birdies as she surpassed the previous record set by Minea Blomqvist and Lorena Ochoa. While Kim enjoyed a stellar day on the course, U.S Open champion Michelle Wie endured a difficult time after being forced to quit after just 13 holes. Wie, who only returned to action last week after a month out with a finger injury, suffered a recurrence of the problem. Kim led Australia's Karrie Webb by four shots going into Friday's action on the course where she finished fourth as an amateur two years ago. "I like hard courses, so I like it," said Kim.
