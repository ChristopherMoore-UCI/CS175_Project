-- A federal judge has blocked key parts of a Texas law that would require doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion, days before the law was set to take effect. The court also found that the sonogram law goes beyond existing informed consent laws regarding abortion and constituted a violation of the First Amendment. "Today's ruling is a huge victory for women in Texas and a clear signal to the state legislature that it went too far when it passed this law," said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. As written, the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure. U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, in Austin, Texas, found that several portions of the law are "unconstitutionally vague," and that it violates the First Amendment by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government-mandated speech.
