Kvitova books place in WTA Finals Meanwhile 800 miles north of Shenzhen, Petra Kvitova sealed her spot at WTA Finals in Singapore with victory over Eugenie Bouchard in the Wuhan Open. -- Andy Murray will look to clinch the 29th singles title of his career on Sunday when he faces Spain's Tommy Robredo in the final of the inaugural Shenzhen Open in China. The Czech player, who overwhelmed Bouchard in the Wimbledon final last July, wasted little time in seeing her Canadian opponent again winning through in straight sets 6-3 6-4. Victory means Kvitova joins Serena Williams, Simona Halep and Maria Sharapova on the list of women to have sealed qualification for next month's season-ending finals. Victory for Murray on Sunday would not only cap a welcome return to form but also boost his chances of reaching the ATP Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena in November.
