"Between September and last week, park biologists aggressively hazed this elk 28 times to discourage it from approaching the road and visitors," they said. Humans visiting the Cataloochee area of the national park had apparently been feeding the young bull elk, which then "lost his instinctive fear of humans," officials said. " "The behavior that it learned from park visitors who had given it food had been too strongly ingrained," making it unlikely the elk would change his offensive ways, they said. York, who hunched over and and remained still through much of the encounter, was not injured, but "if the animal had approached a child instead of an adult, the outcome for the visitor could have been very different," park officials said. This elk was the first euthanized in the park since the animals were reintroduced there by park officials 13 years ago, the release said.
