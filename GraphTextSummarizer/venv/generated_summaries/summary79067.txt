The tour is a spin-off from the PBS special "Hit Man: David Foster & Friends," in which Foster used the piano to accompany artists such as Andrea Bocelli, Groban and Buble in a showcase of songs he'd written or produced in his 35-year career. The man credited for nurturing such talents as Celine Dion, Josh Groban and Michael Buble? The contest aspect will give audiences a chance to watch Foster groom fresh talent, a process normally confined to sterile recording studios. David Foster is involved with a talent contest in which winners get to perform with him on tour. "There's so much talent," says long-time record producer David Foster.
