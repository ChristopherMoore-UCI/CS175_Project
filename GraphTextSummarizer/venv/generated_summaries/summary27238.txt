Authorities across Europe have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products. February 2012 is six months before what had been thought to be the earliest possible time frame where horse meat had been discovered in products labeled as 100% beef. A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the UK said the issues of possible falsified horse paperwork and the issue of horse meat substitution are unrelated. Tesco and Aldi issued statements saying they are boosting testing on meat products to protect customers, restore confidence and ensure product quality. Unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland.
