Clarke became the third player from Northern Ireland to win a major title in the past 13 months, following Rory McIlroy's U.S. Open triumph last month and Graeme McDowell's success at the same tournament last year. Two decades after he first entered the season's third major event, the 42-year-old made history as he triumphed by three shots from Americans Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson in its 140th staging at Royal St. George's in England. Clarke dedicated his victory to his sons Tyrone and Conor, who were back in Northern Ireland where the family has returned after years living in London. France's Raphael Jacquelin was eighth on 281, while Spain's Sergio Garcia, Englishman Simon Dyson and U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love tied for ninth on 282. Having started the final day one shot ahead of 27-year-old Johnson, Clarke faced a strong challenge from fellow 40-something Mickelson.
