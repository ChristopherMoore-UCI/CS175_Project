This past year saw a large number of hospital mergers and acquisitions in health care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 30% of health care procedures, tests and other services do not improve health outcomes. This is a challenge that a new generation of doctors is working to change through initiatives ranging from more transparent bedside care to public reporting of hospital performance. The culture of health care needs to change. Medical mistakes cause too many needless harm or deaths, yet few people see the problem in this context because we rarely have an open and honest conversation about the quality of health care in America.
