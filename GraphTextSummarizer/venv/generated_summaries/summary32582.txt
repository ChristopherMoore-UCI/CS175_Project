That would be basketball star LeBron James, who arrived at No. 2 on Forbes' Celebrity 100 list, having made an estimated $72 million as of June 2014. While she's setting out on joint tours with her husband -- they're currently crossing the country with their "On the Run" trek -- Beyonce's also managing her clothing company, line of perfumes, and collaborations with brands like Pepsi and H&M. All told, Forbes estimates that Beyonce earned roughly $115 million between June 2013 and June 2014. By comparison, her husband made an estimated $60 million, enough to put him in sixth place behind Oprah Winfrey (No. 4 at $82 million) and Ellen DeGeneres (No. 5, at $70 million). And yet, as Forbes notes, Beyonce's empire isn't limited to the music business. After giving what many viewed as a virtually flawless performance at the 2013 Super Bowl Halftime Show, Beyonce hasn't paused, embarking on a grand global tour while also readying the release of her self-titled visual album, "Beyonce."
