" Unarmed man shot 10 times by police Justice, the family says, would be criminal charges against Harris for killing Marlon Brown. "We knew it wasn't going to be an easy video to watch," says Krystal Brown the ex-wife and mother of Brown's children, "but in order to obtain justice, and that's what we're looking for, we knew it was something that we had to do. The family decided to go public with their story and the video in hopes of triggering public outrage that would result in pressure for officials to file criminal charges for Brown's death. On May 8, Marlon Brown was being chased by DeLand police because they allegedly saw that he was not wearing a seatbelt. While on the ground, Brown turns and faces the chasing vehicle and within seconds, his face disappears under the hood of Harris' police car.
