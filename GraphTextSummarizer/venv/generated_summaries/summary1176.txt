-- Residents of Newtown, Connecticut, took to social media Friday to share their fear, shock and horror over the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Several people on Twitter expressed concerns about relatives who attend or work at the school, where a law-enforcement official said at least 18 children were slain after gunfire erupted Friday morning. A hospital in nearby Danbury posted a Facebook update late Friday morning saying that three victims were being treated there. Do you live in the Newtown area or know people at Sandy Hook Elementary? In what now seems like a much more innocent time, the school hosted a winter concert Thursday.
