It's not easy for women who aspire to be architects to find female role models. The number is slightly higher in the United Kingdom, where around 20% of qualified architects are women. Like other professions with notoriously "leaky pipelines," many women drop out of architecture during the onerous final stages. Although just about as many women as men study in American architecture schools, only about 16% of the licensed architects in the United States are women. It's a worthy cause, and reflects the dismissive attitude toward women in architecture even today.
