We don't know whether Obama conveyed to the Chinese what he told the Russians (just let me get through the election, and I will be more flexible), but it's no secret to anyone that China holds more than $1 trillion in U.S. debt. What we need is an effective strategy of how to deal with China in the long term rather than engage in election season tactics. And the administration has failed to take other concrete steps that would reduce China's competitive advantage. Likewise, the administration has done little to offer vigorous protection of American intellectual property rights, which impacts a much broader array of U.S. business interests. There are things under our control that undermine our competitiveness in relation not only to China but to numerous other countries.
