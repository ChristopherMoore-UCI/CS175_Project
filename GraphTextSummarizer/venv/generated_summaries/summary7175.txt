Psychic Eddie Conner said Jackson couldn't help but attract such attention, even if it resulted in a life of isolation. Fans continue to gravitate toward Jackson even as they try to make sense of his passing because mourning him reinvigorates the energy and attention surrounding him, Conner said. " The desire for such a connection can cause devastation now that Jackson is gone, said psychic consultant Jack Rourke, who has worked extensively in paranormal research and consulted for major Hollywood studios. " And despite all of Jackson's troubles, Conner said he believes the star will have an opportunity at success and fame again. "When this is no longer possible because this person is gone, it creates a vacuum within us, so people need to maintain a psychological or even a spiritual stability by creating a fixed image of Jackson," he said.
