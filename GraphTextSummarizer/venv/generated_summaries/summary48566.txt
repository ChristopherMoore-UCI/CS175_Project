Sports Illustrated: Tim Tebow news, photos and covers More air time is spent on football than personal life, but Heavener says viewers see what makes Tebow a special person and athlete. The TV version goes to black just as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is about to announce Tebow's name at the draft. The documentary will get three more airings before Saturday night's Divisional Round game pitting the Broncos at the heavily favored New England Patriots. And that's one of the messages of the film, says Chase Heavener, who directed "Tim Tebow: Everything in Between." Heavener's dad and Tebow's dad were college roommates and have stayed buddies.
