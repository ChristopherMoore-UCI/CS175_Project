If pot businesses aren't violating federal law in the eight specific priorities, then banks can do business with them and "may not" be prosecuted. "As it stands, possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law, and banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctions." Attorney General Eric Holder said recently that he was moved to act as "an attempt to deal with reality that exists in these states." Speaking at the University of Virginia's Miller Center last month, Holder said forcing marijuana businesses to be cash businesses, because they can't access banks, was a public safety problem. Those transactions that banks believe are legal marijuana business can be reported to FinCEN as "marijuana limited" transactions. FinCEN's legal guidance creates two new categories for banks to report transactions with marijuana businesses.
