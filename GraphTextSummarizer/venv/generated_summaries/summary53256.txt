Corn is grown on about one-third of the country's cultivated land, mostly in central Mexico. White corn is used for human consumption while yellow corn is used primarily for animal feed. "Mexico is a net importer of corn from the United States," said Bruce Bagley, chairman of the University of Miami Graduate School of International Studies. Mexico grows two types of corn: yellow, which is similar to that grown in the United States, and white, which is native to Mexico. An increase in meat and chicken consumption in Mexico in the past decade has led to greater demand for yellow corn for animal feed.
