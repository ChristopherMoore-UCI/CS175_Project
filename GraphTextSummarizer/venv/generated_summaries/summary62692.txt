Keith Corbett, a former U.S. attorney, told CNN earlier this year that Zerilli headed a Detroit organized crime family from 1970 to 1975, but was in fact in prison when Hoffa disappeared. -- The FBI -- working on information from an aging reputed mobster -- began digging in the waist-high grass of a Detroit-area field Monday in yet another search for the remains of former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. Contrary to what's been previously thought for years, Zerilli said he was told Hoffa's disappearance was not connected to Genovese family New Jersey crime boss Anthony "Tony" Provensano who allegedly wanted to get rid of Hoffa. Instead, according to the source, Zerilli told the FBI Detroit mobsters wanted Hoffa dead. The mobster allegedly told Zerilli that Detroit's crime bosses ordered the Hoffa hit.
