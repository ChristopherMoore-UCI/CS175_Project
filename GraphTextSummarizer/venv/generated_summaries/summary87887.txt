The problem erupted for Efron as he tried to work his way from being the teen star of "High School Musical" and "Hairspray" to more adult roles with movies such as "The Lucky One" and "The Paperboy. This year, Efron is hoping that a buttoned-up lifestyle -- complete with daily workouts and a 9 p.m. bedtime, or so he says -- paired with his newfound wisdom will help him steer his career in the direction he wants it to go. "It's impossible to lead an honest and fulfilling life as a man and not make mistakes and 'fess up to them when you need to," Efron said. The 26-year-old actor best known for "High School Musical" went to rehab in 2013 but was elusive about what he sought treatment for. Earlier this year he starred in and produced the comedy "That Awkward Moment," and on May 9 his comedy with Seth Rogen, "Neighbors," will arrive in theaters.
