The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation.
