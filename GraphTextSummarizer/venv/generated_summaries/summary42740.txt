Timing is essential to the drug's effectiveness, Plan B supporters say, so getting parents and doctors involved would unnecessarily delay the teen's ability to pop the pill the "morning after." Think of a 14-year-old girl taking Plan B without the love, support and guidance of parents and without the medical supervision of a doctor. He asked the FDA to consider making Plan B available to girls of any age. The effective ingredient in Plan B is the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and this is also found in daily oral contraceptives. The "morning after pill," or Plan B, is 89 percent effective in preventing pregnancy when it's taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex.
