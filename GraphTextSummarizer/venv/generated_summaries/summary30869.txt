One thing to note: Gratuities aren't automatically added on to river cruise bills as they are with ocean cruises. Outfitters are introducing new ships with larger cabins and upscale touches such as floor-to-ceiling windows and private balconies. Even on older boats, however, river cruising has inherent perks: The ships are smaller, so the service tends to be more personal and the atmosphere among passengers is more familiar. As mentioned, alcoholic drinks are free during mealtime on most ships, but if you're craving a cocktail at some other point, that will be extra, too. Also, on most lines all excursions, food and drinks (including beer and wine at meals) are included in the cost of the trip, so there's no need to touch your wallet once you set sail.
