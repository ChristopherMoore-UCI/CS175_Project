Berlack had been a student at Vermont's Burke Mountain Academy, where he trained as recently as last week. "Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport," U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association President and CEO Tiger Shaw said in a statement. "Both of them loved what they did and conveyed that to those around them." Berlack, from Franconia, New Hampshire, was named to the U.S. Ski Team's Development Team after a spring 2013 tryout camp. "Ronnie has been a vital part of BMA since he was a young boy," headmaster Kirk Dwyer said in a statement. Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, were among a group of six athletes freeskiing at an Austrian resort.
