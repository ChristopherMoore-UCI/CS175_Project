This third round of talks, called after two previous rounds of discussions yielded little result, was marked by "serious and constructive" discussions, Iran's semi-official FARS News Agency quoted Deputy Chief Negotiator Ali Baqeri as saying. " Western powers fear that Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons, despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The EU official, who was not authorized to speak to the media due to the sensitivity of the talks, said Iran responded to proposals brought up at the last round of talks in Baghdad, "but, in doing so, brought up lots of questions and well-known positions, including past grievances." Iran rejected calls during earlier talks for it not to enrich uranium to the point that it can be used for weapons, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions weighing on its economy. Iran's counterproposal included five areas of nuclear and non-nuclear cooperation, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over Tehran's hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.
