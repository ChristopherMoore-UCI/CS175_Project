Rainfall, some of it very heavy, is expected in coastal Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh starting Friday evening, its forecast said. Tropical Cyclone Phailin is expected to make landfall somewhere near the border of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh states in India. Seas off the coast of Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh are expected to become extremely rough as the cyclone approaches. The storm will bring gale-force winds and a storm surge that may reach about 10 feet (3 meters) above the usual tide level and could inundate low-lying areas of the Odisha's Ganjam, Khurda, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts and the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh during landfall, it said. Phailin may be less intense than that at landfall and is likely to weaken as it moves on shore, but will still bring storm surges and dump heavy rainfall on inland areas in its path.
