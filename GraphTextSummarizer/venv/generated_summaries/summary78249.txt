As a ghostwriter, "you're part psychoanalyst, part best friend, part lion tamer, part interviewer and part nanny," Leigh said. " Leigh used the same techniques when helping Madonna's younger brother Christopher Ciccone write his best-selling memoir, "Life With My Sister Madonna." "Clearly I am not sitting there holding a pen with the [celebrity]," said Leigh, who has co-written autobiographies with Zsa Zsa Gabor and Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone. Leigh, the fifth and final writer to attempt Gabor's memoir, ended up uncovering a long list of lovers Gabor had previously chosen to keep under wraps -- simply by asking -- including a secret affair with Frank Sinatra. Dan Strone, the CEO of Trident Media Group, a New York-based literary agency, said the reason celebrity memoirs are taking over bookshelves is simple: People buy them.
