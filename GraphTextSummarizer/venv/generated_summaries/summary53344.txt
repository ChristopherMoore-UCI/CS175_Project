-- On October 16, 1962, President John F. Kennedy confirmed the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, thus beginning one of the most dangerous moments in modern history -- the Cuban missile crisis. The unfortunate thing is that "Full Metal Jacket" is timeless, because we're still solving our differences with military might, rather that the lessons we learned from men like John F. Kennedy and the art of peaceful negotiations and diplomacy. Modine: I think I could teach John F. Kennedy a thing or two about the art of negotiation! It was through intelligence and negotiation that war was avoided. There's information that so many millions of Americans are not aware of that took place between President Kennedy and (Soviet Premier Nikita) Khrushchev.
