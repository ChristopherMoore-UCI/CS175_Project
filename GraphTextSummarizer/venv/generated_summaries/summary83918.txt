The heads of both major political parties battled Sunday over the handling of Rep. Anthony Weiner's scandal, with the Republican Party boss accusing Democrats of inaction and the Democratic Party leader accusing Republicans of a "double standard." Speaking to the media on Saturday, Weiner said he has "made some serious mistakes and I'm trying to redeem myself," adding that his "remarkable" wife -- Huma Abedin, a senior aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- is doing well. The debate came the same day that TMZ published photos of Weiner, in various states of undress, which he apparently took of himself in a locker room. See photos at TMZ.com After apologizing last week, Weiner said he had exchanged "messages and photos of explicit nature with about six women in the last three years," communicating with them online and, occasionally, on the phone. " An attorney representing the teen's family said in a statement Sunday that the 17-year-old had Twitter contact with Weiner, and that the tweets "were not salacious or in any manner inappropriate."
