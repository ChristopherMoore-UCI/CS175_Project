If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state. It was a drastic change in tone from less than two weeks ago, when a tearful Arias, minutes after her murder conviction, told a local television station that she wanted to be sentenced to death. "I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life, and that still is true today," she told Phoenix television station KSAZ. After months of dramatic testimony full of so many twists and turns that people lined up for seats in the Phoenix courtroom, jurors began deliberations Tuesday to decide whether Arias should get the death penalty or life in prison for murdering her ex-boyfriend. Defense attorney Jennifer Willmott argued Tuesday that Arias' life should be spared.
