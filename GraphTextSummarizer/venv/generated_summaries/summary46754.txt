He is being transferred to New Delhi from Bihar state in eastern India for questioning and DNA tests, said Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat. The assault on the 5-year-old came just four months after a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang-raped in a bus in New Delhi, setting off furious protests in India. The 5-year-old girl's case sparked protests in New Delhi last week. The second suspect is accused of being an accomplice in the case, which has prompted protests in the streets of New Delhi. Indian police have arrested a second man in connection with the rape of a 5-year-old girl in New Delhi, a police spokesman said Monday.
