-- A 62-year-old man man was arrested early Thursday and faces criminal mischief charges for allegedly applying a herbicide commonly used to kill trees and brush to landmark 130-year-old live oaks on the edge of the Auburn University campus in east-central Alabama, police said. Asked Thursday whether the trees will die, Stephen Enloe, assistant professor of agronomy and soils at Auburn, grew emotional. The poisonings -- which came to light after a man called a Birmingham, Alabama, radio show and said he had poisoned the trees -- came as a heartbreaking shock to Auburn fans. The substance has never been used at Auburn, horticulture professor Gary Keever told reporters Thursday. "Al" mentioned a jersey with Auburn quarterback Cam Newton's number placed on the statue of former Alabama coach Paul "Bear" Bryant at the time of the 2010 game.
