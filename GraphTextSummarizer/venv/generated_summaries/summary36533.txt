Samsung Galaxy phones have outsold Apple's iPhone during various periods over the past year, as Apple has been dinged by critics who say the company's phones are no longer breaking new ground. Curved screens are a rarity among smartphones, which typically feature flat, rectangular displays. D.J. Lee, Samsung's head of mobile marketing, made the announcement at an event in Seoul to roll out the Galaxy Gear smartwatch and Galaxy Note 3 smartphone. Early this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company showed off prototypes of a line of flexible display screens it calls YOUM. "This new form factor will really begin to change how people interact with their devices and open up new lifestyle possibilities," Brian Berkeley, senior vice president of Samsung's display lab, said at the January event.
