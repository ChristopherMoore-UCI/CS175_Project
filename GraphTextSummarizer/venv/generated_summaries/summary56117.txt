Former Associated Press correspondent Bryan Mealer, who covered Africa, wrote a book, "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind," after hearing Kamkwamba's story. " Kamkwamba was kicked out of school when he couldn't pay $80 in school fees, and he spent his days at the library, where a book with photographs of windmills caught his eye. "All of us, even my mother, thought that he had gone mad," said his sister Doris Kamkwamba. Mealer, a native of San Antonio, Texas, said he lived with Kamkwamba in his village for months to write the book. Villagers would surround him to snicker and point, Kamkwamba said.
