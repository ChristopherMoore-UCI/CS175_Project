De Blasio said misdemeanor marijuana arrests disproportionately affect young people in minority groups in New York City. "You will see fewer unnecessary arrests," he said, noting that misdemeanor marijuana arrests have declined for several years. The policy change, which goes into effect November 19, will only affect cases involving 25 grams (.88 ounce) or less of marijuana, Police Commissioner William Bratton said. 'You will see fewer unnecessary arrests' De Blasio said the policy change will also free up New York City police to concentrate on more serious crimes. De Blassio and Bratton said they do not support legalizing recreational marijuana.
