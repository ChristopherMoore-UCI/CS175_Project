The first and "very preliminary" autopsy results have just been released, and they paint a very grim picture of how Michael Brown died: He was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, according to acclaimed pathologist Dr. Michael M. Baden, who conducted the autopsy at the request of Michael Brown's family. Where witness accounts differ, an autopsy can provide certainty, as it will allow us to recreate the crime scene and -- with certainty -- know how far apart the men where, what Brown was doing when he was shot and whether he ever had his hand on Wilson's gun. The two men struggled briefly, and then Wilson, still in his car, shot Brown once, Johnson said. He said that Wilson then approached Brown and fired several more shots until he "crumbled into a fetal position." Brown then punched him in the face and Wilson reached for his gun.
