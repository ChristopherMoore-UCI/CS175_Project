Officials with Hadi's office confirmed Saleh will depart Yemen this week, but would not divulge his destination. Before Hadi became acting president in November, Yemen had been engulfed in anti-Saleh protests. -- After seeing his three-decade rule come to an end, Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, will leave the country for Ethiopia this week, ruling party officials said Monday. Saleh and Hadi appeared at the presidential palace Monday for a former handover of power ceremony amid cautious optimism and ongoing threats of violence in the country. Acknowledging the numerous challenges faced by Yemen, Hadi added, "We are in front of a difficult and complex time and the Yemeni people, who in millions participated in the early elections, gave a clear message for standing with security and stability in order for better change."
