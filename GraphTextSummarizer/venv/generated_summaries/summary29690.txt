During his visit to New York, Banksy has also referenced September 11 in a street art stencil of the Twin Towers in Tribeca. According to The New York Times, Banksy submitted the op-ed -- entitled "The biggest eyesore in New York is not the graffiti, argues Banksy, it's under construction at ground zero" -- and artwork, but the paper declined to publish it. Instead, Banksy published the scathing piece on his blog, which he has been using to unveil new works of art around New York from his monthlong series "Better Out Than In." In his essay, Banksy writes the tower is a construction sign that says New York has lost its nerve. New Yorkers who were directly affected by the attacks on September 11, 2001, were insulted by Banksy's remarks.
