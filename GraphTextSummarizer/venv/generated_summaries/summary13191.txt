As Rep. Bill Cassidy wages a runoff campaign against Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, he'll get some in-person support this weekend from Sarah Palin and  "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson. Palin previously endorsed Cassidy's GOP primary opponent Rob Maness, but now that the race has narrowed to a contest between Cassidy and Landrieu, Palin will help shore up the GOP vote for Cassidy. Palin and Robertson will attend a GOP unity rally for Cassidy on Saturday afternoon in Monroe, Cassidy's spokesman confirmed. In Louisiana's jungle primary system, Landrieu won roughly 42% of the vote, while Cassidy took 41% and Maness took 14%. CNN election results Republicans, eager to make another pick-up in the Senate, are spending big to rally the state's GOP voters around Cassidy.
