Illegal fireworks destroy 14 boats Seattle authorities said illegal fireworks sparked a massive fire that caused $1.5 million in damage. The show, carried out by a pyrotechnics company, was part of an annual series of fireworks displays that began in the city in 1970, police Chief Mitch McCann said. A firework landed on a boat cover at a boat storage facility on the north end of Lake Union, Seattle Fire Department spokesman Kyle Moore said. Seattle also had three roof fires started by fireworks, according to Moore. Twenty-three of the 26 people who were treated at Simi Valley Hospital were released by Friday morning, said hospital CEO Kim Milstein.
