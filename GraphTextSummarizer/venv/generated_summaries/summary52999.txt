General Electric Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, who also chairs U.S. President Barack Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness,  was in Tokyo on Sunday meeting with Tokyo Electric officials. On Monday, a Tokyo Electric spokesman said the idea of wrapping some or all of the plant's six reactors containment buildings in massive amounts of sheeting, in order to curb the release of radiation had been discussed in recent talks with government officials. Still, there was no immediate indication that officials would lift restrictions on the sale and distribution of certain products from areas near the stricken plant, put in place after tests detected high radiation levels in some food. This struggle is part of the larger, daunting challenge facing Tokyo Electric and Japanese officials as they come to grips with the scope of the disaster and work feverishly to keep nuclear fuel cool and prevent the further release of dangerously radioactive material. Fixing the problem quickly is critical because officials believe it is one source of alarmingly high levels of radiation spotted in seawater near the plant.
