That's what The Yemen Times, an English-language newspaper in the country, wrote about American photographer Luke Somers earlier this week, after the al Qaeda militants who were holding Somers hostage threatened his life in a videotape. Somers was killed in Yemen on Friday during an attempted rescue mission by U.S. Navy SEALs. The organization also pointed out that the "raid is at least the third to be launched by U.S. special forces in an attempt to rescue American journalists held hostage in Syria and Yemen. All of the raids failed to rescue the journalists." Professor: Smart, thoughtful, sensitive Somers graduated from Beloit College in southern Wisconsin in 2008. The sentiment that Somers was deeply dedicated to Yemen was shared by his own family members and friends.
