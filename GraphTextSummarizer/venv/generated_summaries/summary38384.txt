The National Weather Service said "probable tornados" caused significant damage across central Mississippi, including in Yazoo, Attala, Warren, Oktibbeha, and Smith counties. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of the state, four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson, and one was from Holmes County, also in north central Mississippi. A tornado touched down in Yazoo County on Monday night, causing damage to a downtown Yazoo City courthouse and tossing debris in a wide area, according to emergency management spokesman. -- State authorities dispatched emergency crews Tuesday to survey the damage after an onslaught of severe weather in Mississippi that injured at least 17 people, damaged property and cut power. In Attala County, storms damaged several mobile homes, injuring six people and leaving parts of the area without power, the service said.
