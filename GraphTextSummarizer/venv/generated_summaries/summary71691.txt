Baker said the auction house may be able to release more information on the winning bidder Thursday. But since the nugget, found last year in Nevada County, California, is believed to be the largest one left from the state's gold rush, it has special value. "We valued it at around $200,000," said Amy Baker, auction manager for Holabird-Kagin American. A gold nugget, weighing 100 troy ounces, sold at auction in Sacremento for $400,000 Wednesday night. An estimated 500,000 people traveled to California between 1848 and 1864 in search of instant wealth.
