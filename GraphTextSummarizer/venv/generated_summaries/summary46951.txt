"To be honest, before I had North, I never really gave racism or discrimination a lot of thought. " There's also been chatter about who will and won't be coming to the Kardashian-West wedding -- People magazine has indicated that the Kardashian family will be there, but not West's pals Jay Z and Beyonce -- while others have gossiped about the details of Kardashian's wedding dress. In a blog post titled "On My Mind," Kardashian spoke about how welcoming daughter North with West last June is like getting "to see the world for the first time again, but through someone else's eyes. Those photos are old or Photoshopped." After Kardashian got those wedding-related thoughts off her chest, she turned to a more serious matter: how being a mother of a mixed-race child has affected her understanding of racism. The 33-year-old opened up Wednesday on topics ranging from the truth about her wedding dress to racism.
