In the years when the bubble reached levels that were clearly unsustainable, from 2002 to 2007, housing was just about the worst possible place to keep wealth. Greenspan's failure is history now, but we should demand that the Fed take asset bubbles more seriously in the future. While most people are hurting badly, the very rich -- whose wealth and income have grown disproportionately big in recent times -- have largely recovered from the downturn. It should be apparent that housing is not a safe asset, even when we are not in a bubble. Median family income in 2010 was down by 7.7% from its 2007 level and 6.3% from its level a decade ago.
