"On average, women in developing countries walk 6 kilometers a day to collect water" because there is not enough of it nearby, Undersecretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero told CNN. Elynn Walter, the sustainability director with the Washington-based WASH Advocacy Initiative, which works to raise and funds and awareness to address the problem, said women in many developing countries are expected to supply water while men tend to other chores. -- Nearly a billion people worldwide have limited access to clean water, the State Department says, and the crisis disproportionately affects women and girls. " Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has elevated water to one of her key issues, providing $770 million through USAID in 2009 toward increasing access to water and sanitation, particularly for people living in developing countries. Otero said water problems are not limited to the third world, however.
