Studying ancient trash from around the world gives archaeologists and historians the chance to understand the habits that defined people's daily lives, said Dr. Richard Meadow, Director of the Peabody Museum's Zooarchaeology Laboratory and Senior Lecturer on Anthropology at Harvard University. "The way that ancient cities used to grow and change through time is actually very much related to the evolution of trash," Meadow explained. Dr Richard Meadow will give a lecture entitled 'The archaeologist's view of trash' at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology on October 6. Trash is a proxy for human behavior. " The Peabody Museum is staging a series of talks and events, entitled Trash Talk: The Anthropology of Waste until Spring 2012, on the importance of trash to our understanding of human behavior, both in the past and now.
