Earlier this year, Shiite protesters in the Qatif region urged the Saudi government to release Shiite prisoners and grant more rights. Al-Turki said Thursday's violence in Qatif "started gradually Monday and it escalated with what happened today." The fighting occurred in the Qatif region of Eastern Province, where many Shiites in the predominantly Sunni country live. There have been street disturbances in nearby Bahrain, a predominantly Shiite country ruled by a Sunni monarchy. Four people were killed and nine people were injured in clashes in Saudi Arabia, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
