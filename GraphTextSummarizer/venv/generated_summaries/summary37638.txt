The sounds of war, once terrifying and alien, are now utterly familiar to the young man who goes by the pseudonym Abu Wasfi. " Abu Wasfi is part of a rebel fighting force that says it is protecting the neighborhood of Khaldiye in the flashpoint city of Homs. The local rebel commander, who goes by Abu Hadid, crawls through holes fighters smashed between buildings to be able to stealthily move around. He defected because he was told to kill innocent civilians and given orders to shoot at demonstrators," says Abu Wasfi. "Give me the radio, give me the radio," Abu Al-Baraa calls out as a hail of bullets from government forces drowns out his orders.
