On Sunday, gunmen killed two polio workers who were making home visits in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwestern Pakistan, police said. The university bus was parked at the school on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province in southwestern Pakistan. "All the (bus) victims are women teachers and students," said Mir Zubair Mehmood, a police official in Quetta. Militants, including a female suicide bomber, attacked a university bus carrying women in southwestern Pakistan and then struck a hospital where the survivors were taken for treatment, authorities said Saturday. The blast shattered the windows of offices and classrooms inside Sardar Bahadur Khan Women University.
