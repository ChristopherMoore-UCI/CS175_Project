" "We are a part and parcel of the mosaic society of New York â€” the quilt of cultures that represents New York City," Heutlinger said. St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City Although St. Patrick's Cathedral isn't as tall as the skyscrapers that surround it, the cathedral has an old-world grandeur that's rare in New York. Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah Not everyone who travels to the Salt Lake City Temple is allowed inside the walls, but that doesn't mean they can't enjoy its splendor. Salt Lake Temple is at the heart of Temple Square, three blocks containing nearly 20 attractions significant to Latter-day Saints' life and history, such as Assembly Hall and the Salt Lake City Tabernacle. Temple Emanu-El in New York City With a sanctuary that stands 103 feet tall, 100 feet wide and 175 feet long and seating for 2,500 people, New York's Temple Emanu-El is one of the largest Jewish temples in the world.
