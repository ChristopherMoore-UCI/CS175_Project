Thus, Colorado students of the future would know that fighting for equality among the races is dangerous and might get you into trouble. While current textbooks detail the illegal labor strikes that eventually led to things like a 40-hour work week and workplace safety laws, future textbooks may make no mention of it. And even though there's no repealing women's right to vote, future generations of girls at least know never to protest against continuing forms of gender inequality, such as being paid less for doing the same job as a man. While current textbooks applaud her courage in the face of a trial, conviction and $100 fine for illegally casting a ballot in the 1872 presidential election, the Colorado textbook of the future might well ensure that her story is blotted out. As we face a future of widening inequality, resurgent discrimination, and decreasing wages, we would do well to follow the example of the Colorado students who are peacefully disobeying authorities and fighting for a truthful account of history in their textbooks.
