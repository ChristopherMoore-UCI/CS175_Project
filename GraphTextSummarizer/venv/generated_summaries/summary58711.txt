The return of the league's regular referees won't put an end to controversial calls, said retired NFL player Tiki Barber. For NFL officials, it's a side job that requires a lot of work Commissioner Roger Goodell said he was not surprised by the outcry about the Monday night game. This season's use of replacement referees climaxed in a furor over a botched call that allowed the Seattle Seahawks to walk away with a 14-12 victory against the Green Bay Packers in a nationally televised game Monday night. Even before the formal vote, the officials returned to work in Thursday night's game in Baltimore between the Ravens and the Cleveland Browns.
