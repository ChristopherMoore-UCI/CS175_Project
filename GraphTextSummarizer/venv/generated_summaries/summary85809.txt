-- Investigators found another bone on property belonging to kidnapping suspects Phillip and Nancy Garrido on Friday, as they scoured the yard for possible clues to the abductions of two other girls about 20 years ago, officials said. Police from Hayward and Dublin, California, on Tuesday began executing search warrants simultaneously on the Garrido property and an adjacent property that he had access to. Orrey said "boxes and boxes" of writings by Phillip Garrido were also recovered on the property and were being taken off-site so investigators "can look through every single page. Cadaver dogs detect decomposing matter, investigators said, and archaeological dogs search for older material. Authorities say the couple held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years and have said Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, fathered her two children.
