Senate Democrats from Republican-leaning states are under growing pressure to join GOP calls for a ban on travel between west Africa, which is the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, and the United States. It's Hagan's endorsement of the ban, though, that most clearly reflects the political pressure Democrats are feeling as a result of the threat of Ebola -- largely because it came just days after she'd expressed reservations about a similar call from her GOP opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis. But in a statement Friday Hagan said she had "said for weeks that travel restrictions should be" part of the plan to contain Ebola. Those defections are ratcheting up pressure on other Democrats -- both vulnerable incumbents and hopeful challengers -- to support a ban that top U.S. and world health officials have said would not be effective and could harm prevention efforts. North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan is the latest Democrat to back a travel ban, though she initially questioned the effectiveness of such a move and said it only made sense as one part of a broader strategy.
