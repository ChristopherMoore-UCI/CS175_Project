-- Nikolay Davydenko made a winning start in his defense of the Qatar Open title with a 6-1 6-4 victory over Italy's Fabio Fognini on Monday. The Russian, hoping to return to top form after injury blighted his 2010 season, needed just over an hour to dispatch Fognini. He beat two-time Doha champion Federer and Spain's Nadal on the way to the title last season. Davydenko is fourth seed at prestigious ATP Tour season-opener where the star attractions are the world's top two players Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, who begin their campaigns later in the week. In the Chennai Open, there was a shock defeat for reigning champion Marin Cilic of Croatia.
