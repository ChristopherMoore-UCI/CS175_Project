Officers freed the pup from the tracks and rushed her to Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, where Dr. Jamie Davidson and staff stabilized and named her. "Dogs rebound quick," said Davidson, adding Cabela is in great spirits. Tampa police found her shot and bleeding, tied to a set of railroad tracks in the city's Sulphur Springs neighborhood on Wednesday. Once she's healthy, Cabela will be spayed, vaccinated and set up for adoption, where she will be paired with a "good family," Davidson said. The cost of Cabela's treatment will run several thousands dollars, but will be picked up by the clinic.
