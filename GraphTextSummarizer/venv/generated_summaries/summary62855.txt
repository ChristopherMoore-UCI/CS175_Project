The 26-year-old Simpson is seeking to cap an incredible breakthrough year in which he won his first title at Wyndham Championship in his home state of North Carolina in August, then triumphed in the second event of the FedEx Cup playoffs and narrowly missed out on the $10 million jackpot when he faded to 22nd at the Tour Championship. -- American golfer Webb Simpson expects a close battle with world No. 1 Luke Donald this week as both seek to top the PGA Tour's end-of-season money list for the first time. The new world No. 50 carded eight birdies in the final 11 holes to finish on 15 under par, before Simpson bogeyed at the second additional hole to hand Crane victory. Donald had been in pole position in his bid to become the first golfer to top both the U.S. and European money lists in the same season, but Simpson went $363,029 clear in the PGA standings despite suffering a playoff defeat to fellow American Ben Crane at the McGladrey Classic on Sunday. Englishman Donald, who went to a friend's wedding instead, will now need to finish second or higher at the Children's Miracle Network Classic at Disney World starting on Thursday to usurp Simpson.
