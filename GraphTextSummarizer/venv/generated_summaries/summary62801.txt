"The referee lacked lucidity," PSG sporting director Leonardo told French newspaper Le Parisien. PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu and Evian's Saber Khelifa were given red cards following a mass brawl which broke out on the final whistle. PSG, who are close to securing a first French Ligue 1 title in 19 years following the win, saw Italian midfielder Marco Verratti pick up a second yellow card two minutes before Beckham was brought on. Nobody wanted to lose -- especially not Evian, who are struggling to stay up," added Leonardo, referring to Evian's place in the Ligue 1 table, with the club level of points with third from bottom Sochaux. The former England captain, who joined PSG in January on a five-month deal, was introduced as an 83rd-minute substitute for PSG before being given his marching orders for a lunging challenge on Youssef Adnane.
