Other nations with large populations of Syrian refugees include Jordan and Turkey. The number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon has passed 1 million, the United Nations' refugee agency said Thursday, making up almost a quarter of the country's resident population. For Lebanon, a small nation beset by internal difficulties, the impact is staggering," U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a statement. The total number of registered Syrian refugees in all countries is 2.58 million, according to the United Nations. Their numbers have made Lebanon the country with the highest per capita concentration of refugees in the world, the agency said.
