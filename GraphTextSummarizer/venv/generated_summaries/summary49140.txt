Christopher Dorner Renegade ex-officer Christopher Dorner led California police on a days-long chase before he was tracked to a hideout in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles. For three weeks in October 2002, the greater Washington D.C. area was virtually paralyzed by a series of random sniper murders. He was fatally shot after a team of elite Navy SEALs raided the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. Over the years, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officers have tracked a host of elusive criminals, most of them within the United States. He was discovered hidden in plain sight, living in an apartment in the oceanside city near Los Angeles.
