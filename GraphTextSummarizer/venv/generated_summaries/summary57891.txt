We have some people grow in toilets and make worm farms in old baths," says Louise Vaughan, the field area manager at Soil For Life, a non-profit that teaches gardening and nutrition to Capetonians. In the last few years, Cape Town has witnessed the proliferation of hundreds of community gardens and urban farms. Rob Small, Abalimi's co-founder, says that there are hundreds of community farms eager to join their network, though currently about 40 are members. The city is in the grips of a vegolution, and it's thanks to the efforts of local food activists, hoping to use these urban farms as a means of battling not just hunger, but poverty as well. -- Cape Town is being overrun by farms.
