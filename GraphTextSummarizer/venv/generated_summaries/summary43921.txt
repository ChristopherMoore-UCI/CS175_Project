The firings are a direct result of wrongdoing found by the VA's Office of Inspector General and the Office of Accountability Review, including significant delays and wait times of veterans, manipulation of appointment data, "neglect of duty," inappropriate handling of VA contracts and misconduct at VA facilities. VA inspector general admits wait times contributed to vets' deaths The firings also follow a yearlong investigation by CNN that found numerous instances of delays in care and, at times, deaths of U.S. veterans at VA facilities across the country. U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida and chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, who led the charge for more accountability at the VA and whose committee has been instrumental in pressing for details of wrongdoing at VA facilities, said Tuesday that he is not certain the new process of firings is enough. The VA also announced that John Goldman, the director of the VA medical center in Dublin, is in the process of being fired after the VA's inspector general revealed that the hospital's staff closed out more than 1,500 patient appointments to hide long wait times in order to meet goals set by VA headquarters. The fourth VA employee being fired, Deputy Chief Procurement Officer Susan Taylor, inappropriately influenced the awarding of VA contracts to a private company and interfered with an investigation into the matter, according to a report by the VA's inspector general.
