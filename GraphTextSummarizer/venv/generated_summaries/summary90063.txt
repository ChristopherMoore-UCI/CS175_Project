After those protests, in February 2011, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's government declared an end to a nearly two-decade state of emergency, lifting restrictions on speech and assembly imposed to combat an Islamist insurgency. The emergency declaration was part of a clampdown on Islamist movements during a civil war that left more than 150,000 dead. Algeria was the site of some Arab Spring protests, but they were not as large as in other countries in North Africa and the Middle East. About 500 international observers were on hand to monitor the voting in Algeria, a North African nation of 37 million plagued by high unemployment. The observers were from the European Union, African Union, Arab League and other organizations.
