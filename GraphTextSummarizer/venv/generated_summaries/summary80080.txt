Though the jury did not believe Arias' story that she killed Travis Alexander in self-defense, Zervakos said he believed Alexander abused her. -- A day after a jury deadlocked on whether Jodi Arias should be sentenced to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend, the jury foreman described the decision process as tense and emotional. If Arias is sentenced to death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in Arizona. Arias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped.
