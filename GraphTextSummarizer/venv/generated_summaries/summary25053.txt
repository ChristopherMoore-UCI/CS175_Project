According to one European intelligence service, there are 20 to 30 criminal gangs in the former Soviet Union that have hacking skills as good as most nations. Many companies don't encrypt the data of their customers and rely on passwords, which are very easy to hack for many transactions. Cybersecurity would not be as big a problem as it is today if the pioneers had paid more attention to security issues. And if countries like China continues to hack U.S. businesses to steal trade secrets and make competing products, American companies will lose sales and jobs. But many encryption products turned out to be hard to use, slowing computers and adding cumbersome steps to simple transactions.
