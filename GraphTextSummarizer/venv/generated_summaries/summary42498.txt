The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. Since fire season began last November, a record 3.5 million acres have burned. Meanwhile, in neighboring Oklahoma, firefighters were battling hot spots Thursday from a wildfire in northeast Oklahoma City, Fire Chief Keith Bryant said. Hot and dry weather combined with a historic drought have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer.
