It's not time yet for prosecutors to make their full case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but as attorneys spar over what evidence can be used in the high-profile death penalty case against him, the description of what materials were used to make the bombs was among several new details about last year's terror attack and its aftermath included in court documents. FBI agents questioned him on and off over a nearly 38-hour period, conducting 14 interviews and giving Tsarnaev frequent breaks, including a 10Â½-hour stretch so he could sleep, the court documents say. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to killing four people and wounding more than 200. Prosecutors say that FBI agents didn't tell Tsarnaev about his brother's death "or the manner of that death, to spare him emotional trauma. FBI agents had "reason to believe that the Tsarnaevs had accomplices and that they or others might have built additional bombs that posed a continuing danger to public safety."
