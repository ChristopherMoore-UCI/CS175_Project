What followed was a British High Court case involving Force India, Aerolab, and F1 marque Team Lotus -- now known as Caterham. It said Force India will report the case to F1's global governing body, the FIA, while continuing a criminal case against Caterham team principal Tony Fernandes, Gascoyne and Aerolab owner Jean-Claude Migeot. 2012 Formula One teams and drivers Aerolab initially launched a claim against Force India, run by team principal Vijay Mallya, for unpaid funds. The case was complicated when, shortly after their split from Force India, Aerolab signed a contract to work on Lotus' 2010 car. A statement issued by Aerolab's legal representatives on Wednesday said the company had been ordered to pay â‚¬25,000 ($39,500) in damages after work conducted during their contract with Force India had been used on Lotus' 2010 car.
