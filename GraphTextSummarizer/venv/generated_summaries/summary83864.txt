Yet Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has showed himself as just the opposite, last week whipping up the justified anger of women in the workforce with advice that they should wait patiently for pay raises. At Harvard, women faculty disagreed with their male peers by a ratio of 2-to-1 "that the climate for female faculty in the School/Department is at least as good as for male faculty." Our experience working with women in companies in media, communications and consumer products suggest that they are coming together -- and with the support of male peers -- to share wisdom and raise awareness on issues of professional ethics and equality, including harassment, unequal compensation and negative stereotyping. Microsoft revealed that while women make up 29% of its total workforce, they are 17% of its leadership -- the lowest among their tech peers, though by a slim margin of 4 percentage points. The "system" Nadella wants women to depend upon at Microsoft has not been kind.
