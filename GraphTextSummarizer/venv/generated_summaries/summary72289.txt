ISIS fighters took control of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, in early June following a quick campaign that saw Iraqi security forces quickly fold under their assault. The timing of the video also appears to coincide with a declaration by ISIS last week of the creation of an Islamic state that stretches from the northeast city of Aleppo in Syria to Iraq's Diyala province. Iraqi authorities are looking at a video that purportedly shows Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivering a sermon in Mosul to determine whether it is really the notorious leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Iraq's military spokesman said Sunday. Very little is known about al-Baghdadi, a name he appears to have adopted just before taking the reins of al Qaeda in Iraq, a group that later reformed under the banner of ISIS. A man named Al-Baghdadi was detained for four years in Camp Bucca, which was a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq.
