-- Disgust, anger and shock greeted official statements from South Korean authorities that texts and social media posts from survivors trapped inside the stricken ferry had been faked. Police successfully put out a call on social media to find any relatives of a rescued six-year-old girl who had been on board with her parents and older brother. " South Korea has been gripped by this tragedy and the pronouncement of these fake social posts added to the collective anguish -- especially as social media has been playing a crucial role in relaying information from the site. Messages such as "I am still alive... in the cafeteria please help me my battery is running out please believe me," and "My phone is not working I am inside the boat I can't see anything" were spreading on social media on Thursday -- as late as over 24 hours after the incident. All news and top searched keywords on the main Internet portals remain linked to the ship, while wishes for good news are flooding social media.
