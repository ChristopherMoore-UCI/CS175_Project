-- President Barack Obama on Sunday used his annual commemoration of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, to underscore his administration's repeated argument that the Iranian government is on the wrong side of the popular, pro-democracy movement sweeping across the region. " Tehran's Azadi Square was the site of massive anti-government protests following the controversial re-election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for whom, opponents claimed, the contest was rigged. In Obama's 2011 Sunday commemoration of Nowruz, the president addressed only the Iranian people and not their government. In his 2011 statement, Obama never strayed from referring to the Iranian government in the third person. Likewise, recent Iranian protests inspired by the Egyptian and Tunisian revolts have been stymied by force.
