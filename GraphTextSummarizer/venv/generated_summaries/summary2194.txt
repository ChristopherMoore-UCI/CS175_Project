Power-sapping technology: lighting rigs, like these ones installed at Telstra Dome are used to help grass growth. The rigs are being adopted by football stadiums across Europe and the United Kingdom to encourage grass growth, but they're creating a significant footprint in doing so. What do you think of grass lighting rigs? The floodlights, corporate boxes and big screens at sports stadiums are all massive power sappers - but there's an increasingly popular technology which is chewing more energy than ever before. The Telstra Dome in Sydney, Australia, earlier this year purchased 15 lighting rigs to improve grass growth at the venue.
