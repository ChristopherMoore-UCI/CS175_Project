The CEO of Breakr, a company that claims to connect "fans with their fandom," said in a LinkedIn post Tuesday that the company harnessed social media's "powerful fangirl demographic" to make Alex Lee, a real, 16-year-old Target employee from Texas, a global trending topic. That backtracking is just one reason why David Orr, who claims to be one of the largest social media influencers on Twitter, is also skeptical about Breakr's involvement. According to Breakr, the company took the photo of Alex Lee that was posted by a Twitter user named Abbie (@auscalum) and fanned Twitter's flames, "spreading the word amongst our fangirl followers to trend #AlexFromTarget." The "fangirl" Leonares credited with boosting the trend and "Alex from Target" both posted on Twitter that they have no connection to Breakr. People tweeted parody images and created YouTube videos while the media, including CNN, published stories about it.
