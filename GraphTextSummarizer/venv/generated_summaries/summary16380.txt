"For me the energy and draw is around the act of creation." Inspired by crop circles Amador was drawn to ancient geometric art after studying crop circle reconstructions. " Amador hopes to inspire people to "follow what brings you joy." San Franciscan Amador, 42, is an "earthscape artist." That's useful, for his canvas is ephemeral, often subject to rogue waves, high tides (he always sculpts during low tide) and dogs. He uses rope and a rake to create large geometric drawings on beaches.
