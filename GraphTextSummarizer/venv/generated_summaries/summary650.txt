Several threatening e-mails regarding Andrews have been sent to sportscaster Dan Patrick since last September, according to Marshall B. Grossman, Andrews' attorney. Grossman has also requested heightened security at Los Angeles' CBS Television City, where Andrews is competing on the show, "Dancing with the Stars." He said the e-mails received in March "are specific, they're violent, they identify the location and method of intended murder." Grossman said the existence of the threats were first revealed to Andrews on Thursday morning. Andrews is getting round-the-clock security, Grossman said. The e-mails were provided to Andrews' representatives by DirecTV, which carries the Dan Patrick Show.
