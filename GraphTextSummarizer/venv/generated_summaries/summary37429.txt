From fashion watches to sports watches, every timepiece can up your style quotient, says Block. "Watch out for brands with bloated prices thanks to merely adding precious metals and jewels to base watches and movements that aren't worth very much." "You'll never get the money back that you spent on it," says Andrew Block, the president and CEO of leading luxury watch consultancy Second Time Partners. Watches should not look petite on the wrist, and the lugs should not extend past the edge of the wrist. "Those with very complicated timepieces are advised to have a few of them so that they have something else to wear if they need to be repaired." Don't feel bad about rewarding yourself Watches are practical purchases.
