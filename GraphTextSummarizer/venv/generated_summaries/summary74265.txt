The result meant that Twente qualified for the Europa League in third place but Werder Bremen go out of Europe altogether despite beating Inter. But the Turkish hosts collected their first-ever Champions League point when Sercan Yildirim stabbed the ball past goalkeeper Allan McGregor with 11 minutes left. A victory would have seen Rafael Benitez's side go through as group winners, but their heaviest defeat in Europe for five years allowed Tottenham to win the group on 11 points after a thrilling 3-3 draw at FC Twente. With both teams already qualifying for the knockout stages, a Valencia win would have seen them go through as group winners. And they remained on course for the three points until the 63rd minute when  Anderson scored a rare goal to earn United a draw, the Brazilian midfielder reacting quickest after Park Ji-sung's shot was parried by goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.
