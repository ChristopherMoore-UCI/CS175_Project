The United States has brought  Abu Anas al Libi -- an alleged al Qaeda operative whom U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers captured in Libya this month -- to New York, a U.S. attorney's office said Monday. " "It shows the inherent flaws in the U.S. policy decision to try (terror suspects) in the U.S. because once you arrive on U.S. soil, that ends the interrogation of these high value detainees," Kind said, said, adding would not have happened if al Libi had been sent to Guantanamo Bay and faced a military commission there. He was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia. A U.S. official said al Libi received care at a medical facility in New York for a pre-existing medical condition and is "doing better." Still, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said Monday that it was "unfortunate that al Libi is on American soil, ending the interrogation process.
