Doctors at Hackensack University Medical Center performed emergency surgery on LeGrand overnight Saturday to stabilize his injured spine, the university said, but hospital officials declined to comment Monday about LeGrand's injury or condition, citing patient privacy laws. One of those fans praying for LeGrand is former Penn State University football player Adam Taliaferro. Junior defensive tackle Eric LeGrand has no movement below his neck due to the injury at the C3 and C4 level of the spinal cord, according to a statement from the university's athletics department. Doctors said Monday that with many spinal cord injuries, the first 72 hours after surgery give a good indication of how much function a patient may recover. -- A Rutgers University football player remained in intensive care Monday after suffering a spinal cord injury while making a tackle in the fourth quarter of a game against Army on Saturday.
