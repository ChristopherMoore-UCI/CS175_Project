I said, and we put it on the cover with the headline "The Winner Is..." Decades from now, when people have forgotten most of what they read inside the pages of Newsweek, they'll still remember the visual impact of covers like that one. John F. Kennedy Jr. would perish in a plane accident, or Saddam Hussein would get captured in Iraq, and we'd switch covers and have the satisfaction of looking nimble and newsy on Monday. Or it was in deciding which icons deserved covers when they died, and what new cultural figures were worth highlighting on the way up. We were closing a special issue, and we had prepared separate covers declaring each man the winner. On slower news weeks, the satisfaction was in posing a pressing or provocative question about the economy, or race relations, or gay rights, or the fight to improve our health or save our schools.
