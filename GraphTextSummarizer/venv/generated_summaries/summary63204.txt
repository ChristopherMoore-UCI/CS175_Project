Lunch is served: The dabbawalas have been serving up lunch to Mumbai residents for 118 years. Watch Manish Tripathi explain how the dabbawalas work Â» A typical day for a dabbawala starts at around 8 am when the cylindrical metal tiffin boxes are collected from homes and taken to the nearest railway station where they are loaded onto crates and transported by train to downtown Mumbai. By finding a way through the network of unmapable Mumbai streets and latterly discovering ways in which to tap into new revenue streams the dabbawalas appear future-proof, their unique system more than capable standing up to and economic downturn or personal changes in taste. People still like to take homemade food, usually every day, so that's why we're in demand," says 33-year-old dabbawala Manish Tripathi from his apartment in Borivali, a suburb of Mumbai. Not only providing a necessary and recession-proof service -- even in tough economic times, people will always need lunch -- the dabbawalas are a cooperative that can boast a business record of reliability that would have any operation salivating with envy.
