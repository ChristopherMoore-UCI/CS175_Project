-- Chinese pair Yuan Cao and Yanquan Zhang claimed gold in Monday's men's synchronized ten meter diving final. British Prime Minister David Cameron made his first trip to the aquatics center to see Daley and Waterfield in action, but he couldn't spur the pair to a podium finish. Coming from China, of course, we hope we can win more medals," said Cao. The silver medal went to Mexican pair Ivan Garcia-Navarro and German Sanchez-Sanchez, who pushed the American team of David Boudia and Nicholas McCrory into the bronze medal position with a strong final set of dives. Tom Daley, icon of the British team, and his partner Pete Waterfield led after two rounds, but blew their chances of a medal with a poor dive in round four.
