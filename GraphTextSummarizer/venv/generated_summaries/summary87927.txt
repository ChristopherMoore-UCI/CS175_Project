-- As of February, more U.S. adults own smartphones than simpler feature phones, according to new research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project. Smartphones are really hand-held computers that also happen to be able to make phone calls. Similarly, the proportion of cell owners who volunteered that they don't know what type of phone they have fell from 13% of cell owners in May 2011 to just 4% of cell owners in February 2012. As the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system becomes the norm for higher-end Android devices this year, you can bet that many people with cheap Android phones will still be running Gingerbread, unable to upgrade. In answering questions from Pew, 45% of cell phone owners said that their phone is a smartphone.
