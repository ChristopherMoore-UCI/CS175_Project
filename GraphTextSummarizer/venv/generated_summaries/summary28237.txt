By now you've either heard about or read George Will's controversial column on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. " I'd no more want to have a conversation with George Will about sexual assault on college campuses than I wish to discuss racism with Donald Sterling. By addressing the problems, colleges are turning sexual assault victims into a "coveted status." Unlike George Will, the president of Dartmouth College, Philip Hanlon, hit it head on: "From sexual assaults on campus ... to a culture where dangerous drinking has become the rule and not the exception ... to a general disregard for human dignity as exemplified by hazing, parties with racist and sexist undertones, disgusting and sometimes threatening insults hurled on the Internet ... to a social scene that is too often at odds with the practices of inclusion that students are right to expect on a college campus in 2014. Colleges prefer to sweep sexual assault cases under the rug, but students have brought the issue to light.
