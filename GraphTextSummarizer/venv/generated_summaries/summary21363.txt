In 1979, it took nearly 10 months to seal the world's largest spill in Mexico's Bay of Campeche. In both cases, efforts such as those used to try to stop the Deepwater Horizon spill -- containment domes and junk shots -- were fruitless. Relief wells have been used to plug two other large blowout spills. -- BP has said it hopes to have a relief well in place in August to permanently cut off the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. Once one hits the original pipe, just 7 inches in diameter, drilling mud will be shot into it to stop the spewing oil.
