The question is: What are GOP candidates saying when they promise to repeal health care reform but are silent on health care and poverty? You see, despite the rhetoric, the need for health care reform was not discovered by President Barack Obama in 2009. To even call health care reform "Obamacare" redirects the conversation away from the most important point: In nearly 80 years of the White House talking about health care reform, we finally have something. Obama doesn't need health care.
