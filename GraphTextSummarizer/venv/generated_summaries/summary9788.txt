"She completely surprised me," Sanford told CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper. With all the issues we are working on, we do not need him in Congress," wrote Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York in a fundraising e-mail for Colbert Busch sent in the hours after Sanford's victory. Now Sanford faces off May 7 with Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University's wind turbine drive testing facility.
