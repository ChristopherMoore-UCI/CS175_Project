-- Convicted Ohio serial killer Anthony Sowell won't be eligible for parole after being classified as a "sexually violent predator," court officials in Cleveland said Wednesday. Officer Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office, said Sowell's classification as a sexually violent predator guarantees that he can only receive life in prison without parole or the death penalty when the sentencing phase of his trial begins August 1. Sowell was found guilty of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges Friday in a string of deaths of Cleveland-area women from 2007 to 2009. Authorities discovered the bodies after a 36-year-old Cleveland woman told police a story eerily similar to those of Wade and the woman whose 1989 account led to Sowell's first conviction for attempted rape. The jury could have recommended parole if members believed Sowell could be rehabilitated, according to Greg Popovich, the Cuyahoga County court administrator.
