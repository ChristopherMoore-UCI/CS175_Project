He said bird deaths from fishing nets occur every year, but never at this level. The warm water has led fish such as anchovies and other species that live in surface waters to migrate to deeper water toward the south. As Chilean weather gets colder this time of year, migrating birds that would normally travel north for warmth are instead lingering to feast on an influx of anchovies and sardines that had fled the coast of Peru in search of cooler waters. -- Chilean officials are asking fishermen to help save birds caught in nets after thousands of dead fowl appeared along coastal Chile this week. Britos said he worries that until Monday, the number of dead birds could rise significantly.
