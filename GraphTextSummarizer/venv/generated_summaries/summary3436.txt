The United States has urged Chinese restraint after days of violent protests in Tibet, even as a deadline passed for anti-Chinese protesters to surrender. Chinese authorities have denied CNN permission to enter Tibet to report on the current situation. -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday blamed supporters of the Dalai Lama for recent violence in Tibet, and said Chinese forces exercised restraint in confronting unrest there. He said Chinese police did not fire their guns or use anti-personnel weapons against the Tibetans despite 61 police officers being injured, six seriously. The dead include women and children, the group said in an e-mail, adding they were killed by Chinese police attempting to stop the protests.
