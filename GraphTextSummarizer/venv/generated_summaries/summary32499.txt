Throughout his prolific career Mel Brooks has gone by many titles -- actor, filmmaker, producer, songwriter -- but comedy is the epicenter of his life, drawing together his early work on TV shows like "Your Show of Shows" and "Get Smart," with his notable career in film with movies like "The Producers," "Young Frankenstein" and "Blazing Saddles," a few of which have been translated to the Broadway stage. The film, which recently premiered at The Paley Center in Los Angeles, where Brooks was joined by longtime collaborator and friend Carl Reiner, is an exhaustive look at the continually hilarious -- and often moving -- output of a filmmaker and writer who is largely responsible for the tone of contemporary comedy. Brooks spoke with CNN at Brooks Films, a humble second-floor office in The Culver Studios in Los Angeles where the filmmaker still works, about what it means to have your life compressed into a 90-minute documentary. Brooks: I like the music in "Blazing Saddles" and I think it would make a good musical. CNN: There seems to be an agreement that your work set the stage for modern comedy -- does that feel true?
