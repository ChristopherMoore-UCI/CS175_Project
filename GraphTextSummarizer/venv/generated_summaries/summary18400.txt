-- After the gloom of December's postal strikes, Britain's Royal Mail has started the new year in the right tune with the launch of 10 stamps which feature iconic album covers. Other chosen album covers include The Rolling Stones' 1969 album "Let It Bleed," which features a cake on the cover baked by a then unknown Delia Smith, Pennie Smith's photography for The Clash's "London Calling" and a bent chrome pipe on the cover of Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells." "For decades, the album sleeve has been the canvas for some of the most imaginative graphic artists in the world, and this issue celebrates this unique art form and some of its greatest examples," said Juliette Edgar, Head of Special Stamps at Royal Mail in the statement. "Almost 40 years after the album came out, nobody knows the old man who featured on the cover, nor the artist who painted him," said Page in a media statement released by Royal Mail. It was after extensive research into lists and polls and trawling through thousands of album covers that the final list of 10 was agreed upon, the Royal Mail said.
