Education for Nature Vietnam has produced and commissioned a number of public service announcements aimed at curbing local demand for wildlife, but never one for the pangolin, which generally doesn't get the funding of the more "charismatic" wildlife species, either because it is little known or isn't thought to be as cute. "People said it was impossible to change China, but the evidence we are now getting says consumption of shark fin soup in China is down by 50% to 70% in the last two years," WildAid Executive Director Peter Knights told The Washington Post. Cut wildlife demand and rhinos, elephants and sharks live. The extra CNN reader donations not used to create that ad will be used to boost the group's efforts to break up the pangolin trade and out restaurants and medicine shops that are illegally selling pangolin products. Few people in the West know it exists, but it's trafficked by the ton for its scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for its meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China.
