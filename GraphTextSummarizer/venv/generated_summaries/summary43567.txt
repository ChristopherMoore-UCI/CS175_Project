-- Rep. David Wu of Oregon will not seek re-election and "is considering all options" regarding whether to serve out the rest of his term, Wu's communications director told CNN Monday. Meanwhile Wu said in a written statement given to CNN, "This is very serious, and I have absolutely no desire to bring unwanted publicity, attention or stress to a young woman and her family." In Wu's home state, Republicans and some of Wu's fellow Democrats responded to the allegations by calling for him to resign. "We need a representative on their 'A-game' and David obviously is not." Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian, a Democrat, said in a statement, "David Wu should do the right thing and step aside now." "Our stance and the stance of all Oregonians is that David Wu should step down," Allen Alley, the chairman of the Republican Party of Oregon, told CNN. He acknowledged it was not clear that Wu would step down even if the county Democratic Party called for him to do so.
