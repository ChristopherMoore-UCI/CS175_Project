America's Hunter Mahan and Ireland's Padraig Harrington are also four-under after both men shot rounds of 68 on Saturday. Overnight leaders Fred Couples and Jason Dufner couldn't keep pace with the fireworks of the leaders. Tiger Woods is also out of contention after another even par round of 72 left him 12 shots off the lead. The 34-year-old made a late charge up the leaderboard with birdies at four of the last five holes to eclipse the efforts of home favorite Phil Mickelson. Bubba Watson continues to creep up the leaderboard after another sub-par round (70) moved him up to fourth place.
