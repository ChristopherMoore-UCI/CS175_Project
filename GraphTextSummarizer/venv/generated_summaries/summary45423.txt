In brain scan studies of older males researchers have found that the brain's pleasure and reward areas, the VTA and the NAc, remain more active in men who are social. The king of male hormones -- testosterone -- goes down and the queen of female hormones -- estrogen -- goes up. Some men in this condition seek hormone replacement therapy and others find relief in exercise, more frequent sex, and spending more time with other people. Nobody thrives when they're lonely, but it seems to take a major toll on older men. They also change his perceptual circuitry, increasing his ability to hear a baby cry, something many men can't do very well before their wives are pregnant.
