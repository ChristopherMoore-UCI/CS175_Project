"Its going to be doing some very smart things; collecting data from numerous sources, making decisions in real time, to form its trajectory and landing," said Guy Lipscombe from database software firm EXASOL, which sponsored the project. The nickname is short for "Low Orbit Helium Assisted Navigator" and, its inventors say, a reference to the Hollywood star Lindsey Lohan. It took the team four years, thousands of volunteer hours, and $60,000 from crowdfunding, to complete the "Lohan." The rocket-powered airplane will reach an altitude of between 25 and 30 kilometers (15 to 18 miles) -- three times higher than the cruising height of commercial airplanes. The components of the airplane have been designed by postgraduate students at the University of Southampton and produced using a 3D printer.
