Mark Gonzalez headed the only goal of the game shortly after the Swiss had set a new World Cup record for time without conceding a goal, surpassing Italy's mark of 549 minutes midway through the second half. The Chileans made the brighter start and Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio had to be at his best to keep out powerful efforts from Arturo Vidal and Carlos Carmona. Villa's second goal arrived six minutes after half-time when his left-footed shot from outside the area deflected off a Honduran defender and looped over goalkeeper Noel Valladares. Chile had welcomed Humberto Suazo, the top scorer in South American qualifying, back to their starting line-up following a hamstring injury, but he looked short of full fitness, and was replaced at half-time after heading his best chance over the bar. The second half was a Chilean onslaught and the South Americans looked to have taken the lead from a set-piece early in the second half when Alexis Sanchez's deflected shot flew into the net, but the goal was ruled out because two Chilean players were offside.
