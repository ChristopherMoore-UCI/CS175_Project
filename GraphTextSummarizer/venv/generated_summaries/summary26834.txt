Postcard: Athenians fear what follows U.S. election When Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses" came out -- and was promptly banned by Pakistan -- thousands of people vented their anger against the British author of Indian ancestry (whose book was published in England) by demonstrating at the U.S. mission in Islamabad. -- When Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election in 2008, people in Islamabad exchanged congratulatory text messages. There are students and teachers among them, leftists, modern Islamists, artists and writers, business people and professionals, people who want a revolution in Pakistan now and people who are resigned to the fact that it's not happening in their lifetime -- and they are very few in number. In the minds of many Pakistanis, the U.S. has proved to be the same two-faced hypocrite they always thought it was -- defending free speech when it comes to anti-Muslim propaganda like the Mohammed film, yet at the same time condemning anti-Semitism and coming down hard on government whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. Pakistanis are also quite resigned to the fact that the government in Islamabad -- which is led alternately by the right-leaning Muslim League or the "progressive" Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) -- is always more loyal to the United States than its own people, and that every U.S. government -- be it Democrat or Republican -- always supports the military or civilian despots in Islamabad and is therefore always pitted against the common Pakistani.
