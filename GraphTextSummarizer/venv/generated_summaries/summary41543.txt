"We saw a couple of things on our way in," explains U.S. Navy Lt. Josh Mize, the tactical coordinator of Rescue 74, the call sign for Friday's mission to seek out debris from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Four other planes will report similar debris to the Australians from the new search area. The P8 crew, all pilots and crew aboard a plane, feel a kinship with the lives lost in the sky and the families left wondering. The P8 continues on, in the hunt to find debris from the missing plane. On half of those trips, says Lt. Clayton Hunt, the team has spotted something.
