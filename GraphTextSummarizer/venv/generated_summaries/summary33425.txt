ICE has also been required to change national training and policy to conform with existing law to avoid further abuses from home raids. The same scene was happening all over New York: Armed agents surrounding homes, pounding on doors and windows, ordering residents to open the door and storming in, sometimes damaging doors and walls, sometimes pointing guns as they entered. ICE claimed it was looking for people not suspected of a crime, but merely those in violation of civil immigration laws. We are proud of this accomplishment, even though we know that home raid operations have continued in the Obama era, most notably in Tennessee and Alabama, where Latinos report ICE engaging in the very same unconstitutional behavior that traumatized my family. They were arrested because many ICE agents were operating under a quota policy that gave credit for arrests of any undocumented person, not just the target.
