-- Millions of people around the world have taken part in ceremonies marking the 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement. In Namibia, Africa, around 1,000 scouts cooked breakfast over a camp fire, and groups from Malawi camped at the top of Mulanje mountain. The Taj Mahal in India, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Sydney Opera House in Australia also witnessed sunrise ceremonies. In southern England, 40,000 young people from around the globe gathered to take part in the largest ever 12-day world Scout Jamboree. It includes a call for peace, comradeship and cooperation over rivalry between "classes, creeds and countries which have done so much in the past to produce wars and unrest".
