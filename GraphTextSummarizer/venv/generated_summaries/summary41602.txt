The 43 states that sell lottery tickets happily take money from their residents knowing full well the income levels of those who are buying the tickets and the grotesquely miniscule odds of winning. This tag line took into account the reality that the ones buying lottery tickets are not "the rich." You're never going to see Donald Trump, Warren Buffet or even Mitt Romney in line at a deli to buy lottery tickets. And when unemployment goes up, lottery sales generally increase as people hang their hopes on this game of chance. Those who have lower incomes buy a higher percentage of tickets.
