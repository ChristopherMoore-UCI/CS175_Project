First official trailer for Syfy's 'Ghost Shark' There is, of course, a sequel in the works for next year, while the original "Sharknado" is getting the unusual honor of a limited theatrical release. 'Sharknado' producer: Tara Reid isn't fired from sequel What's particularly impressive about the performance is that the film's debut telecast -- despite generating massive buzz on Twitter, clocking a whirlwind 5,000 tweets per minute during its peak -- initially delivered a somewhat disappointing 1.4 million viewers a few weeks ago. That's the most-watched encore for an original movie in Syfy history. Don't think I've ever seen this before: Syfy's social media sensation "Sharknado" just delivered its biggest audience yet.
