The art installation "Discovering Columbus" takes the form of a modern New York living room surrounding the 13-foot marble statue of Christopher Columbus. You actually sense the fact that Columbus Circle is the center of this nexus of New York City," Nicholas Baume said. The artist was asked by the Public Art Fund two years ago to do a project in the city, and he walked all around visiting different sites until he settled on Columbus Circle statue. "The project is really about transforming an object that already exists, a monument that's been here in New York City for 120 years," said Nicholas Baume, director and curator of the Public Art Fund, "and giving people a chance to experience it in a completely new way to have in this case, a much more intimate experience. "It's not my intention to say something about Columbus; rather, I want to change the sculpture from public sculpture into a completely different thing," Nishi said.
