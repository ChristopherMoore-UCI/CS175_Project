CIR: Medi-Cal to overhal rehab program The yearlong investigation by CNN and The Center for Investigative Reporting -- which culminated in reports in July on CNN.com and on CNN's "AC360ยบ" television program -- revealed widespread fraud in the drug rehab program, which is part of the largest Medicaid system in the United States. "The budget proposes 21 positions and $2.2 million ... to continue the state's intensive focus on program integrity and expansion of drug treatment services by recertifying all providers in the state," says the budget summary, which was released Thursday. "Due to concerns about program integrity in the Drug Medi-Cal program, DHCS (the California Department of Health Care Services) took steps in July 2013 to eliminate fraud and abuse in the program. ... DHCS has conducted a review of internal operations to improve oversight and monitoring of drug treatment programs, and has improved coordination with counties to ensure appropriate monitoring and recertification of all drug treatment providers," according to the budget summary. "This amount gives us the support necessary to continue our efforts ... in a way that we will ultimately be able to improve the integrity of the program." Of the $2.2 million, half will come from the state's general fund, and the rest will be matched with federal funds.
