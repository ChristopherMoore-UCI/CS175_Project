The manager was arrested last week and accused of selling liquor without a license, and The Spot was licensed as a restaurant and not as a nightclub, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. -- A 17-year-old male has been arrested in connection with a shooting last week at a nightclub where 15 people were wounded, Miami police said. Orosa said the investigation is ongoing because two types of bullet casings were found at the scene and investigators are still trying to locate the getaway car and driver. Miami Police Chief Manuel Orosa said the suspect "decided to take retribution against the individual who apparently fought with his friend" at a high school. "We understand there was a gathering taking place at some sort of little nightclub," he said.
