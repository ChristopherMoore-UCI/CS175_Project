Patrick Jackson has developed an app for Google Glass, Google's experimental head-mounted computer, which feeds important information directly to the eye-line of firefighters in an emergency. To get his hands on Google Glass, Jackson submitted his idea to Google's IfIHadGlass competition. Google Glass has struggled with its public image since Google first made it available to a limited group of developers in April. That's not what Jackson saw when a group of skydivers demonstrated Google Glass at the annual Google developers conference in 2012. The device hit a legal speed bump when a woman in California was cited for wearing Google Glass while driving.
