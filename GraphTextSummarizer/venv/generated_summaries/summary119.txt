Mulfinger is one of many recent graduates who are turning to lower paying jobs with the help of national service organizations such as Teach for America as the conventional job market shrinks. President Obama's call to service has buoyed nonprofits and service organizations, whose operating budgets have also suffered the effects of the shrinking economy. "With the enactment of the landmark Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act legislation, millions of Americans of all ages will be able to serve to address their local community's most pressing needs," said Michelle Nunn, CEO of the Points of Light Institute and co-founder of the HandsOn Network, an organization that connects people with volunteer and paid opportunities in community service nationwide. "National service is a cost-effective, empowering way for citizens to build an America they can be proud of," said former AmeriCorps volunteer Matt Wilhelm, who parlayed his stint as a volunteer into a full-time job with Calling All Crows, a nonprofit that uses the live musicians to promote human rights. They also argue that the concept of volunteerism is undermined by providing financial compensation for community service.
