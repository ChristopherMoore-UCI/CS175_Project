The controversy over Limbaugh's statement comes after the liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org accused the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, in full page ad in the New York Times last month of "cooking the books for the White House" in his testimony to Congress last week. Limbaugh's comments in question came Wednesday when Limbaugh and a caller were discussing critics of the Iraq war: "What's really funny is, they [Iraq war critics] never talk to real soldiers," the caller said. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said his comments were taken out of context. Responding to his critics on Friday's show, Limbaugh said he was "taken out of context," adding his remark was referring to one soldier specifically -- Jesse MacBeth, a vocal war critic who falsely claimed to have served in Iraq. The top Democrat in the Senate slammed Rush Limbaugh Monday over his recent controversial "phony soldiers" remark, despite the conservative talk-radio host's protests that his words have been taken out of context.
