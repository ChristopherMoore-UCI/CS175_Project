A day after her ruling Saenuri (or New Frontier) party won a majority in general elections, Park, its leader and likely presidential candidate, pledged that people's lives will get better. In the run-up to polling, a series of corruption scandals battered public confidence in traditional political parties. Acknowledging defeat, the DUP's Secretary-General Park Sun-sook apologized for disappointing the party's supporters after pre-vote predictions of a landslide victory. "[We] will start anew with the mindset that we will be remembered as sinners if we revert to the old ways of the past." Of the 299 seats up for grabs in the National Assembly, Saenuri won 152 seats, while the opposition Democratic United Party (DUP) took 127. -- Park Geun-hye is living up to her nickname, the "Queen of Elections."
