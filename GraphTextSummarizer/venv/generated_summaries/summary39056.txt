" Al-Ajmi is the third Kuwaiti to be sentenced this year for insulting Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on Twitter. "We call on the judiciary and the government to create a special law for electronic crimes like in other countries," Al-Humaidi said. On Sunday, a Kuwaiti court sentenced another man, Mohammed Al-Ajmi, to five years of imprisonment for insulting the emir -- the maximum sentence permissible by law. "We call on the Kuwaiti government to abide by international agreements it has signed respecting human rights," Al-Humaidi said. In January, Rashed Al-Enezi and Ayad Al-Hirbi were each sentenced to two years.
