Anthony McIntosh, 48, a former corporal at the Prince George's County Detention Center outside of Washington, is charged with deprivation of civil rights and falsifying records in the June 29, 2008, death of Ronnie White. Prosecutors allege McIntosh failed to call for medical attention when he found White unresponsive in his cell. But it says that McIntosh discovered White in his cell unresponsive, but "walked away without providing medical care" or notifying anyone. McIntosh thereby acted "with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to (White), and resulting in bodily injury to, and the death of (White)," the indictment reads. Community leaders at the time decried White's death as "vigilante justice," and many voiced suspicions that jailers had killed him.
