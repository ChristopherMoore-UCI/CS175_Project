The tennis tour has seen a handful of retired grand slam winners return as coaches and Berdych attempted to lure eight-time grand slam champion Ivan Lendl -- Murray's former coach -- last year. "When you are coming back from injuries you lose more easier the feeling than you do when you are on rhythm, when you are with no injuries, when you are confident in yourself that you played a lot of matches," Nadal said. Contributing to his fluctuating performances in Melbourne were a lack of match practice, added Nadal. Kyrgios -- the first teenager on the men's tour to make multiple grand slam quarterfinals since Roger Federer -- led 4-3 with a mini-break but paid the price for two short approach shots, both punished by perfect Murray lobs. While Berdych barely missed on Rod Laver Arena, Nadal called his own display "very bad" and said he helped Berdych by lacking in his trademark intensity.
