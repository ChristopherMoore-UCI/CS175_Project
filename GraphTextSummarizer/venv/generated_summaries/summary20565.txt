-- The much-maligned symbol of motoring in Communist East Germany, the Trabant, is set to make an unlikely comeback as a concept car at this year's International Motor Show in Frankfurt. It makes model cars and airplanes, of the type that sit in display cabinets, not garages. This is the new Trabant, or Trabi as they're known, an energy-efficient city car for modern drivers. "I think the market will be people who say the old Trabant was a cool car, and people who want to have a stylish car, and want to have a green car," Daniel Stiegler, of Herpa Miniaturemodelle, told CNN. Two years ago, a member of its management team, Klaus Schindler, decided it was time to make a miniature model of the Trabant.
