The problem is in Washington, D.C." The U.S. government is scheduled to send another group of undocumented immigrants to Murrieta for processing on Friday, a union official for Border Patrol agents said. The Latin American immigrants rejected by Murrieta protesters were initially held in Texas, where U.S. facilities are so overflowing that detainees are sent to other states for processing. Many never show up and join the nation's 11 million undocumented residents, says the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents. " Other protesters told CNN affiliate KGTV they wanted immigrants to follow the legal process to enter the United States. Counterprotesters squared off with the demonstrators, and a shouting match erupted over the nation's immigration system, which recently has been overwhelmed with a tide of Central American minors illegally entering the United States alone or with other children.
