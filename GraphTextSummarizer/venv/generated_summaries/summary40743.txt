Casey --" In a move the defense hoped would highlight the Anthony family's dysfunction, the defense called Cindy Anthony, who during direct examination agreed she testified six months ago that she thought Caylee was still alive. George Anthony admitted he pulled Orange County detective Yuri Melich aside on July 15, 2008, the first night law enforcement visited the Anthony home. The defense team has argued that Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked on discovering the body and covered up her death, though George Anthony has denied that scenario. During testimony from George, Cindy and Lee Anthony, the defense suggested Caylee was disposed of in the same way the family buried their pets, wrapped in a blanket and placed in garbage bags secured with duct tape. On Tuesday, he denied an affair with Krystal Holloway, a one-time volunteer in the search to find Caylee and the woman who claims George Anthony told her Caylee's death was an accident.
