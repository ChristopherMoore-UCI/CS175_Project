"We remain deeply concerned about North Korea's human rights abuses, uranium enrichment activities, nuclear testing and proliferation, ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose to South Korea and its neighbors. During negotiations, the United States ultimately softened demands that North Korea admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and supplying Syria with nuclear technology, sticking points that had stalled the talks for months. And it is a step that would take North Korea more than a year to reverse, according to U.S. State Department officials. North Korea acknowledges producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs, the official said. According to a senior U.S. State Department official, the 60-page declaration, written in English, details several rounds of plutonium production at Yongbyon, North Korea dating back to 1986.
