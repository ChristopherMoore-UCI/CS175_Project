Chinese authorities reported that Gu and her son had "conflicts" with Heywood "over economic interests." Gu Kailai avoids death penalty Prosecutors at his trial allege Wang knew Gu was involved in the murder of Heywood last November but covered up for her. Bo Xilai, who was head of the Communist Party in the southwestern city of Chongqing and once seen as a future president, was reportedly warned by his former right-hand man that his wife was suspected of murder. Speaking to reporters on March 9 on the sidelines of a panel discussion of Chongqing delegates, Bo defended his policies. But until the trial of Wang, there had been no suggestion Bo had been aware of his wife's actions before her arrest and conviction for murder. In the first official account of the two-day hearing, the court was told that Wang was "angrily rebuked" and slapped on the face by Bo -- who the report referred to as the major official in charge of Chongqing's municipal party committee -- when he revealed his suspicions, Xinhua said.
