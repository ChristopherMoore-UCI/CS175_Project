Alonso, who had two years left on his contract with British-based McLaren, courted controversy for his strained relationship with Hamilton and team boss Ron Dennis and his departure appeared almost inevitable. The 2007 season had started promisingly for McLaren, but rookie Hamilton's early successes appeared to unsettle Alonso as the title race boiled down to a four-way race between the McLaren drivers and Ferrari's Raikkonen and Felipe Massa. Alonso clashed with teammate Hamilton and team boss Dennis in a difficult 2007. A fragile peace was established for the championship decider at the Brazil GP, but it proved a disastrous finale for McLaren as neither Hamilton or Alonso could secure the points they needed to win the title and Raikkonen prevailed. Alonso, who finished third in the 2007 standings behind teammate Lewis Hamilton and new champion Kimi Raikkonen, is now free to join another team A source with knowledge of the Alonso-McLaren talks told CNN that it is not yet known where Alonso will go next.
