Hughes was appointed chief justice by President Herbert Hoover in 1930 after a distinguished career as a lawyer, investigator of special interests, reform governor of New York, Supreme Court justice and secretary of State. The Roberts court's most conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, all appointed by Republican presidents, have voted together on polarizing issues (such as campaign financing in Citizens United) in favor of corporate interests. The balance of power on the Roberts court in closely divided constitutional cases has not resided with the chief justice, as it did with the Hughes court's centrists, the chief justice and Justice Owen Roberts. At his 2010 State of the Union address, with the justices sitting directly in front of him, he accused the court majority in the Citizens United decision of reversing a century of constitutional law to open "the floodgates for special interests... to spend without limit in our elections." As a lawyer, he defended large corporate interests but also five Socialists who had been expelled from the New York legislature because of their political convictions.
