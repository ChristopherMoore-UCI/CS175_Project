An old growth forest is," Virginia Tech Forestry Professor John Seiler explained, "It's literally the rarest type of forest structure left in the United States." Signs urging "Save Stadium Woods" were placed in yards throughout Blacksburg and a group called Friends of Stadium Woods created an online petition which has now been signed by more than 10,500 people across the country. However, the University Athletics Department still preferred the plan to cut down about three acres of the woods to make room for the facility, forcing University President Charles W. Steger to appoint the committee to hear arguments and eventually make their recommendation on whether the facility should be built as planned or at an alternate location. "We'll see what the report has to say and at the end of the day we'll do the right thing," Steger told CNN in an interview in May. Committee chair John Randolph told the Board of Visitors Monday it was "in the university's best interest" to build the facility in a different location. "Alternative sites for the courts and rink have been identified," Randolph said.
