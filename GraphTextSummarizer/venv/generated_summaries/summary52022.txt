Thiago, part of Barcelona's double-winning squad last season, sealed Spain's victory with a moment of genius as he caught goalkeeper Yann Sommer off his line with a 40-meter free-kick. Meanwhile, Belarus qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time after beating the Czech Republic 1-0 in Saturday's third-place playoff match in Aalborg. Belarus had lost 3-1 to Spain in the semifinals, while Switzerland won 1-0 against the Czechs in a match that also went to extra-time. With Spain having also won the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and top club side Barcelona claiming the 2011 UEFA Champions League, it gives the Iberian nation a full collection of major crowns. Midfielder Herrera headed the opening goal four minutes before halftime in Aarhus as he stole in at the near post to connect with a cross by left-back Didac Vila.
