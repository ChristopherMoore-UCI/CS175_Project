-- Actor Tom Cruise has settled a $50 million defamation suit he filed last year against a tabloid publisher after it ran stories accusing him of having "abandoned" his daughter Suri during his divorce from her mother, actress Katie Holmes. Neither Bauer Publishing nor the magazines "intended to communicate that Tom Cruise had cut off all ties and abandoned his daughter, Suri, and regret if anyone drew that inference from anything they published," she added. HAS HE CHOSEN SCIENTOLOGY OVER SURI FOR GOOD?"

CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report Suri is left heartbroken as Tom suddenly shuts her out and even misses her first day of school... The lawsuit against Bauer Publishing, In Touch and Life & Style magazines "has been settled," said Lindsay Ferraro, public relations director for both magazines, in an e-mail.
