The architects describe the end result as "a surprisingly natural, 'bark-like' texture." Tony Kirkham, head of RBG Kew's arboretum and project manager for the Xstrata Treetop Walkway, said, "As a trained arborist, I have had the privilege of being up in the tree canopy; experiencing trees at height and birds and other wildlife from a completely different perspective. -- London's Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew recently opened an attraction that gives visitors the chance to walk among the treetops and examine tree canopies from a new perspective. The walkway at Kew is designed to give visitors a new perspective on trees. In what has been designated "Year of the Tree" at Kew, Kirkham hopes that giving visitors a new perspective on the trees will help them understand the importance of nurturing them. Rising to a height of 18 meters and stretching across 200 meters, visitors can walk between 50 of Kew's mature broad-leafed trees.
