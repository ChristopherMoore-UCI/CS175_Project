Green transport The uneasy companion of large quantities of wind power is great variation in power production due to the intermittency of wind. Wind power works Today, DONG Energy has built half of the world's offshore wind mills and wind energy will be an important contribution to achieving the 85/15 vision. Biomass in power plants To further bring down emissions high efficiency must be supplemented by renewable fuels such as biomass. Electric cars can help absorb the surplus power production when energy production is high because of strong winds and when energy consumption is low at night. The strategy is to create growth and reduce CO2 emissions at the same time, and key elements will be increased efficiency and more biomass and wind energy.
