In TSA's recent blog post: TSA Blog Year in Review: 2013, TSA blogger Bob Burns reviewed some of the dangerous or unusual items officers confiscated in 2013 as well as some of the creative ways passengers tried to hide them. "Our officers regularly find sword canes, credit card knives, belt buckle knives, comb/brush knives, knives hidden in shoes, knives hidden in thermoses and knives hidden under the bag lining near the handle mechanism," wrote Burns. Deterrent vs detergent "In what was believed to be an attempt to avoid declaring his firearms, a passenger at Houston (IAH) wrapped two guns in newspaper and placed them in a box of detergent powder in his checked baggage," wrote TSA blogger Bob Burns. The key message the blog wants to impart is: passengers can't fool TSA officers. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport followed, with 96 guns discovered, while George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston (68 guns), Pheonix Sky Harbor International Airport (66 guns) and Denver International Airport (51 guns) rounded out the top five.
