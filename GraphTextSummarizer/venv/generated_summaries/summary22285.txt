-- Life is never dull at Neuchatel Xamax, at least not since Bulat Chagaev took over the reins of the Swiss football club in May. Chagaev has, remarkably, fired four coaches, removed every local sponsor involved with the club from the previous season and dismissed his entire administrative staff, resulting in Xamax being unable to print any tickets for the opening match of the 2011-12 Swiss Super League campaign. "In Switzerland, you need to provide correct financial documentation to play in the Super League -- and this mess has happened because previous owner Bernasconi had the right documents, which then became Chagaev's when he bought the club. In Switzerland, Chagaev owns two Geneva-based firms, which reportedly oversee his oil and gas trading, real estate and construction empire, but it is his activities with Xamax which are causing greater concern, with some figures now fearing for the very existence of the club. A respected Swiss newspaper reported that Chagaev is illegally living in the country, because he does not have a valid residence permit.
