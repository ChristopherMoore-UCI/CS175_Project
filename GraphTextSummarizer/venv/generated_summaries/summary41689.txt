"They have become so shameless regarding the subject of human rights that they have turned the case of Sakineh Ashtiani, who has committed murder and betrayal, into a human rights issue and are using it against our nation," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told the ISNA news agency. -- A woman sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery has not been executed, Iran's official news agency reported Wednesday, rejecting "Western media" reports that Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani had been executed. Authorities in Iran were reported to have given the go-ahead this week to execute Ashtiani as soon as Wednesday, although the method of killing her was not clear. Human rights groups and various governments have also urged Iran not to execute Ashtiani. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Wednesday that he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart to urge Iran not to execute her.
