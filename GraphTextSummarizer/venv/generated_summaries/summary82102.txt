The Times commissioned Portuguese photographer Edgar Martins to shoot a Sunday magazine color photo essay titled "Ruins of the Second Gilded Age" to capture physical evidence of the real estate bust that took place across the United States. "I think he's a great artist and we're very proud to have published his prior works," said Lesley Martin, publisher of Aperture books. The newspaper published an editor's note Thursday stating that pictures used in a photo essay in its most recent Sunday Magazine were digitally manipulated without the paper's knowledge. She said that Martins' prior works frequently verge on abstract landscapes, including forests ravaged by fire and nighttime beaches. Aperture books, which publishes a variety of photographic styles, including photojournalism, "would not have published this work in a strict journalistic context had we known there would be manipulation used," she said.
