Included in the court documents are a January 8 letter to Maher, accepting the $5 million charity challenge the day after his appearance on Leno, and a copy of Trump's birth certificate, which lists Fred Trump as his father -- not an orangutan.

" "I'm not saying it's true," Maher told Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show" last month. The billionaire real estate mogul is suing millionaire comedian Bill Maher for $5 million.
