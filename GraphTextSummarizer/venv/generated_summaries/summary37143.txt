Johnson, Foley, Robertson and Neely were all witnesses at Monday's hearing, along with GSA Inspector General Brian Miller, who wrote the report on GSA spending that set off the public controversy. However, Robertson later issued a statement to clarify his testimony to the committee, saying: "I only mentioned in passing the existence of an IG (inspector general) investigation as I bumped into a White House staffer that I regularly worked with on GSA issues. Asked when he first told anyone at the White House about the investigation, Robertson eventually said it was within a few weeks after GSA officials were first notified by the inspector general of a problem in May 2011. In later tough questioning of that official, GSA Chief of Staff Mike Robertson, Issa determined that a lawyer in the White House counsel's office knew of the ongoing investigation of the GSA in the middle of 2011, nine months before the earliest time acknowledged to date by the administration. " In her opening statement, former GSA administrator Martha Johnson said she found a badly managed GSA when she took over in 2010 after more than two years of interim leadership.
