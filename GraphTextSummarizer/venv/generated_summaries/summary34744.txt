She waited several decades to tell her story because, at that point, her daughter was an adult and she felt that both were old enough to defend themselves, U.S. Marshals spokesman Chris DeRosa said Thursday. Deputy U.S. Marshals and law enforcement officers in Kentucky arrested James David Gibson on Wednesday, about two years after his alleged 13-year-old victim came forward to authorities. The alleged assaults occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Benson, Arizona, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. By then, she was back in Arizona, more than 1,500 miles from Gibson. By Thursday, authorities were awaiting clearance to extradite Gibson back to Arizona.
