"North Korea does have illicit activities in China," says Steve Sin, a terrorism expert at the University of Maryland and former U.S. military intelligence analyst. There is an art gallery featuring pieces that glorify North Korea, a gift shop with Pyongyang souvenirs, and even a travel office for North Korea's state-owned national airline "Air Koryo." Kim claims North Korean hackers operated secretly in Shenyang for years, moving from location to location to conceal their whereabouts and activities. As the biggest Chinese city near North Korea, Shenyang is a place where many from Pyongyang come to work. It also has great Internet infrastructure," says Kim Heung-kwang, a former Pyongyang computer science professor who escaped North Korea in 2004.
