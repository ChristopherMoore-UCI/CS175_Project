Rosemarie Smith snatched the crispy piece of bread during a visit to Buckingham Palace. Up for auction in the United Kingdom this week is a piece of toast from Prince Charles' breakfast tray on the morning he married Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981. "At the time my daughter was a maid at the Palace and one of her duties was to collect Prince Charles's breakfast tray from outside his room," Smith said in a report on the auctioneers' website. "I suspect Prince Charles was a little nervous on the morning of the big day and this little piece of toast survived!" Of course, this isn't the first bit of food auctioned off for its unique qualities. I had been thinking about a keepsake from the wedding and saw the toast and thought to myself: 'Why not'?" William and Kate's wedding and the Queen's Jubilee got Smith thinking that her bit of royal bread could be worth something.
