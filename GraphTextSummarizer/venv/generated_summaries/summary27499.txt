Analysts say the strong showing of Islamist parties in the first parliamentary elections since the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak, a long-time U.S. ally, could inflame regional tensions and complicate key relationships. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reflected that tension this week when she urged Islamist parties in Egypt to "embrace democratic norms and rules" by creating a government that respects the full range of human rights.

But even if the United States and other countries do continue to support democratic movements in the Middle East, public opinion in the region has barely shifted, Heydemann said.
