Human remains found buried under recently added concrete at a home in Plant City, Florida, are likely those of missing lottery millionaire Abraham Shakespeare, police said Thursday. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said when their investigation began, they had hoped to find Shakespeare alive "and he truly had just wanted to hide from those who were asking him for money." "As our investigation continued, the information we developed led us to believe he may very well have ended up with an untimely death," Judd said. A year later, he won a court challenge from a fellow trucker who accused Shakespeare of snatching the winning ticket out of his wallet while the two were delivering meat to Miami restaurants. Shakespeare's family reported him missing on November 9, telling the Polk County sheriff's office they hadn't seen him since April. The home, according to WFTV,  belongs to the boyfriend of a person of interest in the disappearance of Shakespeare.
