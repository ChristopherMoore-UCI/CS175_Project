The confusion started with a tweet from the World Music Awards, an international contest that has been broadcast from such locales as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Monaco. In a tweet, the show said, "#adele confirms 2015 Tour After The Release Of Her New Album '25'!" Not so fast, said Martin Mills, who heads Beggars Group. Since "21's" success, Adele has won an Oscar for best original song (for "Skyfall," from the James Bond movie of the same name) and given birth to a son with her partner, Simon Konecki. Adele's label, XL Recordings, is a subsidiary of Beggars Group. Oh, and "21" won the Grammy for album of the year.
