-- A Harvard University student was named Tuesday in a criminal complaint alleging he was responsible for bomb threats that led school officials to delay some final exams, including his, that had been scheduled for Monday. The buildings were evacuated and swept by bomb technicians and hazmat officers, and access to Harvard Yard was restricted to students with Harvard IDs, according to the Harvard Gazette, the school's official news website. Eldo Kim, 20, of Cambridge, allegedly e-mailed bomb threats at about 8:30 a.m. Monday to offices associated with Harvard, including the Harvard University Police Department and the Harvard Crimson, the student-run daily newspaper, according to the five-page complaint. "Harvard University was able to determine that, in the several hours leading up to the receipt of the e-mail messages described above, Eldo Kim accessed TOR using Harvard's wireless network," it said. The subject line in each of the messages read "bombs placed around campus" and cited "shrapnel bombs" in four buildings on the school's main campus in Cambridge.
