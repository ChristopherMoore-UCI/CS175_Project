But in the quarter century since the first World AIDS Day, much has changedâ€”so much so, in fact, that leaders have begun to call for "the beginning of the end of AIDS," a global tipping point when the number of people newly infected with HIV is surpassed by the number of people newly offered treatment. Twenty-five years on, it is difficult to imagine a world without World AIDS Day (or without AIDS, for that matter). But the year also brought a cultural touchstone with much deeper significance: the first World AIDS Day. Each World AIDS Day forces the world into a moment of reflection and accountability. With a few exceptions, donor funding for AIDS has stalled.
