When all is said and done, everyone -- even the lawyers who authored the infamous Department of Justice memos on interrogation techniques during the Bush administration -- agrees: Torture is prohibited, and committing it is a crime, under both the law of the United States and international law. Aharon Barak, former president of the Supreme Court of Israel (a country no stranger to the fight against terrorism), wrote in a court opinion that ruled certain interrogation methods to be prohibited under Israeli law, that despite being limited in its fight, democracy has the upper hand because "the rule of law and the liberty of an individual constitute important components in its understanding of security. Interrogation techniques such as waterboarding were officially imported into the CIA's arsenal without clear indication that such techniques actually worked and despite the fact that in the past those very techniques had been used in places such as Korea against American troops. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that by "worked" they mean that through the use of such techniques the CIA got information that led to the foiling of future terrorist attacks. Consequently, no legal opinion could give advance authorization to use such techniques.
