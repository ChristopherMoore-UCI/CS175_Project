The 42-year-old now has the task of guiding Spurs into the lucrative European Champions League, knowing failure could cost him his job. But expectations are much higher at Spurs, with a succession of managers being fired for not securing the top four berth that offers entry to Europe's money spinning Champions League. The London club have appointed the Argentinean after raiding fellow English Premier League outfit Southampton for his services. Pochettino guided Saints to their highest ever EPL finish last season and was credited with bringing through a talented clutch of youngsters at the club. This season he took them to their highest ever league placing -- eighth -- and helped develop a core of home grown talent including Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw, who are both expected to go to the World Cup with England.
