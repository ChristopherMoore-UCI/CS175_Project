Georgia has contended that Russia merely wants control of an oil pipeline, and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Monday that Russia seeks to stamp out his country's "democratic ambitions. Russian and Georgian officials said Russia had entered Senaki, in western Georgia, outside of breakaway Abkhazia. Watch Bush demand a cease-fire Â» World powers have urged Russia to agree to an immediate cease-fire with Georgia and accept international mediation on the crisis in South Ossetia. At the United Nations in New York on Monday, Russia refused to sign off on a resolution calling for a cease-fire with Georgia despite mounting pressure from world powers. "If these reports are accurate ... these actions would be inconsistent with the assurances we received from Russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in [Georgian breakaway region] South Ossetia that existed before the fighting began on August 6," Bush said.
