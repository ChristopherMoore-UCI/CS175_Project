Polesitter Hamilton controlled the race on the Albert Park street circuit to win from teammate Nico Rosberg of Germany. Home hopes rested with Daniel Ricciardo, third in last year's title race, but he looked off the pace in the Red Bull in sixth place. Hamilton, who was forced to retire early in last year's Australian Grand Prix, was taking the checkered flag in Melbourne for the first time since 2008, when he claimed his first world title for McLaren. After getting the thoughts of Rosberg and Vettel, who said it was a "very big honor" to gain his first points for Ferrari, Schwarzenegger turned his attention back to Hamilton. His regular teammate Fernando Alonso sat out the race after his nasty crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona, while stand-in Kevin Magnussen retired after the warm-up lap.
