Osama bin Laden, in an undated photo, apparently taped a message calling Israel's Gaza offensive a holocaust. -- Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden called Israel's recent offensive in Gaza a "holocaust," according to a purported message from him posted on an Islamist Web site. In his last purported audio message in January, bin Laden called for a jihad, or holy war, to stop Israel's military campaign in Gaza. When talking about Palestine, the speaker is referring to the region between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River that includes the Jewish state of Israel and the Palestinian lands of the West Bank and Gaza. The message -- an audiotape played over a still image -- is called "Practical Steps to Liberate Palestine" and it is dated March 2009, according to terrorism analyst Laura Mansfield.
