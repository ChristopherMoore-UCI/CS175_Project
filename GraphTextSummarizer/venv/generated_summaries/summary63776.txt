Investigators are looking into whether a gas line was "inappropriately accessed" at the building where the explosion occurred, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Friday. " Nicholas Figueroa's body was one of those recovered from the rubble Sunday, family spokeswoman Awilda Cordero told CNN affiliates NY1 and WABC. The victims' remains have not yet been officially identified, but authorities believe they are the two people who were reported missing after Thursday's blast, New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters. That was a "major mistake," New York Emergency Management Commissioner Joe Esposito said Sunday. CNN's Julia Talanova reported from New York.
