With the rise of Latino voters in the United States, obstructing immigration reform could cost the GOP votes on Tuesday and any chance of winning back the White House in 2012 and beyond. A recent LatinoMetrics poll shows that immigration is now of at least equal concern to Latino voters as the economy, and concern over discrimination and racism has surged. Although Latinos remain displeased that Democrats have not passed immigration legislation, the same polls revealed increased Latino awareness of Republicans' obstructionism and Democrats' efforts. If the House returns to Republican control, it's hard to imagine Rep. John Boehner -- who would become House Majority leader -- helping the GOP retreat from the precipice on immigration. Even Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox News continues to spew bile on immigration issues, has come out publicly for immigration reform.
