She says she's determined to keep on working to expand the service across Lagos and beyond and ultimately help to change people's attitudes toward waste. It was during that time, while working on a study project focused on the problems faced by people in low-income areas, when she came up with the idea to launch a company offering waste collection and recycling services in her hometown. "That we can create a low-cost way of solving the Nigerian problems, the Lagos problems, here, with Lagos solutions," she adds.
