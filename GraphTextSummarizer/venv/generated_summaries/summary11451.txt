" ISIS kills 300 members of Sunni tribe State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S.-Iran nuclear talks aren't linked to U.S. cooperation with Iran in combating ISIS. Amid revelations that Obama sent a letter to Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last month pointing out the countries' shared interest in beating ISIS, a senior U.S. official and a Western diplomat tell CNN that Washington has gone through the Iraqis to communicate with Iran. "Our ambassador reflected the issue to Iran and although some officials didn't voice opposition, I opposed it and said we will not cooperate with the Americans in this regard since they have a corrupt intention and stained hands and how could we have cooperation with the Americans under such conditions?" Referring to Kerry's comments that Iran would not be invited to join the anti-ISIS coalition, Khamenei said, according to FARS, "The same U.S. secretary of state had personally demanded (Iranian Foreign Minister) Dr. (Mohammad Javad) Zarif, and called for cooperation with us on Daesh but Dr. Zarif had rejected his demand." One senior GOP congressional staffer told CNN's Stephen Collinson that the letter was sending "shock waves" through Capitol Hill and suggested it would also anger Israel and U.S. allies in the Middle East who think the President is already going behind their backs to negotiate a "bad deal" with Iran. "During the hard days of Daesh's attacks on Iraq, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq demanded our envoy in the country (Iraq) that Iran and the U.S. meet for negotiations and coordination on Daesh," Khamenei said, using a derogatory nickname for ISIS.
