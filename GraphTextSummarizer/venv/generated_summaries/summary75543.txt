In antebellum America, and during the Civil War, black and white abolitionists saw Haiti as an example of the potential and possibilities of black political leadership. In many respects, Haiti's liberation from French rule proved to be a high point, sadly followed by a seemingly endless cycle of economic poverty, foreign intervention -- including American occupation from 1915 to 1934 -- government corruption, and dictatorships. As the Haitian people prepare to rebuild their republic, we would do well to remember that the tragedy of Haiti is not a failure of black power but ultimately the frustration of it, one that involves mistakes by not only Haitians  but by Western powers as well, including the United States. During the period of antebellum slavery and after, Haiti profoundly impacted the imagination of African-American political activism. Yet there is another, equally important aspect of Haitian history, one that black Americans identify with deeply.
