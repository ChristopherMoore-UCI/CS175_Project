The identical quadruplets were born via cesarean section in the Winfred L. Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. The odds of spontaneous quadruplets -- conceived without fertility assistance -- are 1 in 729,000, according to Dr. James Bofill, Kimberly Fugate's physician and a professor of maternal fetal medicine at the University of Mississippi. "Typically, when babies are born prematurely, doctors tell the families to expect them to stay in the (neonatal intensive care unit) until their original due date, which in this case would be May 2," said hospital spokeswoman Jennifer Hospodor. You may know the Mathias quads -- Grace, Emily, Mary Claire and Anna -- who are in the eighth grade and appeared on the Discovery Health Channel's "Super Quads." And perhaps you remember a Lifetime reality show called "Four of a Kind," which featured identical quadruplets Megan, Kendra, Sarah and Calli Durst, of Buffalo, Minnesota.
