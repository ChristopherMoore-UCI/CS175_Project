Officials have also asked companies to find ways to keep some employees out of central London and off the busy transport networks during July and August. In recent years, Heathrow has suffered from baggage snafus, snow disruptions and strikes. To help get people out of London after the games, Heathrow will allow athletes to check their luggage at the Olympic Village east of the city. Heathrow expects a 35% increase in baggage on August 13. "The airport ... already operates close to capacity," said Nick Cole, the head of Heathrow's Olympics planning team.
