YouTube has set aside a whole row for Yankovic videos on its "Popular on YouTube" page, including "Word Crimes" -- a parody of "Blurred Lines" that's received more than 10 million views -- and "Foil," a parody of "Royals" that's topped 12 million views. It's the first No. 1 comedy album on Billboard's charts since Allan Sherman's "My Son, the Nut" in 1963 -- the album that contained Sherman's biggest hit, "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh. The long-haired comic musician's new album, "Mandatory Fun," debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart of best-selling albums with 104,000 in sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Yankovic has been taking something of a victory lap to promote "Mandatory Fun" and celebrate his career in the music business, which includes three Grammys, four gold records and more than 12 million in sales. "It does allow me to try things I wouldn't have tried before," he told CNN's Jake Tapper.
