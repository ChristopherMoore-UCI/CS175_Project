" These days, the only aviators you are likely to find at Roland Garros stadium are pairs of sunglasses perched on patron's noses court side at Philippe Chatrier (who actually was a former FFT president). " The "Moi... Roland Garros" exhibition can be seen at the FFT museum at Roland Garros stadium. Piloting his Morane-Saulnier, Garros' first victory came at the beginning of April 1915 and two more quickly followed. Garros' elevated status wasn't earned down in the trenches, but up in the skies above the Western Front, as the exhibition at the FFT museum entitled "Moi... Roland Garros" explains. "For a lot of people in France and abroad, Garros is a tennis man, or a sometime president of the French Tennis Federation (FFT)," says Michael Guittard, head of collections and cultural mediation at the FFT.
