Thousands who never met the girl are mourning her on Facebook after friends of the Parker family established the Emilie Parker Fund page. Emilie died Friday at the hands of a gunman who opened fire at her elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. "I can't imagine how hard this experience must be for you, and I want you to know that our family and our love and our support goes out to you as well," Parker said, as he remembered his oldest girl, Emilie Alice. But Parker, 30, stepped forward to talk about Emilie. On Saturday, Parker vacillated between present and past tense as he talked about his daughter, struggling to come to terms with Emilie's killing.
