It went to Kenyan Caleb Ndiku, the world indoor 3000m champion, in a time of 13 minutes 12.07 seconds to beat teammate Isiah Koech , with New Zealander Zane Robertson claiming bronze. Erraid Davies, a diminutive 13-year-old competitor in the women's para-sport 100m breaststroke, took a superb bronze behind Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand. " Way finished a minute faster than his performance in London, where he was third British finisher behind Mo Farah and Chris Thompson and 15th overall. Undaunted by the presence of defending champion John Ekiru Kelai of Kenya and a host of other athletes with faster personal bests, Way took the opportunity afforded by a tentative start by the race favorites to lead the bunch. He crossed the line after 42 kilometers in a personal best of two hours 15 minutes 16 seconds and still with a smile on his face despite toiling on a tough course around Glasgow in rainy conditions.
