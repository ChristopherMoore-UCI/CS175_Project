The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal build-up of tau -- a protein that, when it spills out of cells, can choke off, or disable, neural pathways controlling things like memory, judgment and fear. Dr. Piotr Kozlowski, who prepared the report, found tangles of tau proteins in seven sections of the hippocampus structure in the brain, findings consistent with other players diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The suit alleges the NFL didn't do enough to warn players about the risks of brain damage. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The doctor said the results appear consistent with CTE, which is concerning because tau is not normally found in such a young brain.
