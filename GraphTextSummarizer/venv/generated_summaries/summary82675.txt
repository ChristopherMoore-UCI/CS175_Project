-- A police officer arrested Friday in Will County, Illinois, has been charged with one count of first-degree murder in connection with a two-state rural shooting rampage that left one man dead, authorities said. The gunman was believed to be using a revolver -- possibly a Colt .38 caliber or .357 Magnum -- because no shell casings were found at either scene, Lake County Sheriff Rogelio "Roy" Dominguez said earlier. Brian E. Dorian, 37, an officer with the Lynwood Police Department, will probably face other charges, said Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow. He is being held on a probable cause warrant, and bail was set at $2.5 million, said Charles Pelkie, a spokesman for the Will County state's attorney's office. Dorian's first court hearing is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.
