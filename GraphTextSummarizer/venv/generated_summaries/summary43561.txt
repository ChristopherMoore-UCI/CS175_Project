The 20-year-old singer, who was a two-time performer during Sunday's ceremony in Amsterdam, Netherlands, lit what appeared to be a joint on stage during her acceptance speech for best video with "Wrecking Ball." Throughout the event, held at Amsterdam's Ziggo Dome, awards were handed out in obligatory categories such as best pop, rock and alternative, as well as EMAs-specific honors such as top worldwide act and world stage. Thicke followed Cyrus with a rendition of "Blurred Lines" that had a cameo from Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, and the night's best female award winner Katy Perry soon followed with a performance of "Unconditionally" that found her suspended in the air. In between awards and performances, Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy made some comedic appearances, showing just how much can go wrong when his overly confident newscaster character is unleashed in the Netherlands. " Regardless, Cyrus' smoking was a slightly more risque act during a relatively tame event, which featured performances from Snoop Dogg, Icona Pop, The Killers, Kings of Leon and Bruno Mars.
