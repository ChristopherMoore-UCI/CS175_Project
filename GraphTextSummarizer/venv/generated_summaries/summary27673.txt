Kosuke Tsuneoka, 41, posted a message to his Twitter account on his arrival at the airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Monday. "They were corrupt military factions that blackmailed the Japanese government by pretending they were Taliban," Tsuneoka posted in Japanese on his Twitter account. "The Japanese government and the family of the kidnap victim did not pay a ransom to the culprits," Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku, said Monday at a news conference. -- A Japanese freelance journalist who was kidnapped for five months in Afghanistan and released Saturday says his kidnappers weren't members of the Taliban, but corrupt Afghan soldiers. He called the lower-ranking soldiers and civilians proper people.
