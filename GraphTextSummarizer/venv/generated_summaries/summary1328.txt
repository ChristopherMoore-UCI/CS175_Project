CNN first confirmed in May the president's plans to nominate Comey, but at the time White House officials refused to confirm that the president had made a selection in his search for a new leader of the FBI. Human rights groups have criticized Comey's alleged support of other controversial Bush-era national security policies such as indefinite detention and detainee treatment programs like waterboarding. -- President Barack Obama will formally nominate James Comey, a top Justice Department official during the Bush administration, to head the FBI, a White House official said on Thursday. Currently he works in academia as a senior research scholar and Hertog Fellow in National Security Law at Columbia Law School. Comey served as a deputy attorney general during the Bush administration, a role for which he has received both praise and criticism from outside groups.
