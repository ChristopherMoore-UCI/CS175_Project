But if a witch were rich, she might feel right at home in this Beverly Hills house. In 2013 the Witch's House became an official Beverly Hills landmark, something Libow worked hard to achieve. The Witch's House is believed to have first appeared on screen in the 1921 silent film "The Face of the World," says Kimberly Reiss of Beverly Hills Heritage, an organization dedicated to promoting the history of the city. "It is, I'm told, the most requested noncelebrity house to visit in Los Angeles," says Libow. The more Libow showed the Witch's House, the more it cast a spell on him.
