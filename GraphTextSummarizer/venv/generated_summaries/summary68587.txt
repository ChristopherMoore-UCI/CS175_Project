A statement on their official Web site read: "Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas is under contract with the club until the summer of 2015. Arsenal have rejected out of hand a formal offer from Barcelona for their talismanic captain Cesc Fabregas, the English Premier League club confirmed on Wednesday. The recent signing of Spain striker David Villa from Valencia for $49 million has put the Sweden international's Nou Camp future under some scrutiny. The midfielder then backtracked by saying that he would put his future in the hands of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and instead focus on playing for Spain at the World Cup in South Africa. Fabregas came through the youth ranks at the Nou Camp before joining Arsenal in 2003, and declared last month he would like to return to Spain.
