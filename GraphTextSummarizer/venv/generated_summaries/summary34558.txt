White House press secretary Jay Carney said the summit came from conversations he and President Barack Obama had regarding the concerns parents had about concussions. "As parents tend to do, we talk about our kids, and we talk a lot about sports," Carney said. More than 200 participants, including the National Football League, professional athletes and the Pentagon, will discuss what can be done to help educate parents and athletes on how to better prevent concussions and protect athletes' brains, according to a White House statement. Dr. David Dodick of the Mayo Clinic told CNN the summit will focus unprecedented attention on the issue of concussions and youth athletes. The White House will announce initiatives on Thursday, including an effort to help start a national concussion database through the University of California, Los Angeles, as well as a $30 million partnership between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Department of Defense to fund the most comprehensive clinical study of concussions among college athletes, the statement said.
