I put the question of what's really wrong with Facebook out on my Google Plus feed, in part because that network is a hotbed for Facebook defectors. "After all, that's why people started leaving MySpace to go to Facebook in the first place, because it simply tried to do too much." Writing for Forbes, Kashmir Hill puts it this way: "Facebook would love to be the all-inclusive resort of the Web, replete with complementary digital daiquiris (that you're forced to chug) upon entry. Let's put the brakes on for just a second and ask a few questions: Are people mad about Facebook's individual decisions -- the e-mail, the tracking, the News Feed -- or do the roots of this discontent reach into deeper, darker places? While that complaint may be premature -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg maintains a majority stake in the company, so he doesn't have to listen to investors and his board all that much -- the company's IPO, and the billionaires and millionaires who resulted from it, doubtlessly cloud how people see Facebook's motives. Facebook cares more about investors than users Facebook went public this year, leading to criticisms that the site's motives have changed.
