Indeed, there is likely an underreporting of male wartime sexual violence, akin to the underreporting of sexual violence generally. In official reports, however, all too often, the issue is mentioned only in passing or is relegated to a footnote -- and the principal U.N. resolution on the subject focuses on female victims of sexual violence almost to the exclusion of male victims. In an earlier report, the Commission noted instances of rape, electric shocks to the genitals and forced rape of family members. Another study, this time relating to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, found that 23.6% of the men surveyed reported experiencing sexual violence, of which 64.5% were exposed to conflict-related sexual violence. Sexual violence against men is not limited to any particular part of the world.
