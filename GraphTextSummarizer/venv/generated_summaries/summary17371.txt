Police found April Jace, 40, shot to death in her south Los Angeles home Monday night, Los Angeles Police Det. Investigators have found no reports of domestic violence between the husband and wife at their south Los Angeles residence, LAPD Det. He acted on several episodes of "Southland," another TV drama about Los Angeles police, between 2009 and 2012. Jace appeared to be suffering severe financial strain in recent years, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Jace "choked and hit" his wife and "slammed her against the wall while (their infant son) screamed in his crib next to her," Maria De Le Vegas said in the sworn declaration obtained by CNN.
