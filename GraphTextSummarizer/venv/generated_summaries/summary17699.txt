In an interview that will air tonight on ABC's "World News with Diane Sawyer," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked frankly about an upcoming IPO, the Facebook movie, a shady lawsuit and much more. Although a Facebook lawyer said yesterday the company is "unsure" whether such a contract was ever signed, Zuckerberg told Sawyer unequivocally, "We did not sign a contract that says that [Ceglia has] any right to ownership over Facebook." The real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time," Zuckerberg said in his interview with Sawyer. As far as the movie "The Social Network" is concerned, Zuckerberg seemed to echo Facebook co-founder Dustin Moscovitz's opinion that the film seems a lot more exciting than the real-life version of Facebook's history. Of course, Sawyer's interview also touches on the privacy debacle ("We have made mistakes, for sure," said Zuckerberg) and the site's crossing the 500-million-user mark (Zuckerberg said the journey had been "surreal") as well as several other topics.
