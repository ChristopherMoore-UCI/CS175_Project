Meet Sherlock, the appropriately named beagle tasked by the Royal Dutch Airlines with returning items forgotten on planes by passengers flying into Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Should the incredibly eager beagle not be around to help, the airline uses information such as seat numbers, phone numbers and public social media details to reunite passengers with their belongings. "He can really do something no one else can" KLM says Sherlock is part of a new lost and found team put together in response to the high number of queries about forgotten items the airline receives through social media. Perhaps the most famous is the Beagle Brigade -- made up of teams of dogs that inspect luggage for restricted agriculture at U.S. airports. Warning: After seeing this achingly adorable video of KLM's newest employee in action you might be tempted to leave your gadgets behind on your next flight into Amsterdam.
