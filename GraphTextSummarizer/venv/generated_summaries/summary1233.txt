The Red Cross and the New York mayor's office are warning people to stay in cool spaces and drink plenty of water. The heat began to fade Wednesday afternoon across the Northeast after posting near triple-digit marks from Maryland to Vermont, with another brutal day in store on Thursday. The hot, humid air that's bear-hugged the region drove temperatures up to 96 in New York and Philadelphia, 92 in Boston and 94 as far north as Burlington, Vermont. The combination of heat and humidity is expected to drive the heat index, a measurement of how hot it feels to your body, into the triple digits again Thursday. It's also bumped ground-level ozone levels into the danger zone for children, the elderly and people with heart and lung ailments across the Northeast Corridor.
