The government decision "seems to completely disregard their basic rights," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. Two prominent Bahraini groups, the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights and Bahrain Center for Human Rights, decried the move. The state-run Bahrain TV announced the move Tuesday evening, citing an Interior Ministry statement. The Interior Ministry statement Tuesday said the country's Citizenship Act "allows the kingdom the right to revoke the citizenship of anyone who is charged with being a threat to the state's security," Bahrain TV reported. But Amnesty International said the move breached people's right to free speech.
