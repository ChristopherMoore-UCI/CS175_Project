Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last month. A grand jury in Tempe indicted Sharper on two counts of sexual assault and three counts of administering dangerous drugs relating to an incident alleged to have happened on November 21, Tempe police said Wednesday. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. Authorities have said Sharper, 38, is under investigation in four other states -- California, Louisiana, Nevada and Florida -- in cases of alleged sexual assault. New Orleans police have issued an arrest warrant for Sharper, who is in custody in Los Angeles and is scheduled to attend an extradition hearing Thursday.
