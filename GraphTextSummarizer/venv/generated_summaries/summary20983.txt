Apparently the Truffula Valley is a much better training ground for the box office than Mars, as "Dr. Seuss' The Lorax" had no trouble fending off Disney's expensive new sci-fi arrival "John Carter. Also hurting matters was the generic title, which Disney shortened from "John Carter of Mars" with the reported belief that "of Mars" would turn off female moviegoers. But the real story here, of course, is "John Carter," which Disney infamously spent $250 million to produce. "John Carter," on the other hand, collected an estimated $30.6 million this weekend. However, since the general public is not overly familiar with the Barsoom works, "John Carter" appeared derivative of the very things it inspired.
