The new law restricts the ability of illegal immigrants to obtain government IDs or public assistance. The law went into effect Thursday and is intended to make life difficult for illegal immigrants in Oklahoma. Illegal immigrants in Oklahoma fear police will use the law for roundups of anyone working and living in the state illegally. The clergy group filed a federal lawsuit against the state saying the state has overstepped its bounds by enforcing immigration law, which is under federal jurisdiction. The law also makes it a felony for U.S. citizens to knowingly provide shelter, transportation or employment to illegal immigrants.
