In mild cases, EV-71 causes cold-like symptoms, diarrhea, and sores on the hands, feet and mouth. Public health officials expect the number of cases to peak this summer, since the disease thrives in warm weather. Severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death. Adults with well-developed immune systems can usually fend off the virus, but children are particularly vulnerable to it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another child died of the virus at a Beijing hospital, but that death was counted in the child's home province of Hebei, which neighbors Beijing, the news agency said.
