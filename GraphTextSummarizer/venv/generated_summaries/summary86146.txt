-- Rep. Paul Ryan is trying to talk about the issue of poverty, but the talk so far has produced more problems than solutions. Bob Woodson, who has known Ryan for years and heads the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, an organization that works with people on the outskirts of society, said people "should earn a right to be critical" by either living in or working with impoverished communities. In a statement Thursday, one day after his controversial remarks, Ryan said he was trying to make a larger point: That "we cannot settle for this status quo and that government and families have to do more and rethink our approach to fighting poverty." Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights While Woodson admires Ryan's interest in poverty and his willingness to travel to some of the most difficult neighborhoods with him and his organization, he said the lawmaker hasn't yet earned the right to be critical "at this point." Gillespie said that if a politician is going to talk about race and poverty and wants to be taken serious, "Don't invoke the man that wrote 'The Bell Curve.'" Woodson, who worked at the conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute with Murray when "The Bell Curve" was released in 1994, agreed, saying he constantly tells Ryan to stop quoting conservative scholars because their polarizing rhetoric "seeps into his speeches." "All of these guys ... do not talk to the people they write about," Woodson said.
