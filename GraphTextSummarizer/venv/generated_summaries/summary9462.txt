An Italian intelligence source told ANSA news agency that authorities are in a "very delicate moment that requires maximum discretion." Some postings say the video is from al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. "I have no doubt that it's them," Vanessa's father Salvatore Marzullo told CNN of the video posted online Thursday. Two young Italian women by those names -- ages 20 and 21 -- went missing and were believed kidnapped after they traveled to Syria in late July. "These women are shouting for help, they are sending out an SOS," said Laura Boldrini, speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies.
