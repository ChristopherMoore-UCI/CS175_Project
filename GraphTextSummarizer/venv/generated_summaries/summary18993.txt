A contract worth as much as $5 million was awarded to high-end Vermont glass and pottery designer Simon Pearce to design and manufacture glass stemware for U.S. foreign embassies just days before the October 1st government shutdown. Harf said the purchase reinforces U.S. worldwide diplomacy: "We're out there representing the United States, and I think what better way to do that than with a good American company with good American products. " But Harf did acknowledge the contract, which was awarded September 25, coincided with the end of the government's fiscal year, at which time many agencies incorporate a "use it or lose it" mentality with their funding. Simon Pearce expects the contract to allow it to hire many additional workers at its Quechee facility, which was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Irene two years ago. A spokesperson for Simon Pearce told CNN the contract is for 12,500 pieces of custom hand-blown glassware to be produced over five years and to be used at foreign embassies.
