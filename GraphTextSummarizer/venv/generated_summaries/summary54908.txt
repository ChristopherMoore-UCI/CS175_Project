Confirming earlier rumors, Apple launched a new program Friday that will allow customers to trade in old iPhones at U.S. Apple stores for credit towards a newer model. Right now, a top of the line, mint-condition iPhone 5 can net $406 in Apple store credit. After answering some questions about the state of a device, you can trade eligible computers, iPhones, iPads and iPods for Apple store credit. So, Apple Retail Stores are launching a new program to assist customers who wish to bring in their previous-generation iPhone for reuse or recycling," said Apple spokeswoman Amy Bessette in a statement. Carriers including AT&T and Verizon also offer store credit in exchange for old iPhones and other smartphones.
