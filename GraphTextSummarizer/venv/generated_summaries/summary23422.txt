South of Amsterdam, idyllic Delft -- dreamy as a painting by hometown artist Johannes Vermeer -- now offers a fine Vermeer Center. (And a few blocks away, beer lovers can soak up the recently re-opened Heineken Experience, located at the site of the former Heineken brewery.) The special "Van Gogh and the Colors of the Night" exhibit gathers together the artist's nighttime works from other museums, including the world-famous "Starry Night." Offering new sights and old masterpieces, the Dutch do a dandy job of making this little country a delight for travelers. On sunny summer days, the Rijksmuseum offers a fun "lunch-box-with-a-blanket-in-the-park" deal (about $17 with museum entry or about $6 for just the boxed lunch and a loaner blanket).
