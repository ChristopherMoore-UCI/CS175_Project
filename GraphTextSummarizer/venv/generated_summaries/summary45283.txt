According to police, the pair were contacted by a Colombian named "Enrique" in Palma de Mallorca through a tourism company that flew them to Lima and then to Machu Picchu. -- Two young women arrested in Peru on suspicion of drug trafficking are in good condition and being well treated while in detention, a senior clergyman in Lima said Tuesday. Archbishop of Lima Sean Walsh, an Irish-American bishop who's been in Peru for the past seven years, told CNN he was able to meet briefly with the young women in the police cell where they are being held. The Ministry of Justice normally has an official translator present, said Walsh, who often visits foreigners held in jail in Lima. They were stopped as they tried to board an Air Europa flight from Lima to Madrid after authorities allegedly found 11.59 kilograms (25.5 pounds) of cocaine in their luggage.
