In their new role, U.S. troops are expected to advise and assist Iraq's security forces, back Iraqi troops in counterterrorism missions and protect American civilians there during a transitional period. The soldiers were part of a security element for a U.S. company commander who was meeting with members of Iraqi security forces at the compound. The attack occurred inside an Iraqi army commando compound when the soldier, clad in an Iraqi army uniform, fired on the U.S. soldiers near the Salaheddin province city of Tuz, the U.S. military said. A September 1 ceremony, held at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad, marked the conclusion of the U.S. combat mission dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom and the transfer to the assistance mission, named Operation New Dawn. Al-Askari said Rahman got into a fight with U.S. soldiers, and then pulled his weapon and fired on them before he was fatally shot.
