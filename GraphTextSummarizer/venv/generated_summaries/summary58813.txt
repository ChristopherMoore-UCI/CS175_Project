With fair trade instead of free trade, American workers can once again bring home the gold. We need fair trade agreements so that the most productive workers in the world -- American workers -- can put their skills to work and compete in the global economy. Mayor Virg Bernero says the American worker has been sold out by backers of free trade. Good jobs with good benefits created the middle class in this country, and now it is being systematically dismantled under the banner of free trade and globalism. We need a long-term strategy to rebuild the American economy that provides jobs and economic security to the millions of hard-working American families who have been sold down the river by unfair trade policies.
