A 2011 report by the UK-based consumer group Which? found that 8 in 10 people in the UK thought paper coffee cups could already be disposed of in paper recycling bins. His company is now in talks with coffee shop chains and existing cup makers, in the hope the technology is adopted: "It'll take us till next year to get going properly. Most paper cups are made from cardboard with a thin layer of plastic tightly attached on to the cup. So the idea is to license the technology to existing cup makers, they can use part of their existing machines and buy our machine and bolt it on as well. The campaign group is now urging retailers to provide clearer information about recycling.
