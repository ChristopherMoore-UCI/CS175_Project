"La Bella Principessa" -- a 13 inch tall pen-and-ink portrait of a Florentine woman with a Mona Lisa-esque smile -- sat in a drawer for decades, before being "rediscovered" and attributed as a lost $150 million masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci. Beating the forgers Either of those tests might once have ruled out modern day forgery -- but forgers are keeping up with scientific advances. The team had discovered this base layer on other Rafael paintings in the collection, but before this, Springs says: "There's no way that a copyist several centuries later would have known that this is how Rafael prepared his paints. Here, a lecturer teaching a new class in forgery-catching and the head of science at the British National Gallery's laboratory explain how new techniques identify ever more cunning forgers and bring true masterpieces to light. "Kemp specifically compiled evidence of all the mistakes that Leonardo's forgers had made through the ages," says Dr Christa Roodt, a Lecturer in Art Law and Business at Glasgow University, teaching a new course on Forgeries, Attributions and the Art Market.
