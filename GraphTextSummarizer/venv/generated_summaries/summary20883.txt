" Chong drank his own urine to survive as his cries for help were ignored by federal agents and inmates in nearby cells, Iredale said. He almost died," said Chong's lawyer, Gene Iredale. It wasn't until the afternoon of Wednesday, April 25, that an agent opened the steel door to Chong's cell and found the handcuffed student, Iredale said. " On Wednesday, Iredale filed a damage claim with the DEA, which he said is the beginning of the process for a civil suit in federal court. " Chong contorted himself to shift his handcuffed arms from behind his back to the front, Iredale said.
