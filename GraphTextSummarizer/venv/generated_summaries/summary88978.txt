-- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbott moved their only televised election debate so they wouldn't clash with the finale of "MasterChef Australia" Sunday -- but their switch forced Kylie Minogue to change her schedule. Since taking over, she has established a sizable lead in public approval polls over opposition leader Abbott. Conservative opposition leader Tony Abbott was quick to condemn Gillard's government when she called the election. A Herald/Nielsen poll released just before the election was called said 56 percent of those surveyed preferred Gillard as prime minister, while only 35 percent supported Abbott. She ousted Kevin Rudd as leader of Australia's Labor Party, and prime minister, in June.
