Tim Brooks is a historian of early audio recordings. This recording had been thought lost for years and years and years," said Brooks. "That's a whole different view of this person than we did get before just from the written word." Brooks says preserving long-forgotten recordings is important work precisely for that reason. "In a way, scholarship hasn't caught up yet with the importance of recorded sound and understanding why leaders were able to lead and change history the way they did," said Brooks. As the place was undergoing renovations, someone discovered a long-forgotten box containing cylinder recordings of Otto von Bismarck.
