Houston residents received flyers in the mail that highlighted Parker's support from gay groups and her relationship with her partner. Parker, who served five years as city controller, beat former city attorney Gene Locke with 53.6 percent of the vote in a runoff election. Parker's victory is also remarkable because a few years ago, Houston rejected a referendum to offer benefits to same-sex partners of city workers. Parker's election also makes her the second woman to become mayor of Houston. "There's a certain segment of Houston, there's a certain segment of society that has problems with the issues around sexual orientation," Parker said.
