-- Talks among regional African leaders failed Monday to resolve a long-standing power-sharing dispute between embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. In light of the continued stalemate, SADC executive secretary Tomaz Salamao told journalists that South African leader Kgalema Motlanthe, who is leading the SADC, had called for a summit on January 26. South African former president Thabo Mbeki is shown at talks Monday in Harare. After the meeting a visibly angry Mugabe said talks faltered after Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), presented proposals which differed from recommendations by the 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC). MDC have a proposal which is in conflict with the SADC and we opposed it and then the talks broke down," Mugabe said.
