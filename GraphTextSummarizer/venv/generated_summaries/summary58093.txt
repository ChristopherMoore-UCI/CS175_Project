Rawls was released and returned home to San Antonio in November 1987, spending the next several months trying to get his act together, Martin said. He was heavily into drug use, sometimes had a violent temper and committed burglary and eventually spent three months in a court-ordered detention and rehabilitation facility in Waco, Texas, said Denise Martin, Rawls' mother. In the past, Rawls had fallen out of sight for a few days, but always called his mother and took some possessions with him, Martin said. Rawls and his friends seemed to have a teenage fascination with Satanism, Martin said. At the time of his disappearance, Rawls was 6 feet, 2 inches and 150 pounds, with dark blond hair and blue eyes.
