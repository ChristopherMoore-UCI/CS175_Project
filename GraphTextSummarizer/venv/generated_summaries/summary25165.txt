That sparked divisions in Serbia about whether to keep pursuing membership in the European Union given that several EU nations have recognized Kosovo's independence. -- Serbian President Boris Tadic has dissolved parliament and called early elections for May 11, following disagreements over Kosovo and the European Union. Tadic, who was narrowly elected to a second term last month, set out his policies in an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais. We're not going to relinquish Kosovo or becoming EU members. However, Serbia -- which regards the region as integral to its history and culture -- has refused to accept the move as being legal, and conservatives do not want to join the EU unless its member states retract any recognition of Kosovo.
