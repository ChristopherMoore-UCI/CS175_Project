Also indicted was Rafael Brenner Resnick, former chief of staff of the Argentine Federal Administration of Public Revenue, for presumably facilitating the payment plan to lift Ciccone Litografica -- which was beset with tax debts -- out of bankruptcy. Boudou is accused of "passive bribery and inconsistent negotiations," according to the decision from Argentine Federal Judge Ariel Lijo that was released Friday. According to Lijo, Boudou carried out the bribe and negotiations with the help of friends Jose Maria Nunez Carmona and Alejandro Vanderbroele, who also were indicted. Boudou, who was minister of economy from 2009 to 2011, is suspected of using his influence to ensure that a contract to print Argentina's currency was given to Ciccone CalcogrÃ¡fica, a company he allegedly controlled, judicial sources said. The company's owner, Nicholas Ciccone, was indicted on a charge of active bribery, and his son-in-law, William Reinwick, is accused as an accomplice.
