International agencies, such as the United Nations and the Arab League, and many countries in the region and in Europe are addressing the refugee and the internally displaced persons' crisis, and money is being allocated to Iraq and host countries to help clothe, feed and house people. Angelina Jolie has been working to focus attention on problem of refugees in Iraq. Jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the U.S. effort to resettle Iraqi refugees in the United States, which has set a goal of taking in 12,000 of those people by September. "How Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East," said Jolie. In August, Jolie first visited Iraq and Syria to get a sense of the problem.
