A number of high-profile gun violence incidents at post offices across the country has increased the scrutiny on post office safety in recent years. The court said USPS attorneys had failed to present evidence to support enforcement of the regulation on post office parking lots. Bonidy, who is legally permitted to carry a concealed firearm, was unable to carry the weapon on post office property without violating the law. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Tab Bonidy, a resident of rural Avon, Colorado, who was prohibited by U.S. Postal Service regulations from carrying his gun on postal service property. Citizens can legally carry firearms in post office parking lots, a federal judge has ruled.
