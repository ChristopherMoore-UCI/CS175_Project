The 89-year-old Lee was resting at home, according to a statement from the office of his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Lee was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on Saturday after experiencing a suspected transient ischaemic attack, or a brief disruption of blood flow to a part of the brain, the statement said. Goh ran a "kinder, gentler Singapore" and helped dilute the perceptions of a Lee family dynasty. After 14 years in power -- steering Singapore through the 1997 financial crisis and the SARS outbreak, and reaching out to his neighbors and to the West -- 63-year-old Goh turned the office over to Lee's son in 2004. Commonly referred to by his initials, LKY, the elder Lee was Singapore's first prime minister after it gained independence from Malaysia in 1965.
