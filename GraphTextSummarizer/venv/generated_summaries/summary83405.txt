"My view on a stock is always relative to its price, and for a long time now there have been better stocks and better companies in almost every line of business that Sony is in, save possibly for its financial services business," Collett said. "The television business hasn't made any more for the last eight years -- any rational manager would have shut that down by now," said Ben Collett, head of Japanese equities for Louis Capital Markets. This month, Sony partnered with Toshiba and Hitachi to create Japan Display Inc., a government-backed project to create smartphone displays. But in the industry where Sony made its name -- consumer electronics -- the company needs a lifeline as it finishes its fiscal year with a record $6.4 billion loss. "If you look at the automobile industry in Japan, it didn't suffer as much as the electronics makers," said Thomas Kang, research director for Strategy Analytics in Seoul.
