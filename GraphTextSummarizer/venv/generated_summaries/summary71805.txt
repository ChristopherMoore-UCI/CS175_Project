Special prosecutor in Missouri teen rape case promises thorough review Montana rapist and former teacher freed after month-long sentence Teen pleads not guilty to rape at school sports camp A grand jury investigating the 2012 rape of a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville, Ohio, and educators' responses to a separate rape allegation in the city that year has led to the indictment of four school employees, including the school superintendent, who faces felony charges, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced Monday. This brings to six the number of people the grand jury has indicted after two students were convicted of rape, DeWine said. He also is charged with making a false statement and obstructing official business, both misdemeanors, DeWine said. But some of the charges announced Monday relate not to the August 2012 rape, but to a separate alleged rape in April 2012 in the Steubenville area, DeWine said.
