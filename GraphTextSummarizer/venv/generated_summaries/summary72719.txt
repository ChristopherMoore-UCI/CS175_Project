-- Country music star Mindy McCready was found dead Sunday at her home in Arkansas from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local sheriff's office said in a statement. "I've spent my fortune, tarnished my public view and made myself the brunt of punch line after punch line. "It breaks my heart what addiction continues to take from this life," singer Wynonna Judd wrote in a series of tweets. She appeared in an episode of "Celebrity Rehab" three years ago with Dr. Drew Pinsky, who said he contacted her last month after her boyfriend's death. Deputies from the Cleburne County Sheriff's Office were dispatched to a report of gunshots fired Sunday afternoon and found McCready's body on the front porch, the statement read.
