'Argo' recognizes forgotten heroes of Iran hostage saga It plans to fund a movie entitled "The General Staff," about 20 American hostages who were handed over to the United States by Iranian revolutionaries, according to a report last week by Mehr News, the official Iranian agency. "This film, which will be a big production, should be an appropriate response to the ahistoric film 'Argo,'" said Ataollah Salmanian, the director of the Iranian film, according to Mehr. Opinion: Latino should have played lead in 'Argo' "Argo" was named best drama movie during the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday night in Los Angeles, and Affleck won the award for best director, a category for which he was passed over in the recent Oscar nominations. "Argo" was officially viewed as "anti-Iranian" following its U.S. release last year, Mehr reported. But Iranian authorities have taken offense at the film's portrayal of the country and its people.
