"Ms. Richards was displaying symptoms of alcohol intoxication including slurred speech and belligerent insolent behavior, cursing at the officers and passively resisted arrest," police said in a statement. "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star and former child actress Kim Richards is accused of kicking a police officer after being arrested Thursday morning. Richards reportedly entered rehab in 2011 for "serious issues" after what watchers deemed erratic behavior on the reality show, which also features her sister Kyle Richards. Richards was taken into custody by police at the Beverly Hills Hotel on accusations of trespassing, resisting arrest and public intoxication after security personnel complained that she was bothering hotel guests about 1:30 a.m. Hotel security made a "private persons arrest," then police entered the restroom and took Richards into custody.
