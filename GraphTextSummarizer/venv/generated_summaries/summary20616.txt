His disappearance came two days after the U.S. Justice Department announced the arrest of 10 people on charges of being Russian agents involved in a long-term mission in the United States. The case resulted from a multiyear investigation conducted by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Justice Department's National Security Division, according to a Justice Department statement. On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said the State Department had no plans to expel any Russian diplomats over the matter. In any case it is regrettable that all these things are happening on the background of the 'reset' in Russian-U.S. relations announced by the U.S. administration." "I'm not projecting any diplomatic consequences other than the good will that we hope will be there going forward to continue to focus on the issues where we agree and work constructively on the areas on which we disagree," Crowley said, adding that officials throughout the State Department had been in touch with various levels of the Russian government to discuss the issue.
