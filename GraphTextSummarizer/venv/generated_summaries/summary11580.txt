The teen said Souza watched as the missing woman was asphyxiated, mutilated and fed to dogs, local police investigator Wagner Pinto told reporters last month. A former policeman, Marcos Aparecido dos Santos, was also charged with murder, conspiracy and concealment of corpse. The prosecutor filed the charges against Bruno Fernandes Das Dores de Souza and eight others in Contagem, Minas Gerais on Wednesday. Souza's former attorney, Michel Assef Filho, said last month that the goalie has "no knowledge of the facts, he is astonished and scared by his cousin's testimony and that's it." Filho stopped representing Souza when the Flamengo Club suspended Souza's contract. Charges include murder with special circumstances, kidnapping, imprisonment, concealment of a corpse, conspiracy and corruption of a minor.
