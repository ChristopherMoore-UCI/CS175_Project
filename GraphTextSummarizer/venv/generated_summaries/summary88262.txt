Dudley, an experienced commercial pilot with 2,200 hours of flight time, careened above New York's East River as his craft lost altitude and eventually plunged into the water, according to National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind. Trapped in the craft's back seat as it submerged, she was the sole passenger unable to escape as the copter inverted and sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday. A source close to the investigation identified the survivors as Paul Nicholson, 71; Harriet Nicholson, 60; and Helen Tamaki, 43. Rosekind said on CNN's "American Morning" that the helicopter was not on an air tour flight, but a private flight, and that a complete investigation would begin Wednesday. Dudley, the pilot, previously made an emergency landing in a small Cessna plane in a Brooklyn, New York, park in 2006.
