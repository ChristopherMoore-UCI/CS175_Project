" Police said the peasants had been camping on land owned by Blas Riquelme, a businessman and politician active in the South American nation's Colorado Party. -- Peasants in eastern Paraguay opened fire Friday on police trying to evict them from private property, initiating a clash that ended with at least 17 dead, local authorities and state-run media said. But Jose Rodriguez, the leader of the "tent people" -- so named because they live in tents, told Radio Nacional that the peasants were on public lands that Riquelme had acquired illegally. Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police. Curuguaty Hospital director Gustavo Gonzalez told the state-run Paraguay Agency of Public Information that seven policemen and more than 10 farmers were killed.
