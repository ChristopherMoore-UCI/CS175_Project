The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Triaminic Syrups and Theraflu Warming Relief Syrups for cough, colds and fevers were voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer, Novartis Consumer Health, because the cap could still be removed by a child even with the tamper-resistant seal in place. Julie Masow, a Novartis spokeswoman, told CNN that there are 183 lots included in the recall - 142 of Triaminic Syrups and 41 of Theraflu Warming Relief Syrups. Novartis said the last batch of products in question were distributed more than a year ago, so the company believes little remains for sale or in use. However, since they were distributed between May 24, 2010, and December 21, 2011, approximately 97% of the Theraflu and Triaminic inventory has already been consumed, returned to Novartis, or quarantined at a Novartis warehouse. So far, Novartis has had 12 reports of children unscrewing the locked caps, including four who ingested the product.
