"People are saying, 'I got AJOed this morning,' 'Have you AJOed today?'" From Erie to Sri Lanka, the O'Neills have been receiving photos showing #AJO. The O'Neills started the AJO Forever Fund to assist families of children with epilepsy and to bolster a scholarship fund for local cheerleaders looking to go into nursing. Two days after Alyssa's funeral, the O'Neills went to a Starbucks in Erie, Pennsylvania, where they live, and purchased lattes for 40 strangers. Now the movement to raise awareness about epilepsy has gone beyond lattes. O'Neill had no clue how many people this random act of kindness would affect.
