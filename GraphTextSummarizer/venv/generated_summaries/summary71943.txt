Markoff, 24, was charged with the April 14, 2009, fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. However, the medical examiner is withholding the official cause of death for Philip Markoff pending further tests, prosecutors said. In a statement Sunday, the family of Brisman said it was "shocked and dismayed" at the news of Markoff's apparent suicide. Markoff was found unresponsive in his Boston, Massachusetts, jail cell at 10:17 a.m. Sunday and pronounced dead by medics, according to officials. Markoff was also charged with the April 10, 2009, robbery of Trisha Leffler at a Westin Hotel in Boston.
