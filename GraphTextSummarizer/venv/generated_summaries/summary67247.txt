Citing security concerns, state court Judge Nadine Allen denied a motion filed by a lawyer for Deandre Kelley, 34, who was charged with the shooting death of daughter Achauntiara Lanza during an argument with the victim's mother, according to bailiff Gail Ruth. "There has been a lot of public discussion that the 'system' failed this family," Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph T. Deters said in a statement at the time of Kelley's indictment. He needs to be in jail and the rest of them should be looking in the mirror for the reason this little girl is dead." Kelley, who has pleaded not guilty, is being held on bond $500,000 bond. Kelley, who turned himself in the next day, was charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, endangering children and having a weapon under disability -- a charge stemming from a prior conviction for cocaine possession. Prosecutors said the dispute began hours before the shooting: Kelley and the victim's mother argued because he brought a gun into the home while the girl was having a slumber party with friends.
