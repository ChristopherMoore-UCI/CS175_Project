Some 80 miles north of Baton Rouge, the Atchafalaya River diverges from the Mississippi and flows down to the Gulf. "If you have a pasture where you grow soybeans and it gets flooded by 25 feet of floodwaters and you end up with 3 feet of oozing mud on top of your pasture, it's going to be a long time before you can plow -- certainly one year," said Sam Bentley, a professor of sedimentary geology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. "On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is that the water rises, we're not able to manage it, it finds the weak areas, exploits those vulnerabilities, perhaps even segments of the river levee get taken out by erosion or collapse due to failure of saturated levees or other things could happen -- ships get loose in the river, barges of chemicals run into the side of the levee." If levees break, weeks could pass before engineers could reseal them, he said. How bad will it be in Louisiana, where the swollen Mississippi is headed? Farmers in parts of Louisiana could face a long recovery, particularly if authorities open the Morganza Spillway near Baton Rogue to lower water levels on the Mississippi River.
