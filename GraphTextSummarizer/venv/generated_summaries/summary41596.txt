Most, especially those who self-identified as materialists, anticipated future purchases with strong, positive emotions: They felt joy, excitement, optimism and peacefulness when they thought of their future purchase, which they also believed would improve their relationships, boost their self-esteem, enable them to experience more pleasure and be more efficient.

"I rarely regretted a purchase, but having a new pair did not make me want more pairs any less," she told me. Online shopping is a relatively mindless activity that, while relaxing, offers little in the way of engagement with others. When her box of shoes arrived in the mail, it was like Christmas morning.
