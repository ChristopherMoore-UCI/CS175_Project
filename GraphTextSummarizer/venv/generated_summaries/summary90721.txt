While the catches might not be as dramatic, they've all caught bad stuff women wouldn't have known about otherwise: warts on a woman's cervix; HPV lesions that could have spread to a sexual partner; benign ovarian cysts that weren't painful but could twist and rupture; and, on occasion, they found ovarian cancer. One, while these women didn't have ovarian cancer, during the surgery doctors did find other things, such as benign ovarian cysts, that were removed. The group said there are no actual studies showing pelvic exams help women, and it believes the exams could actually hurt them. The American College of Physicians looked and didn't find a single study that assessed whether routine pelvic exams save lives or make women healthier. So if pelvic exams can find bad things, why did the American College of Physicians recommend doctors skip them?
