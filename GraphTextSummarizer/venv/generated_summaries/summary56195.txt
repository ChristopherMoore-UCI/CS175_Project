Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director at Human Rights Watch, called for the country's interim government to provide candidates with as much protection as possible so they can campaign freely without fear. -- A man in a motorcycle detonated explosives Monday near a police van in northwest Pakistan, killing at least six people and wounding more than 30, police said. "Since the end of military rule in 2008, Pakistan's political parties have displayed an impressive commitment to cementing democratic and constitutional rule," Hasan said. The elections in May will mark the first time in Pakistan's history that one democratically elected government will give way to another. The Taliban said it targeted secular candidates, but many parties have been hit by the increasing violence.
