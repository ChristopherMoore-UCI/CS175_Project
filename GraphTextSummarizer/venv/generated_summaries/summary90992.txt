Missing American Robert Levinson not 'abandoned' in Iran, John Kerry says Levinson, now 65, had gone to Iran on a mission to investigate corruption involving the laundering of oil profits by Iranian officials, including former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, according to a source. Family attorney David McGee said Levinson's relatives were supposed to meet with FBI Director James Comey about the case long before it became publicly known that Levinson was working for the CIA. McGee said records he found show "without a shadow of a doubt" that Levinson was a CIA contract employee on a rogue assignment in Iran for the agency when he disappeared. -- The family of long-missing former FBI agent Robert Levinson has renewed its request for a meeting with the bureau's new director following reports Levinson had been working for the CIA when he vanished, the family's lawyer said Monday. Ultimately, seven CIA staffers were disciplined and three were fired, McGee said -- including Levinson's chief handler.
