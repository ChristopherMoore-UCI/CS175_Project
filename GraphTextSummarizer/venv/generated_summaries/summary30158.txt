Magaw said police went Thursday afternoon to the man's apartment in Crofton to interview him and found him wearing a T-shirt that said, "Guns don't kill people. Magaw said that, given Pitney Bowes' status as a federal contractor, the man could be subject to federal charges. "Both of those times and both of those telephone conversations he made significant threats to coming back and harming people at the business." Magaw added, "In fact, he said 'I'm a joker and I'm gonna load my guns and blow everyone up.' " Police in the counties of Prince George's and Anne Arundel acted on the alleged threat and the use of the word "joker." "An individual who was in the process of being fired was involved in two separate conversations with his supervisor," Prince George's County Police Chief Mark Magaw told reporters.
