Under images of Michaud doing his work for the day are lyrics from the song "King of Maine" by Maine-based rapper Spose -- yes, Maine has rappers -- that includes a sexually explicit lyric about Republican Sen. Susan Collins. So in Maine on Thursday, when a video profile of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Michael Michaud was released by a blogger, neither the blogger nor the Democrat's campaign say they realized a song featured in the video included sexually graphic lyrics about a top Republican in the state. All of which the Michaud campaign did immediately once it learned the meaning of the lyric, spokesperson Lizzy Reinholt said. He also said he thought the term was meant to be "an endorsement" of Collins, who he described as a highly regarded Republican in the state. The Maine Republican Party saw the video and understood the meaning of the lyric, "I've got Susan Collins givin' everybody brain."
