In foggy conditions and on soft snow in the women's downhill at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Vonn recorded a time of 1 minute 39.61 seconds, beating Austria's Elisabeth Goergl by 0.32 seconds. American skier Lindsey Vonn clinched World Cup victory number 62 Sunday, equaling the all-time record which has stood for 35 years The victory tied Vonn with Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell's, who set the benchmark between 1970 and 1980. In a desperate attempt to get fit for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Vonn aggravated her knee and needed a second operation. Vonn now has the chance to hold the record outright, with 63 wins, in Monday's super-G. "I've surprised myself how far I come," Vonn told CNN after her victory.
