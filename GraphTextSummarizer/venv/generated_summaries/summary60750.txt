During a three-day visit to Colombia, U.S. Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske visited several communities that are developing alternative crops and met with President Juan Manuel Santos, a key U.S. ally in Latin America. The Colombian government has greatly increased its military presence in the area, improving security and giving farmers an alternative to growing coca. Going into alternative crops hasn't been easy for local farmers. But another portion, recently rising, has been used to provide assistance to farmers interested in developing alternative crops like cacao (from which chocolate is made), plantains, yucca and papaya. He's part of a new wave of Colombian farmers growing alternative crops in a region called La Macarena.
