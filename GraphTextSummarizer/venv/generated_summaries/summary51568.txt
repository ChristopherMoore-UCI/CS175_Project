The show clocked in at two hours flat, with a number of categories other awards shows might consider biggies -- like favorite movie -- unrevealed during the broadcast. A gracious Julianna Margulies accepted one of the trophies for her show, "The Good Wife," which won favorite network TV drama, and another for co-star Josh Charles (favorite dramatic TV actor). Justin Timberlake also won, for favorite album ("The 20/20 Experience") and favorite male artist. The talk-show host won her 14th People's Choice Award, named favorite daytime TV host.
