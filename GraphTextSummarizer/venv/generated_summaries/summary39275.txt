Saying it is "unfair for Florida taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction," Gov. Rick Scott signed the legislation in June. -- A controversial law requiring adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screening has gone into effect in Florida. The court said the law would set a dangerous precedent by allowing the government to conduct drug searches for the safety of the public without prior suspicion. Controversy over the measure was heightened by Scott's past association with a company he co-founded that operates walk-in urgent care clinics in Florida and counts drug screening among the services it provides. In April, Scott, who had transferred his ownership interest in Solantic Corp. to a trust in his wife's name, said the company would not contract for state business, according to local media reports.
