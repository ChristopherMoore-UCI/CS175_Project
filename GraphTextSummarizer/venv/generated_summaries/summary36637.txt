" While keen to put expectations in perspective, D1 Oils, in partnership with oil company BP, has announced plans to plant 50,000 hectares of so-called "elite seed" this year, capable of producing 2.7 tonnes of oil per hectare. " "Until you see a one million hectare plantation producing regular amounts of jatropha crude year after year then it's hard to see how quickly the jatropha industry will progress. " "Concrete figures on productivity and seed oil yields are at best limited and those that are available often contradict stated projections. Jatropha is native to Central America but in recent years the shrub has been propagated around the world by developers convinced of its potential as a source of oil. What is agreed right now is that there's very little scientific information about large-scale production of jatropha oil.
