Ports will be required to perform checks and remove safety hazards ahead of loading, unloading or transporting oil and other hazardous chemical products, the transport ministry said in a notice on its website, according to the Xinhua news agency. Ship traffic at Dalian, China's second-largest port for crude oil imports, was limited to avoid interference with the cleanup efforts, Xinhua has reported. A state investigation has found that improper desulfurizer injections caused the oil pipeline explosion in the northeastern port city of Dalian, Xinhua said. -- Chinese authorities ordered beefed-up safety measures at the nation's ports after a pipeline explosion spewed crude oil into the Yellow Sea, state media reported Friday. Beijing was optimistic that the cleanup would be complete by Friday but analysts argue it may take months.
