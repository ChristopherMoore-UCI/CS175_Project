" Over the past several months, allegations have painted Cosby as a sexual predator, a serial rapist, a man who, over many decades, allegedly drugged and assaulted women, many of whom had viewed him as a mentor and guide. Every year, literally countless men who engage in sexual violence against women do not face charges, for reasons as varied and familiar as those given by the women in the Cosby scandal. A few days ago, it appeared that former "Cosby Show" cast mate Phylicia Rashad was condemning the women making the allegations. She was subsequently blasted throughout the media for what many took to be a dismissal of rape victims and a defense of Cosby. This week, three more women came forward to accuse Bill Cosby of drugging and assaulting them.
