" O'Donnell said that Saturday's decision will have a huge impact on the winner. It was time an Olympic triathlon has been settled in such a manner, and former Australian triathlete Bridie O'Donnell was astonished by the close finish. A qualified doctor and a seven-time national rowing champion, she has competed in several triathlons and Ironman competitions. "It's a shame that it has gone to CAS because the race has gone and the medal ceremony cannot be brought back, but you cannot underestimate how much that gold medal means because it can change somebody's life," she said. "I love triathlon and I thought that the Olympic race was gripping," O'Donnell said.
