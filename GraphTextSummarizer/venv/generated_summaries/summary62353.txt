-- Grace, Kara and Trichelle were created to fill a void for young black girls who for so long have been playing with dolls that don't look like them. Some think early play with dolls can affect a girl's self-esteem later in life. The dolls were created by Stacy McBride-Irby, an African-American who watched her daughter play with dolls and wanted to create a doll that looked more like her. I've had dads thank me for creating this line of dolls that represent their little girls. For some, the talk about dolls is not just child's play.
