"This an incident which, in my view, should not have happened," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said Sunday after being briefed by Coast Guard officials. "You had a competently manned ship with a pilot, all the navigation and sensors," said Adm. Thad Allen, Coast Guard commandant. On Sunday, the state's other U.S. senator and a leading Coast Guard official decried the accident. In addition to birds, oil spills can be very harmful to fish and shellfish,  NOAA said. Boxer said the Coast Guard initially reported that the ship's owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the Cosco Busan.
