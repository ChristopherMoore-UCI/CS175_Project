Within the past few days a child protection investigation had been opened to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, said Florida Department of Children and Families spokesman Mark Riordan. George Barahona, 53, will likely face other charges from the "complicated" investigation, said Chase Scott, a spokesman for the West Palm Beach Police Department. Law enforcement officials in West Palm Beach are handling the death investigation, while authorities in the Miami area, where the Barahona home is located, are looking into the family and the safety of the children, Riordan said. The entire vehicle, which was emitting fumes, is covered in unidentified chemicals, according to Scott. The body was taken to the county medical examiner's office for positive identification, said Scott, adding investigators have an idea of who it might be.
