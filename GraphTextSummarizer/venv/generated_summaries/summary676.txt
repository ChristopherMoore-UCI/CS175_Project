The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed to prohibit wage discrimination on the basis of sex and sought to ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work. Low-wage women workers -- many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and are seen as replaceable by their employers -- are especially likely to choose silence and live with pay discrimination rather than risk their jobs. New Jersey  joins states like Vermont, Colorado, Michigan and California in outlining explicit protections for workers seeking equal pay. Women who believe they're the victims of unequal pay face an impossible choice: Jeopardize their economic livelihood or suffer the indignity and economic consequences of discrimination. Female federal workers are paid 89 cents, and unionized female workers 88 cents, for every dollar paid to men.
