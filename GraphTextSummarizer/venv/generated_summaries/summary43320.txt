Share your memories Shirley Temple everywhere At the peak of her fame in the mid-1930s there were Shirley Temple dolls, Shirley Temple dresses, Shirley Temple china, Shirley Temple notebooks, Shirley Temple soap and Shirley Temple sheet music. Shirley Temple, child star, became Shirley Temple Black, diplomat, who raised three children, served as a U.N. representative and U.S. ambassador, and generally kept a low and genteel profile. There had been child stars before Shirley Temple -- Jackie Cooper and Jackie Coogan, to name two -- and there is certainly no shortage of them now, with reality TV and child-targeted cable networks minting a perky new imp every six months. Still, child stars of any era could do worse than model themselves on Shirley Temple. Such was the power of Shirley Temple during the Great Depression, a dark time when millions were out of work and struggling to survive.
