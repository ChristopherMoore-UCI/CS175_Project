"The FDA has failed to ensure that enforcement and compliance activities are conducted in a manner that does not create unnecessary shortages of critical drugs," according to the House report. According to Naumann, "We only have a couple of companies, and the problem is that if one of these companies goes down because of FDA inspections, manufacturing problems or something like that, we don't have those drugs if only one company is making them." Signed by President Barack Obama earlier this month, the act will help the FDA expedite the drug review process, particularly for drugs in shortage. A November 2011 FDA inspection found additional problems, including finding a 10-gallon can in a storage area that contained urine. She said FDA inspection processes and enforcement rules have not changed.
