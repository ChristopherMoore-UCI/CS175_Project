Some, such as Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho -- an opponent of the budget deal but a strong proponent of immigration reform -- argued that the budget battle had made it hard, if not impossible, for House Republicans to reach a deal with Obama. The one thing House Republicans are not going to do in the wake of the budget battle -- not on any issue, in any circumstances -- is a favor for Obama. The question for House Republicans, leadership and rank and file: Do they want to cede the issue to Obama? And to the degree that immigration reform is seen as Obama's issue, it will be dead on arrival in the House. House Republicans, licking their wounds, are asking themselves what's next.
