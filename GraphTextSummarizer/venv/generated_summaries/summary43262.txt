The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities across the administrative borders with those regions. The ministry said the motorcade, which carried Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's South Ossetia region when the shots were fired. South Ossetia was the site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7. Tensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August.
