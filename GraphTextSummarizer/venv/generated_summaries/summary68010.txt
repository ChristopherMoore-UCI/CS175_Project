"Before Cassini, the G ring was the only dusty ring that was not clearly associated with a known moon, which made it odd," said Matthew Hedman, a Cassini imaging team associate at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The moon is about one-third of a mile (a half-kilometer) across and circles Saturn as a part of the planet's sixth, or G, ring. Three years ago, a space probe launched from Cassini found evidence of geysers erupting from underground pools of liquid water on Saturn's moon Enceladus. Since its arrival, Cassini has been making a looping voyage through the Saturn system and is returning loads of data on the ringed planet and its moons. Cassini, which was funded by NASA and the European and Italian space agencies, launched in 1997 and took seven years to make the 934 million-mile (1.5 billion-kilometer) trip to Saturn.
