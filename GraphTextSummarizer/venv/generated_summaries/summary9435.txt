At a club on the outskirts of Montabaur, pilots who knew Lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said. An 8-minute descent to death Lubitz had been with Germanwings, a budget airline owned by Lufthansa, since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the airline's media office said. Spohr said Lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying. Most of Lubitz's training took place at the Lufthansa flight training center in Bremen. The only sound the recorder picked up from Lubitz as the Airbus A320 went down, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said, was the co-pilot's steady breathing.
