New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), estimates that as much as 300 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. "Our focus is on recovering oil from wherever we find it and we will go in day by day until this is over. As of Wednesday, clean-up teams, comprised of some 500 responders, collected 50 tonnes of solid waste and five tonnes of liquid waste from beaches in the Bay of Plenty, cleaning oil from 17 kilometers of coastline, MNZ said. "This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea," the organization's Steve Abel said. The ship's second officer will appear in Tauranga District Court this morning to face a charge of "operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk," MNZ said.
