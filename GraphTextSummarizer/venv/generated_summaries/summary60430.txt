In May: 12 dead, dozens missing after Bangladesh ferry capsizes Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report from New Delhi. Overcrowding of ferries is a persistent problem in Bangladesh, which sees scores of casualties from ferry accidents every year. The boat, the Pinak-6, capsized late Monday morning in the Padma river, around 60 km (37 miles) south of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka. One of the survivors, Abul Hossain, said that most people traveling on the boat's deck survived, but passengers in the cabins remained missing. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked rescuers to take all necessary steps to facilitate the rescue operation, and salvage the stricken vessel, the national news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, reported.
