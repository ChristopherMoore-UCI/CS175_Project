Of VMI's 1,428 cadets, 111 are women, school spokesman Lt. Col. Stewart MacInnis told CNN affiliate WSLS-TV. "After the female cadet made her report, the systems and procedures that are in place to address the safety of all cadets and to provide support were immediately placed into operation," Peay said in the statement. -- A Virginia Military Institute cadet has been charged with rape and sodomy after a female cadet reported she was the victim of sexual assault.
