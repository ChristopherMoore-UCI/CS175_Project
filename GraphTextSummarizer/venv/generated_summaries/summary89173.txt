-- German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed solidarity with Greece Tuesday on a trip to Athens, even as tens of thousands of Greeks rallied to show their anger toward her over the hardship their country is suffering. Christoph Weil, a senior economist at Commerzbank, told CNN that Merkel's visit to Athens comes as a "surprise" and that there was "a significant risk that Greece will exit the euro in the next two years." However, Wolfango Piccoli, director of Eurasia Group, says that the risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone remains "marginal" at the moment and that the so-called troika -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- will provide Greece with the next tranche of bailout funds to meet its debt obligations. In return for international bailout funds, Greece has agreed to the austerity program and labor market reforms -- measures that have led to violent street demonstrations in the past. Thousands protest austerity measures in Greece Samaras, whose coalition government is seeking new ways to implement budget cuts of 11.5 billion euros ($14.49 billion) to ensure the country receives another international bailout installment this month, also stressed the strong ties between the two nations. Merkel noted that Greece was going through a "very difficult phase" in which many people were suffering, but she insisted the debt-stricken nation had made progress in reducing its deficit and passing reforms.
