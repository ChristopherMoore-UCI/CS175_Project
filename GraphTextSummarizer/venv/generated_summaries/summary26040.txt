After a short time fighting in Aleppo, Syria, the order came to move across the essentially nonexistent border into Iraq, where ISIS fighters battling Iraqi forces near the Haditha Dam -- the scene of recent U.S. airstrikes and Iraqi ground operations -- needed reinforcement. Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISIS 'There are many nationalities' Al-Tamimi -- known by his nom de guerre, Abu Walid --  says he traveled from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait in July, and from there on to Turkey, a main route for jihadists into Syria. "These foreign fighters, when we squeeze them in Iraq and in Syria, they will permeate, they will infiltrate, they will cross the borders to Turkey, to Lebanon -- they have already started doing that and into Jordan, and Saudi Arabia is not very far," he said. But now ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, can "muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria," a CIA spokesman told CNN on Thursday. Al-Rubaie says he believes that Iraqis and Syrians probably constitute more than 70% of ISIS fighters.
