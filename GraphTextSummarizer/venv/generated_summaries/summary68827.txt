It's a great location, but we opt to head out of the city to Sonoma County, about an hour from San Francisco, which is home to some 1,800 growers and 450 wineries. If you think wine country -- especially Sonoma County -- is just for grown-ups (at least those over 21) think again. For younger kids, Sonoma Train Town Railroad has a steam railroad, a Ferris wheel and a carousel. There are many kid-friendly wineries too, complete with toy chests, picnic grounds and more, says Liza Graves, mom to 11-year-old twins and founder of Sonoma-based www.beautiful-places.com. If your gang loves the comic strip "Peanuts," You won't want to miss the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa.
