Those were just some of the many questions a group of us chatted about over coffee recently: Holland, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin, Cosmopolitan executive editor Leslie Yazel and me. "Women have this idea that we are supposed to not be moody and we're supposed to tamp down that moodiness," said Julie Holland, author of "Moody Bitches" and a psychiatrist who has practiced in New York for 20 years. And why is at least one in four American women taking some form of psychiatric medication, including antidepressants, versus one in seven men, according to Holland? What we're also seeing, Holland said, is a growing belief by women in the workplace that they need the meds to control their emotions at the office. As we wrapped up, I asked the women what the biggest takeaway was for them following our conversation about Holland's thoughtful new book.
