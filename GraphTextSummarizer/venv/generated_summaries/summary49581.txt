If the console report is true, it remains to be seen whether Google would go for the OUYA model of a more affordable, accessible system or try to compete with the so-called Big Three -- Sony's PlayStation, Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's Wii U. All three carry heftier pricetags but are more powerful and more well-established in the gaming world, with new games developed specifically for the devices. Google is reportedly working on a video game console that would be powered by its Android operating system, potentially putting another huge tech player in an arena dominated by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Both a console and a watch would be moves to undercut rival Apple, which is widely expected to roll out its own smartwatch and is reportedly planning to add gaming as part of the next iteration of its Apple TV product. Citing unnamed sources who have been "briefed on the matter," the Journal also said Google is planning to release a revamped Nexus Q, a media-streaming device that was announced but never released for sale to the public. An Android gaming console would come on the heels of the release of OUYA, a $99, open-platform console that runs on a version of the Google operating system.
