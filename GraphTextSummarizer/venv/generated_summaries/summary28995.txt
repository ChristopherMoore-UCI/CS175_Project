But there were some signs that DiMaggio was infatuated with Hannah and signs he was trying to lure the family to his home in rural San Diego County, near the Mexican border, her grandparents said. Hannah told authorities that DiMaggio fired at least once before being shot, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. In the weeks before DiMaggio's home in rural San Diego County went up in flames, he pleaded for the Andersons to visit him one last time. But a friend of Hannah's said she saw a different side to the relationship between DiMaggio and the teen. Marissa Chavez told CNN that she was in a car with Hannah and DiMaggio, 40, a few months ago when he told Hannah he had a crush on her.
