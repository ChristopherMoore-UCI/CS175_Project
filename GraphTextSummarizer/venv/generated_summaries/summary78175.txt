"These cowardly acts of targeted assassinations and indiscriminate bombings cannot deter the remarkable courage of the Somali people, whose tenacity and determination has overcome formidable obstacles and brought us to where we are now," said Augustine P. Mahiga, the special U.N. representative. Unidentified armed men shot Mustafa Haji Maalim in Mogadishu, and he later died at a hospital, the U.N. special representative for Somalia said in statement condemning his killing. Various witnesses told private Somali news outlets, including Shabelle Media Network and Garowe News, that at least two masked men shot Maalim in the southern district of Waberi in the Somali capital. Maalim was the father-in-law of former Somali President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, according to the United Nations. Just after sunset on Thursday, a suicide bombing in Mogadishu killed several people, the National Union of Somali Journalists said.
