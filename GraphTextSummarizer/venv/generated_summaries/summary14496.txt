The Arab Human Development Reports of 2002 and 2005 said the low status of women is one of the reasons Arab countries had stagnated, calling the rise of women "a prerequisite for an Arab renaissance." Pistorius' South Africa, a country with a storied history in the fight for racial equality, has a disturbing record of violence against women. In some countries, women are subjected to violence as retaliation for other family members' or their own perceived offenses in so-called "honor killings. On the same day that thousands of women stood up to participate in One Billion Rising, billed as the largest mass action to stop violence against women and girls, the sad news came from South Africa that yet another woman was killed. As the world changes, as countries emerge from poverty and people fight for their rights, we can look to the level of violence against women as one of the gauges of their success. Women have endured the use of rape as a weapon of war, and domestic violence as a tool of control at home.
