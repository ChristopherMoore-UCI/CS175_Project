Liberia went to the polls Tuesday for a runoff election after incumbent President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf failed to win the votes needed for an outright victory last month. "Regardless of your political views, I appeal to all Liberians to say no to violence on Election Day," said Ellen Margrethe Loj, the U.N.Secretary-General's special representative and head of the U.N. Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). Liberia faces many challenges: up to 80% of Liberians are unemployed and a majority live without basic necessities such as water and electricity. On Monday, members of the Tubman's Congress for Democratic Change clashed with police in what authorities called an unauthorized protest, state-owned radio network Liberia Broadcasting System reported. While the U.S.-based Carter Center said the October balloting was "peaceful, orderly, and remarkably transparent," opposition parties have protested the results, and claimed voting irregularities.
