It was easy to frighten players in the first game just by introducing the team's horrifying creations, and the second title offered new scares by changing the pacing of the action. While he wouldn't reveal what he would call his "OMG moment" in the game, Papoutsis said there are definitely a couple of moments in that will surprise and shock players. They focused on an overall package of elements -- music, characters, mental tension and even background environments -- to create the feeling of angst players have come to enjoy from the franchise. He said the visual moments in the game that could potentially happen, or that players could envision happening, create the most fear and tension. He is hoping players will get deep into the missions, find out more about the characters and grow more attached to what happens to Isaac.
