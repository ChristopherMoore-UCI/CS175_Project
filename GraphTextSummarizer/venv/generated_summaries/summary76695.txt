The purpose of the Aerial Clicker is to crowdsource the analysis of aerial imagery for disaster response. Who are they -- what sorts of day jobs do they have, etc? Meier: It's hard to say since many don't sign in to volunteer but, anecdotally, a combination of digital humanitarian volunteers and individuals who are interested in wildlife protection, from all ages and walks of life. The effort grows out of Meier's work with Ushahidi and others to help citizens map and analyze data in response to natural disasters, like the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Crowdsourcing the analysis of aerial imagery for wildlife protection is certainly new. It's a worthy issue and, as Meier explained, an important test of a "micro-tasking" platform that could be used to tackle other crises, including disaster response.
