The 17-year-old was arrested after a teacher at Russell County High School found a journal that "contained several plans that looked like potential terrorist attacks, and attacks of violence and danger on the school," Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor said on Saturday. Derek Shrout was in a Russell County court Monday, where District Judge David Johnson set his bond at $75,000, prosecutor Buster Landreau said. Taylor said that school shooting "was potentially the spark that started him writing things down in a plan." But as time went by, he was doing the whole white power thing," David Kelly, the senior class president at Russell County High School, told WTVM. According to CNN affiliates WRBL and WTVM, the teenager pleaded not guilty to attempted assault.
