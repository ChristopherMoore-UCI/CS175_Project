It "aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury," the White House said in a release.

Through perceptual experiments, interactive games and illusions, the show is able to, in a sense, "hack your brain," Silva said. As Silva says on the show: It's as if your attention is a spotlight, and you can only shine it on one thing at a time.
