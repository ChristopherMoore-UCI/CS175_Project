"The message stressed the Syrian government's readiness to participate in the international conference on Syria 'Geneva 2,' highlighting that combating the terrorism that targets citizens is a decisive factor in making any peaceful solution to the crisis a success," SANA reported from the Vatican. In a message to Pope Francis, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said his government is ready to participate in next month's peace talks but noted outside countries must stop supporting what he called terrorist groups in the country's civil war, Syria's state-run news agency said Saturday. "The message also highlighted that stopping terrorism requires having the countries which are involved in supporting the armed terrorist groups stop providing any sort of military, logistic or training support, noting that this support was provided by some of Syria's neighbors and other known countries in the Middle East and abroad," SANA said. The papacy confirmed the communique, saying the Syrian leader's "delegation brought a message from President Assad to the Holy Father and explained the position of the Syrian government," the Vatican's website said. Parolin told Sweid that the pope "is constantly following the situation in Syria" and "Pope Francis affirms the need to solve the crisis in Syria through dialogue among the Syrians without foreign intervention," SANA said.
