The company and Ji entered their pleas before U.S. District Judge George H. King, who set sentencing for December 10. "When he pleaded guilty (Monday), Ji admitted that his company had distributed an unapproved drug containing somatropin -- a human growth hormone product -- which had not been approved for distribution in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration because the version of the drug being distributed by DNP was manufactured in China," the release said. -- A California company and its president pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges related to the distribution of human growth hormone, the Justice Department said. Owner David Ji, 50, of Irvine, pleaded guilty to a felony count of distributing prescription drugs in interstate commerce without a license, it said. In the United States, it is approved for the treatment of short stature due to growth hormone deficiency and a number of other indications.
