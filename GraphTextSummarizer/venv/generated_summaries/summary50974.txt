-- Police in Aruba launched a new search Monday for missing U.S. woman Robyn Gardner, but no body and no new clues were found, Aruban authorities said. Giordano's mother is the beneficiary on his policy, Stein said, and authorities have not said who is the beneficiary on Gardner's policy. Based on his own conversations with Aruban law enforcement officials, Stein described the photos found on Giordano's camera as "explicit." Richard Forester of Maryland, who describes himself as Gardner's boyfriend, brushed aside reports of the pictures Monday and said his focus was squarely on locating Gardner. The area was selected as a result of information authorities gained after interrogating Gary Giordano, and other information, said Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein. A judge ordered last Monday that Giordano could be held until August 31 in connection with Gardner's disappearance.
