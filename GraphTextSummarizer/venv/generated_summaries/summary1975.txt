Direct elections favored A recent opinion survey by the Indonesian Survey Circle showed that 81% of Indonesians prefer direct local elections. "Direct elections are important because it is the fruit of the 32 years of Indonesia's struggle for democracy," student leader Mohamad Ivan Riansa told a small protest in front of the parliament building Wednesday. Under former dictator Suharto's 32-year rule, local leaders were chosen by political parties that won seats in local assemblies. -- Indonesia's parliament voted on Friday to do away with direct local elections in a move that critics say is a huge step backward for the country's fledgling democracy. Titi Anggraini, director of the Association for Elections and Democracy (Perludem), said that many were upset by the law change.
