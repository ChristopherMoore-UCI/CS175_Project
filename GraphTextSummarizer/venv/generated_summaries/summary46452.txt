Earlier this month, Madoff's son Mark Madoff committed suicide in his Manhattan apartment two years to the day after his father was arrested for swindling $50 billion from investors in the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. Annette Bongiorno, 62, turned herself in to the U.S. Marshals Service in Florida on Tuesday after her bail was rejected by a district judge in New York, according to U.S. Marshals Deputy Wayne Pickering. -- A former aide to Bernard Madoff has surrendered to authorities in Florida and will soon appear in New York to face charges related to Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme. She is said to have managed investment accounts for some of Madoff's largest and most important customers, including Carl Shapiro, Stanley Chais and Jeffry Picower, said Madoff's secretary Eleanor Squillari. Bongiorno had been booked at the Palm Beach County jail, but was later transferred into the custody of the marshals, said Palm Beach police spokesman Eric Davis.
