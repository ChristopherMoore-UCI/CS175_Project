" Lennox released her fourth solo album, "Songs of Mass Destruction," in October 2007, including a song that launched a campaign to raise awareness and support South African women affected by the HIV virus and AIDS pandemic. After witnessing the effects of HIV/AIDS on South African women for herself, Lennox says she was moved to help the dire situation. At the invitation of former President Nelson Mandela, she visited South Africa, where HIV prevalence among women ages 15 to 24 years is three times higher than that of men of the same age. The high rate of sexual violence against women in that country is believed to contribute to the growing number of HIV/AIDS cases. By focusing on those issues, the campaign hopes to effectively battle to the high rate of HIV infection among females around the world.
