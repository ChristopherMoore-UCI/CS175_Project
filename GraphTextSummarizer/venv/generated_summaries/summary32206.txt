It may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time, but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the middle of a serious legal stew. It held up motorists trying to make it into Manhattan and caused days of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, where Democratic Mayor Mark Sokolich had not endorsed Christie for re-election. Wildstein, whom Christie appointed to a high position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. Anyone Christie fired may also try to get revenge. Then came Wednesday's revelation that a top Christie aide, Bridget Anne Kelly had e-mailed Wildstein before the closures, telling him, "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."
