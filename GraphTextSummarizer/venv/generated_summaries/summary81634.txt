-- Brothers Thomas and Raymond Kwok, who control Hong Kong's biggest property development company, Sun Hung Kai, have been arrested for suspected corruption, authorities said Thursday. On Thursday morning, Sun Hung Kai Properties suspended trading of its shares. CNN's Andrew Henstock contributed from Hong Kong and Michael Martinez from Los Angeles. Also arrested for suspected corruption was a person described by Hong Kong's Department of Justice as "a former principal official of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," a spokesman for the Independent Commission Against Corruption said. The company has since announced the shares will resume trading when Hong Kong's stock exchange opens Friday morning.
