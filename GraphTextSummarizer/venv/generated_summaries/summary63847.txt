"She is a great Australian." "All I know is that I made a lot of people happy from a lot of backgrounds who call Australia home," was Freeman's assessment of her achievement. "Her victory was one of the great sporting events of our generation," said Australian Prime Minister John Howard. Freeman was already an Australian sporting icon prior to Sydney 2000, having won two gold medals at the 1994 Commonwealth Games (for 200 meters and 400 meters), and back-to-back 400 meters gold medals at the 1997 and 1999 world championships (as well as a 400 meters silver medal at the 1996 Olympics). If her role in the opening ceremony was replete with symbolism, however, it was just a prelude to the events of 10 nights later when, in the most eagerly anticipated contest of the Games, Freeman lined up in lane six of Stadium Australia for the 400 meters final. Freeman celebrates after winning gold in the 400 meters.
