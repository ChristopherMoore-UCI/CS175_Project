Chile's Supreme Court has ruled that former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori can be extradited to Peru on five corruption and two human rights abuse charges. Peru has alleged Fujimori ordered death-squad killings and participated in various acts of government corruption. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has denied all allegations, calling them politically motivated. But the wheels for extradition were set in motion a couple of months ago. A Chilean prosecutor in June recommended that Fujimori be extradited to Peru to face the charges.
