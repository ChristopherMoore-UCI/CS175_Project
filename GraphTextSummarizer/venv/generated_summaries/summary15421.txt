The battle with Samsung began in Northern California in April 2011, with Apple filing a 373-page complaint of patent and trademark infringement. Samsung hit back with its own list of alleged patent infringements by Apple -- backed by its 6,000-strong US telecoms patent portfolio and its claim to have first introduced a smartphone as far back as 1999. Apple's original complaint includes allegations that Samsung infringed on elements of the iPhone's look -- its rectangular shape, rounded corners, silver edges, black face and display of icons. (Financial Times) -- "It's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world," Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, told analysts last month. On Monday, he is due to express those same feelings face-to-face with Choi Gee-Sung, chief executive of Samsung -- the Korean company that Apple alleges is the chief culprit in copying its iPhone and iPad inventions.
