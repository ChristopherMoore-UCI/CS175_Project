The line of Mizzou students stretched from Providence to nearly Champions Drive at its peak. "The Missouri Students Association was also on hand, giving out 'Stand with Sam' buttons to administrators and students. -- When 14 members of the anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church showed up at the University of Missouri Saturday to protest the presence of openly gay football player Michael Sam at an NCAA basketball game against Tennessee, they were in for a bit of a surprise. #StandWithSam Sam showed his gratitude by tweeting to supporters: @MikeSamFootball Thank you for all of my Mizzou family for your support.
