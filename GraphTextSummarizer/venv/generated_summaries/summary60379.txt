-- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is hoping to repay his Chinese fans with a win in Shanghai next weekend -- despite admitting he's "never had much luck" at the Formula One circuit. "As for the race itself, I've never had much luck in Shanghai, apart from my win in 2006," he told reporters in Shanghai. The German, who has struggled since coming back from retirement in 2010, finished eighth in China last year. "A lot of hard work and analysis has taken place back at the factory since our return and I hope to see these efforts pay dividends next Sunday in Shanghai." For many years now, I've had a big and loyal fan base there, and it's still very touching to see the lengths they go to in supporting me.
