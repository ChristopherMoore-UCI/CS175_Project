Photos of opposition leaders labeled "traitors" have been posted in Russian cities, while at an anti-Ukraine rally in Moscow just days before Nemtsov's assassination, Russians loyal to Putin carried signs and placards with pictures of those "traitors," including Nemtsov. Russian police moved with surprising speed to arrest five suspects, all of them Chechens, in the killing of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov. Some of Nemtsov's supporters claim he had become a bigger threat to the Kremlin, pointing to information he was allegedly uncovering on Russia's military role in Ukraine that could undermine the Kremlin's claims that its forces fighting in Ukraine have been just "volunteers." Some Russian politicians and media personalities close to the Kremlin charge that Putin's foes in the West orchestrated the killing to damage the Russian President's image and ignite a civil war in Russia. Now, with Nemtsov's killing, Russian officials and Kremlin-friendly media have whipped up a sandstorm of theories, confounding the most intrepid attempts at establishing the truth.
