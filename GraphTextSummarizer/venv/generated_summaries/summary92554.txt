Norway's Alexander Dale Oen won gold in the 100m breaststroke in an emotional day of medal winning at the FINA World Championships in Shanghai. That was probably the hardest medal in my life; I knew I was going to race against the world's best, and to be able to compete after what I have been through this last month is really a blessing," Cielo told FINA's official web site. "It's a very special medal after what happened in my country in the last days," he told FINA's official web site after his victory. As Cielo wept during the medal ceremony, other swimmers made pointed gestures, unhappy at his appearance. Medals are important but I cannot imagine my life without the environment of swimming."
