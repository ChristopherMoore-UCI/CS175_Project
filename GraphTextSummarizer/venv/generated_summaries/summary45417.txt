A Bristol County, Massachusetts, grand jury indicted former NFL player Aaron Hernandez on a first-degree murder charge and five weapons charges Thursday. Hernandez appeared in court Thursday afternoon to hear the court announce the indictment. The indictment circumvented the need for the scheduled probable cause hearing that was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Hernandez and two other men allegedly picked Lloyd up on the morning of June 17; his body was found later that day in an industrial park near Hernandez's home. The grand jury has also indicted Tanya Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, for contempt of court.
