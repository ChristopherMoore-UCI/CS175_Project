What you can do Parents play a big role in their children's success at school, Vaandering says, whether it's in math class or gym class. In health class at Dwight-Englewood, students are offered the opportunity to use apps like Calm.com, which provides a soothing screen and sounds in timed blocks to calm the mind. PE teachers have struggled to fight the effects of childhood obesity in class, says Vaandering; many children's motor skills are not where they should be and cardiovascular endurance is a big problem. Many schools provide pedometers and heart rate monitors for students, Vaandering says. An overemphasis on standardized tests and budget cuts has removed important stress outlets such as art class and PE in some schools, she says.
