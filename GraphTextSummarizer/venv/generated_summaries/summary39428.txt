Flights from Phuket International Airport were canceled following the crash and remained closed on Monday. Sunday's crash left 88 people dead and investigators trying to determine just what caused the smash at the airport at Phuket in southern Thailand. -- Experts investigating the Thai plane crash have recovered the plane's flight data recorders, officials said Monday as survivors of the disaster recalled how their holiday jet careered off the runway and was engulfed in fire. "At this time, the death toll is at 88, and salvaging of the plane is still going on and we expect that this will finish today," said Thai Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont. Phuket International Airport is the second-busiest airport in Thailand, according to the airport's Web site.
