A San Diego County judge set Maraglino's bail at $3 million on Tuesday and scheduled a May 22 hearing on readiness and a preliminary hearing for May 30, Walker said. Cory Killgore, was last seen alive April 13, and authorities found her body on April 17 in a rural part of Riverside County. Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, pleaded not guilty in court Tuesday, said Steve Walker, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. -- A third person was charged with murder Tuesday in the California death of a deployed Marine's wife, the San Diego County prosecutor's office said. She was found at a Ramada motel near the San Diego airport last month after paramedics responded to a call for medical help.
