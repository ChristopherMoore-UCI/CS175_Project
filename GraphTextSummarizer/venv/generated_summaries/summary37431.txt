"Building on strengths and accomplishments over the past years, Canada is committed to helping build a more secure, stable and self-sufficient Afghanistan that is no longer a safe haven for terrorists," said Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon. "The future of Afghanistan resides in the hands of women, children and youth," said International Cooperation Minister Beverley Oda. The post-2011 non-combat training mission will further contribute to the goal of preparing Afghans to assume responsibility for their own security," said National Defence Minister Peter MacKay. After next year and until March 2014, Canadian troops will continue training Afghan security forces and will provide up to 950 military trainers and support personnel. "As we continue to work alongside the Afghan people and the international community, Canada will continue to play an important role in supporting efforts toward a better future for all Afghans." Based in the Kandahar area, Canadian forces have been one of the major troop contributors to NATO's International Security Assistance Force.
