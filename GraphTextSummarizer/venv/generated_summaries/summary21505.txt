It's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel," said Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, head of Hasan's legal team. Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed "that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible," said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case. Lunsford, a health care specialist, described how his friend and colleague, physician's assistant Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. As Lunsford was checking behind him, "Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me," he said. "This is nothing more than their disagreement with Major Hasan's strategy in conducting his defense," said the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, rejecting a motion by the standby counsel who are tasked with assisting Hasan as he represents himself.
