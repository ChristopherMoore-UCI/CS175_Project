North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei expressed regret at North Korea's decision to launch despite the concerns of the international community. " North Korea shouts 'look at me' with rocket Its reaction to North Korea's move and how it responds to any U.N. Security Council initiatives will be key. " In a commentary published by state news agency Xinhua earlier in the day, Beijing said there was a "dangerous lack of trust" between North Korea and Japan, South Korea and the United States. Why did North Korea launch a rocket? "From China's perspective it has very little interest or need to come down very hard on North Korea until the U.S, Japan and South Korea make it clear to China that allowing North Korea to do this is going to be more costly than cracking down on them," said Dean Cheng, research fellow in Chinese Political and Security Affairs at the Heritage Foundation. North Korea claims the rocket tests will enable it to launch a satellite but many nations consider the launches a cover for testing ballistic missiles.
