But in the wake of that report, Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd says, all phone calls and mail from international terrorist inmates are now screened. A Justice Department spokesman said that after a thorough review, the special administrative measures that Reid had been under were not renewed in June, on the recommendation of three agencies: the FBI, the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's office and the Justice Department's Counterterrorism Section. "If a terrorist can communicate with his family, with other associates -- even with monitoring -- he could use codes; he could be directing other terrorist acts," said former New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who is now a security consultant. But limiting letters to family members does not prevent wider dissemination, says Clark Kent Ervin, former inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to Reid, Supermax houses some of the most notorious convicted terrorists, including 1993 World Trade Center bombing mastermind Ramzi Yousef, September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, "dirty bomb" plotter Jose Padilla and "millennium bomb" plotter Ahmed Ressam.
