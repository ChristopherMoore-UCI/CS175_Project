"Part of our curiosity is a way of learning what makes the great great in our own search for knowledge, fame and fortune," author Sheila Kohler wrote in a blog post about our fascination with celebrities for Psychology Today. The response to Bey-gate deviated from the cries of women's empowerment that followed a recently released image of supermodel Cindy Crawford from a 2013 photo shoot for Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America. While "Stars, they're just like us!" may be a popular franchise for tabloids that also love to post features on celebs without makeup, it would appear that the famous are not allowed to actually be regular people. After all, regular people aren't as admired as celebs. The picture shows Crawford sporting imperfections, including cellulite.
