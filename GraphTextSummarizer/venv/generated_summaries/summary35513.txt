The federal suit filed by Hendron and others accuses pension plan administrators of, among other things, causing the plan to include "unreasonable and excessive" fees and expenses, paid by participants, without their knowledge and not used for their benefit or that of the plan. He opened fire at about 6:30 a.m. (7:30 a.m. ET) Thursday at ABB Inc., a St. Louis transformer manufacturing company, police said. "We have to go back and try and figure out what motivated him and like I said, we may never truly know what motivated him to do this." Sack said police are looking into Hendron's work history and his personal relationships. Hendron was one of a group of ABB employees listed in a lawsuit filed in 2006 against administrators of the company's retirement plan. When they entered the facility, Sack said, police found "a gruesome scene" -- the dead and wounded and those employees desperately hiding from the shooter.
