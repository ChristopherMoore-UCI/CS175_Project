And it was Pakistan who dominated proceedings in Dubai as Ajmal claimed a seven-wicket haul for the first time in his career, accounting for captain Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell in the space of ten deliveries. Former captain Salman Butt and fast bowlers Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif were found guilty of deliberately bowling no-balls in a Test match at London's Lord's stadium and all three are currently serving custodial sentences. -- Spinner Saeed Ajmal tore through England's batting line up as Pakistan took control of the first Test in Dubai, in the first clash between the two countries since the spot-fixing scandal of 2010. Both sides insisted in the lead up to their series, played in the United Arab Emirates due to the ongoing ban on Pakistan playing matches in their home country, that they were keen to move on from the incidents. Only wicketkeeper Matt Prior looked comfortable at the crease as he compiled a diligent 70 not out, with Eoin Morgan contributing 24 and Graeme Swann 34.
