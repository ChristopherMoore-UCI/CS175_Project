" Finkbeiner offered the students, who rarely see trees in the concrete jungle of Manhattan, some suggestions on planting trees. At the U.N. earlier this month, Finkbeiner had one item on his agenda: taking adults to task for their lack of action on planting trees. Jonathan Mejia, a student who attended the presentation, left feeling inspired to "go out with a couple of my friends to a park and plant a lot of trees in a common area that everyone goes, like maybe Central Park." Twitter and Facebook could be used to spread the word on tree events, Finkbeiner told the curious group of youngsters. But Finkbeiner believes this tree crusade can only be successful if it is led by children.
