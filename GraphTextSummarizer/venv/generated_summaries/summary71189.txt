Anti-government activists say the government is putting hired thugs and plainclothes police on the street to break up protests, but pro-government demonstrators have told CNN they are there of their own volition and are not being paid. By the time CNN arrived, there were about 100 anti-government protesters and 300 to 400 supporters of the government near the intersection of Rabat Street and Fitteen Street. And in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, at least 20 people were injured in clashes between stone-throwing pro- and anti-government demonstrators, opposition lawmaker Ahmed Hashid told CNN. " Human rights activists accused pro-government demonstrators of beating students after a similar protest in Sanaa Wednesday. More students showed up, both Al-Nihmi and Al-Janadi said, and the protesters began chanting anti-government slogans such as "The people want the fall of the regime" and "Oh Ali, son of Saleh, your regime is no good."
