But after news emerged of the expensive hunting trip, with widespread Spanish media reports that it included the hunting of elephants, even normally-staunch political allies of the monarch said publicly that they considered the timing of the trip a mistake. The criticism of the trip initially focused on the expensive safari in the midst of the nation's deep crisis, with 23% unemployment, 5 million Spaniards out of work, and the government applying austerity cuts and tax increases to make up for budget shortfalls. The African trip caused an outcry in Spain and abroad for its expense during the nation's economic crisis and for including the hunting of elephants. Animal rights activists also voiced criticism, as reports emerged that the king was hunting elephants. He underwent hip replacement surgery earlier this month after falling while on a controversial private hunting trip in Botswana.
