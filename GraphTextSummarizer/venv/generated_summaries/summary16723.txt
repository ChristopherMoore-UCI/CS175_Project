According to reports in Chinese state media, Broad Group, the developers for Sky City, have so far failed to get the proper permits required to proceed with construction. He added that plans will be announced at an as-yet unscheduled future press conference, leaving construction plans for Sky City firmly frozen on the ground. "We have not yet started work on Changsha's Sky City," a Broad Group press officer told CNN. Critics -- including architectural experts and the Chinese public -- worry about safety because of the use of non-traditional building techniques and the pace of construction. However when questioned by CNN, the company's press officer hesitated to provide a start date for construction.
