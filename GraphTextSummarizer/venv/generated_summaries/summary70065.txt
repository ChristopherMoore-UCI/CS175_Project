-- President Barack Obama held a town hall meeting Saturday with a group of young people in the Soweto section of Johannesburg, with video links to similar groups in other cities in Africa. A bright view of Africa's future Africa's role in the world economy as a provider of raw materials to other parts of the world dates back to colonial days and must be changed, Obama said. "The number of people killed by terrorist attacks in Africa or South Asia far outstrips deaths by Westerners," he said. " Obama meets with Mandela's family in South Africa "Though they may not have the same transnational capacity that some of the earlier organizations did, they're doing great harm in Africa and in the Middle East and in South Asia."
