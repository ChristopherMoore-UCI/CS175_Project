Balfour is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and the singer's brother, Jason Hudson, 29, in their Chicago home in October 2008. Bagby said in her closing argument that Balfour had threatened to kill the family of Julia Hudson, Jennifer Hudson's sister. In her closing argument, Bagby said Balfour shot Hudson's mother as she tried to defend herself with a broom. William Balfour, Hudson's former brother-in-law, faces charges of first-degree murder, home invasion, residential burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. "None of us wanted her to marry him," Hudson said of her sister's decision to marry Balfour.
