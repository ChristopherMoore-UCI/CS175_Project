"I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autism spectrum disorders. The debate over whether autism spectrum disorders are caused by vaccines started when researcher Andrew Wakefield published a now-retracted study in The Lancet in 1998 that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. In fact, several subsequent studies trying to reproduce the results have found no link between vaccines and autism, including several reviews by the Institute of Medicine. While the cause of autism is not known, several studies indicate it starts in utero, long before a child is given the MMR or any other vaccinations. CDC researchers are standing by their original findings: that there is no link between autism and vaccination schedules.
