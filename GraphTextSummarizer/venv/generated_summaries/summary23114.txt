"The ITF respects the decision of the CAS tribunal, who agreed that an anti-doping rule violation has been committed," Ricci Bitti said in a statement sent to CNN. "I can't even describe how happy Marin was when he found out the news," Cilic's manager Vincent Stavaux told CNN. Cilic will be allowed to compete at next week's Paris Masters after his suspension was cut from nine months by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which has final say on the case. Cilic appealed to CAS as he wanted his penalty wiped out completely while the International Tennis Federation (ITF) sought a longer suspension than the one handed out by its independent tribunal. Stavaux also took exception to the ITF's anti-doping tribunal claiming in September that Cilic withdrew from a match at Wimbledon in June to "avoid adverse publicity" after he tested positive.
