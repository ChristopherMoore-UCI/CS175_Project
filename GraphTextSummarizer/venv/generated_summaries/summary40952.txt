But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. The State Department decided in January not to renew Blackwater/Xe's contract when it expires in May. That followed a refusal by the Iraqi government to renew the firm's operating license because of a September 2007 shooting incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired upon and killed 17 Iraqi civilians. Triple Canopy already has a State Department contract in Iraq. DynCorp International also has a State Department contract for work in Iraq. Starting January 1, the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain Iraqi licenses to operate.
