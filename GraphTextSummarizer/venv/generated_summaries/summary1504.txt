Bangkok residents waded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods, but in central Bangkok, it had been mostly dry. -- Severe flooding in Thailand on Saturday threatened central areas of Bangkok, a bustling capital barely above sea level and facing inundation at the next high tide predicted at 13 feet. "Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded," said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. The United States has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two U.S. helicopters are helping the Thai military determine the extent of the flooding.
