-- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom and his wife, Sandra Torres de Colom, have filed for divorce in an attempt to clear the way for the first lady to run for the presidency, Guatemalan Judge Mildred Roca told CNN. In a statement, the party confirmed the pending divorce, stating that the goal was "to avoid further political manipulations from the opposition." "They were in a situation that was difficult, but for the good of the nation," said Jaime Martinez, general secretary of the Grand National Alliance party, which is allied with UNE. Torres claimed that under Guatemala's civil code, marriage does not constitute a relation that is banned under the constitution, and she said that her candidacy was legitimate even without divorce. Torres and Colom belong to the National Unity of Hope, or UNE, party. The couple filed for divorce on March 11, the family court judge said.
