Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of Susan Jordan, who was walking to Arlington High School in Riverside, California, when Brown pulled her into an orange grove, according to court documents. California's last execution was on January 17, 2006, when Clarence Ray Allen was put to death for three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances. He could also become the first inmate to be put to death in California's new lethal injection chamber. If the execution proceeds as scheduled on Wednesday, Albert Greenwood Brown could become the first person to be executed in California since 2006, when legal challenges arose and prompted the state to revise its lethal injection procedure. Brown also refused to choose between a one-drug lethal injection or a three-drug cocktail, CNN affiliate KTVU said.
