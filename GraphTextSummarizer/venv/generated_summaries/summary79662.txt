Displaying fluid corridors, curvaceous walls, and a radical structure, the Innovation Tower is also the first building from renowned Iraqi-born British architect Zaha Hadid to be built in Hong Kong. Although it is affiliated with the Hong Kong Jockey Club, it has nothing to do with horse racing and everything to do with design. In the thick of Hong Kong's concrete jungle, surrounded by dense residential spaces and a web of roaring highways lies the Jockey Club Innovation Tower at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. It's not only (for) our students and our teachers in the building," said Professor Timothy Tong, President, Hong Kong Polytechnic University "The school has a long history but it used to be blended into the campus, it was quite sort of hidden," said Simon Yu, an architect at Zaha Hadid Architects.
