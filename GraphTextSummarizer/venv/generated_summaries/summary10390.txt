More: 12 of the world's most spectacular Christmas trees Five generations of parol makers When visiting the San Fernando barangay (village) of Santa Lucia, the "home of giant lanterns," it's not unusual to behold a parol behemoth under construction right on the curb no matter what time of year. San Fernando parols, in comparison, now recall psychedelic kaleidoscopes, brilliant stained glass windows, prismatic pinwheels, oversized snowflakes or batik textiles. " In the late 1950s, parols in San Fernando began transcending the classic five-pointed, stellate design of bamboo and papel de Japon (Japanese rice paper) favored by inmates and students today for their Christmas projects.

Arnel Cayanan, 30, says he earns around 15,000 pesos ($340) a night from selling parols by the road in San Fernando.
