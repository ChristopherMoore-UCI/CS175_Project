"Nicky also alleges that for several more years, Ms. Whitman continued to receive the letters from the Social Security Administration Office regarding the mismatch in the Social Security numbers," Allred said. The campaign included a copy of a Social Security card and California driver's license it said Santillan had given Whitman. Nicky Diaz Santillan, who worked for Whitman for nine years, was fired in June 2009 "for what appeared to be political reasons involving Ms. Whitman's decision to run for governor," famed attorney Gloria Allred claimed in a news conference. "But all of the documentation that we had said that she was legal." Allred alleged that Whitman should have known Santillan was an undocumented worker, because several letters, dating back to 2002, were sent to her about the maid's "mismatched" Social Security number. " "Ms. Whitman just laughed," Santillan said.
