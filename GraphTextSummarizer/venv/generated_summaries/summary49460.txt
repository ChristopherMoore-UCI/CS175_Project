PSG, who were to prove David Beckham's final club, won the French title last season under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti. Since being promoted to the French top flight at the end of last season, Monaco have invested heavily in players, most notably Colombian striker Radamel Falcoa. Striker Cavani, nicknamed "El Matador" for his flamboyant style on the pitch, joins PSG from Napoli, where he was Serie A top scorer last season with 29 goals. His signing underlines PSG's determination to match the spending of Ligue 1 rivals Monaco, who have been taken over by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. " Cavani, who helped Uruguay to Copa America glory in 2011, has long been a target for a host of Europe's leading clubs and with 38 goals in just 43 matches for Napoli in all competitions last season his price tag rose.
