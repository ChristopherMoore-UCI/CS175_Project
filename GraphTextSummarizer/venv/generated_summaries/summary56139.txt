Real's coffers have swelled thanks, in part, to a kit deal with German sports brand Adidas, worth $42 million per year, and a $39 million five-year sponsorship agreement with airline Emirates. Major League Baseball's New York Yankees are fourth on the list, valued at $2.3 billion, while NFL teams the Cowboys and the New England Patriots are fifth and sixth worth $2.1 billion and $1.64 billion respectively. Los Blancos' revenue of $650 million is the highest in sport, while the Spanish team's income of $134 million is second only to that of National Football League (NFL) franchise the Dallas Cowboys. The nine-time European champions have risen to the top of the list, overtaking English Premier League team Manchester United, with the U.S. business magazine valuing Real at $3.3 billion. The remaining six spaces in the top 10 are taken by U.S. sports franchises.
