It was a goal which had seldom looked like coming given Bayern's profligacy in front of goal and the inspired performance of Joe Hart, the Manchester City goalkeeper. But there was still one more twist in the tale and when City failed to clear Philipp Lahm's cross, Boateng struck a powerful effort which took the faintest of deflections off Gotze's back and flew past Hart. Jerome Boateng, the man who once wore the blue of Manchester City, struck an 89th minute winner as Bayern Munich claimed a dramatic 1-0 victory in its opening game of the European Champions League. But Bayern survived and only another wonderful save by Hart prevented Boateng's rasping effort from nestling in the far corner. On this occasion, it was indebted to its goalkeeper, Joe Hart, who produced a series of outstanding saves to keep Bayern on bay.
