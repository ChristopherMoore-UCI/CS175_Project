President Barack Obama dismissed criticism he doesn't spend enough time developing relationships with Washington deal-makers who can help push his agenda forward. Romney gets more personal In the interview, which will air as part of the documentary "Obama Revealed: The Man, The President," Obama suggested he is willing to build those relationships, but often turns down social engagements because he prioritizes time at home with his children. "Whereas President Obama is basically with his family during those hours, which is sort of a balanced thing to do but not necessarily good for a president." David Maraniss, who penned biographies of former President Bill Clinton and Obama, said the current president "is not going to become this great transactional politician," like Clinton. "Sometimes on the weekends, we may turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we're trying to carve out family time," Obama said.
