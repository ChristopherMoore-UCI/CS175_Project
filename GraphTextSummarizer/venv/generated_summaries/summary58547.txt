"The benefits out of the exploitation of the wealth of energy is going to the interest of all the people of Cyprus whether they are Greek or Turkish Cypriots," Anastasiades told CNN. With such a potentially valuable asset, Anastasiades believes it is important to take heed of the experiences of other countries with large energy reserves and for Cyprus not to be caught out by the resource curse. According to the Republic of Cyprus' president Nicos Anastasiades, this rich supply of energy could help unite the island. But for Cyprus, still bitterly divided between a Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north, the rewards could be more than just financial. He points out that Turkey has been "violating (Cyprus's) economic zone" in recent years as they attempt to influence relations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
