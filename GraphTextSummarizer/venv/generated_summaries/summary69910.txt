"This is an indication that viruses pathogenic for human or animals might also be preserved in old permafrost layers, including some that have caused planet-wide epidemics in the past," said Jean-Michel Claverie, one of the study's co-authors. Giant viruses contain far more genes than common viruses. Pithovirus has about 500 genes, dwarfing viruses like those that cause AIDS or influenza, which contain about 10 genes, according to Claverie. While this ancient virus is harmless to people, the scientists behind the discovery warn that the discovery suggests that the thawing of permafrost in polar regions, as a result of either climate change or mining, could bring threats to human health. Far more genes Scientists were previously aware of two distinct families of giant viruses, Megaviridae and Pandoraviridae.
