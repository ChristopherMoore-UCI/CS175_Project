-- On June 17, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson explained to The New York Times reporter James "Scotty" Reston why he had to stay the course in Vietnam by stabilizing the South Vietnamese government so that it could fight communism. In 1964, Johnson heard from voices ranging from Idaho liberal Frank Church to Georgia hawk Richard Russell that Vietnam was not critical to fighting communism and that the war was unwinnable. In an era when American schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war, this warning about Vietnam also made the war seem essential. With Vietnam, proponents warned that the fall of Southeast Asia to communism would vastly strengthen the Soviet Union and China. The second is that in Vietnam the U.S. faced a "broad-based popular insurgency" whereas today, according to most polls, a large number of Afghans support foreign assistance.
