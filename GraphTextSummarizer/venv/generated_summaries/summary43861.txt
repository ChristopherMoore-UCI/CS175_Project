There was immediate opposition from some pilots and flight attendants to the decision last week by Transportation Security Administration Administrator John Pistole. In response to concerns from Federal Air Marshal Service leadership, Pistole continued excluding small knives that most closely resemble weapons, specifically those with blades that lock in place or have molded hand grips. Flight attendants: Decision doesn't make sense Castelveter said the new rule is consistent with Pistole's embrace of Risk-Based Security. Experts believe hardened cockpit doors and engaged passengers minimize chances that hijackers using small knives would be successful. But Pistole is resolute that the move is correct, that U.S. aviation security has improved since the 2001 al Qaeda hijack attacks on the United States to the point that the likelihood of a similar plot succeeding against a commercial airliner is remote.
