The late Robert F. Kennedy was the younger brother of slain President John F. Kennedy and a former U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator. Kennedy -- a Fox News contributor -- was trying to take his newborn son for a walk "to get fresh air" outside Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, when two nurses intervened to prevent him from leaving, they said. Kennedy, who was accompanied by a hospital doctor, allegedly twisted the arm of one nurse to move her away from a door and kicked another after she approached him on January 7, according to Elliot Taub, the attorney for both nurses. "The nurses were the only aggressors," Haydock said in a statement delivered by Kennedy's attorney. Kennedy denied those allegations, saying "the nurse had no right to grab our child out of his father's arms." His attorney, Robert Gottlieb, said his client was "calm and considerate" and only became aggressive when the two nurses tried to take the baby.
