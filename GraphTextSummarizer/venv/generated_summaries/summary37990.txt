Despite Williams pulling out of the event, the Rexall Centre tournament still boasts a top-level field including world number one Caroline Wozniacki, the number two ranked Kim Clijsters and Venus' sister Serena. The American was due to face Serb Ana Ivanovic in a first round clash on Tuesday, but will now be replaced in the draw by Chinese qualifier Zhang Shuai. "I was really excited to play Toronto," world number 34 Williams told the tournament's official web site. Elsewhere, Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska upset the odds to beat top seed Vera Zvonareva in the final of the WTA tournament in Carlsbad, California. The extra berth created by the 31-year-old Williams' withdrawal has been given to Spain's Lourdes Dominguez Lino.
