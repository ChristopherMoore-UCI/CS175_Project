SEACOM is the first cable supplying east Africa, which until now has been reliant on satellite connections. Hodge pointed out people in South Africa have already benefited. Seacom cable in the Red Sea James Hodge, who specializes in competition and regulation, says initially SEACOM will predominantly benefit those already connected. Strong competition within the cable itself should drive prices down and avoid any price collusion among the various providers, Hodge said. Service providers have reacted to the imminent arrival of the SEACOM cable by adjusting their prices, and more cuts are seen, as the local providers respond to the increased competition, he said.
