"When somebody says 'ambush,' you see a character in a movie and you expect a guy to trip over a line or somebody pop up from a garbage can or somebody has the high ground and shoots on them," said Steve Weiss, research director for the Officer Down Memorial Page, whose website tracks slain U.S. law officers. The group says that as of Friday, the total number of law enforcement fatalities is up 29% over the same period last year, and the number of gunfire-related fatalities of law officers is up 36%, Weiss said. Associate of suspected Colorado killer arrested Weiss' group doesn't specifically count ambush deaths of officers, but a search of its records with the word "ambush" shows that 14 law officers died in such a manner in the past 12 months -- a figure almost matching the FBI's recent data trends. " But the overall yearly number of killed officers nationwide is much lower than the 1970s -- an era when violence on police was remarkably high, according to Weiss and Fuentes. " The recent yearly trend of 15 ambush deaths of officers is haunting, Weiss said.
