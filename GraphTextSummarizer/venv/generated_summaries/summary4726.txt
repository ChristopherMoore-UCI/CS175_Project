"We are asked to decide only if a genuine fact issue exists as to whether Dr. Knight engaged in unlawful gender discrimination when he fired Nelson at the request of his wife. "As we have indicated above, the issue before us is not whether a jury could find that Dr. Knight treated Nelson badly," read the high court's decision. During the last six months of Nelson's employment, Nelson and Knight, both married with children, started sending text messages to each other outside of work. Toward the end of her employment, Knight complained to Nelson her clothing was tight and "distracting," the decision read. At one point, Knight told Nelson that "if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing," the decision read.
