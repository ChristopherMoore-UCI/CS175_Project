"It was certainly a design which Giger prized, much as he took great pride in his collaboration with myriads of music industry and film artists, since he began his glorious journey as a world-class painter, sculptor and designer," read the statement. Among the other participants in "Dune" was one of Giger's heroes, the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali. Giger was married twice; he is survived by his wife, Carmen Maria Scheifele Giger. Encouraged by "Alien" screenwriter Dan O'Bannon, Scott turned to Giger after seeing similar creatures in the artist's 1977 book, "Necronomicon." In the late '60s, a friend published a number of Giger's works as posters.
