Kristen LaBrie, 38, also was ordered to serve five years on probation and to complete an anger management program, said Essex County district attorney spokesman Steve O'Connell. Fraser, an autistic child who at age 6 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was recuperating and his cancer was in remission. Prosecutors argued during LaBrie's trial that she intentionally withheld medications and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy, from her son, Jeremy Fraser. Prosecutors argued that LaBrie's negligence was a factor that contributed to her son's death, allowing the cancer to spread after it had been beaten back into remission. She was sentenced to probation for convictions of child endangerment and assault and battery.
