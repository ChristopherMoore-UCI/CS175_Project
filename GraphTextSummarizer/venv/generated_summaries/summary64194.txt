" Former U.S. Open champions Jim Furyk and Graeme McDowell were tied for the lead coming into play Sunday. -- American golfer Webb Simpson made a furious charge Sunday to win the U.S. Open, grabbing his fist major tournament victory. But his play faded and on Sunday the 14-time major champion ended the tournament in a tie for 21st place, dropping four shots in the first three holes of his final round as he eventually signed for a 73. Simpson shot two-under-par 68 Sunday to end the tournament at one-over 281 for the four rounds. Tiger Woods continued his fall Sunday as he failed in his bid for his fourth U.S. Open title and his first major since winning at Torrey Pines in 2008.
