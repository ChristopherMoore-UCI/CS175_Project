Gov. Robert Bentley wrote a letter to the consul general of India in Atlanta, Ajit Kumar, offering an apology to the government of India for the "tragic incident." Bentley was referring to an encounter where a Madison County, Alabama, police officer forced a 59-year-old man to the ground, causing partial paralysis. On Tuesday, the officer, Eric Parker, entered a plea of not guilty in court. Patel, who is helping take care of his developmentally delayed 17-month-old grandson, speaks little English. CNN reached out to Parker's attorney, Robert Tuten, for comment, but didn't get an immediate response.
