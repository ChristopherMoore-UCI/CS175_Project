-- A free speech dispute over a California law banning the sale of violent video games to children is set to be heard in the U.S. Supreme Court this week. As defined by California, such interactive games are those in which the player is given the choice of "killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being" in offensive ways. A high court ruling allowing greater government control over the evaluation of expressive content could be applied to other media. The Supreme Court in recent years has thwarted repeated congressional attempts to protect children from pornography, saying such legislation went too far in limiting adult access to lawful but explicit sexual content on the internet. Video game makers have said the ban goes too far against their free speech rights, and the existing industry-imposed, nationwide voluntary ratings system is an adequate screen for parents to judge the appropriateness of computer games.
