-- Five militants were killed in the volatile eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk on Monday after they took part in a large coordinated assault on a border guard base, an official at the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service told CNN. The attacks in Luhansk began early Monday when least 100 militants tried to storm the border unit on the southern edge of the city, said Oleg Slobodyan, the spokesman for the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service. He said border guards were refraining from returning fire because they didn't want to cause civilian casualties. Fighters observed a roughly 20-minute truce in the afternoon for the removal of injured militants and border guards, the border service's website said. Ukraine's military sent air support for the border guards Monday, but residents' proximity to the guards' base "limits the full-scale use of the military aviation," said Vladislav Selezhnev, a spokesman for the Ukrainian government's Anti-Terrorist Operation.
