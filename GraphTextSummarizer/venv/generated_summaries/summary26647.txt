Last week, the group demanded $200 million from Japan in exchange for Goto and fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor. ISIS has shown its willingness to kill hostages before, the first being American journalist James Foley last summer and the latest being Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor from Japan reportedly killed last week. The 47-year-old Goto left Japan last fall, when his youngest of two daughters was a mere 3 weeks old. If they didn't, according to the message, Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh would be killed, followed soon thereafter by Kenji Goto of Japan. If Jordan gets such proof and releases al-Rishawi, it is not clear whether that would mean Goto also goes free.
