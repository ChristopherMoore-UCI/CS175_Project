The showdown between the Vatican and America's largest group of Catholic nuns is expected to peak this week when group leaders will meet to determine a response to the Vatican's reprimand for the group's "radical feminist themes." Nuns in various orders around the United States have been conversing about the Vatican report, and their reactions have been "surprised, stunned, shocked," Campbell said. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is providing support to Sartain, and the LCWR isn't expected to publicly address the Vatican report until after this week's meeting, said Mary Ann Walsh, spokeswoman for the bishops' conference. Others such as CNN's senior Vatican analyst John Allen said the Vatican report has basically decreed that the LCWR "needs an overhaul in which it will have a tighter relationship with the bishops. For Campbell, the Vatican report doesn't pose a crisis of conscience.
