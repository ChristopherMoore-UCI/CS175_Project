All three victims, including Knight, who suffered several gunshot wounds, are expected to survive, a sheriff's spokesman said Sunday. Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding Death Row Records in 1991 and signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Detectives have video that shows a man shooting former rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight and two other people in a West Hollywood nightclub early Sunday, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. He was shot in the leg at a party hosted by rapper Kanye West at a Miami hotel on the eve of the 2005 VMA show.
