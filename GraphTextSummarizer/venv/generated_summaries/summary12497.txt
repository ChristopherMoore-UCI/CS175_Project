Quite rightly, Jobs' array of gadgets and how they made us think differently about technology have been the focus of the avalanche of tributes to him. In fact, technology continued to be the nerdiest of interests -- until Jobs made technology actually cool and hip forever. Steve Jobs saw around corners, over the horizon and into the future, changing forever our daily lives through technology. But it's hard to imagine anyone but Jobs connecting cutting-edge technology so effectively to what people want to do in their daily lives. In most people's minds, technology was the realm of "nerds" and "geeks."
