"It was tough, it was hard work down the last," said Luiten Four members of McGinley's 12-strong team were in action in Wales with Ryder Cup debutant Jamie Donaldson the best placed. -- Europe's Ryder Cup selections endured largely disappointing finishes to the final build-up tournament before the biennial clash gets underway later this week as Dutchman Joost Luiten won the Wales Open Sunday. Meanwhile, world number one Rory McIlroy said he was looking forward to capping his remarkable year with a third Ryder Cup triumph. Luiten overcame a poor start to his round at Celtic Manor, venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup, to finish on 14-under after a level par 71. Luiten had to battle to salvage a par-five on the 18th to hold off England's Tommy Fleetwood and Ireland's Shane Lowry at Celtic Manor.
