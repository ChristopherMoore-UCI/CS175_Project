Ponting made just eight runs as Australia suffered a crushing defeat by South Africa in the third and final Test in Perth at the venue where he made his debut in the five-day format 17 years ago. "His contribution to the international game has been immense and quite rightly he will be remembered as one of the true legends of the sport," Richardson said of Ponting, who ranks behind only Don Bradman in Australia's list of batting greats and is the only player to have won the ICC's cricketer of the year award twice in a row. Ponting took over from Waugh as Australia's Test captain in 2004, two years after he claimed the role in the one-day team. However, Australia's dominance gradually waned and the writing was on the wall for Ponting when he lost an Ashes series to old rivals England for the third time in 2010-11 on home soil. "I have put a lot of pressure on myself to perform, it has always been about big games and big series for me," he told reporters on Monday.
