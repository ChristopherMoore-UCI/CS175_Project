But here, instead of teaching that other religious communities have only partial access to the truth about God, the synod claimed that nontraditional families only partially reflect God's intentions for human relationships. The final version, which received mixed support from synod participants, was less welcoming still: "There does not exist any basis to establish even remote analogies between homosexual unions and the plan of God for marriage and the family." Both the synod's initial draft and final document acknowledged the blessings that can be found in different forms of family life (although the final draft explicitly limited itself to talking about "a stable and true relationship between a man and a woman"). In thinking about families whose lives fall outside the church's norms, the synod's initial document took its cues from a theological model first developed at Vatican II, a model that at first had to do with interreligious dialogue. For instance, the draft stated unequivocally that same-sex relationships "cannot be considered on the same footing" as opposite-sex marriage, and it prefaced its praise for the sacrificial love of same-sex couples with the caveat that it was not "denying the moral problems connected to homosexual unions."
