The landmark decision Monday by New Mexico Second Judicial District Judge Nan Nash came after a two-day trial and could make New Mexico the fifth state to allow doctors to prescribe fatal prescriptions to terminal patients. The ACLU and Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life choice advocacy group, filed the lawsuit on behalf of two New Mexico doctors and cancer patient Aja Riggs. But Riggs, the 50-year-old terminally ill cancer patient named in the New Mexico lawsuit, says she's glad she now has a choice. In a decision sure to cause debate, a New Mexico judge has ruled that terminally ill, mentally competent patients have the right to get a doctor to end their lives. "I am really pleased that the court has recognized that terminally ill patients should have more choice in the manner of their death," said Riggs.
