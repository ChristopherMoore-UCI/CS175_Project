Armstrong was rushed to a hospital in Italy earlier this month "due to illness," Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt said then in a video posted on the band's website. "We would like everyone to know that our set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those we offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas," the band said. -- Green Day's lead singer is seeking treatment for substance abuse, the rock band announced Sunday, two days after the performer's expletive-laden meltdown during a show in Las Vegas. "You've got to be ... kidding me," said Armstrong, noting his longevity on the music scene and disparaging teen pop sensation Justin Bieber, who was not among the festival performers. The band said on its website that Billie Joe Armstrong, its charismatic frontman, would get help for substance abuse, though it did not specify the nature of his problems.
