The DNC defines a presidential candidate as someone who "has accrued delegates in the nominating process and plans to seek the nomination, has established substantial support for his or her nomination as the Democratic candidate for the Office of the President of the United States, is a bona fide Democrat whose record of public service, accomplishment, public writings and/or public statements affirmatively demonstrates that he or she is faithful to the interests, welfare and success of the Democratic Party of the United States, and will participate in the Convention in good faith. "In terms of who is eligible to participate as a candidate, we take our cues from the DNC's rules." Tad Devine, a Democratic political consultant working with senator, points out that because Sanders has come up politically in Vermont -- a state with no party registration -- there is actually no way for him to register officially as a Democrat. The political consultant, however, said that in order to get on the ballot in some states, Sanders would have to "pledge some allegiance to the Democratic Party." "He won't have to sign on to every plank of the Democratic platform in order to get in, but he will have to acknowledge that he is running as a Democrat," Devine said.
