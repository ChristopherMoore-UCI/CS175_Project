"I think he's much better off in a suit," iconic American designer Tommy Hilfiger told CNN's Piers Morgan about President Obama. "I think Michelle Obama brought back that focus on fashion and the first lady having a look -- and that trickles over to the men as well," said Hartman. Although style mavens generally tend to covet the first lady's ensembles, Michelle Obama did receive heavy criticism when she opted for an Alexander McQueen gown for a 2011 state dinner with Chinese President Hu Jintao, instead of a more diplomatic choice of an Asian-American designer. "When it comes to things like creating brand image where everybody does the same thing or people are consistent, it helps consumers and voters remember who they're looking at," said Hartman, calling to mind Steve Jobs' black turtleneck, jeans and New Balance sneakers; Mark Zuckerberg's gray T-shirts; and even Rick Santorum's sweater vests. According to Emily Barnett, a Parsons School of Design assistant professor, color choice is also powerful visual tool -- whether viewers know it or not.
