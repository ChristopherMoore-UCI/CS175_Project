She and my father taught me everything I know about love and family, and she and I often lean on each other for support. I still have the support of my mom, and that's what keeps me going most days. I went from planning a family vacation to planning a eulogy in a matter of days. My father lived a life full of love. When the New Orleans Saints play a game, I think about how he'd yell at the TV, a trait he definitely passed down to me.
