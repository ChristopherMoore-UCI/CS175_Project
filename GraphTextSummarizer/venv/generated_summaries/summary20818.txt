"It is an established practice that civilian accommodation, offices, churches, mosques, hospitals, cultural places, shrines are non-military targets, but if they are used to stage an attack, such civilian accommodation or office automatically loses that immunity and becomes a military target," the statement said. The oil-rich Niger Delta has been the site of frequent clashes between militant groups and the Nigerian military. The targeted group -- the Niger Delta Liberation Force -- has accused the military of large-scale massacre and rape in the village and surrounding areas, allegations that military spokesman Timothy Antigha called "completely false. " "It is possible a few civilians were caught in the crossfire," Antigha, a spokesman for the military's Joint Task Force, which was formed to combat rebels, said Sunday. One of the most prominent rebel groups, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, and other militant groups say they're fighting for a fairer distribution of the region's oil wealth.
