Nicholas John Miller, 22, was arrested after the incident, which began in Jacksonville -- about 12 miles northeast of Little Rock -- and ended in nearby Cabot, Jacksonville Police Capt. The bus had stopped nearby, and Miller left the woman, boarded the bus and, armed with the knife, took over the driver's seat, Jacksonville police said. Miller was being charged Thursday with a felony count of vehicle piracy, 12 felony counts of kidnapping, and two felony counts of aggravated assault, Jacksonville police spokeswoman April Kiser said. But she "did not have one to give," Jacksonville police added in a news release. The incident began with Miller allegedly demanding a car from a woman in Jacksonville, Boyd said.
