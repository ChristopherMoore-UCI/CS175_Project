The carrier was also part of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and air operations over the Balkans in 1992, 1993 and 1994, according to Navy records. The Navy announced Thursday it's paying ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas, one cent to take the former USS Saratoga off its hands for dismantling and recycling. That ship was towed to All Star Metals of Brownsville earlier this year, with the Navy paying a penny to the ship recycler under a contract awarded last October. A third carrier, the former USS Constellation, is expected to meet a similar fate soon, according to a Navy statement. It is now at Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island and is expected to be towed to Texas in the summer, the Navy said.
