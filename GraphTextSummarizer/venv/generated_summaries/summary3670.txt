According to a statement by the U.S. Interior Department, the agreement will open up almost 1.5 million acres of U.S. outer continental shelf to exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. It follows the commitment last year by U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon to work out an agreement on developing the maritime border reserves. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar attended the signing of the pact known as the Transboundary Agreement in Los Cabos, Mexico, with Patricia Espinosa, the Mexican foreign relations minister. The Transboundary Agreement creates a framework for Mexico's state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) to work with U.S. oil and gas companies in developing the maritime boundary area. The area, roughly the size of Delaware, is estimated by the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to contain up to 172 million barrels of oil and 304 billion cubic feet of natural gas, the department statement said.
