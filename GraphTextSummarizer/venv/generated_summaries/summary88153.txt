It was perhaps the most divisive series finale of all time, leading legions of people to think their televisions went out and spawning a plethora of close readings of Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'. Perhaps sick of answering questions about an event that happened seven years ago, Sopranos creator David Chase finally let a sliver of info out on Tony Soprano's whereabouts at end of the HBO series. Questions about that scene never ceased, and Chase's elusiveness over Tony's fate only furthered speculation. In an article on Vox, writer Martha P. Nochimson questions Chase on whether Tony dies in the finale. Chase's nonchalance notwithstanding, "Sopranos" fans can breath a sigh of relief knowing that Tony's enjoying some onion rings somewhere, post-blacked-out screen.
