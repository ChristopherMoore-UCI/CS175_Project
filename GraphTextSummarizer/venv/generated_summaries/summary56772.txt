According to Amendola, Sandusky has seen McQueary at charitable events, including those of Second Mile. Defense lawyer Joseph Amendola told CNN contributor Sara Ganim that the young man, who was described in a grand jury report as being about 10 years old in March 2002, was in Amendola's office several weeks ago and said he believed he was the boy called "Victim 2." The young man said nothing sexual occurred with Sandusky in the shower, according to Amendola. "Victim 2" had dinner last summer with Sandusky, Amendola said. According to Amendola, Sandusky contends that Curley told him that a person reported seeing the coach and a young boy in the shower.
