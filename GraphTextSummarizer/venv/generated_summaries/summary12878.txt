-- An important hydroelectric dam shared by Brazil and Paraguay failed Tuesday night, pushing a large swath of central and southern Brazil into darkness, said the country's minister of mines and energy, Edison Lobao. At about 10:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), the Itaipu dam shut down completely, Lobao said in a radio interview. An official at Brazil's National Electric System Operator told CNN that the incident at Itaipu caused an outage of 18,000 megawatts. Neighboring Paraguay and Uruguay also reported related blackouts, Lobao said. Millions of people were affected by the blackout in six Brazilian states that included the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
