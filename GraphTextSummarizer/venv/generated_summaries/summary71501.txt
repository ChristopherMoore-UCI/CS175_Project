Duncan was hospitalized eight days after he arrived from Liberia, and later tested positive for Ebola. Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia on September 20, and he made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25. And many are wondering why Thomas Eric Duncan died when several other Ebola patients treated in the United States survived. He didn't get a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor Unlike other American patients, Duncan didn't get a blood transfusion from someone who'd survived the virus. "Mr. Duncan did not receive the same type of serum transfusion as the patient in Nebraska (Mukpo) because his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors," the hospital said.
