-- Engine problems forced the pilot of a Delta Air Lines aircraft to turn back Thursday night shortly after takeoff from Atlanta, the company said Friday. The aircraft returned to Atlanta without incident, spokeswoman Gina Laughlin said. Passenger Ginger Heath said the incident began with a shaking sensation, followed by "sparks, a great big boom and lots and lots of fire" from the engine. Passengers aboard Flight 1442 from Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina, told CNN affiliate WSOC that they had been airborne about 10 or 20 minutes when one of the engines appeared to catch on fire. Laughlin could not confirm the report of flames, but said crew members reported smoke in the cabin following the incident.
