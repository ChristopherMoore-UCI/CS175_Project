Minor enemies attack en masse and in waves, while tougher enemies usually show up to scrap all alone. But it is more than just blood and gore (which, incidentally, gets splashed all over your character during battle, then magically disappears afterward) that make "Space Marine" worthy. Players often are accompanied by two other space marines who contribute to the wholesale slaughter of lesser opponents but seem to have little effect on boss battles. There are plenty of weapons to satisfy your melee or missile tendencies in battle. Boss battles are demanding, and pulling off multiple attacks is almost required to conquer the last foe.
