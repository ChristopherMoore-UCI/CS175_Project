The outpatient program Anderson chose, Mothers Making a Change, is designed especially for pregnant women and women with young children. Anderson spent three weeks in residential treatment -- all she could afford -- but didn't think that was enough, so she enrolled in Mothers Making a Change, a year-long outpatient drug and alcohol program in Atlanta, Georgia. In addition to therapy and education, Mothers Making a Change provided transportation and offered free child care while Anderson was there. Anderson began drinking and smoking marijuana in high school. "I can say with everything in me, with every bit of my breath, that program helped me turn my life around," said Anderson, who now runs a program to help the developmentally disabled in DeKalb County, Georgia.
