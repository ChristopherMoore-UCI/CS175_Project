But elsewhere -- when the police aren't looking -- Iranian men and women dance together and see nothing wrong with it. Every year for the last 35, the arrival of summer brings a battle between women pushing against the rules in the Iranian heat and regime backers fighting against the loosening of restrictions. From the moment the Islamic revolution took power in Iran, women, who had enjoyed Western-style freedoms, started to endure new rules restricting their lives. In it, Iranian women of all ages are posting pictures of themselves free from the restrictive clothing. The "Happy" video showed defiance from two groups who are chafing under the limits imposed by the authorities: young people and women.
