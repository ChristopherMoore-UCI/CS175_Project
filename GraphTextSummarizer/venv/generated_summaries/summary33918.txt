-- A series of civil lawsuits against defense contractors KBR and its former parent company Halliburton claims the companies endangered the health of U.S. troops and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan by unsafely burning massive amounts of garbage on U.S. bases. However, spokeswoman Cathy Mann said if the allegations are in regard to KBR activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, then Halliburton believes it has been improperly named. Further, it would be inappropriate for Halliburton to comment on the merits of a matter affecting only the interest of KBR," Mann said in an e-mail to CNN. Guilmette's suit describes winds blowing "the thick black smoke and toxic fumes from the burn pit" into the tent where he lived from March 2004 to March 2005. Burn pits produced thick black smoke and toxic fumes, according to plaintiff Richard Guilmette.
