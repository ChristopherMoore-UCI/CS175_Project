Wahiba Sands Camping under the stars in the desert is a favorite Omani pastime and Wahiba Sands is one of the favorite locations to do it -- a rejuvenating desert retreat far from Muscat, where Bedouin tour guides offer desert safaris and overnight camping treks. Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, opened the Royal Opera House Muscat in 2011. The beautifully constructed building itself is worth a visit even if you can't catch a show; it blends traditional Omani design with modern acoustic technology and is one of the most recognizable sights in Muscat.
