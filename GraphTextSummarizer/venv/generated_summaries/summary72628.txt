Success in tablets would boost Microsoft's profits, ease investor concerns about the shrinking PC market and set it up for future growth. The next generation OS, which will be unveiled at the Microsoft Build conference on Tuesday, is not only designed for PCs, but it is also made to work on tablets as well. It isn't the MacBook or Mac OS X Lion that has Microsoft executives worried, though. The new operating system, currently known as Windows 8, is the tech giant's attempt to regain ground that it has lost to Apple, which surpassed Microsoft last year as the world's most valuable company. Our sources tell us that the device will be manufactured by Samsung but has been designed meticulously by Microsoft in an attempt to create the iPad alternative.
