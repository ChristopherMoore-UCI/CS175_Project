Smith, the Pew researcher, said in a phone interview that much of the growth in Twitter is driven by younger people who use the mobile Web or apps to access Twitter's services. In its survey, conducted in two chunks between January and April, Pew found that the percentage of online Americans who use Twitter has leveled off. Only 15% of online adults in February said they used Twitter -- and that's "similar to" the 13% who said they used the micro-blogging platform in May 2011, according to Pew's report. "The proportion of online adults who use Twitter on a typical day has doubled since May 2011 and has quadrupled since late 2010," Pew writes. While the overall popularity of Twitter may be about the same, the subset of people who use Twitter frequently appears to be growing, according to the report.
