"The U.S. has confirmed that Ilyas Kashmiri was killed on Friday," said Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani at a Monday press conference in Quetta, the capital of the country's southwestern province of Balochistan. The U.S. government has confirmed the killing of al Qaeda operational commander Ilyas Kashmiri,  the prime minister of Pakistan said Monday. It could also be seen as an embarrassment for Pakistanis, who have twice in just over one month, had a major al Qaeda figure killed on their territory without their participation. He was commander of "Brigade 313" of Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, which has formed a close relationship with al Qaeda. Kashmiri was also said to have ties with David Coleman Headley, the U.S. citizen who confessed to helping scout targets for the Mumbai attack in November 2008.
