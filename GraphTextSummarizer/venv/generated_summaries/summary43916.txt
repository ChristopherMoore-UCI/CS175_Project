Malik Jones, 16, allegedly was playing a game called "pick 'em out and knock 'em out" when he punched Delfino Mora, 62, in his jaw, sending Mora to the ground, where the back of his head was cracked by concrete, a Cook County, Illinois, prosecutor told a judge during a hearing Monday. Connecticut woman arrested in group home assault caught on video Jones posted the beating video on his Facebook page, and it was seen there by someone who said Jones also attacked him on June 30, Simonton said. Four arrested after Indian woman's assault captured on video All three teens were ordered held without bail until their next court date August 3, Simonton said. That man showed it to Mora's youngest son, Emmanuel, who is a friend of his, and that led police to Jones on Saturday, she said. Nicholas Ayala, 17, and Anthony Malcolm, 18, used Jones' cell phone camera to record the attack, picking up the "loud crack of his head hitting the cement," prosecutor's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said.
