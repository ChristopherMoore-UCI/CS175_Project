Paul's political team also arranged a pair of intimate, off-the-record meetings with activists from the South Carolina "liberty movement" who were intensely loyal to his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, during his two underdog presidential bids in 2008 and 2012. "You can't raise enough libertarian Ron Paul money and hope to win," said Trey Grayson, the former Kentucky Secretary of State who lost to Paul in his 2010 Senate primary. Much of the anxiety surrounding Paul in South Carolina is coming not from his activist base but from the traditional donor class -- even some with long ties to former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who supported Paul in 2010 and welcomed him into the Senate's "Tea Party Caucus" after his victory. Paul has cozied up to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a beacon of the Republican establishment who backed Grayson in that 2010 primary, and he endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney last summer when Ron Paul was still, technically, a candidate for the nomination, irking many of his libertarian devotees. -- Rand Paul arrives in South Carolina on Friday for a handful of fundraisers and closed-door meetings with local Republicans, the latest in a series of expeditions to key primary states as he mulls a presidential bid in 2016.
