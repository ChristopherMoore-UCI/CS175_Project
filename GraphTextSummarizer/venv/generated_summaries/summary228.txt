Known as the "lady" in Myanmar, Suu Kyi has been compared to former South African President Nelson Mandela, who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid. In an interview with CNN several years earlier, Suu Kyi, in fact, likened Myanmar's plight to South Africa's former brutal race-based system. Over the years, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in Myanmar. Over the years, Suu Kyi has made clear her devotion to bringing democracy to Myanmar. Even when Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar in May 2008, Suu Kyi was not allowed to leave her house, though trees were crashing down all around her.
