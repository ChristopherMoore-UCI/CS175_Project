Merced County sheriff's deputies Wednesday arrested Teresa Ceja Robles, 33, and her husband, Jose Augustine Velarde, 37, and charged them with murdering Ana Lila Diaz DeCeja inside their Planada house. Beyond befriending Diaz, the sheriff said that store surveillance video shows Robles shopping for baby items on the same day -- December 2 -- that she and her husband allegedly kidnapped the boy and killed his mother. Pazin said that Robles and Velarde got Diaz to come over to their house, where the mother "was "immediately attacked by the husband, savagely strangled ... and lit on fire to hide the evidence." Sheriff Mark Pazin told HLN's "Nancy Grace" that the pair killed the 26-year-old woman because they wanted to have her two-month-old boy, a desire that began after Diaz let Robles hold the baby in a medical clinic shortly after his birth. On Thursday, members of Diaz's family -- including her husband and mother -- gathered for a bittersweet reunion with the baby boy, whom they had not seen in nearly two weeks.
