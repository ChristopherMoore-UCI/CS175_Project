The soldiers, identified as Christopher Roger Blackett, 20, and Sebastian Gamez, 20, are accused of killing 17-year-old Vincent Edwin Carlisle Jr, said Harnett County Sheriff Larry Rollins. Carlisle's body was found Thursday afternoon in the woods in the county, Rollins said. Carlisle, a high school senior, had been missing for four days, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. -- Two soldiers from Fort Bragg were arrested this week and face murder charges in the death of a North Carolina teenager, authorities said. "It's important to me that people know that Vincent Carlisle was a very intelligent young man, and he had dreams, and he had plans," Stewart said.
