There's also been talk of a bigger iPad, coming a month after the rollout of bigger iPhones. The company also used the event to roll out its then-latest Mac operating system, OS X Mavericks. Last October, Apple unveiled the thinner and lighter iPad Air and a revamped iPad Mini. Apple on Wednesday sent invitations to media members for next Thursday under the headline, "It's been way too long." Most Apple analysts expect to see new Macs at the event, which will be held at Apple's Cupertino, Calif., campus.
