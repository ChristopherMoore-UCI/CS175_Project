"It's bloody hard to make an Olympics final, let alone get a medal," said Sally Pearson, who won silver in Beijing and also set a new Olympic record in a gold-winning performance in the 100m hurdles on Wednesday. " Ken Wood, the swim coach who helped train China's double gold winner Ye Shiwen, one of the Olympic surprises this year, said the Australians "cannot afford to be soft" to compete with Chinese swimmers. Some Australian athletes have been pushing back on the criticism about their lack of gold medals in London. It has inspired a review of Australia's swimming program, headed by former national head coach Bill Sweetenham and Olympian Suzie O'Neill. Wood has coached swimmers and record breakers such as Australia's Leisel Jones and Geoff Huegill.
