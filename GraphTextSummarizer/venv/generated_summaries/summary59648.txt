-- Over the course of two days, 10.5 million people spent four hours watching Kim Kardashian and NBA player Kris Humphries tie the knot. Since the couple's E! special, "Kim's Fairytale Wedding," which aired on October 9 and 10, the pair has honeymooned in Europe, celebrated Kardashian's 31st birthday in Las Vegas, filmed a new season of "Kourtney & Kim Take New York" and filed for divorce. However, why would E! be hell-bent on making sure Kardashian and her future hubby looked completely discontented with one another? Citing irreconcilable differences, according to court documents from Los Angeles Superior Court, Kardashian filed for divorce from her husband of 72 days on Monday. Not to mention the blowout that ensued when Kardashian told Humphries she wasn't taking his name.
