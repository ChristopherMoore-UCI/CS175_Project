After being knocked out and losing a lot of blood during his fight with the British Masked Horseman, Ichabod Crane suddenly wakes up inside of a cave covered in weird cave stuff. The goofy, intriguing, timely allegory that is Fox's 'Sleepy Hollow' What follows is a handy primer for the show's insanity: The episode starts in the middle of a Revolutionary War battle, which you have to admit is not a common starting place for TV shows. Nor, for that matter, can I think of any other TV show in history that has suddenly introduced an invulnerable British soldier wearing an "Eyes Wide Shut" mask. He tries to hold off the Headless Horseman using his brain to control chains, but the Horseman cuts through them with his axe, which I should mention is heated to 500 degrees. "Sleepy Hollow" gives the Headless Horseman a shotgun, and the shotgun appears to fire explosive rounds.
