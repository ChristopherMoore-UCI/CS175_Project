-- Last August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an ultimatum: Food manufacturers had one year to make sure any "gluten-free" products met FDA requirements. The ruling applies to packaged foods only. It is typically what gives foods made with these products their chewiness and elasticity. Gluten is a protein complex found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. To use the "gluten-free" label, products must now have an undetectable level of gluten and cannot have any ingredient containing wheat, rye, barley, or any their derivatives.
