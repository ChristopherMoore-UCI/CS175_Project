"The brothers are ages 15 and 17 years old, and both are in police custody at the present time," Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said Tuesday, adding that the younger brother had also been charged with one count of luring. Prosecutors say Autumn was lured to the boys' home, where they murdered her -- possibly for her BMX bike, which police found among some of the girl's belongings when they searched the site early Tuesday. Dalton said she was strangled and died from blunt-force trauma, but based on preliminary findings, there were no signs of sexual assault. The young suspects turned themselves in, accompanied by their attorneys, Tuesday. -- Two teenage brothers were arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Autumn Pasquale, the 12-year-old-girl found dead Monday in Clayton, New Jersey, according to authorities.
