When authorities searched the singer's home as part of the investigation into the alleged egg-throwing, a sheriff's deputy found suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of Bieber house guest Lil Za, who now faces a felony drug charge. The plane carrying Bieber and others -- presumably his entourage -- was clearing customs after touching down at Teterboro Airport when U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers said they detected the odor, law enforcement sources said. -- Pop star Justin Bieber was granted re-entry Friday into the United States following a search of his private airplane by federal officials who said they detected an odor of marijuana after it landed in New Jersey, a law enforcement official told CNN. A prosecutor is expected to decide as early as next week whether Bieber will be charged with felony vandalism in connection with the case. That same day, Florida authorities released police documents that accused Bieber of being under the influence of alcohol, pot and Xanax when police stopped him for allegedly street racing in Miami Beach last week.
