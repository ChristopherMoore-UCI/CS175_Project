"Usually, when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus, it's meningitis C," said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, in a telephone interview with CNN. "We have filed an Investigational New Drug application for our MenB vaccine in the U.S., but have not yet come to an agreement on a pathway to licensure for this vaccine with regulatory authorities," Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power told CNN Saturday in an e-mail. "We took the step to allow the option to vaccinate the students, but the decision to do so has not been made yet," CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told CNN on Friday. "This is very, very unusual." Schaffner added that, in the United States, Group B meningitis typically strikes infants, and only rarely adolescents and young adults. Cases of meningococcal disease in general -- including Group B -- have dropped in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1930s.
