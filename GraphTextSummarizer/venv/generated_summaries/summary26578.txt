-- New York could be the first state in the country to impose a limited ban on a controversial method of drilling for natural gas. New York City gets roughly half of its water from the Delaware River Basin, which was recently named the country's most endangered river because of the threat of natural gas. The moratorium  -- which would only be in effect until May -- seeks to halt new drilling permits for horizontal hydraulic fracturing, dubbed "fracking," a controversial method of extracting natural gas. In the past, Paterson has expressed concern about hydraulic fracturing, which involves cracking thousands of feet beneath the earth's surface to get at valuable natural gas. "The City has invested more than $1.5 billion in watershed protection programs that have resulted in improved water quality throughout our watershed, as well as to our releases downstream, which benefit all members of the Commission, and the 15 million people who rely on the Delaware River watershed for clean drinking water," Bloomberg wrote.
