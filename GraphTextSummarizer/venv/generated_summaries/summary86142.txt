-- A worker at a west Philadelphia abortion clinic has pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and may testify against Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the doctor accused of performing illegal late-term abortions, court officials said. Mongar died November 19, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by Gosnell, according to Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. The Philadelphia district attorney's office grand jury report from January 11, 2011, charged Kermit Gosnell with murder for allegedly performing abortions past the 24-week limit prescribed by law. The second is the death of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died in a second-trimester abortion, according to Common Pleas Court Judge Benjamin Lerner. The other charges Williams pleaded guilty to are delivery of drugs illegally causing the death of another human being, engaging in corrupt organization and two counts of conspiracy to corrupt.
