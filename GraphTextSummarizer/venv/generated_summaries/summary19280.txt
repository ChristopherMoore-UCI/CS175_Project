Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi tied the knot Saturday with longtime beau Jionni LaValle in a celebration in New Jersey inspired by the "Great Gatsby." The reality TV star from the show "Jersey Shore" stuck to the theme in a demure wedding dress that was a far cry from the brash animal prints and plunging necklines for which she is known. "Here is the first picture of me and Jionni as husband and wife!" In a photo posted on her website, she wore an opulent beaded lace dress and a floor-length veil over her bright red hair. She appears on the show with former "Jersey Store" cast member Jenni "JWOWW" Farley.
