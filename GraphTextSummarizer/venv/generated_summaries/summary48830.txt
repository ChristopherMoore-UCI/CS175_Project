Designs incorporating nanotechnology are a far cry from Otegui's day job which has seen him employed in the design departments of car industry giants like BMW, Citroen and Fiat -- working on the grill and wing mirrors of the new 500 (Cinquecento) -- in recent years. He says that on rough calculations each turbine would produce 0.2 watts of energy and a square meter grid of turbines could produce around 90 watts of power. His futuristic concept is called the Nano Vent-Skin (NVS) and the design -- to wrap buildings in an organic lattice skin made up of micro wind turbines -- is radical. Otegui concedes that implementation of nano-manufacturing of this type is still years away. It was all the big "green" projects around the world that got Otegui thinking about smaller solutions.
