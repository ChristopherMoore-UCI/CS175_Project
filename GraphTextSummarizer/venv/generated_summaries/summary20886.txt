A video published on www.uriminzokkiri.com, a North Korean government website, draws on imagery from the highly successful pop video "Gangnam Style" by the rapper PSY to poke fun at a South Korean presidential candidate. -- The new North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has brought Disney characters and fun fairs to the images disseminated by the secretive regime's state media. The question now is whether his rule has also added a touch of South Korean pop culture. The face stuck on the dancing figure is that of Park Geun-hye, the candidate for the governing Saenuri Party in the upcoming South Korean presidential election. The North Korean video starts with a picture showing a person apparently in the midst of performing the world famous horse dance from "Gangnam Style."
