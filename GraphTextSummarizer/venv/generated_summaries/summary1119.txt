To be sure, all of these are serious forms of military intervention, but bringing up the specter of Iraq can be misleading, just as it was in Libya. As I've argued before, military intervention remains premature. None of the Western powers has come out in even tepid support of military intervention. Those who warn that Syria will descend into civil war are a bit behind: It is already in civil war. So we find ourselves in an odd but increasingly common situation, where Syrians themselves are more enthusiastic about foreign military intervention than Americans are.
