A WAFB poll out this week in Louisiana found incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu four points ahead of Republican Bill Cassidy. Democrats in key Senate races are showing some strength in the final stretch of election season -- but it may not be enough to keep the chamber. And a recent Courier-Journal/Survey USA poll in Kentucky found Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes trailing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell by just one point. A new CNN/ORC poll released Friday shows Democrat Michelle Nunn leading Republican David Perdue 47% to 44% among likely voters. An idiosyncratic election system is also a problem for Democrats in Louisiana, where Sen. Mary Landrieu led the last five polls ahead of the state's open primary, which will send two candidates to a run-off if no one wins 50% of the vote.
