-- The Dalai Lama refused to answer a question Monday about whether Tibetan monks should stop setting themselves on fire to protest China's occupation of Tibet. Self-immolation is becoming an increasingly common form of protest for Tibetans who want genuine autonomy from China and accuse Beijing of repression. More than 30 of them took place in the last year in China, Tibetan advocacy groups say. He handed over political leadership of the Tibetan community to an elected prime minister in 2011. The Templeton Prize, an award worth Â£1.1 million ($1.77 million), honors "outstanding individuals who have devoted their talents to expanding our vision of human purpose and ultimate reality." The Dalai Lama will give $1.5 million to the aid organization Save the Children, he said.
