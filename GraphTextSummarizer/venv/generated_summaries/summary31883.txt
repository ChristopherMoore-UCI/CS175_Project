Attorney General Martha Coakley became the first Democratic governor candidate in 20 years to not receive the endorsement of the Boston Globe in the general election, with the publication instead endorsing Republican Charlie Baker on Sunday. The newspaper also endorsed Baker over Coakley because it claimed the Republican would in fact be the better candidate to "consolidate" outgoing Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick's legacy on reforms tied to education, health care and public transportation. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined Patrick and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at a campaign rally for Coakley on Friday. "At a difficult inflection point in state government, Massachusetts needs a governor who's focused on steady management and demonstrable results," the Globe's editorial board wrote. The Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts just got some more bad news.
