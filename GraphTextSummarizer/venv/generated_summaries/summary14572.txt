Deadpool has appeared on screen before; in 2009, he was played by a combination of Ryan Reynolds and Scott Adkins in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine. According to studio 20th Century Fox, the comic book star will arrive in theaters with a movie of his own on February 12, 2016. " Reynolds actually did some filming as the character a few years ago, and the footage leaked online right around the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, which was held in July. Reynolds hasn't been officially announced as the lead, but he's been so closely identified with the character it's almost assumed he will get the part. "The movie has been in a state of limbo for a while," Reynolds told The Niagara Falls Review.
