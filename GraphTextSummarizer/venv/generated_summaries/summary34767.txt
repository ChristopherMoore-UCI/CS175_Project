Critics of the ban, including Republican leaders, Gulf state officials and Gulf Coast residents, said it only hurt oil and gas workers in hard-hit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster. Obama's decision effectively reverses White House plans announced at the end of March to open the Gulf region -- along with other large swaths of U.S. coastal waters -- to oil and natural gas drilling. Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican and a frequent critic of the Obama administration's handling of the Gulf spill, said in a statement, "This announcement from the Obama administration today will undoubtedly send more economic capital and even more jobs overseas, in the wake of those oil rigs that already left our waters for Egypt, the Congo and Nigeria during the 'arbitrary and capricious' moratorium on deepwater drilling." Under the plan, roughly two-thirds of available oil and gas resources in the eastern Gulf would have been opened to drilling. -- President Barack Obama will not be allowing new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico for at least seven years, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced Wednesday.
