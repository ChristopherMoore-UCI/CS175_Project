" Rosin points out that Bliss, who heads the marketing company Rob Bliss Creative and told New Republic "I make viral videos for a living," has been accused of not being inclusive before. Bliss said that during the 10 hours captured on video, there were 108 instances of street harassment, of which he had 30 to 40 scenes with good enough quality for him to consider. Bliss, 26, said the Grand Rapids video had an open call for participation. "I simply wanted to capture street harassment in a very intimate, close-up way in the real world and have people talk about it," Bliss said. In 2011, a blogger wrote about the Grand Rapids Lip Dub video project, which Bliss hosted.
