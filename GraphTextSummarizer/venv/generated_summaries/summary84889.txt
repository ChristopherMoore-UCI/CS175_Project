-- The venerable CBS soap opera "Guiding Light" will go dark in September after 72 years and 16,000 episodes, the network announced Wednesday. In 1979, the show did a groundbreaking storyline when the character of Roger Thorpe (played by the late Michael Zaslow) raped his wife, Holly (Maureen Garrett). Among the actors who went on to greater fame after roles on the show: Kevin Bacon, James Earl Jones and Taye Diggs. The marital-rape story line reflected a significant real-life case in 1978 -- the state of Oregon v. John J. Rideout. Gina Tognoni is one of many performers who have appeared on "Guiding Light" over the years.
