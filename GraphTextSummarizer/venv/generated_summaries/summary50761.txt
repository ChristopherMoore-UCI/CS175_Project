In a letter to the Anti-Defamation League, Oldman said he was "deeply remorseful" for the comments about Mel Gibson, which the ADL said put forward anti-Semitic stereotypes. Gibson was pilloried for anti-Semitic remarks he made in 2006; Baldwin was criticized for lashing out at paparazzi with an anti-gay slur last year. I am unaware -- as I have seen reported -- of Gary Oldman defending any anti-Semitic remarks in the interview, or, for that matter, anyplace!" said Urbanski. In the interview, on newstands Friday and already published online, Oldman wades into the controversies involving Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin, though to be fair, he does so in the context of ripping hypocrisy and political correctness. "Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him -- and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dough," Oldman said in the interview.
