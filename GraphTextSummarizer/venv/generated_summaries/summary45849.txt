Asked about ISIS's claim of the woman's death in Raqqa, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that she could not "confirm those reports in any way. Intelligence and law enforcement sources said the theory comes from prior intelligence on her captivity and ISIS' past behavior with hostages. Al-Kasasbeh's killing was an attempt by ISIS "to instill terror and fear in the hearts of its enemies," making them less willing to provoke or put up a fight, says a prominent Sunni Muslim cleric who has been exiled from Syria. " ISIS has held a number of hostages from the United States, Britain and Japan. But, he said, "we are highly skeptical" because of ISIS's proven lack of credibility, and he questioned whether they could identify Jordanian warplanes so high in the sky or would hold a hostage in a "weapon warehouse."
