The result leaves Tottenham seven points ahead of Arsenal, who go back above Chelsea on goal difference, although Spurs are now eight points behind second placed Manchester United -- who closed the gap on Manchester City to just two points after a late 2-1 victory at Norwich on Sunday. Third-placed Tottenham began the day 10 points ahead of their neighbors and still with designs of catching Manchester City and Manchester United at the top of the table. First defender Bacary Sagna nodded home Mikel Arteta's cross, then Premier League top scorer Robin van Persie curled home a superb effort -- his 23rd league goal of the season. Meanwhile, at Wembley Stadium, Liverpool defeated Championship side Cardiff City 3-2 on penalties to win the English League Cup, manager Kenny Dalglish's first trophy since returning to the club. But Norwich looked to have rescued a point seven minutes from time when Grant Holt fired home after his turn out-witted Rio Ferdinand.
