A building department official said one of the two Park Avenue buildings that collapsed received a city permit last year for the installation of 120 feet of gas piping. Fire marshals, police arson investigators and the National Transportation Safety Board -- which probes gas explosions -- worked to determine the cause of the explosion. Among the victims was Alexis (Jordy) Salas, 22, an aspiring lawyer who checked on an elderly neighbor and member of his church -- who was also killed -- when the odor of gas filled corridors of their building the night before the blast, said his wife, Jennifer Salas. Building department records detailed a litany of violations, dating back decades, for one of the collapsed buildings, including a lack of smoke detectors, blocked fire escapes and faulty light fixtures. Fire officials said they received no reports of gas leaks in the area in the last month, while police reported receiving no calls since 2010.
