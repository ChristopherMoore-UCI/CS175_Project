The ruling from Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. came in the second day of jury selection in the trial of Anthony, 25, who is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. -- A Florida judge dismissed a batch of potential jurors in the Casey Anthony murder trial Tuesday because several members had discussed the case in the jury room. Casey Anthony also faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement. Perry tied the jury panel problem to a person, listed as a witness in the case, who had also been summoned for jury duty. "Through no fault of your own I think it's best I let you go and return back to the central jury room," said Perry, who asked for more jury candidates Wednesday.
