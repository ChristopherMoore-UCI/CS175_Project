-- Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, called Wednesday for new parliamentary elections in Russia over concerns about vote fraud. Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that Russian authorities "must halt police mistreatment of election protesters, journalists and detainees" before further planned rallies. Amnesty said more than 1,000 people, including journalists, had reportedly been detained following election protests, of whom possibly more than 100 remain in detention. Some protesters at opposition rallies have been arrested "simply for shouting 'Freedom' or 'We need another Russia,'" he said, while pro-government supporters gathered in the same location have been left untouched. A draft report by the organization's election-observer mission details alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors.
