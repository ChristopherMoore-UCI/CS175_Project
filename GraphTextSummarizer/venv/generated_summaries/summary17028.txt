In a statement released Thursday, FAMU Interim President Larry Robinson said a "comprehensive" anti-hazing plan includes a revised student code of conduct procedures, enhanced means of reporting and investigating allegations, a new anti-hazing website, and more money for research on the problem. The band member's roommate in May pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to a felony charge of hazing resulting in death and first-degree hazing. Their attorney told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB that hazing has occurred this year at the university. Pam Champion said anti-hazing steps taken by FAMU are insufficient. "They are putting dollars over the students," Robert Champion Sr. said of FAMU.
