With 26 minutes gone the 20 year old surged through the Egypt defence before exchanging passes with Hulk, on the left wing, and burying the ball past goalkeeper Ahmed Elshenawi. New Zealand goalkeeper Michael O'Keefe failed to clear a corner on the stroke of half time, and Baga was left with a simple header to give his side the lead. The five time World champions struggled to continue their dominance in the second half, with Egypt captain Mohamed Aboutrika pulling a goal back in the 52nd minute. The reformed Great Britain side, who haven't competed in the Olympic football competition since 1960, made a steady, if uninspiring, Olympic return at Old Trafford, Manchester. Spain's Olympic squad has been expected to add Olympic gold to the country's already impressive collection of titles.
