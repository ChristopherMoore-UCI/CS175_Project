-- A Siberian Tiger mauled a man Monday morning after he and a friend scaled the fence of the Calgary Zoo and pressed up against the tiger cage, zoo officials said. Two-year-old Vitali is normally one of the more laid back tigers, zoo officials said Monday. Officials said two men scaled the zoo's 8-foot perimeter fence, which also is covered in barbed wire, about 1 a.m. Monday morning. Watch Vitali inside the zoo enclosure Â» Vitali "has a fairly significant armament at his disposal: very sharp claws," said Dr. Sandie Black, the zoo's head veterinarian. They are, however, quite serious," Graham Netwon, the zoo's director and chief financial officer, said at a news conference Monday.
