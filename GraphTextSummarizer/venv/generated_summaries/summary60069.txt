In December, the FARC announced the planned release of six national police officers: Luis Alfonso Beltran, Cesar Augusto Laso, Carlos Jose Duarte, Jorge Trujillo, Jorge Humberto Romero and Jose Libardo Forero. While severely weakened in recent years, the group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. "We are very happy for the 10 hostages who will be released and their families," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos wrote on Twitter soon after the announcement. Calling its police and military hostages "prisoners of war," FARC vowed in a statement published on its website to continue its fight against the state. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, said Sunday it will free its remaining 10 government hostages and stop kidnapping civilians for money.
