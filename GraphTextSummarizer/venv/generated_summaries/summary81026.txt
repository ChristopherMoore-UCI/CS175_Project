The unnamed juror "would like to talk about the experience of serving on a grand jury, the evidence presented and the investigation in a way that could contribute to the public dialogue concerning race relations," but is barred from doing so by state law that requires secrecy about grand jury deliberations, the ACLU said in a statement. The grand jury decided in November that it would not indict Officer Darren Wilson in the August 9, 2014, shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teen whose death sparked nationwide calls for police reform. "The Supreme Court has said that grand jury secrecy must be weighed against the juror's First Amendment rights on a case-by-case basis. A member of the grand jury that declined to bring charges in the August 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown is suing the St. Louis County prosecutor to be allowed to speak on the case, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said Monday. The juror, referred to by the ACLU as "Grand Juror Doe" is suing Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch because he would be responsible for bringing charges against the grand juror for speaking out, the ACLU said.
