It is imperative that African women take advantage of this to provide a sustainable environment that would encourage and promote technology amongst women. The problems that African women in tech face are not very different from the ones female techies in many other parts of the world also come across. That lack is what motivated myself, Ethel Ella Mbawe from Zambia, Barbara Bingu from Uganda, Sam Beckbessinger from South Africa and Akaliza Keza Gara from Rwanda to organize in early August the first Women in Tech Africa meet up. I run the Women in Tech group in Ghana and at one of our monthly events one young female computer scientist approached me and said: "They keep telling me I cannot be really good at IT and also be a good wife and a mother."
