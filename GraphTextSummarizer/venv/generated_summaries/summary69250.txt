Erdogan secured 52% of the votes in the first round of the presidential election, narrowly avoiding a runoff, according to Turkish election board. While the constitution would have allowed Erdogan to run again when his term finishes next year, his own party rules prohibited him from seeking fourth term. -- Turks have picked prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to be the country's first directly elected president.
