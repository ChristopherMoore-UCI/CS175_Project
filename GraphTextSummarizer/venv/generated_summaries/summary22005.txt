Speaking at the event, Pew Environment Group managing director, Josh Reichert said that until recently it was widely believed that the oceans were too vast and abundant to be impacted by humans.

Along with more than 250 species of fish, 70 species of coral and more than 60 varieties of algae were observed around the four islands (Pitcairn, Henderson, Oeno and Ducie) that make up the British Overseas Territory. A National Geographic documentary about the expedition -- "Pitcairn: The Real Bounty Revealed" -- recently premiered at the headquarters of the UK's Royal Society in London.
