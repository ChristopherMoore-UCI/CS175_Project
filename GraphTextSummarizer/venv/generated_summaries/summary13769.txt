The episode ended with Rick and Carl coming upon an empty baby car seat, devastated to see that little Judith Grimes was nowhere to be found. "It's a very important part of the story that Hershel died; it isn't just shock death," executive producer Scott Gimple explained to The Hollywood Reporter. If Daryl dies, we riot: A chat with Norman Reedus It was the Governor and Rick in hand-to-hand combat, and as soon as it looked like Rick was a goner, Michonne ran the Governor through with her sword, and Meghan's mother, Lilly -- the Governor's new girlfriend -- later finished him off. Midway through the episode -- despite Rick's pleas to the Governor (who has recently been going by the name Brian, though his real name is Philip) to let go of his hostages, Hershel and Michonne, so his group and theirs can learn to coexist in the prison -- Hershel, the wise old doctor, was brutally beheaded by the Governor. Moving into the next season and a half, the loss of Hershel will be felt and will be this driving element toward Rick's character.
