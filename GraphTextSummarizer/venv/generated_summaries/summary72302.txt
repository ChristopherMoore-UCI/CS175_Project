The order, which expired last month, protected thousands of bureaucrats and politicians, including President Asif Ali Zardari and his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, from corruption and criminal charges. -- Pakistani Defense Minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar was blocked from leaving the country Thursday after Pakistan's Supreme Court struck down an amnesty that had protected politicians from corruption charges, state media reported. The 17-judge court invalidated the National Reconciliation Order on Wednesday, saying in its ruling that the amnesty "seems to be against the national interest" and "violates various provisions of the Constitution." Pakistan's Supreme Court said its ruling revived all cases that had been suspended or withdrawn under the amnesty. The order, passed in October 2007 under then-President Pervez Musharraf, only covered alleged wrongdoing that occurred between 1986 through 1999.
