-- U.S. President Barack Obama won a battle against Somali pirates. They've attacked dozens of ships and taken hundreds of hostages from several countries. Somali pirates have been the scourge of the Horn of Africa for years. You may have seen the headlines in the last few days: a Somali pirate attack and hostage-taking ended with a precision operation by U.S. snipers and a successful rescue. More than 40 U.S. personnel were killed before U.S. forces withdrew.
