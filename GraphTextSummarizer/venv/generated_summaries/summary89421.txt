He described al Libi as a key al Qaeda figure who is a "legal and an appropriate target." U.S. forces launched dual raids on the northern and eastern coasts of Africa over the weekend in the hunt for two alleged terrorists: Abu Anas al Libi, a suspected al Qaeda operative wanted for the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, and an Al-Shabaab foreign fighter commander named Ikrima. If he talks, al Libi could offer valuable information on men he worked with inside Libya, as well as al Qaeda in general. But some think al Libi probably doesn't know much about the current operational details of al Qaeda. He is thought to have been a close associate of the Saleh Ali Nabhan, a fellow Kenyan and senior al Qaeda operative in east Africa, who was believed to have been connected to the embassy attacks.
