"When Nick George was handcuffed, arrested and locked in a cell for several hours just for carrying Arabic-English flash cards, that was not only illegal and unconstitutional but absolutely did nothing to make air travel any safer. One government official, who spoke on background because of the pending litigation, said TSA behavior detection officers observed George "exhibiting anomalous behavior" before he reached the checkpoint. I told them honestly because I had been trying to read Arabic news media, especially Al-Jazeera, and these are words that come up when you read the news about the Middle East," George said. George, of Wyncote, Pennsylvania, said he is studying Arabic because of his interest in Middle East politics. "I want to serve my country using my Arabic language," George told CNN.
