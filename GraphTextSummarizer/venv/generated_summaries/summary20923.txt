Viral hemorrhagic fevers is a generic term that refers to a number of diseases found in Africa, including Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever, according to Denise Werker, deputy chief medical health officer at the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health. "We do not have information that it's Ebola hemorrhagic fever. There is no drug treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, she said, adding it is not a highly infectious disease. The hemorrhagic fevers are characterized by high fever and symptoms that may be nondescript. Health officials in Canada said Monday they are looking into the case of a man who recently traveled from Liberia and is exhibiting symptoms consistent with viral hemorrhagic fevers.
