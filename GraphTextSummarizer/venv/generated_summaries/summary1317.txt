"It has been a very, very important day for Scottish football," SFL chief executive David Longmuir told a press conference. -- Glasgow Rangers, one of European football's most famous clubs, must play in the fourth flight of their domestic league next season, Scottish Football League (SFL) clubs decided Friday. They were subsequently expelled from the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and had to turn to the lesser SFL for next season. "This decision maintains the sporting integrity that clubs and fans across Scotland have been calling for but it also impacts massively on Scottish football as a whole and only time will tell what the consequences will be. But that decision is likely to have severe financial implications for Scottish football, which has struggled to attract the cash lavished on the English Premier League (EPL) south of the border.
