Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to Britain, reacted quickly to the prime minister's remark, saying that Hamas is responsible for the misery in Gaza and raised the issue of Shalit's captivity. Noam Shalit, the soldier's father, recently appealed directly to Palestinians in Gaza to put pressure on their Hamas leadership for a prisoner swap during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends September 9. The issue of Shalit came up after British Prime Minister David Cameron issued tough talk about the Palestinian territory of Gaza during a visit to Turkey, comments seen as criticism of Israel. "I would welcome any release of Palestinian prisoners, but I would welcome the release of one Israeli prisoner," said the emotional Shalit, raising a solitary finger. Israel immediately launched a military incursion into Gaza to rescue Shalit, then 19, but failed to free him.
