We had many more things in common: small town Midwestern backgrounds, and we both moved to big cities to pursue the unlikely dream of being an actor. Now Emerson is on the island of Manhattan, filming "Person of Interest," one of the top dramas on television. What if it were more surreal or absurd, where characters from "Person of Interest" walked into "Big Bang Theory" or something like that? I'm happy that my character on "Person of Interest" has enough ambiguity that it's still compelling in that villain way, except he's not. I shot a few scenes with her on "Person of Interest," which was a great pleasure.
