Keenan Draughon of Clarksville, Tennessee, was arrested after he checked two handguns, two defaced rifles and two unloaded high-capacity magazines, according to Port Authority spokesperson Joseph Pentangelo. He had checked the weapons in gun cases at Terminal 8, according to Pentangelo. "It's unusual, but it's not remarkable," Pentangelo told CNN about the case. Rifles and shotguns are legal to carry if unloaded with a proper permit, according to Pentangelo. The two rifles were defaced, one with purple paint and the other with silver paint, covering the serial numbers, which is a crime, according to Pentangelo.
