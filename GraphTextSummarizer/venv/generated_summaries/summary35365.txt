"I'm no royal watcher, but love choice new family made to release photos snapped by baby George grampa. Most seem to agree that Michael Middleton, father of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and granddad to Prince George of Cambridge, should leave royal photography to the professionals. But at the same time, they certainly don't have the same shine and pop and feeling of grandeur that you often see from official royal family photos." Prince William and Catherine, the latter holding Prince George swaddled in a white blanket, are posed on the lawn of her parents' home in Berkshire with the sun behind them, a difficult shot to pull off. However, John Keatley, an editorial and celebrity photographer in Seattle, told CNN that taking such informal pictures jars the royal "brand."
