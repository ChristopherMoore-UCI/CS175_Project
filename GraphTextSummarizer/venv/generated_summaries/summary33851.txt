The home side were lacking regular captain John Terry and star striker Wayne Rooney, but were rewarded for a dogged display against a Spain side who had the bulk of possession but created few chances. -- England battled to a morale-boosting 1-0 win over world champions Spain at Wembley Saturday with their stand-in captain Frank Lampard scoring the only goal early in the second half. Spain, who had not lost to England for 10 years, continued to force the home side back, with Tottenham midfielder Scott Parker outstanding in a rearguard action, being named man of the match. David Villa's volleyed shot hit the post with England goalkeeper Joe Hart beaten and substitute Cesc Fabregas sent a late effort wide from an excellent scoring position. In other international friendly action Saturday, Wales continued their fine recent form with a 4-1 home win over Norway in Cardiff.
