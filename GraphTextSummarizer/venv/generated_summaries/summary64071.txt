The reports come two days after a witness said that tens of thousands of people chanted anti-government slogans before the funeral of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution who went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics. Montazeri, for example, took a public stand against nuclear weapons in October, issuing a fatwa, or religious edict, declaring them to be "un-Islamic" and instructing Muslims to take the lead in banning them, said Nazenin Ansari, diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper Kayhan in London. Montazeri had a very large public following, especially since the June elections and all his statements in favor of human rights," Ansari said He was once a confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran for a decade after the revolution. In the past six months, Montazeri had become the voice of the reformist movement on key foreign policy issues, Khonsari said. His death is "a terrible blow for the (reformist) green movement and everybody who has been active these past few months," said Mehrdad Khonsari, a senior research consultant at the Centre for Arab and Iranian Studies in London.
