Anger over Greece's austerity measures exploded in the streets of Athens early Monday as tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in riots that left 106 police officers and dozens of civilians injured, according to police. The riot, widely described as one of the worst in Athens since Greece began dealing with its crippling debt crisis in 2010, broke out after the Greek Parliament approved a new package of austerity measures in return for a new eurozone bailout of the debt-stricken country. In May of that year, three people died when a fire bomb hit a bank in central Athens during protests over austerity measures.

The bailout deal, which would result in significant losses for bondholders, is intended to help reduce Greece's debts to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020, from about 160% currently.
