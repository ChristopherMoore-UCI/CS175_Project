In 2010, amid increasing tensions of Iran's nuclear program, the United States instituted sanctions that U.S. officials described as "unprecedented." -- U.S. sanctions also targeted groups in Iran -- such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij Resistance Force, and Iran's Law Enforcement Forces -- as well as several individuals in Iran. -- The history of U.S. sanctions against Iran dates as far back as 1979, when hostages were held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. U.S. sanctions: -- As a result of the hostage crisis in 1979, the U.S. government froze Iranian government assets in the United States and U.S. banks overseas, totaling $12 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury. Two years later, the United States banned "virtually all trade and investment activities with Iran by U.S. persons, wherever located." --
