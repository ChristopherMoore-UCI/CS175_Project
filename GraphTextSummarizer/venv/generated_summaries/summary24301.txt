Apple tends to release new products on Fridays, giving them a full weekend to rack up sales while excitement is high. When the two new tablets were unveiled last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new Mini, with a speedier processor and the same high-definition "retina display" as its bigger cousins, would be released "later in November. " Speculation -- and when is even the most minor of Apple releases not preceded with flurries of speculation? -- has begun to center on November 22 as a likely release date. There was no word Tuesday on a release date for the updated version of Apple's tinier tablet, four days after its larger sibling, the new iPad Air, went on sale. Waiting a week later than the 22nd would have the Mini released on Black Friday, when it would face an avalanche of competition as virtually everyone in the electronics field will be offering post-Thanksgiving sales.
