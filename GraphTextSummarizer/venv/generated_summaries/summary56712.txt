Ferdinand is the brother of Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand, whose comments about former England colleague Cole and strained relations with onetime defensive partner Terry have contributed to what one leading football official has described as a "'mafia feud". "We are driven to conclude not just that it is 'highly unlikely' that Mr. Ferdinand accused Mr. Terry on the pitch of calling him a 'black c***', but that he did not," the FA commission wrote. "At no point is his demeanor and facial expression that of someone who is imploring, injured, or even quizzical in the face of an unfounded allegation by Mr. Ferdinand that he (Mr. Terry) had just been racially abusive towards him (Mr. Ferdinand). The 31-year-old took to Twitter to refute the findings of an FA disciplinary panel which cast "considerable doubt" over evidence he gave in defense of former England captain John Terry, who was found guilty last month of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. "A much more plausible and likely explanation is that Mr. Terry was angry; angry at Mr. Ferdinand's taunting and provocation of him, angry at the way the match had gone, and angry at the way in which it seemed likely to end.
