-- Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, visited Nagasaki on Tuesday, one of two Japanese cities on which the United States dropped atomic bombs during the final days of World War II. "President Kennedy was very proud that he was able to start the process of nuclear disarmament, and all of our family shares the commitment," she said. The bombing of Nagasaki took place three days after the United States had dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima. In comments at the museum, she referenced her late father, former President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy, who took up the position of ambassador last month, toured the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and talked with survivors of the nuclear blast that devastated much of the city on August 9, 1945.
