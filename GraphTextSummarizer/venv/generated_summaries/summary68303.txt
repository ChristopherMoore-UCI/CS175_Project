I did appreciate that this week's ridiculous Ford Music Video, which took place in a "haunted house" (Ryan could barely get that out without guffawing), could easily have doubled as an ad for Hi-C's Ecto-Cooler. Daughtry, who used to have a first name but nope not anymore, showed up all high on life from Tuesday night's hookup with Colton Dixon at the Belmont. Randy dismissed Shannon immediately following her "sing for your life" rehash of "One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men, but earlier in the episode Ryan Seacrest confirmed that the judges will get to use a "save" in this season's horse race. This time, Ryan tried to blame Colton's obscure song choice from Wednesday's performance show. No offense to high school volleyball player Shannon Magrane (I totally just teared up watching her famous baseball dad's proud-papa reaction to her highlight reel), but I'm glad someone went home last night.
