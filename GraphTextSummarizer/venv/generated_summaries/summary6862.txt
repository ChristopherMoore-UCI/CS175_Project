But three models, including the Chevy Cruze produced by General Motors, and the Volkswagen Beetle, posted marginal results and fell short of the loftiest rating for comprehensive safety, which also factors in results from other IIHS front, side, rollover and rear crash tests. Volkswagen said in a statement that it is "passionately committed to building the safest vehicles available to the public and has already begun to incorporate this latest knowledge into the design and engineering of our cars going forward." GM also noted variables unique to each vehicle that are required to perform well in safety tests. The 2013 two- and four-door Civics turned in a "good" performance -- the highest score -- in a new type of tough front crash test earlier this year to earn the highest accolade from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Car companies designed models to perform better in the latest frontal and other tough crash tests, but some still need to address concerns. The federal government conducts separate crash tests and posts its own safety ratings.
