"Mars has always fascinated us, and the things Curiosity tells us about it will help us learn about whether or not life was possible there," said Charles Bolden, the NASA administrator. Curiosity is sending back more data from the surface of Mars than the combined results of all of NASA's previous rovers, the space agency said. The Black Eyed Peas singer wrote the song, "Reaching for the Stars," to mark the successful landing of NASA's Curiosity rover on the Red Planet this month. "And what future human explorers can expect, will.i.am has provided the first song on our playlist of Mars exploration." While will.i.am has the first song, NASA also accomplished another feat this week.
