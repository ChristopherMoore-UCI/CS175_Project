ACTED says it has developed programs in many countries to help people affected by wars, natural disasters, economic problems and social crises. The staffers were abducted Monday in the Almar district of Faryab province in northern Afghanistan, said Adrien Tomarchio, press officer for a Paris-based non-governmental organization called the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development. The group has been working in Faryab province for more than nine years and has been engaged in development and community health projects there. Tomarchio told CNN in an e-mail Tuesday that they were freed "unharmed." Ahmad Jaweed Bedar, the Faryab governor's spokesman, said the Taliban kidnapped the four and took their vehicle, a Toyota Hilux Surf. Zeenat Garewal, ACTED country manager, said three of the staffers were community health trainers and one was a driver.
