The Belgian has topped the world rankings, celebrated four grand slam triumphs and earned over $24 million in prize money before calling time on her glittering career at this year's U.S. Open, but she hopes daughter Jada can find a profession away from the court. She won that year's U.S. Open as a wildcard, becoming the first mother to clinch a major championship since Australia's Evonne Goolagong in 1980. Clijsters said that only since retiring has she been able to see what their achievements meant to Belgian tennis fans. That win has become famous for the on-court celebration between mother and daughter, and Clijsters ranks the victory as the most emotional of her career -- coming less than a year after the death of her father. Her exploits raised the profile of tennis in Belgium, and her rivalry with Justine Henin was keenly fought, with Clijsters winning 13 of their 25 meetings -- although Henin won all three of their grand slam final matches.
