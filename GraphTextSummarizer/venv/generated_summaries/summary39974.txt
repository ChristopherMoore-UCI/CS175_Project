Fight for your rights -- or simply vote, as 68% of single women did for one candidate over another, and let it be understood that your interests are not in the economy, but your own sex life and your need for free birth control. We need them whether we are single by choice, through separation, divorce, or bereavement or because this, for you, is how life has turned out. Doesn't it suggest that, withered, alone and childless, you have failed at life? I must realize I am failing at life. But then single people are most often defined by their sex life, muddily defined at that.
