De Rosnay explained: "When we started to make this record, we noticed that electronic music was being portrayed as music for the night and the cities. In addition to installations like David Bowie's "Life on Mars" revisited by Mick Rock and Barney Clay, a cocoon of light and sound by filmmaker Jonathan Glazer and Spiritualized's J. Spaceman, interconnected floor panels by Cantoni and Crescenti that undulate when you walk on them and the massive, responsive light cube by United Visual Artists, there were films by Spike Jonze and Arcade Fire as well as a screening of Kevin Macdonald's user-generated film "Life in a Day." Dressed in a sheer button-down shirt and long skirt, the flame-headed Florence Welch belted out new numbers, "Never Let Me Go," "Heartlines," "Spectrum" and the previously released single "What the Water Gave Me." Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Aug√© of Justice played a DJ set at the event and gave a small preview of their new album "Audio, Video, Disco," (due October 24), but nothing too much. -- The Creators Project, a partnership between Vice Media and Intel, took over the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, on October 15 and 16 to continue its mission to bring art, music and tech together in exciting and unexpected ways. So if you listen to this album as electronic music for DJs, it may be a little bit of a disturbing experience.
