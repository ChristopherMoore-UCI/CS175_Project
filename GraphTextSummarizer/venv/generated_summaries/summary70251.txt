One Ryder Cup player who will be lining up at Mission Hills in Shenzen for Thursday's opening round is Woods' U.S. teammate and great rival Phil Mickelson. The growing rivalry between McIlroy and Woods is proving to be a big drawcard for golf, as witnessed by the chaotically enthusiastic scenes in Monday's one-off clash between the pair. He won the second major title of his career at August's PGA Championship, adding to his 2011 U.S. Open triumph, as well as helping Europe retain the Ryder Cup in Illinois thanks to a stunning comeback victory against a U.S. team including Woods. I feel that over the next two years, we'll still have the same disappointment from not winning this year's Ryder Cup." Mickelson has won this event on two previous occasions when it was held in Shanghai, and he is confident of more success at its new home. After dropping out of the top 50 of the world rankings in October 2011, Woods has bounced back in 2012 by winning three PGA Tour events and he is second on the U.S.-based circuit's money list behind its winner McIlroy.
