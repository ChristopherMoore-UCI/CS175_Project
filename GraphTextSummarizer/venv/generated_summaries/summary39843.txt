Like the wider Syrian conflict, Yarmouk has a human face; the faces of young Mohammad and young Jihad. I encountered two such individuals on my mission to Damascus -- Jihad and Mohammad -- tiny, vulnerable infants who were taken from Yarmouk in recent days, a place that was described last week by the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as "the deepest circle of hell." I will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside Yarmouk, other civilians who need help where they are. Thousands of Syrian and Palestinian refugees trapped in the Yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities. Because to abandon such belief would be to abandon Jihad, Mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them.
