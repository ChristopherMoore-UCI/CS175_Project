-- Fresh pro-British protests erupted Saturday in the Northern Ireland city of Belfast, police said, hours after nine officers were hurt in rioting. The recent violence follows more than a decade during which Northern Ireland has made steady progress toward lasting peace and stability. Tensions have been high since city council members there voted a month ago to stop flying the Union flag year-round, restricting it instead to certain days. Another officer was hurt Friday in the Newtownabbey area, police said, where bottles and bricks were thrown at police in the course of a protest lasting several hours. Officers came under sustained attack in east Belfast from more than 100 people, some throwing fireworks and bricks, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said Saturday.
