CNN journalists discovered her in Hannibal Gadhafi's plush home after anti-Gadhafi forces overran Tripoli and Hannibal Gadhafi and his wife fled to Algeria. When she couldn't keep one from crying, Aline, the wife of Gadhafi's son Hannibal, poured boiling water on her head. Now, CNN is working with several agencies to make sure that Mullah gets proper care and that she can get back home to her family after her nightmare under the Gadhafis. Apparently, it was not just Mullah who suffered as servants of Hannibal Gadhafi's family. Another foreign nanny contacted CNN and described Aline Gadhafi as a "sadist" and a "psychologically sick" woman.
