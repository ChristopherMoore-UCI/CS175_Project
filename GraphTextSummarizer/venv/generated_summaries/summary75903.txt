The Centers for Disease Control and Infection and the states' health departments have been testing samples of open containers of infant formula, according to the CDC's Dr. Robert Tauxe, and the Food and Drug Administration has been testing samples of unopened powdered formula. The Illinois Health Department says "formula can become contaminated with C. sakazakii through the raw products used to make the formula, contamination after pasteurization or during preparation of reconstituted formula for infant feeding." There are steps parents can take to reduce infection in newborn babies: -- Prepare only a small amount of reconstituted formula for each feeding so as to reduce the amount of time the formula is held at room temperature. However, at this time, it has not been established that infant formula was the source of either of the latest infections, according to the CDC. Commercially prepared liquid infant formula is generally safe because it's been canned, Tauxe said, but powdered infant formula is not completely sterile.
