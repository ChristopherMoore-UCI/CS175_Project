Last year, the South Korean Kim got word through government channels that his sister was alive, in North Korea. The family took part in family reunions that began October 30 and will end Friday at Mount Kumgang, the two Koreas' joint mountain resort in the North. "I felt relieved to hear she had worked as a nurse and later became a doctor, that probably means she had a better life" than many North Koreans. "She told us that when the North and South Korean family meetings started, she was upset that no one in her family had looked for her," he said. Numbers are unknown in the secretive North.
