Gen. Carter Ham, then the commander of U.S. Africa Command, has warned Congress that Boko Haram elements "aspire to a broader regional level of attacks," including against United States and European interests. The State Department hinted at this issue in its announcement designating Boko Haram and Ansaru as terrorist groups. -- The State Department on Wednesday designated Nigeria-based Boko Haram and its offshoot Ansaru as "terrorist organizations," legally enabling Washington to take various steps against the groups, their members and their supporters. The decision to designate Boko Haram and Ansaru as terrorist organizations followed a robust debate. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sacrilege" in the Hausa-Fulani language, has launched a self-described "war on Christians" and seeks to impose a strict version of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria, if not the entire country.
