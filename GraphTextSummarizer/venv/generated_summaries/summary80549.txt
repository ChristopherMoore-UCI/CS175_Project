At least three people died when a suicide bomb exploded near Afghanistan's Kandahar airfield Thursday, hours after U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had left the city. Panetta made the comments after meeting with Karzai in Kabul, and a U.S. official released a formal statement about that possible visit, which may come in January. President Barack Obama and Panetta invited Afghan President Harmid Karzai to visit Washington early next year to discuss the volatile security situation. The attack struck an MRAP, the acronym for a Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle used by U.S. forces, as it was about to enter the base. The meeting will be an important opportunity to discuss implementation of the strategic partnership signed by the two leaders about U.S. military presence in the country, it explained.
