The time is nearing for a potentially definitive U.S. response to alleged Syrian government atrocities and an increasingly violent military crackdown in Egypt, President Barack Obama said in an exclusive interview broadcast Friday on CNN's "New Day." " A new push on college affordability Obama spoke to CNN on the first day of a bus tour selling his new higher education affordability proposal, which includes a  plan to create a college ratings system designed to better inform parents and students while pressuring colleges and universities to lower skyrocketing tuition costs. "I am sympathetic to Senator McCain's passion for helping people work through what is an extraordinarily difficult and heartbreaking situation, both in Syria and in Egypt," Obama replied. Obama: Conservatives, liberals share blame on college cost spike So why are we even talking about?" As for shutting down the government, that's "bad for not just people who work for the government, but all the contractors ... and the defense folks and everybody who is impacted by the services that they receive from the federal government," Obama said.
