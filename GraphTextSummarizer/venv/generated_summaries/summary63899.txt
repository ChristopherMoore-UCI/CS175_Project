" Eighth seed Almagro advanced courtesy of a straight-sets 7-6 6-3 victory against Tsonga's compatriot Richard Gasquet. Federer, 30, looked to have given himself a chance of winning the contest at the Uniprix Stadium when he claimed the second set, but world number 16 Tsonga rallied to emphatically clinch the third and deciding set in convincing style. -- Third seed Roger Federer has crashed out of the Rogers Cup in Montreal, after losing 7-6 4-6 6-1 to Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Thursday. In a repeat of their recent Wimbledon quarterfinal, 13th seed Tsonga defeated the 16-time grand slam winner to set up a last eight clash with Spaniard Nicolas Almagro. "[This] is the match I played best," said Tsonga reflecting on his previous encounters with Federer.
