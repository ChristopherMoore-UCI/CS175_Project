More than two out of every five middle- and high-school students who smoke report using flavored little cigars or flavored cigarettes, according to the report. The Waxman letter warns "tobacco companies are succeeding in developing a new market by selling flavored cigars to young smokers." The report was the CDC's first attempt to measure flavored little cigar and flavored cigarette use among kids. Flavored cigars account for 80% of those sales. The law did not, however, ban flavored cigars.
