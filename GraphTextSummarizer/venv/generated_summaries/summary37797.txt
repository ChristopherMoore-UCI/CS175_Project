Storm systems continue to hammer states with drenching rain and significant flash flooding. Of particular concern Friday are parts of southeast Kansas and southern Missouri, which have seen up to 10 inches of rain this week, with more expected over the weekend. They include parts of Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky, where forecasters say more than 2 inches of rain may fall in a short period of time Friday. In South Carolina, Logan Dale Evans was found dead in floodwater on his family property Wednesday night near the town of Central, Pickens County Coroner Kandy Kelley said. On Monday, Elijah Lee, 4, died after 6 inches of rain fell on Pulaski County, about 140 miles southwest of St. Louis.
