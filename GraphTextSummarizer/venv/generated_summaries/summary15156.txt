The Spanish law of 2010 restricted abortions in later gestations, but did establish abortion on request earlier in pregnancy. What it means is that Spanish women, like Irish women, will be forced to travel for care to Britain and other European countries. The reality was that doctors in Spain were, at that time, legally able to provide abortions at later gestations than the 24-week "time limit" permitted by British law. Yet barely five years on, Spanish women find themselves effectively deprived of any ability to access abortion at any gestation. Throughout most countries in the developed world, with notable exceptions such as the Republic of Ireland, women's need for abortion is recognized by law and provided for through services, which are often publicly funded.
