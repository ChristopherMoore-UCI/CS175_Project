"We will follow U.S. and its allies all over the world, even if they are in Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore, Afghanistan or in U.S." Seven of the dead were security personnel, and two were a mother and daughter on their way to school, Lahore government official Khalid Ranjha said. The compound was in the town of Miranshah in North Waziristan, one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, officials said. The bombing was in an affluent part of Model Town in Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city. "I am proud to accept the responsibility of the Lahore suicide blast," Tariq wrote in a text message to CNN. Azam Tariq, spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said the attack was in response to U.S. aggression against Muslims around the world.
