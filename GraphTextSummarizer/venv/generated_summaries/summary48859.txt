His name is Eric LeGrand, and you'll find him Saturday on the field at Rutgers Stadium in New Jersey. LeGrand has made inspiring others a goal for his life, regularly speaking to youth and school groups around New Jersey. "Just right away, he had this positive energy and positive outlook on life," said Alex Morgan, the breakout star for the U.S. women's soccer team who became friends with him at a professional game in July. LeGrand, 21, has a way of touching people he's met, from professional athletes to his teammates to the more than 26,000 fans who follow him on Twitter. He has spent time with nearly all the professional teams in the New York area, including Yankees stars Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez.
