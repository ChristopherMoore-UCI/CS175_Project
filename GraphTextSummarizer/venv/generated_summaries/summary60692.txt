A plea for political civility similar to the one that followed the assassination attempt against former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords may be the only response to LePage that has a chance, although he only insults fellow Maine Republicans who try to cajole him into civility. The latest report of an abusive outburst from petulant Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage is just the most recent in a continuous stream of invective dating back to his 2010 campaign and the beginning of his term in 2011. LePage hired an out-of-state sign maker to produce and erect a message at the Maine border with New Hampshire that "Maine is open for business." He has attacked Maine Democrats, infamously and crudely saying that one state legislative leader was the first to stick it to the people of Maine without using Vaseline. " However painful it is to see how much LePage has ruined the public's opinion of Maine, I am resigned to the probability that his pattern of bullying and blustering followed by defensive claims of populism is likely to end only when he leaves office.
