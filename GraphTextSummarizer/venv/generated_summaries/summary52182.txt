The inmate, Abraham Pearson, was spotted walking in a Detroit neighborhood Monday night, said Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon. Pearson was facing sentencing on Monday on carjacking and armed robbery charges. Authorities said Pearson attacked a deputy with a sharpened comb in front of two other inmates inside a holding cell at the Frank Murphy Hall Monday morning. Tolliver is a retired Detroit police officer who joined the Sheriff's Office in December. The Dodge was recovered and the officer's uniform was found under a vehicle near Beaubien Street in Detroit.
