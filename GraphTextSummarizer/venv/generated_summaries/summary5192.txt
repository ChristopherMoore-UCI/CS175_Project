The death toll for campaign staff and election workers in the run-up to the vote now stands at 21, according to Tabish Forugh of Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission. Elsewhere, an international forces service member shot a protester who aimed his AK-47 toward a guard tower at a NATO military base in southern Afghanistan, military officials said Thursday. Afghanistan's interior ministry announced it will deploy 52,000 police, soldiers and national security officers on election day. Also in southern Afghanistan, two international service members were killed Thursday in a bombing and an insurgent attack. The attack occurred in a remote district of Afghanistan's northern Balkh province Wednesday morning, said Munir Ahmmad Farhad, a spokesman for the provincial governor.
