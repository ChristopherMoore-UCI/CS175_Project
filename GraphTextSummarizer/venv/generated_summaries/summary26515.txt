Lenny Kyle Dykstra, 48, of Murrieta, California, was charged with 13 counts: bankruptcy fraud, obstruction of justice, four counts of concealing property from the bankruptcy estate, three counts of embezzlement from the bankruptcy estate, and four counts of making false declarations to bankruptcy court, according to a statement from spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. By the time Dykstra filed for bankruptcy in July 2009, he had accumulated loans totaling $21 million, bankruptcy records show. Last month, Dykstra was arrested and charged with bankruptcy fraud, and he was released on $150,000 bond and ordered to seek outpatient substance abuse treatment. After filing for bankruptcy protection, Dykstra allegedly "looted" his Sherwood Estates mansion in Thousand Oaks, California, lied about who stripped the mansion, and denied receiving money for having sold items that were owned by the bankruptcy estate, Mrozek said. -- Lenny Dykstra, a three-time major league All-Star outfielder who played for the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, was indicted Friday for bankruptcy fraud for allegedly selling items from his $18 million mansion in Ventura County, a federal prosecutor said.
