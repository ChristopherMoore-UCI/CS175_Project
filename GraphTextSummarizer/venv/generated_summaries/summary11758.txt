"We've got lots of crews out there trying to hold that line, trying to protect that wildlife refuge," Forest Service public information officer Haven Cook said. Cook said while the fire is 75% contained, dealing with a fire in swamp can be tricky. "The tower is fine; so is the historic Chesser Island homestead," Cook said. "This fire can go on for weeks until we get a good drenching rain," Cook said. -- Two fires have merged, coming dangerously close to protected areas in Florida's Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
