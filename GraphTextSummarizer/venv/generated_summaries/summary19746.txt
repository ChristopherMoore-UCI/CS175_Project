-- The United Nations humanitarian chief urged Sudan to allow aid workers into a Darfur refugee camp that has been closed for nearly two weeks, limiting access to 80,000 displaced people. The peacekeeping force said it will not do so unless the government pledges to give them a fair trial The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says constraints on aid agencies in the region have been steadily increasing since March 2009, when 11 international aid groups were expelled from Darfur. United Nations officials estimate that 300,000 people have died in the past seven years and more than 3 million displaced amid fighting between rebels and government forces. Sudanese authorities prevented aid agencies from entering Kalma camp and its surrounding areas after violence broke out earlier this month. "If access is not urgently restored, the situation risks deteriorating rapidly." Darfur, a province of Sudan, has suffered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, according to aid groups.
