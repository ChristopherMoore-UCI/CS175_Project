On June 21, Alabama Credit Union posted a note to its Facebook page saying donations were being funneled to an account there "owned by Ms. Harris to use purely at her own discretion -- but she clearly understands the intent of those donating to the fund." A detective also said Harris was exchanging sexually explicit text messages with various women while his son was locked inside the sweltering car, painting a much different portrait of Harris than the dedicated and doting family man described by friends and family. On Friday a second Georgia law enforcement agency said it is now inquiring about Justin Ross Harris' activities. It was not immediately known how much each service had collected, or if any of the money had reached the Harris family. The campaign was established after Cooper's father, Justin Ross Harris, was charged with murder and child cruelty in the June 18 death of his 22-month-old son.
