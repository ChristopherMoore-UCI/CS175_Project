But Kurdish ground forces, as well as airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition, recently have tried to cut off Mosul's lines of supply to ISIS in Syria, setting up what could be an eventual assault by the Iraqi military later this year to expel the terror group from the city. There are about 20,000 fighters in Syria who belong to terror groups such as ISIS, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center will tell a House committee on Wednesday, according to remarks obtained by CNN. Kurdish fighters battle equipment woes as well as ISIS in northern Iraq Iraqi ground forces could begin a move to retake the city as soon as April, a U.S. Central Command official told CNN last week. Few expect the Kurds to be involved in clearing Mosul of ISIS -- that would be a job for Iraqi government security forces. ISIS declared it had established a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria last year.
