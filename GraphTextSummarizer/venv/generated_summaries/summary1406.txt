The Harvard team members have created their own set of simple robots that they're trying to teach to emulate those termites. "Not the ones around here that destroy buildings, but the ones on other continents that build ... mounds more than 40 feet tall," said Justin Werfel, a staff scientist at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Rather than a robot being like a human, it's more like a bunch of robots that are like an ant colony." The power is in sending out a bunch of robots that are really simple and hoping that some of them will succeed." "If we wanted to have a Mars base and we could send a team of robots on ahead to build the habitat first, that's obviously a big advantage for the human astronauts who would show up later," he said.
