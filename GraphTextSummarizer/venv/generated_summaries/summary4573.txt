It was the first time a tsunami has been observed on radar, said Professor John Largier, an oceanographer at the University of California at Davis and an author of a new paper describing the work. Such a detection system could provide a 15-minute warning for a tsunami approaching northern California and an early warning of an hour for southern California, where the shallow continental shelf along the coast is bigger, Largier said. For the past decade, Largier and his colleagues have used a high-frequency radar array at the university's Bodega Marine Lab to study ocean currents off California. Researchers from Hokkaido and Kyoto universities in Japan and San Francisco State University and Largier used data from radar sites at Bodega Bay; Trinidad, Calif.; and two sites in Hokkaido, Japan, to look for the tsunami offshore. It's a software challenge that we show we can achieve" for the West Coast, Largier told CNN Tuesday.
