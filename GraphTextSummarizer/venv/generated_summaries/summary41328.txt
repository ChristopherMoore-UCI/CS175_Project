-- As a new round of French military strikes targeted Islamist rebels in Mali on Sunday, both sides of the fight said they were determined to win. British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to "provide logistical military assistance to help transport foreign troops and equipment quickly to Mali," but no British personnel in a combat role, a Downing Street spokesman said. The Economic Community of West African States plans to hold an emergency meeting in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to prepare to send troops to Mali to help government forces, a spokesman for the organization said. French fighter jets bombed rebel training camps and other targets in northern Mali, France's Defense Ministry said in a statement.
