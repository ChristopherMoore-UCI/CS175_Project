City's former Italian coach and Tevez endured a difficult relationship with the Argentine's apparent refusal to warm up during a Champions League tie at Bayern Munich in September 2011. " Tevez's new club, Juventus, last won the Champions League back in 1996 and reached the quarterfinals last season before losing to eventual champion Bayern Munich. -- Over a billion dollars was spent, the English Premier League title was won, its neighbors' feathers were duly ruffled, but the pressure to adapt to European football proved too much for Manchester City says Carlos Tevez. But Tevez is aware of how such pressure can be detrimental to a team's chances of success with City just one example of how players can be adversely affected. But it was the club's failure in European competition which left a sour taste in Tevez's mouth with City failing to in their bid to compete with the continent's biggest clubs.
