In Gaza, "Some 200 radical Islamists tried to storm the French cultural centre in Gaza City on Monday, shouting slogans threatening the lives of staff over Charlie Hebdo cartoons," AFP reported, adding that the protesters chanted "'Damnation upon France!' In Senegal and Mauritania, protesters torched French flags, the French news agency France24 reported. The paper quoted one protester, Abu Abdallah Makdissi, as saying, "Today, we are telling France and world countries that while Islam orders us to respect all religions, it also orders us to punish and kill those who assault and offend Islam's Prophet Mohammed." In Karachi, Pakistan, police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the French consulate. AFP, the France-based news wire service, said police reported that 173 people have been injured; at least 45 churches have been "set ablaze in the capital (Niamey) alone," and a "Christian school and orphanage were also set alight."
