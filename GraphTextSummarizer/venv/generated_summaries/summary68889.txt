The murder case will proceed against Pedro Hernandez -- accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, who disappeared on his way to a New York City school bus stop in 1979 -- after a judge on Wednesday denied a motion to dismiss the case, a court official said. Hernandez confessed in May 2012 to killing Patz more than three decades ago, when he was a stock clerk in Lower Manhattan. The defendant's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, said that while he believes Hernandez shouldn't face murder charges, he's not surprised by the decision. Police said Hernandez admitted he choked the boy after luring him into the basement of the bodega where he worked, which Etan would pass en route to the bus. Patz's plight catapulted concern for missing children to the national forefront after authorities put his image on thousands of milk cartons, a technique that would become more common in the next few years.
