Hawaii Police have confirmed they have arrested a 32-year-old man on charges of identity theft, attempted theft and unauthorized possession of confidential personal information. There has been a new twist in the curious case of leading golfer Robert Allenby who last month reported being beaten and kidnapped in Hawaii. "Investigators identified numerous unauthorized charges made on Mr. Allenby's credit cards. But a woman who witnessed the incident later told Australian network Nine News that she found Allenby a block from the wine bar and not 10 kilometers away as he had suggested. "Honolulu police booked a 32-year-old male this afternoon for three counts of second-degree identity theft, three counts of second-degree attempted theft, and one count of unauthorized possession of confidential personal information," the police statement read.
