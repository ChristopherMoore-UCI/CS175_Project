-- A jury in the case of two former personal assistants accused of defrauding celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi was sent out Thursday but has not yet reached a verdict. The Italian sisters have told Isleworth Crown Court in west London that Lawson authorized their personal expenditures on Saatchi's company credit cards, including on designer shoes, clothes and trips abroad. Francesca Grillo is accused of defrauding Lawson and Saatchi of 580,000 pounds ($950,000), and Elisabetta Grillo is accused of defrauding them of 105,000 pounds ($172,000). The case has gripped UK media, thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. Elisabetta Grillo's defense lawyer, Anthony Metzer, told the jury that his client was the "soft underbelly" by which Saatchi was attacking Lawson after the breakdown of their relationship.
