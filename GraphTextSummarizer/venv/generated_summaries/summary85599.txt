FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke added: "Even though Mexico, one of the biggest football nations on earth and host of two FIFA World Cups, has finally opted to withdraw its bid to stage a third edition, FIFA wishes to thank the whole Mexican football family for having taken part in this process. South Korea and Qatar will compete with the other eight bids to host the 2022 World Cup, with FIFA set to decide on the hosts of both events in December 2010. "In Mexico we do have a sufficient number of stadia to stage the contest, but the majority of these were built several years ago to meet old FIFA requirements," the statement continued. -- The Mexican Football Federation have pulled out of the bidding process for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups because of financial concerns during the current economic downturn. "We obviously fully respect this decision and are very much looking forward to continued cooperation with the Mexican Football Federation as another very nice goal approaches, namely the FIFA Under-17 World Cup 2011, for which the preparations are well on track."
