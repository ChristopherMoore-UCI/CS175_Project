"A big artillery shell hit a nearby building as we were being taken to new areas where Al Shabaab took control in north Mogadishu," journalist Abdirisak Black told CNN. The organization called on all parties in the conflict in Mogadishu to cease hostilities and to desist from taking their conflict to journalists and unarmed civilians. -- Eight journalists were wounded Tuesday in an attack at a police school in Abdiasis district of northern Mogadishu, the National Union of Somali Journalists said in a news release. The Ethiopians remained until early 2009 when the TFG took tentative control, clinging to a small part of Mogadishu, and protected by African Union (AU) peacekeepers mainly from Uganda and Burundi. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow in Mogadishu and CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this story.
