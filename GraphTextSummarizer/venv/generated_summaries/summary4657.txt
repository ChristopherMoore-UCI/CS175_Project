"And so we've been very clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against what I consider to be inexcusable attacks from Hamas." -- President Barack Obama used the annual White House Iftar dinner Monday evening to briefly discuss the crises unfolding in the Mideast. On the growing conflict between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza, the President staunchly defended Israel's right to defend its borders. The White House Iftar dinner was started by former President Bill Clinton. The President also said, "The pictures we are seeing in Gaza and Israel are heart wrenching."
