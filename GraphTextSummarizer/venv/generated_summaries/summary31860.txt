"Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. According to a post on his Twitter page, which is maintained by his grandson Brian Musial Schwarze, Musial died at 5:45 p.m. (6:45 p.m. ET) Saturday of natural causes. And Musial was active in the community, contributing to causes such as the USO, the Senior Olympics, the Boy Scouts and Covenant House. During and after his playing career, Musial developed a special relationship with the St. Louis fan base, who knew him simply as "Stan the Man. He has since been surpassed in some of those categories, but he still ranks fourth in baseball history in total hits, behind only Pete Rose, Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron.
