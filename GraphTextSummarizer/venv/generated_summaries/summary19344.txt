President Barack Obama will ease sanctions imposed against Cuba under the U.S. embargo after Cuba agreed to release American aid worker Alan Gross. The U.S. began imposing sanctions against Cuba after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959 and soon after nationalized more than $1 billion in American assets on the island. The agreement will deliver the most sweeping changes in the U.S. policy toward the nation that lies just 100 miles off the U.S. coast since the U.S. embargo on Cuba started in the early 1960s. Cuba said in 2011 that the economic damage of the U.S. embargo has topped $1 trillion in its five decade history. The U.S. will ease travel restrictions, making it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business there.
