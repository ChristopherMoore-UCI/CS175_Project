It was complex before WikiLeaks, and it is complex after WikiLeaks, perhaps more complex." Publicly, the State Department says there has been no request from Libya to remove Cretz, and P.J. Crowley, State Department spokesman, insisted in his daily briefing that "he is still our ambassador to Libya." Crowley, however, added, "One of the issues we will be discussing with Ambassador Cretz is his return to Libya." The United States might replace its ambassador to Libya after WikiLeaks published his colorful cables to Washington about the eccentricities of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, complicating relations with the notoriously sensitive regime. On an ongoing basis we are evaluating whether any changes will have to be made." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, wants U.S. diplomats to continue providing candid and unvarnished feedback to Washington, the official said. The fallout from WikiLeaks continues to roil U.S. diplomatic relations and, according to the senior official speaking on background, Libya is not the only country to be affected. Ambassador Gene Cretz, a career diplomat named to the post in 2008, is back in Washington for consultations with the State Department.
