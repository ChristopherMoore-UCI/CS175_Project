Newt Gingrich offered his second wife a choice of an open marriage or a divorce when he revealed to her he was having an affair with the woman he later made his third wife, Marianne Gingrich said in interviews with ABC News and The Washington Post. " The Gingrich daughters wrote that they were confident South Carolina voters were more interested in what their father has to say "about job creation, lower taxes, and about who can defeat Barack Obama by providing the sharpest contrast to his damaging, extreme liberalism." "Our father is running for president because of his grandchildren -- so they can inherit the America he loves," they wrote. He married Marianne Gingrich, who was a 28-year-old congressional staffer, six months after his divorce from his first wife, Jackie Gingrich, was final. Newt Gingrich was asked about the controversy Thursday morning while campaigning in Beaufort, South Carolina, where voters will cast ballots in the GOP primary Saturday. We offered several of them to ABC to prove it was false, (but) they weren't interested because they would like to attack any Republican." Marianne Gingrich's revelations echo what she told a reporter for an article published in Esquire magazine in August 2010, but it is the first time Marianne Gingrich has talked about it on camera.
