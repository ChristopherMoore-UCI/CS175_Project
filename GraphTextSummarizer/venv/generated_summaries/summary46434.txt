-- There's a reason they call Kimi Raikkonen the 'Iceman' so it's no surprise the Ferrari driver isn't allowing rumors surrounding his retirement to get him hot and bothered. It was during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July that rumors of Raikkonen's impending retirement began to surface. "The only thing that I said was that I will finish my career in Ferrari, F1 career in Ferrari, then people came up with 'it's end of this year, it's now, it's then'. Raikkonen's future has been the subject of much speculation with talk of him leaving the sport sweeping through the paddock over the past few weeks. " Ferrari is enduring a difficult time with the team having failed to win a drivers' title since Raikkonen triumphed in 2007, while it currently trails Mercedes by 292 points in the constructors' championship.
