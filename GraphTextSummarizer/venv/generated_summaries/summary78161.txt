The bill, which was approved by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and is now before the Senate, would rewrite some of the rules regarding protected areas, grant amnesty to illegal deforestation that occurred before July 2008, and give states greater control over preservation management. But opponents say easing deforestation laws will give a greenlight to developers and loggers to fell more of the Amazon Rainforest. Supporters say that the bill will help landowners, especially small ones -- a large number of whom currently violate existing conservation laws. -- Brazil's Catholic Church is the latest to publicly oppose a controversial revamping of the country's "Forest Code," which activists say would cause an environmental disaster. Once again, the church said it's goal with the Forest Code petition is to foment public discussion on the proposed bill.
