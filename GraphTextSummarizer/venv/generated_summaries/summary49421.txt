Police said that interviews with friends of the victims indicated that the two Britons may have only recently met while on the nearby larger island of Koh Phangan before traveling to Koh Tao for a party excursion. They have circulated photos of 10 people they are looking for among local authorities, said Col. Prachum Ruangthong, the police chief of the local precinct. The deaths on the small southern island of Koh Tao are being investigated as murders. A regional police official had earlier told CNN that people had been prevented from leaving Koh Tao, but Prachum said that wasn't the case. Authorities said it was the first homicide case on Koh Tao in at least eight years.
