Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs. The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground. Children who might be violent because they are desperate to escape an uncomfortable task or environment learn to communicate their discomfort in nonviolent ways. Staff are forbidden from saying anything negative about the children, parents or other teachers, even among themselves. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions.
