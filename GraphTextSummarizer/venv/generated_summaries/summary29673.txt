Kasem's corpse was taken from a Washington state funeral home last week before the radio icon's daughter could enforce a court order against it being removed, according to the director of Tacoma's Gaffney Funeral Home. Gaffney said Kasem was kept in his funeral home until he was instructed by Jean Kasem to send it to Montreal last week. Danny Deraney, a representative for Kerri Kasem, said Jean Kasem has the legal right to control her late husband's remains. "I think they have that right." Kerri Kasem is pushing for a new law in California to give adult children visitation rights with their aging or incapacitated parents. Kasem's wife, Jean Kasem, said she has been "blackmailed" by her husband's children for 35 years.
