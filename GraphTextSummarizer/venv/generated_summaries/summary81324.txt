Conclusion: While President Obama continued trade agreements begun under the previous administration, it is not accurate to assert that Obama has not signed any free trade agreements when, in fact, he has done so with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. An economist who follows trade policy, though, says that pursuing free-trade deals does not appear to be a top priority of the Obama administration. "He's basing it on an absurd premise that President Bush signed a couple of trade agreements, but the fact remains that the president renegotiated the trade agreements -- made them better for American workers, made them better for the American auto industry and the American meat industry -- and that's why we not only got them through Congress, but the president actually signed them into law. The term "new" in Romney's remarks concerning trade deals appears to be a reference to the fact that work on the three separate trade agreements began in 2007, when George W. Bush was president. "It takes a lot of capital to get trade deals through Congress, and it's particularly tough to do when the economy is weak," said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
