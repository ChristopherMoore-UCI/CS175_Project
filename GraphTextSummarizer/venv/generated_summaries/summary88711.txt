Although there is a slight possibility the whales could swim out during high tide, Mase said, "I wouldn't set out hope for that." "Even in high tide, you're going to have a series of sandbars and sand flats," she said. "We want to set the expectations low" that the 41 remaining stranded whales can be saved, said Blair Mase, a marine mammal scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The assessment came as the number of dead whales climbed to 10, including four euthanized by wildlife officials after being found in "poor condition," Mase said. It's difficult to explain why any particular mass stranding occurs, but they tend to occur in areas where previous strandings have occurred, during low tide -- particularly those around the new and full moons, in areas dotted with sand bars and during storms. Such strandings are common and occur in a variety of locations, said Phillip Clapham, director of the whale research program at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.
