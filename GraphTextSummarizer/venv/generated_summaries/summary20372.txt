FIFA intend for goal-line technology to be used at December's Club World Cup in Japan, and if successful it will also be implemented at the 2013 African Cup of Nations and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. "The Premier League has been a long-term advocate of goal line technology," read a statement on the organization's website. Two systems, designed by technology companies GoalRef and Hawk-Eye, have been approved after going through two phases of FIFA testing. If you say OK to goal-line technology, then it is offside technology, then penalty area technology, and we stop the football. UEFA chief opposed to goal-line technology FIFA president Sepp Blatter had previously opposed the move but said the turning point had been an incident at the 2010 World Cup involving a second round clash between England and Germany.
