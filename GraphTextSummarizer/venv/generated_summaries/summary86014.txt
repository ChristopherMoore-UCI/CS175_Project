"Our family thought that Ms. Rice was helping our father and watching over him while he was in Chicago," son Joey Banks said in a statement from the attorney. Banks family attorney Mark Bogen said Banks' agent, Regina Rice, had the octogenarian sign a new will three months before his death. "However, we have learned that she had him sign a power of attorney, a health care directive and a will giving everything to Ms. Rice." He said that before his father's sudden death, "we spoke often to Ms. Rice because she made it difficult for us to speak directly to him. "Words cannot express how important Ernie Banks will always be to the Chicago Cubs, the city of Chicago and Major League Baseball," Ricketts said after Banks' death.
