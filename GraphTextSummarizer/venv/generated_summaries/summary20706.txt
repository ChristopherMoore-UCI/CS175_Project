Residents are not denying the existence of al Qaeda elements in their region but say that misdirected strikes work in favor of the militant group, helping them recruit new operatives. A U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda suspects in Yemen killed 13 civilians, including three women, three security officials in the restive Middle Eastern country said. The first three hit their targets, killing at least 12 suspected al Qaeda militants, according to Yemeni officials. But two weeks later, they evacuated the town after authorities released al Qaeda prisoners. The strike took place near the town of Rada in al-Baitha province on Sunday, Yemeni officials said.
