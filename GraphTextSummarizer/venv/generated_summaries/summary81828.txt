Director Michael Bay announced this month that she is being replaced as Shia LaBeouf's love interest by model-actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for "Transformers 3." Fox portrayed Mikaela Banes in the first "Transformers" and its sequel "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen." Fox, 24, was so excited when Green, 36, popped the question on a Hawaii beach that she dropped the 2-carat diamond engagement ring into the sand, Us Weekly magazine reported. -- "Transformers" actress Megan Fox said "yes" to ex-fiance Brian Austin Green's marriage proposal, just four months after calling off a two-year engagement with Green, her publicist confirmed. Fox and Green began dating six years ago and became engaged for the first time in 2007. Green spent a decade playing David Silver on the hit TV series "Beverly Hills, 90210" until it was canceled in 2000.
