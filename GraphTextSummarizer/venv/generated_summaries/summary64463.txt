Besides the train bombing trial, a separate trial concluded last month with the convictions of 20 men, mainly Algerians and Moroccans, for Islamic terrorist activity in Spain. Authorities say Spain remains under constant threat from Islamic terrorism. Spain commemorated victims of the March 11, 2004 Madrid train bombings with somber ceremonies on Tuesday at three stations in the capital where 191 people died in the Islamic terrorist attacks. Al Qaeda reports regularly mention Spain -- among other countries -- as a target, and more than 300 suspected Islamic extremists have been arrested in the country since the bombings. In another case, a judge held in prison for investigation 10 men, mainly Pakistanis, who were arrested last January in Barcelona on suspicion of planning al-Qaeda style attacks in Spain, Germany, France, Britain and Portugal.
