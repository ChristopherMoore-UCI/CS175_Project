For more than half a century, vice presidents and vice presidential nominees have had a huge impact. Ezra Klein, writing for The Washington Post, suggested it was likely the pick didn't "much matter at all," asserting "that's usually what happens with vice presidential picks." How? First, the conventional wisdom that vice presidential picks don't matter is just wrong. John F. Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon Johnson, became president. Thus, even if Ryan were not one of the leaders of perhaps the single most influential new political movement in America in the past decade, the tea party-aligned deficit hawks of "the New Right," he, as a vice presidential pick, would immediately vault to the forefront of U.S. politics.
