CNN's Hamzeh Noami and John Defterios in Dubai and CNN's Samira Said in Atlanta contributed to this report. The fire started at 2 a.m. (5 p.m. ET Friday), when many people were out and enjoying the nightlife in unseasonably warm temperatures, witness Leah Polonenko said. A fire broke out early Saturday at a luxury apartment skyscraper in Dubai, engulfing several floors on at least three sides of the iconic Torch building and spewing flaming debris to the ground. The fire appeared to start around the 50th floor, but then strong winds blew the burning debris around to lower floors on other sides, witnesses said. "Then we saw another piece of fire fall, and it started the fire on the other side."
