Marketed as "the future of fashion design shows," NBC's "Fashion Star" premiered Tuesday. As long as new shows continue to add unique elements to existing reality programs, it seems they'll have a shot at ratings gold. The CW and ABC's forthcoming singing competitions, "The Star Next Door" and "Duets," respectively, are certainly variations of existing shows like "American Idol," "The X Factor," "The Voice" and "The Sing-Off. In other words, if "Project Runway" and "Shark Tank" were one show, that show would be called "Fashion Star." "In 2012, there are so many channels and reality shows out there, it's hard to come up with a concept where everything is completely new," said Steve Carbone of RealitySteve.com. "Copycat shows aren't unique to reality TV," Dehnart said.
