About one-third of Latino voters say they have given this election "a lot of thought," while half of U.S. registered voters say they have, Pew said. Fifty-nine percent of Latino registered voters said they are dissatisfied with the country's direction, while 73 percent of all U.S. registered voters say the same, Pew said. "Nearly half (47 percent) of Latino registered voters say this about the Democratic Party -- down from 55 percent in 2008, but similar to the share on this question expressed by Latinos for much of the past decade," Pew said. "In contrast," the report said, "very few see the Republican Party as more concerned about Latinos than the Democratic Party -- just 6 percent of all Latino registered voters and 18 percent of Republican Latino registered voters say this. Sixty-two percent of Latino registered voters said they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, Pew said, while 25 percent say the same for the Republican Party.
