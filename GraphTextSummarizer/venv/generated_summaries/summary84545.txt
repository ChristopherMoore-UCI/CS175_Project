-- A New York woman accused of trying to cash in on the Newtown elementary school shootings pleaded guilty Thursday to wire fraud and to lying to FBI agents, federal prosecutors in Connecticut said. The U.S. Attorney's office said that FBI agents contacted Alba after seeing the CNN report and that she told the agents the same thing she told CNN. Alba, prosecutors said, set up false bank accounts and claimed she was collecting for a "funeral fund" set up on behalf of one of the 20 children killed in the December attacks, Noah Pozner. Donors sent $240 to a PayPal account between December 14 and 20, federal prosecutors in New York said this year. "The thought that someone would scheme so quickly and deliberately to benefit from an unspeakable tragedy is beyond belief," FBI Special Agent in Charge Kimberly Mertz said in a statement.
