California allows medical marijuana use, but the federal government does not, she explained. Frank, who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said that about a dozen states have approved some degree of medical marijuana use and that the federal government should stop devoting resources to arresting people who are complying with their states' laws. Those found guilty of marijuana use can lose their jobs, financial aid for college, their food stamp and welfare benefits, or their low-cost housing. The resolution also would not speak to state laws regarding marijuana use. Rep. Barney Frank's bill would radically curb federal penalties for personal marijuana use.
