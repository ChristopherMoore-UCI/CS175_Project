It started with the assassination of a favorite son, John F. Kennedy, in 1963, and continued with the assassination of his brother Robert, later the plane crash of young John Jr. and the loss of another brother, Ted. Abigail writes a farewell letter to John Quincy that captures the New England spirit: "It is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed. Great necessities will call out great virtues, and qualities that may seem dormant will wake into life, forming the character of new heroes and new leaders. Here in Boston, people will grieve for many days. Or reread "John Adams," the book that was originally intended to be about Adams and Jefferson -- until McCullough fell out of love with Jefferson and into love with Abigail.
