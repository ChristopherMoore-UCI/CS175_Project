Watching his 2-year-old daughter Cadence playing with her brand new Christmas toys, Kerry Hoffman was suddenly struck by a thought: "I need to be here to walk her down the aisle." "The doctor called all the nurses and doctors and pediatricians out of their rooms and said 'This guy actually did it,'" Hoffman remembered proudly. " Hoffman also continues to look for new ways to improve his personal fitness, describing himself as "a fitness dork." The doctor performed a routine checkup, noting that Hoffman was already on medication for both high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I started lifting weights at about 13," Hoffman said.
