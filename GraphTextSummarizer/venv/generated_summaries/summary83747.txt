During a May trip to the country, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Nigeria "has acknowledged that there have been some problems" and was "working to try to control it." CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report. The attack took place at about 1 a.m. Sunday at the College of Agriculture Gujba. Since 2009, Boko Haram has sown murder and mayhem in Nigeria's northeastern region. One of the three states is Yobe, where Sunday's attack took place. At least 40 students died, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.
