Before we came to Lake Chad, we'd met two informants in Nigeria who live among Boko Haram members and know the terrorist organization's tactics better than most. U.S. and Nigerian security sources tell us Boko Haram tends to use Niger as more of a logistics hub or to escape military operations in Nigeria. There have been concerns that fighters are hiding themselves among the refugees, and recruiting among Niger's disgruntled unemployed youth -- a concern shared by Nigeria's other neighbors as Boko Haram morphs into a transnational terrorist organization. Boko Haram attacks have terrorized this part of the country for years, but their kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls in Chibok in April has brought them an unprecedented level of international infamy. Many fled a Boko Haram attack in the middle of the night and spent the night hiding in the bush before crossing the river into Niger.
