The robbery is the latest in a spate of daytime thefts at jewelry stores and designer shops in London's exclusive shopping areas of Bond Street, which includes New Bond Street. A CNN camera crew filming in March on Oxford Street, near Bond Street, caught a group of thieves speeding away on motorbikes from a jewelry store they had just robbed. Detectives released surveillance camera photos of the two, in addition to images of some of the rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches taken from Graff Jewellers on central London's New Bond Street. Both men are thought to have spoken with London accents, Scotland Yard said. -- Two men are being sought for questioning in the brazen daylight robbery of a jewelry store last week, in which some $65 million in merchandise was stolen, authorities said Tuesday.
