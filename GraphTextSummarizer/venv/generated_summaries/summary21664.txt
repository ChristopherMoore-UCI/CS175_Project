A one-time hit to your wallet is infinitely preferable to having that ticket held against you for anywhere from three to five years -- the length of time it will be on your DMV record -- and used by your insurance company to justify higher premiums. But sometimes, it's smart to pick your battles -- and go for the best outcome you can realistically hope for given time and other constraints. A continuance will push your court date off for another few weeks or so and give you time to prepare a defense -- or hire a lawyer. In some counties/states, certain charges aren't reported to the DMV at all -- especially if it's an out-of-state ticket. You've probably read articles about fighting traffic tickets -- but the reality is many of us (probably most of us) just don't have the money to hire a lawyer -- or the time/expertise (let alone gumption) to actually challenge a ticket on our own.
