A South African court last month banned the playing of a political song called "Kill the Boer," most recently sung by radical youth leader Julius Malema. Terreblanche was the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB) which attempted to resist South Africa's transformation from Apartheid to democracy in the 1990s. South African President Jacob Zuma also appealed for calm after news of the killing broke, according to the country's national news agency, SAPA. Police said the 69-year-old was bludgeoned and stabbed to death with clubs and a machete in an attack at his farm near the town of Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West Province . The group also said that "all communities -- white, as well as black -- should refrain from reckless statements and from romanticizing violence.
