Taliban tightens grip on Afghan schools There have been several instances of girls being poisoned in schools in recent years. However, observers say abuse of women remains common in the post-Taliban era and is often accepted in conservative and traditional families, where women are barred from school and sometimes subjected to domestic violence. During the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001, many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school. "The Afghan people know that the terrorists and the Taliban are doing these things to threaten girls and stop them going to school," Aseer said last week. In April, also in Takhar province, more than 170 women and girls were hospitalized after drinking apparently poisoned well water at a school.
