For half a century, Ted Kennedy was the most prolific senator on the political scene, making major strides in civil rights, civil liberties, education, human rights abroad, arms control, good government and of course health care. When my first Senate boss, Phil Hart, was in the last stages of his battle with cancer, Kennedy spent hours by his side offering humor, Irish tales and Senate banter almost endlessly, as Chris Dodd and many others have now done for him. He now works as a pro bono private counsel on civil rights and human rights issues. Former Kennedy aide Burton Wides says the senator had a zest for politics and an appetite for hard work. I remember Kennedy rebuking Bob Shrum, his speechwriter, and me for running late as he weaved through traffic from his suburban home to an interview by civil rights leader and radio host James Farmer.
