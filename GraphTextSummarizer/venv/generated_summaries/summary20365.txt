In a letter sent to lawmakers before U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced there was evidence sarin has been used in Syria, the White House said that intelligence analysts have concluded "with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin." " Also Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asked the man heading the world body's investigation into chemical weapons use in Syria to report to U.N. headquarters on Monday for "consultations," a U.N. spokesman said. Syria does not have chemical weapons and would not use them if it did, he said. After a meeting on Friday with Jordan's King Abdullah, President Barack Obama reiterated U.S. "preliminary assessments" that "chemical weapons have been used on ... populations in Syria." He didn't backtrack from his earlier statements that it would be a "game changer" -- as far as how the world deals with Syria -- if it's proven definitively that President Bashar al-Assad's forces used chemical weapons on his own people.
