The judge ordered Brown to attend at least three Alcoholics Anonymous sessions each week until he reports to the Los Angeles County jail on March 20, according to the city attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan. A Los Angeles police officer smelled "a strong scent of alcohol" when he approached Brown during the Ventura Boulevard traffic stop last October, a police spokesman said. "Brown is pleased that the matter has been resolved," attorney Christopher Brown said in a statement. The jail time is stiffer because his driver's license was suspended after he pleaded no contest last summer to another charge of driving under the influence, the Los Angeles city attorney's spokesman said. Brown, who has been touring with his R&B group, New Edition, released "Masterpiece," his first solo album in 14 years, last June.
