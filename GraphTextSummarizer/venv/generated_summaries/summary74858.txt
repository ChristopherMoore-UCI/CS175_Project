There's no shortage of cross-country trails in the Deep Creek Lake area, but the most civilized option might be at Savage River Lodge, where in-house rentals and lessons make the experience a cinch for beginners. Head for the North Camp Trails, almost entirely devoted to new skiers, and combine Backbone Pass with Big Dipper for 1Â½ miles of gentle terrain with pastoral views.
