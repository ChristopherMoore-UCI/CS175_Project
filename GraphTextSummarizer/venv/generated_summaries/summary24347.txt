CNN's Per Nyberg in London, England, contributed to this report. At least one Madonna show has been canceled, Rosenberg told CNN. A crane collapsed while lifting a large metallic truss into place, Lt. Thierry Delorme of the French Navy told CNN. Another two people, one British and one American, are severely injured, and four are lightly injured, officer David Goddin told CNN. "My prayers go out to those who were injured and their families along with my deepest sympathy to all those affected by this heartbreaking news," Madonna said in a statement issued by her representative, Liz Rosenberg.
