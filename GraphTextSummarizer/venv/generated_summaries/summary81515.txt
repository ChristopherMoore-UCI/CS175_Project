-- An ongoing skid in crude oil markets and the impact of Superstorm Sandy helped drive U.S. gasoline prices down nearly 21 cents a gallon in late October, the latest Lundberg Survey found. Lundberg predicted gas prices could fall another 10 to 20 cents a gallon in the coming weeks, "assuming there's no jolt in the price of crude from some awful, international reason." "It's the biggest price decline in our surveys since early December 2008, when the recession hit in full force," Lundberg said. The national average price of regular gas fell to $3.55 a gallon between October 19 and November 2, survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said. Crude oil prices, which make up the largest element of the price of motor fuel, are on the downswing, and demand has fallen since the end of the summer vacation season, Lundberg said.
