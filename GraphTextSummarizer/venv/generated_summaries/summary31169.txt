According to the document, symptoms include "intermittent connectivity, slow Wi-Fi speeds" and "Wi-Fi network not seen" -- all of which sound quite serious. Apple is investigating several issues with its new iPad's Wi-Fi connectivity, according to an internal AppleCare document unearthed by MacRumors. If the AppleCare document is real, Apple is currently trying to "capture" and replace iPads which have problems with Wi-Fi connectivity. Most of the replies on the thread indicate that the problem affects only the Wi-Fi version of the new iPad and not the 3G model. For comparison, a thread about the iPad overheating issue, which was widely discusses in the media, currently has 876 replies.
