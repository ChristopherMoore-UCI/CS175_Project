Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel is expected to sign for Ferrari next year, with Alonso tipped to return to McLaren. " A new chapter is about to begin for Raikkonen in the near future when his girlfriend Minttu Virtanen gives birth to their first child. He won his first grand prix with McLaren in 2003 and his first and only world title with Ferrari in 2007 before the Italian team effectively paid up the rest of his salary to bring in Fernando Alonso for the 2010 season. " On the subject of sharing baby tips with the German, Raikkonen adds: "Yes, he has more experience..." He might be one of F1's most-enigmatic and best-loved stars, and still among the highest earners, but in many ways he has stayed true to his roots. Asked if he would encourage his child to follow him into motor racing, he gives a typically direct and definitive "No!" Raikkonen might not be keen on small talk but he is looking forward to discussing fatherhood with Vettel, his closest friend in F1, who became a father to a baby daughter earlier this year.
