-- Police arrested 11 people in central and northern Italy on Friday on suspicion of recruiting Kurds to join the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK -- the outlawed separatist group fighting for a homeland in southeastern Turkey. The rebel group continues to operate in Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq, and the Turkish military has in the past bombed PKK targets around Iraq's border with Turkey. The PKK has been locked in a bloody conflict with Turkey since the 1980s, and more than 30,000 people, mostly ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority, numbering more then 12 million people. Of those arrested, 10 are Kurdish -- mostly from Turkey -- and one is an Italian with a criminal record, Italian authorities said.
