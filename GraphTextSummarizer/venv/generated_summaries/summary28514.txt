When Canton police responded to a 911 call Sunday for a vehicle that had gone into a local pond, the car's owner -- who police aren't naming -- said it was the doing of Rosie, his 5-month-old German Shepherd puppy. "While this story has a happy ending," said a Canton police press release, "we would encourage drivers to keep their pets safely secured in the rear of their vehicle where they cannot interfere with operation. The man and his dog were both in the Dodge Neon as it floated about 30 yards offshore before it sank, according to Quirk, who said a witness rushed into the pond to help get Rosie safely out of the vehicle after the driver had to untangle things to free himself. -- Throughout history they've been humankind's most convenient, unwitting and trustworthy scapegoats for missing homework assignments and olfactory mishaps. "Rosie got her leash entangled in the [gear] shifter," Rob Quirk of the Canton Police Department said, repeating the driver's explanation.
