"There's a lot of people crossing over the border all the time," said Dr. Eric Mintz, the leader of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team. "What puts people at risk is a lack of safe drinking water," Mintz said. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north, bordering Nigeria and Chad and the Central African Republic, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official. Mintz said the rugged and remote region has been affected repeatedly by cholera epidemics, most recently last year. Two-thirds of rural Nigerians lack access to safe drinking water, and fewer than 40 percent of the people in the affected states have access "to toilet facilities of any description," the health ministry said.
