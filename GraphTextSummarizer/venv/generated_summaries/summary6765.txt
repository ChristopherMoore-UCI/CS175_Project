While apparently offering no evidence they existed, it continued: "We have heard from two contacts that Erdogan has eight accounts in Swiss banks; his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his son and that a Turkish businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four Erdogan children in the U.S. purely altruistically are lame." In a cable dated December 12, 2004, the U.S. ambassador in Ankara at the time wrote a less-than-flattering profile of Erdogan, who had recently become prime minister amid anxiety among Western governments about his "Islamist tendencies." Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he plans to sue over remarks from then-Ambassador Eric Edelman in 2004 suggesting that the prime minister concealed his wealth in Swiss bank accounts. Those who have slandered us will be crushed under these claims, will be finished and will disappear," Erdogan said later, according to Turkish media reports. Erdogan vowed to resign if it could be shown he had bank accounts in Switzerland.
