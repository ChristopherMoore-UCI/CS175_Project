In apparent response to the idea that the FBI did not inform Boston police of the investigation, the bureau issued a statement Thursday from Boston Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers, saying the information was available. Boston Police Commissioners Edward Davis echoed Lieberman's sentiment. Hundreds of Boston law enforcement officers then began a gripping week long search for those who carried out the terrorist attack. Davis used that high-profile response as proof that reforms to the nation's video surveillance are needed, writing that in order to catch the bombers, law enforcement officials rely "almost exclusively on the support of our business partners to provide critical video surveillance along the finish line." One of the alleged culprits in the Boston bombing, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was investigated by the FBI after the agency received a tip from Russian authorities that the suspect could be radicalizing.
