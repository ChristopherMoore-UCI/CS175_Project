The Saint-Omer library was home to a Shakespeare's First Folio. Shakespeare turns 450 this year CNN's Marion Lory reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. According to the British Library, which holds four copies, the First Folio was produced by two of Shakespeare's fellow actors and closest friends, John Heminge and Henry Condell. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, with 82 First Folios, has the single largest collection of the books, representing one-third of the world's existing copies. "I am not an expert myself on Shakespeare's pieces, so I wanted to have the opinion of an expert," said Cordonnier.
