The desire to win likely fuels outrageous behavior, said Fran Bialy, assistant director of A New Hope Center, an agency that aids victims of rape, domestic violence, assault and hate crimes. Three white male students involved in the skit made light of domestic violence, and they did it in racist manner, say some. The Waverly High skit was approved by school officials before it was performed, Yelich said. " Alum Vlad Chituc also blamed school officials. Then, in the midst of the cheers and a sea of red and white pom poms came a 30-second skit that, for some, turned an afternoon of school pride into one of shame.
