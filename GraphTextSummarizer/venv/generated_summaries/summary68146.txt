The use of the whip in horse racing has been a source of controversy in recent years, notably in Britain. Animal welfare groups have criticized the "utterly barbaric" whipping of a horse which competed in a race against Paralympic icon Oscar Pistorius. Regulator British Horseracing Association completed a 10-month review of whip regulations in November 2011, recommending its use be regulated, with bans issued for excessive use. In a statement to CNN, six-time Paralympic gold medalist Pistorius -- who also reached the semifinals of the Olympic 400 meters competition -- said he was unaware of any ill treatment to the horse. World Horse Welfare, a body which advises on rules for international equestrian competitions, branded the treatment of the horse, which started the race 15 meters behind Pistorius, as a "disgrace".
