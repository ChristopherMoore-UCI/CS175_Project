In Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch said, "security forces briefly arrested between 30 and 50 demonstrators in Jeddah" on January 28, according to reports. In the United Arab Emirates, Human Rights Watch said, state security arrested Hasan Muhammad al-Hammadi, who "had spoken out publicly in solidarity with the Egyptian demonstrators" during a mosque sermon. "They have responded with their usual mix of repression and intimidation to nip the buds of any wider democratic blossoming." Human Rights Watch said the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, "used violence against peaceful demonstrators" during a rally last week in which people were supporting the Egyptian protesters. " Human Rights Watch said that in Syria, security services briefly detained five young demonstrators at three different protests, and that on February 2, "a group of 20 people in civilian clothing beat and dispersed 15 demonstrators who had assembled in Bab Touma in old Damascus to hold a candlelight vigil for Egyptian demonstrators. "Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that regular police and 'special forces,' identifiable by their uniforms, punched, kicked, and detained participants, as well as at least two journalists and a Human Rights Watch research assistant," the report said.
