Las Vegas showgirls strut their stuff in Les Folies Bergere, which is closing after 50 years. You know it's a recession when leggy Las Vegas showgirls can't sell enough tickets to stay in business. "Folies Bergere enjoyed an amazing and unprecedented run on the Las Vegas Strip," according to Ron Thacker, president of Tropicana Las Vegas. "We are extremely proud to have been part of such an iconic Las Vegas production and offer a sincere thank you to the cast, crew and support staff for their many years of excellence." The curtain will go down on the act for the last time on March 28, according to the Tropicana Las Vegas, where the show runs on the Strip.
