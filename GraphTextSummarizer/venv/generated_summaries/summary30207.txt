"It was very important once I saw that he had slipped through the cracks of history that we make sure that we bring him and his story to life here at ATF," said ATF historian Barbara Osteika, who discovered William Foote's story in a New York Times article from decades ago. As a part of a larger effort to honor all fallen agents of law enforcement, ATF has gone back through historic annals to excavate overlooked stories of heroism like Foote's. On the wall beside Foote's name is the name of William L. Pappan, an agent of the then, U.S. Department of Treasury, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Alcohol Tax Unit, who died in 1935 as the first Native American federal investigator killed in the line of duty. " While Foote's story of sacrifice has recently gained public attention, his has been a story of family lore for generations of his ancestors. Several of Foote's descendants were in attendance and Foote's great-grandniece, Bettye Gardner, a professor of African-American history at Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland, accepted the award.
