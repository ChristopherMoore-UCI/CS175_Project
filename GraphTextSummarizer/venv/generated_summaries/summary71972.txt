They speculate that vitamin D may be important in some way in educating T cells about how to recognize self cells; this occurs in the thymus, and errors in the training could lead to higher levels of the destructive T cells. They sampled blood from the newborns' umbilical chords and recorded levels of vitamin D and a specific type of immune cell known as autoreactive T-cells. The connection between vitamin D and immune disorders first emerged from population studies that showed people who lived further away from the equator, in places with less sunlight, were at higher risk of developing MS. The researchers found that babies born in May had vitamin D levels that were 20% lower than those in babies born in November, and almost double the amount of autoreactive T-cells. Some have speculated that insufficient levels of vitamin D, which the skin produces when exposed to sunlight, on the mom's part could play a role, since babies born in May are gestated during the colder, darker months, while winter babies are in utero during the spring and summer.
