Missed some putts there early in the round that could have made a difference, maybe not, but who knows-type thing." Johnson and Stricker's 2012 U.S. Ryder Cup teammate Brandt Snedeker carded a 69 to finish 10 under, one shot clear of reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson (71) and 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley (70). Dustin Johnson clinched the opening PGA Tour title of 2013 after holding off a final round challenge from fellow American Steve Stricker at the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. "It gives me a lot of confidence going into this year," Johnson told the Tour's official website after becoming the first player since Tiger Woods to win a PGA Tour title in each of his first six seasons out of college. World No. 12 Johnson, three shots clear of defending champion Stricker heading into the final day, carded a five-under-par 68 to finish 16 under for tournament. "I actually thought, as we started the round today, I could really put some serious pressure on this guy because I'm going to hit first every time to the green," said the 45-year-old, who is 90 under for his last 20 rounds at the Hawaii course.
