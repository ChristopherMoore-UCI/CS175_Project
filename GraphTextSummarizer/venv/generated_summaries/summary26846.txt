In the late 1980s, Cross spent three years in prison on weapons charges and for plotting the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees. Cross is accused of shooting to death a boy and his grandfather outside a Jewish community center near Kansas City, Kansas, on Sunday and then a woman at a nearby Jewish assisted living facility. Hate crime charges are possible, as police investigators say they have "unquestionably determined" that Cross' actions were a hate crime, Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass said. He obtained firearms from a "straw buyer," a middleman with a clean record who could buy weapons legally and then sell or give them to Cross, allowing Cross to avoid federal background checks, a U.S. law enforcement official said. U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom said that federal prosecutors are still collecting evidence and that federal charges could come later.
