Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that  investigators will release new information highlighting how an over-reliance on cockpit computers and pilot confusion about automated engine thrust settings led to the crash in July as Boeing 777 sought to land at San Francisco airport. Pilot reliance on automated systems to fly big jets and related errors have become a key focus of investigators digging into last summer's Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco that killed three people and injured more than 180 others. Investigators have not yet said if the crew failed to activate auto-throttles, which aim to maintain a certain airspeed, or somehow disconnected them during the approach, the Journal reported.
