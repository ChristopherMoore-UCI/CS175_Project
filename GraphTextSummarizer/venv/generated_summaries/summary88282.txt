Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. Camilien and Colina knew each other, according to authorities. The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. A 32-year-old Massachusetts man is facing murder charges, authorities said Wednesday, four days after another man's remains were found in a duffel bag.
