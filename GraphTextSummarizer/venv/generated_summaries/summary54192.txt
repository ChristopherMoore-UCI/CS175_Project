In a televised speech Monday, Vice President Amado Boudou said the situation was similar to the time when Fernandez temporarily handed presidential powers over to him when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid. In August, Fernandez, 60, suffered a cranial trauma, for which doctors conducted a brain scan and found normal results with no symptoms at the time, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said Saturday. During Fernandez's absence, Vice President Amado Boudou is serving as Argentina's interim president. -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will undergo surgery on Tuesday morning, days after doctors discovered she had a blood clot on the surface of her brain. Over the weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work.
