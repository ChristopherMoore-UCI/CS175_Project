Among other things, Obama's latest proposal for health care reform would give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate increases by health insurers. The board, to be known as the Health Insurance Rate Authority, would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved, although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators. Advocates of an exemption repeal say the exemption has allowed health insurance companies to essentially divide the country into geographic zones. Specifically, Obama's plan calls for the secretary of health and human services to work with a seven-member board made up of doctors, economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium increases. The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to repeal the antitrust exemption currently granted to health insurance companies.
