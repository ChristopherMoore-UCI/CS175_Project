-- Wayne Rooney's injury time header gave Manchester United a 3-1 victory over city rivals Manchester City to put them through to the English League Cup final 4-3 on aggregate. City's defence appeared to have halted the attack, but the ball eventually fell to Michael Carrick, whose pass found veteran midfielder Paul Scholes to fire past goalkeeper Shay Given. City won last week's first leg 2-1, courtesy of a double by former United striker Carlos Tevez, but the English champions brought the aggregate scores level early in the second half. However, in the 91st minute, England forward Rooney -- who scored all four goals in United's victory over Hull on Saturday -- struck with a close range header from a Giggs to deny City a place in their first major final for 29 years. United will now face Aston Villa in a repeat of the 1994 League Cup final, looking to gain revenge for that particular 3-1 Wembley defeat.
