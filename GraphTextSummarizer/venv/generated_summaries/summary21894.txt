"Refloating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job," said Andrew Lamason, the department's services manager for Golden Bay. The stranding of large sea mammals is nothing new to New Zealand, where the Department of Conservation responds to an average 85 such incidents a year. Nearly 200 whales were beached Friday in Farewell Spit on New Zealand's South Island. Mass strandings are rare, especially on the scale of what's happening around Golden Bay. Rescuers on Saturday refloated 66 pilot whales stranded on a remote beach in New Zealand as a race to save their lives continued.
