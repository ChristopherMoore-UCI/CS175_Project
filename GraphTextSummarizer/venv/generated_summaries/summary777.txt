Just be aware that an Aspie is interested primarily in significant contributions to conversation, preferring to avoid "small talk," trivial statements and superficial conversation. Many people with Asperger's are challenged by large crowds, looking people in the eye and reading common social cues. Aspies think differently Aspies frequently talk at length about small details instead of being brief and to the point. For example, the cancellation of a project may be a relief to most of your team, while an Aspie may see it as people not appreciating their hard work or allowing them to finish the job. I have seen Aspies start reprogramming software in their head well before they get back to their desks and write the first line of code.
