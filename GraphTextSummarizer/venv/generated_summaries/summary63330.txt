Rancic and fellow co-host Brad Goreski  will return in September, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers. "I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference." Shortly before her departure, co-host Giuliana Rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that Disney star Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana. Last week, co-host Kathy Griffin bid the show bye-bye after seven episodes, saying her style did not blend in with her co-hosts. But her apology was not enough for co-host Kelly Osbourne, who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later. After weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts, "Fashion Police" is going on an extended break.
