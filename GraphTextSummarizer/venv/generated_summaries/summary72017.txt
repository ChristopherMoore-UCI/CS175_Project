A year ago, as energy costs headed up and the school faced cuts in state funding, college President James Drake, who drives a hybrid, decided to give the shortened workweek a try. Drake says he often receives calls from other colleges and universities wanting to know how it's working. Over that year-long period, by closing on Fridays and turning down the air conditioning and heating systems, the college saved $267,000 in energy costs. Brevard Community College used $267,000 in energy savings to add 10 new full-time faculty positions. Mylitta Barrett, a single mother, says the switch means she spends less time with her three sons.
