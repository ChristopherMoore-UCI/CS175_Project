"Before, let's just say that communication didn't happen often between islanders," he said, explaining that the Fisherman's Guild had a tight hold on how fishing was regulated and before the tsunami most fishermen operated as individuals. Even though only one oyster processing factory is still functioning and a third of fishermen of the Urato Islands remain, he is determined to revive his new community and create a sustainable fishing industry. The quiet life Koizumi hoped for after quitting a job at a lumber company in Tokyo is still to be realized, and some residents of Katsurashima don't think fishing, a way of life for all on the Urato Islands and livelihood for most of the communities along the Northeast coast of Japan, is possible anymore. Just a month after the tsunami, Koizumi set up "Uminoko Saisei" (Children of the Sea), a cooperative project for fishermen from the Urato Islands and outside "stakeholders." Walking along the cracked and sandbagged quayside, oyster farmer Yoshimasa Koizumi spies his fishing gear that has been lying untouched for over a year.
