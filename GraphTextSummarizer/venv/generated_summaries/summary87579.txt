TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. "It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation," said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down.
