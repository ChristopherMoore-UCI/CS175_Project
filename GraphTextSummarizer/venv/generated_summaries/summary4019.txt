Classic cars are fun, you can drive them and they have become a lifestyle as well. "Someone shouldn't go into the vintage car market for pure investment purposes, but have a passion for classic cars," he said. Records have been tumbling recently for classic cars sold at auction. The value of classic cars has jumped 39% this year alone, according to the Historic Automobile Group Index (HAGI), which tracks the financial performance of 50 rare and exotic classic cars. Sotheby's sold off 31 classic and concept cars and auto-related items for nearly $63 million in just over two hours at the auction in New York City.
