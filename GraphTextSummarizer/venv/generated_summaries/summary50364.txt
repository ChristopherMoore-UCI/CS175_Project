Botched injection stirs debate Controversy over lethal injections has been brewing in recent years after European manufacturers, including the Denmark-based manufacturer of pentobarbital, banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Execution witnesses said convicted murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett convulsed and writhed on the execution gurney and struggled to speak, before officials blocked the witnesses' view. This month, a group of criminal justice experts recommended that federal and state governments move to a single lethal drug for executions instead of complex cocktails that can be botched. As controversies over lethal injection drugs surge, Tennessee has found a way around the issue: It is bringing back the electric chair. Now Tennessee is the first state to make use of the electric chair mandatory when lethal injection drugs are unavailable.
