Vaccinating men provides a "double benefit" in that fewer men with HPV will also mean that fewer women are exposed, adds Porche, who was not involved in the current study but has researched HPV in men. In an effort to prevent cervical cancer, which can be caused by HPV, public health officials have been encouraging young women to get vaccinated since the Food and Drug Administration approved the first HPV vaccine, Gardasil, in 2006. HPV can cause certain cancers of the anus and penis in men, although those diseases are far less common than cervical cancer in women. "Men are such a vital component of the whole prevention cycle when looking at HPV or any sexually transmitted infection," says Demetrius Porche, a professor of nursing research and evaluation at the Louisiana State University School of Public Health in New Orleans. Most health insurance plans cover HPV vaccination for both males and females.
