Centuries rolled forward and outfits got quirkier in the heart of Dakar late last month as Senegalese fashion designer Selly Raby Kane showed off her futuristic creations for her latest collection, "Alien Cartoon." "From my first fashion show and the first time I've presented my collection there has been a small evolution and everything is going to that path; that fantastic and surreal approach of what a garment is." 'This is who I am' That journey culminated last month with "Alien Cartoon" and now Kane says she's determined to continue developing her brand and collaborating with other artists. "I am addicted to everything that makes me leave Earth and discover other things, other realities," adds Kane. Blending urban culture with strong pop art influences, Kane's structured creations nodded to the fantasy worlds staged by directors like Tim Burton, while being firmly rooted in Dakar. A member of the artistic collective "Les Petites Pierres," Kane first started drawing clothes at a young age while growing up in Dakar.
