While Cosby offered Stacy Brown more than the head-shake that caused several moments of awkward radio silence during an interview with NPR, he did not address the allegations. On Monday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Spelman College, to which Cosby and wife Camille donated $20 million in 1987, has suspended the Cosby Chair for the Humanities while the controversy continues. As for how he sort of landed a sort of scoop, Brown said he had been keeping in touch with Cosby's camp for the past three and a half weeks -- and at one point even thought he was close to securing an interview -- but when his people changed their minds, Brown did an end-around. Amid mounting allegations against him, Bill Cosby has broken his silence. Despite Cosby's challenges, Brown wrote that the comedian "sounded upbeat on the phone," especially when it came to a question about how his wife, Camille, is holding up.
