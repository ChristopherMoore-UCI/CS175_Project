"People remember the March 11th attacks," said Vicente Jimenez, a deputy editor with El Pais newspaper, "and while conscious that the threat continues, you have to continue with your life. It was March 11, 2004, during morning rush hour, that terrorists armed with powerful bombs boarded these same commuter train lines, unleashing an onslaught that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero were not taking part in the public events. The terrorists got off at various stations down the line, before cell-phone timers detonated 10 bombs in quick succession on four trains at three stations. The attacks are the deadliest in Europe since the rise of al Qaeda.
