"The rain is the bigger impact going forward," said CNNI Meteorologist Taylor Ward, who noted that Haikui had diminished from typhoon status before hitting land about 225 kilometers (140 miles) south of Shanghai. Chinese officials had evacuated 374,000 people from Shanghai and 250,000 from Zhejiang, according to the state-run China Daily. Tropical Storm Haikui made landfall Wednesday morning in Zhejiang province, where hundreds of thousands of people had been evacuated from its path. Haikui, which had been a typhoon on Tuesday, is the third tropical storm to hit China's east coast in less than a week. " Ward said another 6 to 10 inches of rain were expected to fall, with "maybe isolated amounts greater."
