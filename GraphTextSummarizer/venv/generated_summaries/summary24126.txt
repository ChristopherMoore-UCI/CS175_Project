She's excited to become a first-time homebuyer and has been shopping exclusively for foreclosed homes in the Phoenix, Arizona, area for several weeks now. Smith estimates the loan program will probably help only about 1,000 families acquire homes across the Phoenix metro area. "It's the American dream," Locascio says of home ownership, and she's just zeroed in on the one she wants to be hers. Nonprofit housing assistance programs such as Smith's are available in many cities across the country to educate and counsel prospective home buyers and inform them of available assistance. Although Locascio's bid was $30,000 less than the listing price, offers like hers are common in the Phoenix area.
