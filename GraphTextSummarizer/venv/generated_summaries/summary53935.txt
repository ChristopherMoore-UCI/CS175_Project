The official death toll stands at 702, with more than a thousand still reported missing after mudslides and flooding engulfed this ethnic-Tibetan city in northwest China Saturday night. But a lack of flat and stable ground to pitch camps meant that most survivors faced the prospect of another day without shelter, while digging through debris in search of loved ones. -- A day after a miraculous rescue, the sounds of cheers were replaced by crying families, the roar of bulldozers and dynamite blasting debris in Zhouqu, China, on Wednesday. The heat also hampered the rescue efforts, compounded by a severe lack of drinking water and the growing threat of disease. The roads in are also jammed with trucks carrying hundreds of coffins, along with the much needed supplies of water, food and medicine.
