"The indictment alleges that funds that could and should have been applied to purchase medical equipment and enhance health care services for an historically under-served population were diverted by the defendants for their personal use and to benefit friends and family members," U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said. Outgoing New York state Sen. Pedro Espada Jr. and his son, Pedro, were charged Tuesday with embezzling $500,000 from a federally funded health care nonprofit, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. In April, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said he would sue Espada, the state's senate majority leader, calling his fellow Democrat's alleged transgressions "outrageous." The pair are accused of abusing their senior positions to divert Soundview funds for personal use and for the benefit of family members and friends, the statement said. "Thirty years ago, Sen. Espada founded the Soundview Health Care Center," Necheles said in a written statement.
