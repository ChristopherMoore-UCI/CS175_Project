It's not just Nevada: Nearby Northern California is also seeing an abnormal number of black bears, with CNN affiliate KXTV showing images taken from Yosemite National Park and Lake Tahoe's Heavenly Ski Resort. Nevada: Barely sleeping An unusual number of black bears are up and about in western Nevada. The National Weather Service's forecast for Incline Village, Nevada, for instance, calls for high temperatures heading to or well past 50 degrees for the next week at least, with nary of snow flurry in sight. Add to this curious mix, giant waves in Hawaii, a historic drought in California, and bears coming out of hibernation in Nevada, and you can't help but wonder: What is going on with the weather? If this was 10 degrees cooler, it would be one of those," Eric Helmbrecht, the owner of Powder Hound Ski Shop, told CNN affiliate KTUU, trying to sound hopeful "We will get snow and it will be fine."
