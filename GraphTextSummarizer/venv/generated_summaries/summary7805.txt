But the activist's wife said that when he called her before leaving Vietnam, Nguyen denied ever admitting to wrongdoing and said that he was not finished working for democracy there. Nguyen's wife, Ngo Mai Huong, said Nguyen had gone to Vietnam planning to visit his younger sister and talk about democracy and the rule of law. According to a report published last year in the Communist Youth Union-run Tuoi Tre news, "police caught (Nguyen) bringing documents on terrorist training to allegedly incite demonstrations in Ho Chi Minh City as well as other provinces and cities" during festivities marking the reunification of North and South Vietnam and May Day. The former high school teacher went to Vietnam in April to meet with other grassroots democracy activists, but was arrested at the airport on arrival, Duy said. State media said that Nguyen, 58, of Elk Grove, California, admitted to taking part in illegal activities and was flown out Vietnam for humanitarian reasons.
