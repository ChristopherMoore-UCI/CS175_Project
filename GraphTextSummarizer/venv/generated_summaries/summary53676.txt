" Morgan wondered whether "The Tonight Show" is still the "Holy Grail" among late night talk show hosts, and Lopez said, "if you ask me personally -- I know you didn't ask me -- who I thought should've been the host of 'The Tonight Show,' I think when Johnny Carson, -- which I was fortunate enough to do that show with him in 1991 -- -- George Lopez told CNN's Piers Morgan that he's not ruling out the idea of running for mayor of Los Angeles -- eight years from now. " Morgan asked Lopez, who graciously welcomed Conan O'Brien to take his timeslot on TBS (sister network to CNN), about the time he described Jay Leno as the "biggest two-faced dude and a back-stabber. "I believe that there are certain things that could be taken care of that you don't need a strong political background in." Lopez told Morgan he cares most about "bonding the city back. I thought the heir apparent would've been David Letterman." Morgan asked whether Lopez still saw Letterman as the heir apparent.
