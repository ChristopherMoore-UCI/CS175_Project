Police were "alerted at 5 a.m. local time on Friday by museum guards" that the infamous sign reading "Arbeit Macht Frei" -- "Work Sets You Free" in German -- was stolen, according to police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel. "While we don't yet know exactly who stole the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an attack on the memory of the Holocaust, and an escalation from those elements that would like to return us to darker days," said Avner Shalev. -- A sign synonymous with the Nazi work camps of World War II was stolen overnight from the Auschwitz Concentration Camp memorial in Poland, police said Friday. Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, called the sign "the defining symbol of the Holocaust" and urged authorities to intensify their investigation. The heavy iron sign "was removed by being unscrewed on one side and pulled off on the other," Szczygiel said.
