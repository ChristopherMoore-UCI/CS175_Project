Speaking out for the first time since nude pictures of her were leaked on the Internet, actress Scarlett Johansson defended the right to privacy, even for high-profile celebrities such as herself. Johansson sat down for an interview with CNN in Nairobi, Kenya, following a visit with the humanitarian group Oxfam to see first-hand the impact of the drought and famine that has hit the Horn of Africa. Asking why protecting privacy is important is a redundant question, she told CNN's David McKenzie. She said she was touched by the harrowing stories of many of the people she met at refugee camps, including a woman who was forced to leave her handicapped child behind in her search for food. She said the world was increasingly becoming a smaller place and urged people to get involved with helping others.
