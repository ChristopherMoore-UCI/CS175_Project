Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Obama are three very different kinds of leaders. Republicans went on to hold the House after their disastrous shutdown of 1995-96, and Obama rebounded from what he called "a shellacking" in the midterm elections of 2010 to win re-election comfortably in 2012. Calling Reid an ex-boxer is like calling John McCain an ex-naval officer; you really never depart from those deeply ingrained traits. They ought to put up a plaque where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid delivered the tea partying Republicans their worst whipping in a generation. Republicans were seeking an unattainable goal: Repealing Obamacare during the presidency of Barack Obama.
