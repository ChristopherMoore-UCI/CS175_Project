Although transport category airplanes are sensitive to hand flying at high altitudes, only an amateur would demonstrate that lack of skill. Death by airplane seems farfetched in this case. But my gut theory as a 30-year airline veteran is that human intervention was involved to save an airplane and its passengers in crisis, not to commit foul play. In addition, inside knowledge beyond that of even experienced 777 pilots would have been necessary to locate the ACARS unit from within the depths of the electronics and engineering (E&E) compartment in order to disable it such that the system no longer was capable of sending automatic data; notwithstanding the logistics of pulling up a portion of the first class galley carpet to gain access to the E&E hatch while using some type of threat to prevent passengers from impeding their progress. Or the terrorists themselves had enough piloting skills to fly the airplane.
