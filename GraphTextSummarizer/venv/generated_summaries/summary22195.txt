-- Bitcoin is still in beta, and users should only invest what they can afford to lose, Bitcoin Foundation executive director Jon Matonis says. The company's computer programmers hadn't accounted for a quirk in the way Bitcoin works, allowing cyber attackers to dupe Mt.Gox with a scheme resembling receipt fraud. Bitcoin and other digital "cryptocurrencies" have been the de facto payment system on underground websites that deal in drugs, weapons and other illegal merchandise. Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors on Sunday. Matonis remained bullish about Bitcoin's future, telling CNN the currency was "massively resilient."
