On Monday, the state-run news agency SANA published a report citing an unnamed military source saying that authorities found Israeli weapons, explosives and stolen military uniforms in Homs and recovered weapons, ammunition detonators and other military supplies hidden in a drum and a water tank in the garden of a house in Naseeb, a city in Daraa province. The observatory said 20 people were wounded, seven of them seriously, in the Homs province city. -- A Syrian city known for its relative calm during the Syrian uprising has been stormed by security forces, an opposition activist group said Tuesday. The Syrian government has been battling opposition activists for what it calls a campaign against terrorists. Since protests began in March, demonstrators have demanded true democratic elections and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but such protests have often been met with force.
