Watch what FDR's First 100 Days were like Â» Congress gave Roosevelt nearly nearly everything he wanted -- 15 major bills in the first 100 days, including the Emergency Banking Relief Act, the Public Works Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But, should Congress fail to act, Roosevelt would ask for "broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were, in fact, invaded by a foreign foe," he warned in his inaugural address. Congress also approved the Beer-Wine Revenue Act that anticipated the end of Prohibition. Democrats had just won huge majorities in Congress and were ready to do the president's bidding. Presidents can no longer count on the kind of bipartisan cooperation FDR got in 1933 -- even at a time of crisis.
