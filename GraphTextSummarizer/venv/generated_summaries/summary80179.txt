"Over the last few days, the ship began seeing an increased number of gastrointestinal illnesses, caused by norovirus (commonly referred to as the stomach flu)," said Princess Cruises spokeswoman Susan Lomax, via email. How the Navy avoids norovirus Norovirus infects many people on land, but health officials track it on cruise ships, leading to more frequent reporting of cases, the CDC said. "In response, we have enacted our stringent disinfecting protocols developed in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which includes an extensive deep cleaning of the ship and the terminal in Los Angeles on Sunday before the ship embarks on its next voyage." The CDC statement confirmed the ship has implemented CDC sanitation procedures to slow the disease's spread. "As it is the cold and flu season, when the stomach flu circulates on land, we encourage all of our guests to be diligent in following the widely accepted practices of frequent hand washing with soap and water and the use of hand sanitizers," said Lomax.
