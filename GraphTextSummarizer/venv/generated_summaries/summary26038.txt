BepiColombo will help us understand how planets can form so close to their parent star, and will analyze Mercury's geology and magnetic field. Upon arrival, a module called Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO) will separate from the rest of the spacecraft and perform a detailed study of the Mercury system. After landing a probe on an icy comet and possibly shedding new light on the origins of life on Earth, the European Space Agency (ESA) is now looking at scorching-hot Mercury for its next mission. This was later explained by relativity, which revealed that Mercury's warped orbit was due to curved space and not some unseen object. "Mercury is special," said Johannes Benkhoff, the project scientist in charge of the BepiColombo mission, "It's the densest planet in our solar system, even denser than Earth - if we consider uncompressed density - and has a magnetic field, like Earth, that no one expected before, so I guess it's a cool planet to go to.
