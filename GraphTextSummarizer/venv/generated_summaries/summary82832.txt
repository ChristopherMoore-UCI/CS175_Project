In addition, Syfy is developing a drama series called "Seeing Things." Based on the comic "Grey Legion" from Platinum Studios, "Seeing Things" is about a cop who meets a violent demise but returns as a ghost to close his last case. Skip Woods ("X-Men Origins: Wolverine"), Naren Shankar ("CSI: Crime Scene Investigation") and Deran Sarafian ("CSI: NY") will write and executive produce this one from Universal Cable Productions. Slack, Robert Cort and Scott Mitchell Rosenberg will executive produce the project from Fox Television Studios. Another movie/mini project in the works at Syfy is "Darkfall," from Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris ("Kung Fu Panda," "Sleeper Cell"). Jim Henson Company and Universal Cable Productions will produce.
