French President Francois Hollande is visiting Guinea on Friday in a direct show of support for the West African nation as it battles the deadly Ebola virus. As of Sunday, there had been 1,260 deaths in Guinea out of 2,134 confirmed, probable or suspected cases of Ebola, the WHO said in an update Wednesday. "Case incidence is stable in Guinea, stable or declining in Liberia, but may still be increasing in Sierra Leone," the WHO said. In a briefing to journalists ahead of the trip, the presidential office said Hollande wanted to take stock of the efforts being made to combat Ebola, not just in Guinea but around the world. By going there, he hopes to show solidarity with Guinea and its neighbors and send the world a message about not stigmatizing countries affected by Ebola.
