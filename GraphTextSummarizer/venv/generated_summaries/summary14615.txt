Bundaberg, a coastal town about 360 kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Brisbane, was particularly hard hit, with more than 2,000 homes inundated with water and a similar number of people evacuated, said mayor Mal Forman. In Brisbane, residents were being asked to limit water use after a water treatment plant was clogged up by silted water. We have water either side of us and the water is flowing rapidly," Forman told CNN by telephone from his office in Bundaberg's town center. An aerial photo taken above Bundaberg posted by Queensland State Premier Campbell Newman on his Twitter account showed vast swathes of land under water. " Some of the town's roads were under six or seven meters of water and some one-storey houses were completely covered, Forman added.
