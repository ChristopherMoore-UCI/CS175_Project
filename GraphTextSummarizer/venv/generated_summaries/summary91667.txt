A former counterterrorism official with knowledge of U.S.-Libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to conduct operations in support of U.S. policy in Libya, including assessing the opposition and determining their needs. For instance, when the CIA helped launch the occupation of Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, CIA operatives were in the country coordinating activities before there were any U.S. boots on the ground. Whenever the CIA is engaged in secret action, the U.S. wants plausible deniability of the role it may have played -- but as the former senior intelligence official indicated, that isn't always the case. A former counterterrorism official said the specific activities of CIA officers would be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the president. The law prohibits the expenditure of appropriated funds by or on behalf of the CIA for intelligence activities "unless and until the President finds that each such operation is important to the national security of the United States and reports, in a timely fashion, a description and scope of such operation to the appropriate committees of Congress."
