Rolling Stone apologized, acknowledging discrepancies and admitting that its writer had not contacted the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on Jackie. The decision came after Charlottesville police told UVA "that their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi," the university said in a statement. Months after a troublesome Rolling Stone article detailed rape claims on campus, the University of Virginia has reinstated its chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. In November, Rolling Stone published "A Rape on Campus" featuring a woman identified only as Jackie. For example, two of Jackie's friends told CNN that numerous details of the alleged attack described in Rolling Stone were entirely different from what Jackie told them that night.
