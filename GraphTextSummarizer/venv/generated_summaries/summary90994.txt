The first meeting will occur Monday in Atlanta, where Holder will hold a roundtable discussion with law enforcement, local officials, community leaders, student leaders and faith leaders on race relations and policing in minority communities. As mayor of New Orleans, Morial said he focused on encouraging strong relationships between local communities and law enforcement -- not only reducing tensions, but preventing crimes. "The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color. The President also announced that he had instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to work with cities to build better relations between communities and law enforcement. And this is tragic, because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates."
