Today, we have worked constructively to reach a settlement agreement that is satisfactory to all parties involved," said California Highway Patrol Commissioner Joe Farrow in a statement. A police report released a few days after the incident said Pinnock posed a danger to herself and other drivers because she was "walking within traffic lanes" at times and when asked to stop she became "physically combative." A 51-year-old woman shown in a video being repeatedly punched by a California Highway Patrol officer has reached a $1.5 million settlement with the law enforcement agency, its media relations office said. As a result of the settlement, the officer involved, Daniel L. Andrew, has agreed to resign, the CHP media relations office said. The beating suffered by Marlene Pinnock, a great-grandmother, took place in July along the Santa Monica Freeway and was caught on tape by a passing motorist.
