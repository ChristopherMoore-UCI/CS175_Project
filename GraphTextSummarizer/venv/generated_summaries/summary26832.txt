The National Telecommunications and Information Administration offered a program to help people buy converter boxes that make old TVs work in the new era. On the whole, studies show more people will get TV signals than will lose them in the switch to digital, Ingram said. The National Association of Broadcasters supports delaying the change until June in part because it will cause fewer people to go without TV after the change. Congress elected to delay the digital switch in part because lawmakers don't want people to go without TV. While analog signals fizzle out over long distances, digital signals tend to stop completely at a certain falling-off point.
