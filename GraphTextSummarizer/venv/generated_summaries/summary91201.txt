Regulators, journalists, securities analysts and investors routinely ignore the most obvious indicators of investment risk that are presented by bad boards of directors. Editor's note: Nell Minow is editor and chairwoman of the Corporate Library, an independent research company, and was named one of the 20 most influential people in corporate governance by Directorship magazine and "the queen of good corporate governance" by BusinessWeek Online. Because of the extensive involvement that financial services companies have in many different aspects of the business of large public corporations, directors of those companies in particular should be especially cautious about overlaps and conflicts. This is particularly obvious in the case of AIG, which has been a serial offender in corporate governance, especially in executive compensation. Badly designed compensation is an indicator of poor corporate governance, and poor corporate governance is an indicator of investment risk.
