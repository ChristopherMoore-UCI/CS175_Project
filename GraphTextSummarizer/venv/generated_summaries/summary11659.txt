Congressional tensions This week, House Republicans will huddle at their annual three-day retreat in Baltimore to map out their 2012 agenda and strategy for responding to Obama and congressional Democrats. And with key economic nominees needing Senate confirmation, including a new director of the Office of Management and Budget after Jack Lew was named White House chief of staff, Republicans could cause problems for the president and Senate Democrats. And Democrats are concerned that House Republicans will insist on adding more items to the measures to try to keep conservatives on board. While aides in both parties say it's likely Congress will resolve that dispute, Republicans are still licking their wounds after a public backlash over how they handled those issues and fear that Senate Democrats will drag out the fight to score more political points in an election year. In addition to their push for Keystone, House Republicans are planning votes early this year on legislation that would expand domestic energy production and upgrade transportation infrastructure across the country.
