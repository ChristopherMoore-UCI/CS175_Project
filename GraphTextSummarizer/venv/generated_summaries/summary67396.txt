"For immigration reform to be truly comprehensive, it must include protections for all families," Leahy said. Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told CNN it's unlikely the narrowly divided 18-member Senate committee would make significant changes to the legislation. Durbin acknowledged Tuesday that while he backs Leahy's proposal, it could prove problematic for the larger immigration reform bill. Other amendments proposed by committee members include a proposal by Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions to significantly cut the number of foreign workers granted admission to the United States under the bill. The list of requirements could include, among other things, jointly owned property, shared child custody, joint bank accounts, joint credit cards, proof of a commitment ceremony and photographs of shared vacations and holidays with extended family.
