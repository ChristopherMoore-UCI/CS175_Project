"So you may not notice it to the naked eye, but the bottom line is there's a lot below the surface we should look into." Besides, women have more options: a male broadcaster such as Stefanovic is pretty much locked into a suit and tie, while a woman can indulge in some variety (though TV image consultants may have something to say about that, as Wilkinson observed in a pointed speech). And often, as Stefanovic pointed out on Monday's show, it's women criticizing other women. It's "ridiculous," agrees New York-based style consultant Rachel Weingarten -- but nevertheless, she adds, there's something to be said for being noticed. Indeed, there's a whole industry of gossip and fashion magazines targeted at women that exist to showcase women's clothing and "hot new looks," while in magazines aimed at men -- such as GQ and Esquire -- fashion and style are simply portions of a much larger scope of issues. Stefanovic was trying to make a point about sexism, he told Australia's Fairfax Media.
