In the battle for European qualification, Athletic Bilbao kept themselves in the hunt with a 4-1 win over 10-man Tenerife, who had Jose Antonio Culebras sent off in the 17th minute for violent play. Inspired by the brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo, Real closed to within two points of leaders Barcelona at the top of the Spanish Primera Liga. A penalty from former Liverpool star Xavi Alonso completed the goal glut as they kept pace with Barcelona, who had beaten Racing Santander 4-0 on Saturday. Atletico Madrid had inflicted a first league defeat of the season on Barca last weekend but their joy proved short lived as they were beaten 1-0 by lowly Almeria. Pablo Piatti scored the winner three minutes from time for Almeria while Malaga boosted their hopes of survival after a 2-1 win at Espanyol.
