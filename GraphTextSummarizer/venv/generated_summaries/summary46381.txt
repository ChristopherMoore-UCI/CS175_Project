The 29-year-old started from pole position and delighted the "Tifosi" -- the name given to Ferrari's legion of passionate fans -- with a superb drive to finish ahead of world champion Jenson Button, with Felipe Massa third in the second Ferrari. -- Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso secured an emotional victory for Ferrari at their home Italian Grand Prix at Monza on Sunday. The Spaniard is now on 166 points, 21 points behind new leader Mark Webber -- who overtook McLaren's Lewis Hamilton at the top of the standings despite finishing down in sixth place. Button claimed the better start and led for the first 36 laps, but Alonso took the lead following a pit stop and held on for Ferrari's first "home" win in four years. Nico Hulkenberg of Williams, Renault driver Robert Kubica, seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher and the second Williams of Rubens Barrichello completed the top 10.
