Cavill cites the lack of brand awareness, too rapid expansion and badly thought out partnerships with U.S. chains as typical reasons why British and other foreign brands have failed to make much of a dent in the U.S. Last year profits of Arcadia Group were more than healthy -- around $440 million in 2010 -- but faced with the U.S. market, "we are a pimple in terms of one brand, in terms of scale, of what the size of the opportunity could be," Green says. Did we take a site that was horrid, did it have risk in terms of where it is, how far down SoHo it is, getting people to come down there?" They may be rhetorical questions, but despite the calculated risks Green and his Arcadia Group remains an emerging player in the U.S. retail scene where so many British companies have tried and failed before: a common joke in the rag-trade says that the only way to make a small fortune in America is start with a large fortune. His transformation of Topshop from cheap high street shop to a fashion-forward brand has grabbed the attention of supermodels, fashionistas and the queen of fashion, U.S. Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour. Green's Arcadia Group has over 2,500 outlets in the UK, including affordable fashion chain, Topshop, and employs over 44,000 staff. -- Sir Philip Green is the retail king of Great Britain, but can his empire of clothing stores conquer the U.S.?
