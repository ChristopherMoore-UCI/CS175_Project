-- Practically from the day the Space Age started on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union launched the first human-made satellite into Earth orbit, it's been like this. My own cheerleading for space travel was often countered with some spoilsport, honest and sincere, complaining that all that money being shot into the skies could be put to better use on Earth: Both these catastrophes were too reminiscent of the serial test failures of the 1950s in which rockets regularly blew up before reaching the stratosphere and test pilots seeking faster, higher records in the same Mojave skies lost their planes and their lives. Christopher Nolan's film conceives a potential future in which what's left of NASA has gone underground to figure out options for humankind literally choking to death on ecological decay on Earth. e.g. Why do we need to go to Mars when we have all these problems on Earth to solve?
