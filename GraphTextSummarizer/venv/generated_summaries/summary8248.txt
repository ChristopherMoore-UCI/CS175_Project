Greece has also hammered out a plan to write down €100 billion worth of Greek government bonds and swap existing debt for securities with lower interest rates, a deal that would result in losses of 53.5% of nominal value for the private sector. " While the Greek economy is small compared to other eurozone countries -- "about the size of Connecticut compared to the rest of the United States," Neumann said -- the real threat is keeping the debt crisis and borrowing costs from spiraling to larger economies in the eurozone. The Greece deal is not the final step toward stabilizing eurozone debt woes. -- Eurozone finance ministers sealed a deal Tuesday morning for a second bailout for Greece, including €130 billion ($173 billion) in new financing. Tuesday's bailout deal "certainly removes some near-term risk," said Frederick Neumann, senior economist for HSBC in Hong Kong.
