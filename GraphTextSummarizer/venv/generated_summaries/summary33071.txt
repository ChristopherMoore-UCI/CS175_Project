Moen Grude recently packed off a shipment of bells with Norwegian fans heading to the European Handball Championships. "Music is pumped out to encourage chanting and singing and there is a sense that, for example, football clubs are intruding into what was once a fairly spontaneous part of fan culture." And if you are the proud owner of a cowbell in North America, chances are it passed through her hands en-route to the U.S. "Bells have been used, especially in downhill skiing, for a long time. It started in Switzerland, where in summer the cows all walk around the mountains with bells on," added Halvorson. " "He began producing bells for his neighbors' domestic animals and sheep."
