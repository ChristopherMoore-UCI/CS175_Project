In December, Malaga were handed a season-long ban from UEFA club competitions after falling foul of FFP. "As is well known, the UEFA rules encourage clubs to 'live within their own means', which is a sound economic principle aiming to guarantee the long-term sustainability and viability of European football. "The "break-even" rule also infringes other EU fundamental freedoms: free movement of capital (as far as club owners are concerned), free movement of workers (players) and free movement of services (player agents)," said the statement issued by Striani and Dupont. However UEFA expects the Commission to reject the complaint given the support it has received from a number of European bodies as well as clubs ahead of the new regulations' introduction. Malaga, who were the first high-profile club to be punished under new tougher FFP rules, owed player wages and have debts with other football sides as well as the Spanish tax authorities, claim UEFA.
