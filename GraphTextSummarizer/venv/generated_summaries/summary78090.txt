PSG has invested heavily in the transfer market in recent seasons, spending a reported $260 million bringing in the likes of Javier Pastore, defender Thiago Silva, striker Ibrahimovic and Lucas Moura along with several others. With Valencia needing just one more goal to progress, PSG began to awake from its slumber with the introduction of striker Kevin Gameiro. " Valencia coach Ernesto Valverde was left disappointed with the result but admitted that he could not criticize his players for their performance. United, which was beaten 2-1 by Real Madrid at Old Trafford, was angered by the sending off of Nani by Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir. But Paris Saint-Germain, without the suspended Ibrahimovic and benched Beckham, booked its place in the quarterfinals for the first time since 1995 following a 1-1 draw with Valencia.
