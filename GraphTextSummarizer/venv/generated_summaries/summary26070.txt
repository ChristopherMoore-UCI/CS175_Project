Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth told CNN the F-Type -- footage of which was released exclusively on CNN's Quest Means Business -- carries the DNA of previous models. Speth said he expects the model, already creating extensive online chatter, to enjoy "very special demand." The previous E-Type, Speth added, "was and still is a very, very iconic car and nobody can build such a car anymore. The Jaguar 2013 F-Type, the latest from the company's more than seven decades producing luxury cars, will debut at the Paris Auto Show this week. Speth expects the car to sell well both in emerging markets and in Europe.
