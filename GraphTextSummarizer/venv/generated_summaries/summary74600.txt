Acclaim Entertainment's "South Park," a first-person-shooter game released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64, computer and original PlayStation, was panned by critics. The creators of the "South Park" TV show are working on a new video game that is planned to hit stores in the latter half of next year, game publisher THQ announced on Thursday. " Game Informer magazine, which is published by GameStop, will have more details about "South Park: The Game," including an interview with Stone and Parker, in the issue that hits newsstands this month. With the new game, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the power duo behind "South Park" and the Broadway hit "The Book of Mormon," should want to erase their last foray into console gaming from people's memories. "Matt and Trey are arguably two of the most important comedic talents of their generation," THQ executive Danny Bilson said in a statement.
