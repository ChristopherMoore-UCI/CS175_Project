-- A plan to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. to spend more time away from his government mental hospital and eventually to become a permanent outpatient "lacks specificity," a psychiatrist who has closely followed Hinckley's case for over a decade said Tuesday. However, Phillips said he does not agree Hinckley's depression is in full remission and says he displays some symptoms, including sullen behavior and weight gain. He said the proposal by St. Elizabeths hospital to let Hinckley spend much more time visiting his mother at her home in Williamsburg, Virginia, "is not good enough" because it lacks firm details about what kind of therapy sessions, group sessions and art and music classes Hinckley could attend in Williamsburg. During the 10 days of hearings, various experts have said Hinckley's most severe illnesses -- major depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder -- are in full remission. Phillips said the Virginia mental facility that agreed to provide outpatient programs for Hinckley has not received records from St Elizabeths about Hinckley's condition it needs in order to construct a program for him.
