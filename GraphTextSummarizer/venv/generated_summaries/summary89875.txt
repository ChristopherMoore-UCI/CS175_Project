In 2005, sources inside the U.S. government leaked the news that Poland was permitting the CIA to detain captured al Qaeda terrorists in secret in Polish prisons. Polish support for U.S. geopolicy has twice ended in humiliation for Polish governments. Of course, too, the U.S. has banked a huge store of goodwill in Poland that will take years to deplete. Some waning of U.S. prestige in Poland was inevitable. A Pole can work legally in any large EU country, and an estimated 1 million do, sending home more money than Poland earns from all its U.S. trade.
