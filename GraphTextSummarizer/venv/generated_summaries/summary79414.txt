The school's university health services said a student who contracted measles -- likely during a trip overseas -- had spent time in and around campus and commuting to and from his home in Contra Costa County on Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, trains during the February 4 to 7 morning commutes and in the late evening. " Erika Jenssen, the communicable disease program director for Contra Costa Health Services, said Thursday even those who shared the same airspace as the infected student 1 to 2 hours after the fact -- and who have not been vaccinated for measles -- may get sick. Children are particularly susceptible: About 10% of them who get measles come down with ear infections, and roughly 5% end up with pneumonia. Measles start out much like a common cold, with high fevers, red eyes and a telltale rash often following. That's a possibility in Northern California, where health officials are trying to get the word out that a University of California, Berkeley, student may have exposed classmates and strangers to measles.
