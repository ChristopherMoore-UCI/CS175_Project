-- "Sometimes you can forget about the preciousness of life," hospital spokesman Allen Poston thumbed onto his Blackberry after peering into an operating room where a team of 15 doctors and medical staff separated conjoined twins in six hours in surgery. Poston, who updated friends and relatives on the surgery with constant posts from his hospital blog, snapped photos of each girl and showed them to friends and family who had been in the hospital waiting room since early Monday. "I'm standing here in the operating room looking at the exposed beating heart of Preslee Wells," he wrote as he walked the halls at the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma University Medical Center. On Monday afternoon, 2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, rolled onto their own backs for the first time, he said. Two-month-old twins Preslee and Kylee Wells required surgical separation.
