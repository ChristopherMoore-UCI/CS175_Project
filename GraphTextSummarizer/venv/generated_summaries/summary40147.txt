In a presentation at PopTech, a conference about new ideas in science and technology, Kish describes himself as a "real-life batman" and showed videos of his blind students riding mountain bikes through obstacle courses, playing basketball and skateboarding." Kish, who lost both his eyes to cancer when he was an infant, says something is broken with the way blind students all over the world learn. By and large, they're taught to be dependent on sighted people -- in part because 99% of them, he said, are taught by people who can see. "And some disability advocates worry that all the hoopla over sonar makes blind people seem like superhuman freaks, with special powers that more than compensate for their problems." Not allowing blind people a chance to do these things, he said, would be "very shortsighted."
