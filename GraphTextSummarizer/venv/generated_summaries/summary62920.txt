Protesters not only lined the streets outside SeaWorld Orlando in Florida, the company's flagship park, but the streets of New York and Pasadena during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rose Parade. "To promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts about SeaWorld -- among them, that SeaWorld is one of the world's most respected zoological institutions, that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research." "The Blackfish crusade against SeaWorld and zoological care in general is engineered by a perfect marriage between sensational animal rights organizations and disgruntled ex-SeaWorld employees." In December, SeaWorld's largest investor, the Blackstone Group, sold its majority ownership the month before SeaWorld's own chairman sold more than a million dollars' worth of his SeaWorld stock. SeaWorld has battled back against the claims "Blackfish" makes, calling the film grossly one-sided and the product of animal activists.
