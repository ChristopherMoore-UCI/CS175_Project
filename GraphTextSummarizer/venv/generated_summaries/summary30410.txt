" Originally released last May, "Flappy Bird" had largely languished before a surge in popularity, starting around December, that would see it become the most downloaded app in both Apple's App Store and the Google Play store for Android devices. Or you could just busy yourself with one of the multitude of "Flappy Bird" clones, which continue to flood app stores at insane rates. In the mean time, Dot Gears, Nguyen's studio, has two other games available for download -- "Shuriken Block" and "Super Ball Juggling." At the time of its demise, "Flappy Bird" had an average four-star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the Apple App Store and 228,000 on Android. "Flappy Bird," the now defunct mobile sensation, will one day rise like a phoenix and fling itself awkwardly into an app store near you.
