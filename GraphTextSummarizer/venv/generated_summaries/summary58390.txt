The move means that until new generals are named, many regions in Peru, including many in the interior of the country, will be led by colonels instead of generals, something that opposition politicians have criticized. The new head of the police, Raul Salazar, mentioned the need to fight corruption no less than six times during a speech at his induction ceremony. The forced retirements, which were announced in the official gazette over the weekend, are widely seen as an attempt by Humala to combat corruption. -- Peruvian President Ollanta Humala has removed 30 of 55 generals in the national police, the largest such purge in the institution's history. Critics also voiced concerns that the move was a ploy by Humala, as a new president, to place commanders loyal to him in the top posts.
