While "Frozen's" soundtrack has done just fine, with just over 3 million units sold as of October 10, it seems music fans haven't been as eager about albums released by artists. Taylor Swift will release her latest album, "1989," on October 27, and the Foo Fighters' "Sonic Highways" is slated for November. Even the "Frozen" soundtrack is a holdover, as it arrived last November. In fact, the two performers who've come closest to reaching platinum-level success in 2014 actually released their albums last year. Beyonce's self-titled artistic smash has gone on to notch 776,000 units so far this year, while Lorde's "Pure Heroine" has pushed 754,000.
