After the visits were over, Planned Parenthood notified local authorities of alleged human trafficking and learned of at least 11 visits to facilities in six states over one week "in which persons claiming to be involved in sex trafficking with minors asked for services for young women," according to Planned Parenthood statements. "These are actors, and they investigate sexual abuse cover-up going on across the country institutionally at Planned Parenthood clinics," Rose told CNN. "This bill would deny federal funds for family planning and preventive care to Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of reproductive health care to women in the United States," the statement by Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood in New York state said. Planned Parenthood spokesman Schear said the video posted on the Live Action website was edited and was shot with a secret camera by Live Action activists on January 13. In response, Planned Parenthood described the January 13 video by Rose's anti-abortion group Live Action as a scheme to "take down" the abortion-rights organization, Planned Parenthood spokesman Stuart Schear said in a statement.
