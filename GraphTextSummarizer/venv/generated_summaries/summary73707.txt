Recent remarks by U.S. President Barack Obama that he is not thinking of military action against Iran are positive, according to Iran's supreme leader, Iran's state-run Press TV reported Thursday. Iran insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful, civilian purposes, but the United States, Israel, and many other countries suspect it is trying to develop nuclear weapons. But Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized Obama's threat to impose more sanctions on Iran, saying Tehran's enemies have been imposing repeated sanctions ever since the country's Islamic Revolution more than 30 years ago "in the hope of turning Iranians away from the Islamic establishment," the television network said. It is "deeply in everybody's interests -- the United States, Israel and the world's -- to see if this can be resolved in a peaceful fashion," he said of Iran's nuclear issue. And in an interview with The Atlantic this month, Obama cautioned against an Israeli strike on Iran.
