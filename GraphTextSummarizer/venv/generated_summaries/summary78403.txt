Carpeted walls, which are common in movie theaters would reduce the risk of ricochets, said ballistics expert Jon Nordsby. Bullets that have first passed through objects such as theater chairs might cause worse wounds. "The very nature of theaters makes them perfect killing zones," said Howard. Howard offered these details about the weapons police say were used in the attack: -- AR-15 rifle: A rifle that commonly fires bullets .223 inches in diameter. Authorities in the Colorado movie theater massacre found an AR-15 rifle drum magazine Friday capable of carrying 100 rounds, and the police chief said thousands of rounds of ammunition for various weapons had been bought online in the weeks prior to the shooting.
