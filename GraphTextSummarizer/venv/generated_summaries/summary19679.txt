The militants had taken the owner of the house hostage, said Peshawar Police Chief Imtiaz Altaf. "We have planned more attacks on Pakistani forces and its installation as it works to please the USA," Ehsan said. Police had been looking for the men after three rockets were fired toward Peshawar's Bacha Khan International Airport on Saturday, killing at least nine people. Taliban official Ehsanullah Ehsan said their target was in fact the air base. -- Five militants suspected to be behind an airport attack in Peshawar were killed Sunday morning when police raided a house where they were hiding.
