Twenty-two ships and four planes are combing the area for the missing men, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported, citing Hainan maritime authorities. President Xi Jinping on Monday urged local authorities to do their utmost to find the missing or stranded and minimize casualties, state media reported. Fifty-eight fishermen remain missing from the three boats that went down in the South China Sea roughly 300 kilometers from the Chinese island of Hainan, the local government said Tuesday. A total of five fishing boats with 171 crew aboard were caught in the storm, the Hainan Maritime Search and Rescue Center said, according to Xinhua. Three people have been killed as a result of the storm, the state-run Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday, citing the regional center for flood and storm prevention.
