When British tennis player Heather Watson said in a post-match interview that she lost her Australian Open round due to "girl things," she sparked a debate about menstruation that quickly spread across the world. "Even grown women in the office, when they make the walk from their cubicle to the bathroom discreetly tuck a tampon or pad up their sleeve or decide whether to carry their purse with them -- not to hide the blood itself, but the fact that they're bleeding," Karen Houppert, author of "The Curse: Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo, Menstruation," told CNN. "Girl things" While Houppert supported Watson's candor, she said describing menstruation as "girl things" perpetuated a culture of concealment. In some cases, professional cyclists naturally miss periods due to low body weight, said Thompson. "It's potentially problematic for women because our periods can get used against us," said Houppert.
