The story has gotten a ton of traction online, with many parents expressing outrage about another case of a parent under investigation for letting children do things on their own. " As Meitiv's kids got older, she and her husband grew more aware of the whole concept of helicopter parenting -- and the idea that kids had to be supervised all the time. In October, a few days after Danielle Meitiv let the kids play at a playground around the block from their house and walk home by themselves, two CPS workers came to her door after they were contacted by someone mostly likely from the neighborhood, Meitiv said. Alexander Meitiv was not arrested, but a few hours later, someone from Child Protective Services arrived and said the family needed to agree not to let the children be unsupervised until the matter was resolved within the agency, or the children would be taken into the custody of Child Protective Services. "And if we are going to say, 'Oh, my God, I would never let my kid walk outside; something bad could happen,' well, I hope you're saying that 'Oh, my God, I would never put my kid in the car, something bad could happen,' because the No. 1 way children die in America is as car passengers, and yet we seem to keep that 'danger' in perspective, but we can't keep the same perspective when it comes to letting our children walk outside," she added.
