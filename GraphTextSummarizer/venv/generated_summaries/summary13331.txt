"I think that it was a good weekend to reconstruct my season," said Vonn, whose divorce from husband Thomas Vonn after a year of separation came through last week. Tina Maze is already far ahead in the race to usurp Vonn as overall World Cup champion, and on Sunday she joined the American as one of only six female skiers to win a race in each of the alpine sport's five disciplines. The Austrian was beaten by Ted Ligety on Saturday when the American took advantage of his rival's mistake to win the giant slalom, but this time Hirscher recovered from eighth place in the opening run to beat compatriot Mario Matt and third-placed Italian Manfred Moelgg. It was Maze's 17th World Cup win overall, still a long way off Vonn's leading 57. The four-time World Cup champion won the first two Super G races this season, but then took a month off due to stomach problems.
