Before his arrest, police had been worried that Morgan may be targeting Wesleyan University and the town's Jewish residents. Morgan was one of several people who gathered Wednesday afternoon outside Broad Street Books after the Wesleyan junior was shot, the source said. In July 2007, the young woman filed a harassment complaint against Morgan while the two were taking the same six-week summer course at New York University, school spokesman John Beckman told CNN. A spokesman in Meriden said Stephen Morgan had been in custody there, but was transferred to police in Middletown, seven miles away. A statement from the university alleges that Morgan had written threats against "Wesleyan and/or its Jewish students" in his personal journals.
