State media quoted Zimbabwe police VIP protection spokesman Martin Mbokochena as attributing the incident to "some unruly elements in society who want to disturb. Kubatana, an online network for Zimbabwean activists, on Tuesday sent an SMS message saying: "Mugabe's motorcade has been in three crashes in past month causing death and injury. So far all I know is that one passenger who was in a commuter bus died on the spot and 15 passengers from the two vehicles sustained injuries," Bvudzijena said when asked to confirm reports of two more deaths in the incident. " All three accidents happened in Mugabe's rural home district, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southwest of Harare in Mashonaland West province. The accident was the third in two weeks involving the 88-year-old Zimbabwean leader's motorcade, which consists of about 15 vehicles, including a Mercedes limousine, motorcycles and army vehicles.
