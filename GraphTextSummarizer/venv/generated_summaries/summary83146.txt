The Human Rights Campaign called it "an important and historic step towards equal dignity, equal respect and equal rights for same-sex couples." Last week, New York's state Senate defeated a bill that would legalize such marriages. A law legalizing such marriages in New Hampshire takes effect January 1. District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty signed a measure recognizing such marriages as legal. Earlier this year, lawmakers in Maine approved a measure legalizing same-sex marriages, but voters in the state last month passed a referendum to overturn the new law.
