"We are confident, with the indictment and arrest of Jerice Hunter today, we will achieve our ... goal of securing justice for Jhessye," Black told reporters. Montgomery, the county attorney, said the fact authorities haven't found Jhessye's body didn't prove to be an impediment in securing an indictment nor did he expect it would prevent a jury from convicting Hunter. A grand jury indicted Jerice Hunter on Thursday and, later that day, she was arrested "without incident" around 1:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) at her home in Mesa, Arizona, Glendale interim police Chief Debora Black said. Police believe 5-year-old's body was dumped in trash Hunter had said her daughter Jhessye, then 5 years old, wandered out of the family's Glendale home on October 11. Police said reports from the girl's siblings led them to believe Hunter had abused Jhessye.
