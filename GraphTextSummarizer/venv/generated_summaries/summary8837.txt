-- Teresa Romero Ramos, a Spanish nurse's aide who had contracted Ebola after caring for a patient with the deadly disease, is now free of the virus, Spain's Special Ebola Committee said Sunday. "The last two measurements were in 'background' levels, and there is no significant statistical difference with negative results," Luis Enjuanes, an expert on viruses, said in a phone interview, in English, with CNN. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Nic Robertson and Joshua Berlinger contributed to this report To fight her lung problems while also battling Ebola, the doctors administered anti-inflammatory drugs to ease her respiratory problems, even while unsure how that treatment might affect the anti-Ebola measures, Enjuanes said. "It means she's making her own protection, so any virus fooling around probably will be destroyed or neutralized," said Enjuanes, who's been attending the near-daily meetings of the government's special committee on Ebola, a panel of medical and scientific experts convened to deal with the crisis.
