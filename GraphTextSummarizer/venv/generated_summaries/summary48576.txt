Like his son, King Sr. was a tireless civil rights advocate; he even led the Atlanta branch of the NAACP. Sammy Davis Sr. had a lot in common with his candy man son. A 1992 Sports Illustrated profile of his son noted that Mel Sr. played a key role in helping get Mel Kiper Enterprises off the ground by helping his son track down subscribers and advertisers for his early NFL draft newsletters. Given his son's famous concerns about the climate, it's surprising that Al Sr. worked as a lawyer for a petroleum company and later became chairman of Island Creek Coal Company following the end of his political career. Sammy Sr. was a successful dancer and vaudeville entertainer along with his wife, Elvera Sanchez, during the 1920s.
