Greenpeace published a guide to "environmentally friendly sex" in 2002, which includes "switching off the lights during romance" or "if you want to see your partner, have sex during the day." Casanova himself was known to eat them in great quantities before sex." It's clear in Weiss' 200-page book that she is using sex to promote a completely green lifestyle. But if you haven't considered "greening your love life, you are still a total environmental disaster," according to Stefanie Iris Weiss, author of the recently released book, "Eco-Sex."
