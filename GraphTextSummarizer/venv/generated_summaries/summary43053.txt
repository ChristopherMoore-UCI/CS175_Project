R.E.M. actually made their decision a few months ago, before they met in Athens, Georgia, this summer to record three new songs for a two-CD greatest-hits package, "R.E.M., Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage" 1982- 2011, out November 15th. "There is a great deal of sadness, but it's really celebratory," R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills says, describing his conflicting emotions the day after he, guitarist Peter Buck and singer Michael Stipe announced they were disbanding after 31 years together. " Mills, Buck and Stipe issued the news of their split without warning on September 21st, in a statement posted on R.E.M.'s website. The band delayed the announcement because "a lot of people are affected by this decision in a serious way," Mills says, referring to R.E.M.'s staff and crew. " Ironically, R.E.M.'s disappointing 2004 album, "Around the Sun," made Mills, Stipe and Buck determined to stick around long enough to redeem themselves.
