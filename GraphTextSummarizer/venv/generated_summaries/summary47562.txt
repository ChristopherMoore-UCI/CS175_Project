Among other things, the $4.5 billion measure provides more money to poor areas to subsidize free meals and requires schools to abide by health guidelines drafted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. -- President Barack Obama signed a sweeping overhaul of child nutrition standards Monday, enacting a law meant to encourage better eating habits in part by giving the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds. To help offset the higher cost of including more fruits and vegetables, the bill increases the reimbursement rate for school lunches. "Right now across the country too many kids don't have access to school meals." The measure has been a top priority for first lady Michelle Obama, who has championed it as part of her "Let's Move" initiative to combat child obesity in the United States.
