A lot of the ghostly tales and legends that were in my mind at the time involved cats -- the mythical black panthers people are always claiming to spot, particularly -- and that gave the idea some traction, because I had a very real setting with which to work. -- In a summer crowded with books about vampires, werewolves and things that go bump in the night, a young novelist is stepping forward with his own fresh take on the supernatural suspense thriller. At the time, while I read widely, I was very focused on writing detective novels. The supernatural elements were more of a plotting challenge, too, and I think good things happen when you challenge yourself as a writer. But the story adds some chilling and unexpected twists, including a landlocked lighthouse, a mysterious blue light and a home for rescued lions, tigers and other big cats.
