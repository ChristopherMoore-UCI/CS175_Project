Liverpool decide against Suarez appeal City suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Sunderland on Sunday, but went ahead after just 10 minutes as Argentina star Aguero beat Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina with a dipping shot he might have saved. In Tuesday's other games, third-placed Tottenham Hotspur beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 while Sunderland continued to impress under new manager Martin O'Neill with a 4-1 win at struggling Wigan. Goals from Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and a James Milner penalty put City ahead of second-placed local rivals Manchester United, who visit Newcastle on Wednesday. "It was massive for us, we didn't deserve to lose against Sunderland but we were incredibly efficient today," Kompany told Sky Sports. It completed a miserable evening for Liverpool, who were missing striker Luis Suarez after club officials confirmed before the match they would not appeal his eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra.
