"We recently made some changes to Facebook that help surface more engaging content, whether paid or organic, to people using Facebook," spokesman Andrew Noyes said in an e-mail. "Sponsored stories" -- in other words, posts that someone paid for -- reportedly will begin appearing in the feed in the top right corner of home pages. "With these changes, people may see a varying number of ads or Sponsored Stories alongside organic content. But as with many Facebook changes, complaints died down in the weeks that followed as users either got used to the feature or entered a realm of quiet acceptance. "Sponsored stories" have appeared on Facebook for some time, targeted to individual users based on their activities on the site.
