Justice prosecutors met with State Department officials "after the attorney general's remarks on Friday and are coordinating with the Office of Inspector General on its investigative efforts," Justice spokesman Peter Carr said Tuesday. -- The Justice Department Tuesday said its prosecutors are assisting the State Department Inspector General in the investigation into the breaching of passport files of the three leading presidential candidates by State Department contractors. Watch the Secretary of State's comments Â» State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Monday the Justice Department had an "open invitation to be involved in the process" and it would be "up to the Department of Justice as to what sort of involvement they will have." The involvement of its lawyers appears to be a shift in the Justice Department's position since Friday, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey said he wouldn't join the investigation until the State Department inspector general requested assistance. The State Department initiated the contact and a follow-up meeting with Justice prosecutors sometime after Mukasey spoke, according to a knowledgeable official who asked not to be identified because of the pending investigation.
