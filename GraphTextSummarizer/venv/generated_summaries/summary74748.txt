Tendulkar, one of India's most popular sporting heroes, also holds the records for most runs and most centuries in the five-day Test format. South Africa set the record for highest run chase of 438-9 against Australia in 2006, and needed to score the third biggest mark to overhaul India's total. The 36-year-old became the first player to score a double-century in the 50-over format as India thrashed South Africa by 153 runs in the second match of the series in Gwalior to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. Tendulkar surpassed the previous record of 194, which was jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Charles Coventry of Zimbabwe, to take his record total of runs to 17,598 in 442 one-day internationals played. -- Sachin Tendulkar confirmed his status as one of cricket's all-time great batsmen on Wednesday, adding the highest individual one-day international score to his list of world records.
