But it would be a mistake to conclude that online courses fulfill the same role in a person's life as a college education, just as it would be an error to equate four years of high school with some online study and a GED exam. But the price of education has skyrocketed, especially in the tiny segment of elite schools. Don't get me wrong: I have always been a fan of online education -- but with a few important caveats. When America and other industrialized nations created public schools, it was not to make better workers but happier ones. Like the arts and journalism, whose value may be difficult to measure in dollars, higher education has long been understood as a rather "soft" pursuit.
