It is a second successive grand slam semifinal for Bouchard, who was beaten in straight sets by Li Na at the Australian Open earlier this year. Gulbis, seeded 18th, overcame Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4 to build on his impressive victory over 17- time grand slam winner Roger Federer. The Russian, who won at Roland Garros in 2012, will now face Canada's rising star Eugenie Bouchard. Sharapova, who was beaten in last year's final, won the second set 7-5 before taking the decider 6-1. Bouchard, ranked 16th in the world, appeared to be heading out of the tournament but fought back to take the match 7-6 2-6 7-5.
