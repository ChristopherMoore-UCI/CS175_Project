There are plenty of great white sharks in the southern California surf, but they pose no danger to beachgoers, according to Randy Hamilton, a shark expert with California's Monterey Bay Aquarium. Discovery Channel shark expert Jeff Kurr calls it a great white shark, but shark expert David Shiffman believes it was a dolphin. "Plus, the fact that that particular beach has become the epicenter for white shark activity, I would say it's definitely a white shark." Emerson told CNN that it wasn't until on the way home from the beach that her son spotted the creature in one of the photos she took that afternoon. "I just go back to the last 50 years on how many great white sharks have actually caused a death in southern California," Hamilton said. The great whites around southern California are juveniles, also known as "young of the year."
