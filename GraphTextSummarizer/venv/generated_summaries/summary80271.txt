President Barack Obama's campaign posted a photograph of him embracing his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, to Facebook and Twitter late Tuesday, moments after CNN and other news outlets projected he had won re-election over GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Amid the congratulations and the angry posts from Romney supporters were some praising the photo. Obama's campaign acknowledged his victory on Twitter and Facebook before he e-mailed supporters or addressed a victory rally early Wednesday in Chicago. It also has received more than 550,000 shares and 3.9 million likes on Facebook, shattering previous records held by Mark Zuckerberg's wedding photo in May and this photo of a glass of beer, set up as a tribute to a fallen sailor. The messages also rode a massive wave of Twitter chatter about the election returns.
