Liang Chow soared to international fame as a Chinese gymnast before settling down in the middle of Iowa to teach American gymnasts. In her two years with Chow, Douglas won a team gold medal at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo, another team gold medal at the London Olympics and finally the sweetest prize of them all -- the Olympic individual all-around championship. Like many young girls, she sat glued to the TV during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, mesmerized by the dazzling gymnasts flipping their way to glory. But Chow's gym was 1,200 miles away from Douglas, her siblings and her mother, who didn't think the idea would work. At age 14, Douglas received her mother's blessing to go train with Chow.
