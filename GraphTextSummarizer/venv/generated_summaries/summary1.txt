Before the Tevatron closed, the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a four-mile circumference in opposite directions. "We now have more than double the data we had last year," Sergio Bertolucci, the director for research and computing at CERN, said last month. But so far, neither the results from the U.S. collider experiments nor from the the Large Hadron Collider, located 328 feet underneath the border of France and Switzerland, have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery. The scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year.
