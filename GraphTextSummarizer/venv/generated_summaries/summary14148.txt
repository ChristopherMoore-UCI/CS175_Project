But compared to her Matt Lauer interview/Saturday Night Live hosting gig in March 2012, where it seemed like nerves got the best of her, the actress looked healthy, landed a few good punchlines and, most encouragingly for Lohan fans, appeared genuinely happy to be in front of a camera that wasn't tracking her movements in and out of a courthouse. While commenting about gay-rights activists who dumped vodka to protest Russia's new policies, Lohan remarked, "Waste of good vodka," before explaining she was allergic. In addition to laughing at the comics' remarks about her own public issues ("Justin Bieber has been on tour longer than you've been in rehab"), Lohan landed her own jokes about her problems with alcohol. Chalk it up to the benefit of lowered expectations: Lindsay Lohan guest-hosted "Chelsea Lately" last night, and it was one of her best television appearance in the past few years. One of the high point of Lohan's appearance was -- as is typical for her -- self-deprecating jokes.
