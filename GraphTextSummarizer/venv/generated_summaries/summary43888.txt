Second seed and defending champion Maria Sharapova played her second round match against Eugenie Bouchard of Canada later Thursday and was on the brink of victory, leading 6-2 and 4-2 in the second set when rain intervened again to end proceedings. -- Li Na's hopes of a second successive grand slam final appearance were washed away between the showers at Roland Garros Thursday -- losing her second round match to American Bethanie Mattek-Sands. Third seed Azarenka continued her impressive progress in search of a second straight grand slam title with a 6-4 6-3 win over Annika Beck of Germany. The sixth seed did take the opening set despite a comeback by her stocky opponent, but fell 4-1 down in the second before the first bout of rain. She will return Friday to complete the task, while the same fate befell the men's defending champion Rafael Nadal, who did not even get on court for his second round encounter with Martin Klizan of Slovakia.
