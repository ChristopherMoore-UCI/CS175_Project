Before leaving for Orange High School, Castillo sent an e-mail to the principal of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, to alert him that Hillsborough would soon make history, according to testimony. Alvaro Castillo was fixated with the Columbine High School shootings, mass murders and natural disasters. Castillo later dressed in a Colorado T-shirt, a black trench coat he bought during a sightseeing trip to Columbine, cargo pants, military-style boots and ammunition belts, according to testimony. From June 1 to August 30, Castillo's diary is replete with references to "Operation Columbine" and how he would "sacrifice" students then kill himself. Jurors also saw a narrated video that Castillo shot in Littleton after convincing his mother to take him there to see Columbine High School and the homes of shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
