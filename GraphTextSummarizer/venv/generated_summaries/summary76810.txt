The dragster was driven by Top Fuel driver Antron Brown. "The entire NHRA community is deeply saddened by today's incident and sends its thoughts and prayers to the woman's family and friends," the group said on its Web site. He went to a hospital as a precaution, but was released, the National Hot Rod Association said.
