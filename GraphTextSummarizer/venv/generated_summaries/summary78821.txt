-- President Barack Obama returned to Washington on Wednesday and plunged into a newly energized political debate over how to shrink the chronic federal deficit and debt in the wake of his stronger-than-expected re-election victory. Boehner tried to sound willing to compromise on Wednesday by saying he'd be open to a comprehensive plan resulting in more revenue, but not from higher taxes. In it, he challenged Obama to work with Republicans on negotiating a comprehensive plan to reduce spending, lower tax rates while eliminating tax loopholes, and reform entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. A White House statement said Obama launched the discussion on arguably the most pressing challenge facing his administration by phoning key congressional leaders Wednesday, including the top Republican in both the House and Senate. It frees President Obama to be able to work with the Republican Congress, and it frees the Republican Congress to be able to work with President Obama," Navarro said.
