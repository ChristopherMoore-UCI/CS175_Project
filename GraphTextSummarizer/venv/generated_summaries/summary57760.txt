The e-mail addresses, which showed up as messages for Facebook users, never took off, and when Facebook tried to make them the default e-mail accounts for all users in mid-2012, "a lot of people were unhappy with that," he said. With last week's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, the fast-growing messaging service, Facebook  is focusing more on mobile messaging than e-mail these days. "We're making this change because most people haven't been using their Facebook e-mail address, and we can focus on improving our mobile messaging experience for everyone," Facebook said in a statement. For those who do have a Facebook mail account, messages will be forwarded to the primary e-mail address listed in a user's account, the company said. Facebook ventured into the e-mail field in November 2010, adding the service to the messaging system already used heavily by its 1.2 billion users.
