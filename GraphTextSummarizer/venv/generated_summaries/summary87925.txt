More outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been reported aboard cruise ships since 2001, according to CDC statistics. Cruise ships are ripe for spreading illness. Measures include increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfection, isolating ill people, distributing information about proper hand-washing and hygiene as well as illness updates and regular reporting to CDC Vessel Sanitation Program officials. The government agency says the spike is tied to an increase in both passengers and ships sailing the seas as well as an overall increase in norovirus outbreaks. Nursing homes, dormitories and cruise ships are common transmission grounds.
