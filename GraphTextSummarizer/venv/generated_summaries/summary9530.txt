The reason Bruce Levenson could not make the Hawks profitable is not because black people don't buy season tickets, or arrive at games late, or spend all their time at the bar, or black fathers don't bring black sons to the games. It was another wealthy white man sharing his commonly thought views on the spending habits or lack thereof of black consumers and how that affects white consumers, who white business executives consider the most valued consumer in America. Racism has never been as profitable in the NBA as it is right now in the wake of the historic $2 billion sale of the Clippers, the almost doubling of national television deals that are sure to bring record profits to the league, and the identification of interested purchasers lined up and ready to close the deals.
