"One in 3,000 people has a chance of being hit by lightning (in a lifetime)," said CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. "We went outside, and all three of them were on the ground," Janet Suarez told CNN affiliate WSVN. Lightning strikes caused 28 deaths and 139 injuries in the United States -- the latest year for which figures are available, the National Weather Service said. It was unclear how close the men were to the spot where lightning struck. Last month, two farmers died and three others were injured in Buckeye, Kentucky when lightning struck a barn.
