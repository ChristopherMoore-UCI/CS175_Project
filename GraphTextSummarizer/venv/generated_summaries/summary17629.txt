The Nevado del Huila volcano is on orange alert, meaning an eruption is probable within days or weeks, the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining said last week. Colombian emergency officials said Monday they are asking the 800 families where they want to be moved to, Caracol Radio said. The volcano's crater holds 52 million cubic meters (1.8 billion cubic feet) of lava, said Colombia's Caracol Radio. Scientists with the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, commonly known as Ingeominas, said they did not detect any major action inside the volcano Monday, Caracol reported. Officials also plan to install a microphone on Huila to detect any new rumblings from inside the volcano, Caracol said.
