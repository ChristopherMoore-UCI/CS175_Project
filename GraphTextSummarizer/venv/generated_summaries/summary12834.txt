For some of us, that's sampling a dish we'd never try at home -- whether fish cheeks in China or Tuscan cinghiale (wild boar) at the always-lively Il Latini ristorante in Florence. Even though Americans earn less vacation time than most other industrialized countries -- a median 12 days, according to a recent Expedia Vacation Deprivation study -- they still tend to forgo two days. Why not consciously decide that while you're away from home, you'll do something that's a bit out of character? These days, it's easy to pre-arrange for a set amount of cash -- even if it's just $15 or $20 -- to be deducted from your paycheck or bank account. Vow not to leave vacation days on the table.
