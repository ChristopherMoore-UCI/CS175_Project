But there is another women's issue, domestic violence, that touches many women and men, some of whom are professional football players. Does anyone doubt that the NFL's support of breast cancer awareness is mainly a strategy designed to give the impression that the NFL cares about women, and generate more female football fans? Even in very recent NFL history, again and again other star players have been implicated in violence in their personal lives, including Vikings running back Adrian Peterson; San Francisco 49ers' defensive end Ray McDonald, who was arrested last weekend on felony domestic violence charges; and Denver Broncos' wide receiver Rod Smith, to name only a few. For the NFL to show it is serious about supporting women, why not lower the shield of denial about domestic violence and put the issue out there before the fans? After all, the most recent high-profile discussions in America about domestic violence have centered on the violent actions of Ray Rice, Baltimore Ravens' running back, who was suspended from play when a video was released showing him punching and knocking out his future wife.
