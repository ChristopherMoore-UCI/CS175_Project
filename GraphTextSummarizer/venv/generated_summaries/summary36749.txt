I can remember spending hours with my high school friends roaming the Harmony House record store in downtown Detroit. We met one night, exchanged numbers and I haven't dialed it since. Now, I am sure on some level I am simply romanticizing life before Steve Jobs. As I was fumbling around looking for something that looked like a power button, it dawned on me: I hadn't manually turned off a television in years. Tell me, how many people with smartphones actually know their boyfriend's or girlfriend's telephone number and can dial it from memory?
