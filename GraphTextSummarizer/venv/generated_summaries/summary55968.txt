Canadian consular officials will remain in contact with local authorities and are prepared to provide consular assistance as needed," Chris Plunkett, spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington, said in a statement. Snider is expected to make an initial court appearance Tuesday in Miami, the FBI said. -- A 24-year-old Canadian man will probably face federal charges after allegedly rushing to the front of an American Airlines aircraft after it landed in Miami on Friday, the FBI said. Two passengers on Flight 320 from Montego Bay, Jamaica, helped subdue the man, identified by the FBI as Ryan Snider. American Airlines spokesman Ed Martelle said the man appeared to be disoriented.
