Dive Bar: Sacramento, California Guests of the upscale Dive Bar are treated to performances by mermaids and mermen mingling with fish inside a 7,500-gallon tank. Mythical mermaids have fascinated humans for centuries, and alluring creatures in bikini tops and fish tails seem to be keeping the love alive. One of the first mermaid shows in the United States can be traced back to Weeki Wachee Springs in Florida, where mermaids debuted synchronized ballet moves at an 18-seat theater in October 1947. Here are five spots where mermaids are making a big splash: The Sip 'n Dip Lounge: Great Falls, Montana The mermaid attraction at the Sip 'n Dip Lounge in Great Falls, Montana, started when a housekeeper at the adjoining O'Haire Motor Inn agreed to put on a costume and swim around for guests on New Year's Eve 1995. Wreck Bar: Fort Lauderdale, Florida The landmark Wreck Bar at the Sheraton Fort Lauderdale Hotel draws guests with its shipwreck theme and underwater mermaid show.
