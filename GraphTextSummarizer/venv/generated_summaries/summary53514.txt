A lot of American students who come to Florence -- and there are lots and lots of students in the center, most of whom are American -- are a lot less dressy than the Italians, and the Italians can spot them a mile away. Florence is one of those places that is not too big, but it's still a city, so wherever you go you meet different people, it's not that everyone knows everything about you. Obviously there are lots of shops in the city, but there are also lots of markets, and many people shop at them. Well, in the city center any night you can find people going out. -- Tanya Gray, 28, works at a preschool in Florence, where she has lived for the last two years.
