In fact, it has done just that: granting citizenship at birth to residents of other Territories. No federal court has ever recognized birthright citizenship as a guarantee in unincorporated Territories. As with many things, when it comes to citizenship, little is guaranteed to residents of the Territories. When it comes to citizenship in the Territories, Congress can giveth or it can choose not to giveth, and the Constitution gives those residents no recourse. The theory: If the practice of acquiring Territories required endowing the inhabitants with citizenship of the United States, this would be too great an inconvenience to the government.
