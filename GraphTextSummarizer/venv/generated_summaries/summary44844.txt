The two-time Olympic gold medalist even referenced Denver on Facebook when appearing at a World Cup event in Colorado in 2012, saying many of his songs were translated into Slovenian and remained popular standards in her country. With such a strong team ethic in the U.S. ranks it may be a safe bet to assume the sound of the Star-Spangled Banner will be ringing around Beaver Creek to delight home followers. With the precocious Shiffrin starting the 2014-15 season with a fine World Cup win in giant slalom in Austria and Vonn on the comeback trail after knee surgery, the trio will, in the words of the John Denver song, be aiming for a "Rocky Mountain High" at Beaver Creek. Their ultimate focus is the world championships on the home snow of Colorado next February and the training has been intense -- but away from the piste the U.S. team room is more than often than not reverberating to the sound of music. But as U.S. team member Stacey Cook told CNN all the intense rivalry can be put aside by making music together.
