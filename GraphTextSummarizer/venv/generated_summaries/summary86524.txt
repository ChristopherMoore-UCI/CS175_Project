The pair ended up losing in a lopsided vote for incumbent Richard Nixon, with the McGovern ticket earning only 17 electoral votes -- from Massachusetts and the District of Columbia -- to Nixon's 520. McGovern, 90, is best known for his unsuccessful 1972 campaign for president as the Democratic nominee against incumbent Republican Richard Nixon. "The family of Sen. McGovern wishes to extend their gratitude and appreciation for the many prayers and well wishes and requests complete privacy at this time," said Lindsey Meyers, spokeswoman for Avera McKennan Hospital and University Health Center. Eagleton withdrew and McGovern then tapped Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy and U.S. ambassador to France. -- Former presidential nominee and Sen. George McGovern has been admitted to a hospice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a spokeswoman for the facility said Monday.
