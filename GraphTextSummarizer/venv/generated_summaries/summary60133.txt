" Egyptians head to the polls beginning Wednesday for historic elections -- the first democratic vote since President Hosni Mubarak was forced from power early last year. -- Hamdeen Sabahy, a leftist dark-horse candidate for Egypt's presidency, is a passionate proponent for the teeming nation's poor and an ideological devotee of the late firebrand nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. Sabahy identifies greatly with the revered Nasser, an Arab world hero whose nationalist and populist rhetoric reverberated on the impoverished streets of Cairo and other towns in the 1950s and 1960s. Aswat Masriya, a news outlet, quotes Amr Helmy, former minister of health, as saying "Sabahy has been a true revolutionary since his college years, he also has a detailed program that has room for all types of Egyptians." Abdel Haleem Kandil, a prominent columnist, said he decided to cast a ballot for Sabahy after hearing him talk "about peasants and workers with details that shows he has a direct relation with them, something that no other candidate has." CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report His stirring message of economic justice, accompanied on the campaign trail by Nasserite nationalist tunes, has been well-received by citizens across society -- organized labor, youth and rights groups, academics and public figures.
