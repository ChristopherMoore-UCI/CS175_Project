Women comprise two-thirds of American family breadwinners and co-breadwinners. This legislation would grant workers up to seven job-protected paid sick days each year, to use not just when they are ill, but for helping sick family members and preventive care. Inequality in pay means families have less money for quality child care, less education, fewer doctor visits and more scrambling to make ends meet, year in and year out. Family responsibilities burden all workers, men as well as women, regardless of pay. Here is what the candidates can do: First, fight for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would expand 1963's Equal Pay Act and make it easier for women to compare their pay with that of fellow workers.
