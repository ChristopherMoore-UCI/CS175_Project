New York detectives and U.S. marshals apprehended the two men Friday morning at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, apartment according to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. Breland is on parole for a felony assault in upstate New York, according to police. An eyewitness said Breland opened fire after Wright handed him a gun, according to Kelly, who did not cite a possible motive. The father, Anthony Hennis, 21, was pushing Antiq Hennis in his stroller near their home on Sunday evening. Both men have some kind of relationship with the young boy's father, who has declined to be interviewed, according to Kelly.
