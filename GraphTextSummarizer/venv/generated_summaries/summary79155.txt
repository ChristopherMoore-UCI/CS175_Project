Girls were afraid that attending the Malala Yousafzai Post Graduate College for Women in the Taliban-dominated Swat Valley would attract the attention of fighters like the ones who gunned down Malala and two other girls on a school bus in October, according to Kamran Rehman Khan, a top official in the Swat Valley. Taliban gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them which one was Malala. Malala first got an international platform at age 11 when the BBC gave her a chance to write a blog about going to school despite a Taliban edict forbidding girls in the classroom. She wants the school to remove her name, but she wishes for people to continue to fight for girls to go to school, he said. Several students told Khan that they respect Malala but are concerned about their safety, he said.
