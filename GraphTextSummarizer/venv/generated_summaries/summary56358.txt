On Sunday, the yacht club identified three of the missing sailors as Alexis Busch of Larkspur, California; Alan Cahill of Tiburon, California, and Jordan Fromm of Kentfield, California. Coast Guard and Air National Guard crews spent two days searching for the four before announcing the suspension Sunday night. It said that Marc Kasanin, 46, of Belvedere, California, had died. The vessel's skipper reported that the yacht was hit by a series of large waves that rolled it over, tossing several crew members overboard and running it aground, the Coast Guard said Sunday. The search effort included three helicopters, a C-130 transport and four Coast Guard vessels, including the cutters Aspen, Pike and Sockeye.
