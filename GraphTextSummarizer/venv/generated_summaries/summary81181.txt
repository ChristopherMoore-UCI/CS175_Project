Petra Kvitova stunned Maria Sharapova in straight sets 6-3 6-4 to claim the  Wimbledon women's singles title Saturday. Eighth seed Kvitova, beaten in the semifinals by eventual winner Serena Williams last year, responded with two breaks of Sharapova's service to take the first set in 40 minutes. " Russia's Sharapova was bidding to repeat her success as 17-year-old in 2004, but despite breaking Kvitova in her very first service game was largely second-best against an opponent hitting with pace and accuracy. But in contrast, it was a bitter disappointment for Sharapova, who has battled back to the top of the game after serious shoulder surgery. The 21-year-old had gone into the final as the underdog against three-time grand slam champion Sharapova, but belied that status with a high-class display on Centre Court.
