On "Cameras," beatmaking prodigy Lex Luger provides diamond-bright high-hat clicks, low-end vroom and soulful background vocals as Drake struggles to convince his girl he's not cheating on her after she sees him in a magazine with another woman; on "Lord Knows," Just Blaze laces a shake-the-sky mix of gospel choir, gauzy R&B sample and stomping beat, and Rick Ross swoops in for a hilarious freestyle: "Villa on the water with the wonderful views/Only fat ni**a in the sauna with Jews." The music is grandiose, full of big names and weighty references -- from the drunk-dial epic "Marvin's Room" to the N'awlins hip-hop tribute "Practice" to cameos from AndrÃ© 3000, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne and Stevie Wonder. A Track-by-Track Breakdown Mostly, Drake stretches out over languid, austerely plush tracks that blur hip-hop, R&B and downtempo dance music. "Over My Dead Body" opens the album with a dreamweave of cascading pianos and plaintive backing vocals from Canadian singer Chantal Kreviazuk: "I was drinking at the Palms last night/And ended up losing everything that I came with," he raps in his finest just-woke-up voice. Hip-hop has never produced anything quite like Drake -- a guy with a Jay-Z ego and a Charlie Brown soul.
