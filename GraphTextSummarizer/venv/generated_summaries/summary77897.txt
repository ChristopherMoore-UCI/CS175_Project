Boston Police officials are not publicly revealing details of the death of Officer Pat Rogers, who appeared in several episodes of the first season of the unscripted series about the pressures of police work. In a statement, TNT said: "We stand with the men and women of the Boston Police Department, and send heartfelt condolences to family, friends and fellow officers. The show, which is produced by Boston native Donnie Wahlberg, begins its second season on TNT next week. A Boston police source who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media said the preliminary investigation suggested it was a suicide. Rogers was a "really nice, well-liked guy" who served the people of Boston well, the source said.
