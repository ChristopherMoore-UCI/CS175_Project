It is unclear whether Hama residents will turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Friday after Muslim prayers. -- Security forces have begun removing tanks from the volatile Syrian city of Hama, a sign that the tensions there could be easing. "The army is present at the city's entrances to facilitate the entry of government employees who live in the Hama countryside and work in government offices in the city; some people in Hama prevented them from entering the city by cutting off roads." Hama has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations, including a huge anti-government demonstration on Friday. "The Syrian army did not enter and will not enter Hama," a Syrian government official told CNN Wednesday.
