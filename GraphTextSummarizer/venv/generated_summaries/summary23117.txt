A handful of times in the decades since television was introduced to the U.S., judges have allowed documentary crews to record jury deliberations for future airing. So we shouldn't rule out the possibility that at some point, in some state, rationalizations will be made and cameras will be placed in jury rooms for a continuing television series. With a big enough jury pool, it would hardly be difficult to find 12 men and women who would welcome the opportunity to deliberate on national television. If television viewers get breathless waiting to see who is voted off an island, think of the anticipation as the decision is made whether to set someone free or send him to prison. On television.
