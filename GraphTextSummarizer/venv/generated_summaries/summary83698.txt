Its shape and feature set will be familiar to anyone who's seen other Pavilion dv6000 series laptops, but the Special Edition HP Pavilion dv6985se stands out for two reasons. Users who want something more portable or more subdued should look to the Sony Vaio NR498, which offers similar performance and features (but lacks multimedia controls) for a slightly lower price. Perhaps to maintain the laptop's polished aesthetic, HP left off the handy port labels found on the keyboard deck of nearly every other Pavilion laptop. (With HP's standard Pavilion battery, the system would weigh closer to 6 pounds--but a smaller battery isn't an option on this fixed configuration.) We do like the Pavilion's dual headphone jacks, which make it easy to share movies and music with friends.
