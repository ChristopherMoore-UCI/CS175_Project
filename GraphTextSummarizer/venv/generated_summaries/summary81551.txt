"We can identify individual dolphins from their battle scars -- which range from small nicks out of the dorsal fin, to major scarring following shark attacks," said Slooten "Estimating population changes in marine mammals is challenging, often requiring many years of research to produce data accurate enough to detect these kinds of biological changes. "This study provides the first empirical evidence that Marine Protected Areas are effective in protecting threatened marine mammals," said Liz Slooten of the University of Otago. Marine Protected Areas (MPA) have long been advocated as a way to protect sea mammals, but the New Zealand project is the first to confirm this. They are one of the rarest species of dolphins, endemic to the waters around New Zealand, with only around 8,000 animals thought to be left in the wild. Findings from a research project conducted over 21 years and published in the "Journal of Applied Ecology" revealed that a marine sanctuary off the coast of Christchurch, New Zealand has significantly improved the survival of Hector's dolphins .
