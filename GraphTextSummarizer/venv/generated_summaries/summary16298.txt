-- A handwriting expert testifying for the defense said Wednesday that former Kansas police officer Brett Seacat did not forge a suicide note for his wife, Vashti, whose body was found inside the couple's burning home in 2011. Brett Seacat is on trial for first-degree murder in Vashti Seacat's death. Prosecutors say Seacat shot his wife and set fire to their home. Seacat has said he was sleeping downstairs on the night of the fire, CNN affiliate KWCH reported. One of Brett Seacat's co-workers testified earlier in the trial that Seacat had asked for an overhead projector the day before his wife's death.
