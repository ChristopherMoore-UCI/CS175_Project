Setting a goal to cut national suicide rates by 10 percent by 2020, the organization said suicide was a major but preventable health problem that health authorities had failed to adequately address due to a number of complicated factors.

The report found suicide rates were highest globally among those aged 70 years and over, but highest among the young in some countries -- and was the second leading cause of death for 15-29 year-olds globally. The research found that suicide killed more people each year than conflicts and natural catastrophes, accounting for more than half of the world's 1.5 million violent deaths annually, World Health Organization staff told reporters at its presentation in Geneva.
