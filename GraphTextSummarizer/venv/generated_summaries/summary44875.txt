"The Villages active life style continues to draw people from all over the county," Gary Lester, vice president for community relations at The Villages, told CNN. While many of the communities in the Top 10 list released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Thursday were in the oil- and gas-rich Great Plains region, the fastest-growing community was a retirement development near Ocala, Florida. He points to its theaters, hotels, golf courses and nightly entertainment as big draws for new residents. The Villages in central Florida has more than 101,000 residents. Homes range from just over $100,000 to more than $1 million, and the average age at purchase is 62, Lester said.
