Serena Williams is in the field for the WTA Championships in Istanbul next week, her first tournament since winning the U.S. Open title last month. Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro secured the Austrian Open title and kept up his bid to make the ATP Tour Finals with a 7-5 6-3 defeat of qualifier Grega Zemlja in the final. Dane Wozniacki was claiming her 20th career title but her first Premier Level event in 14 months which have seen her slip down the rankings. "It really makes me look forward to next year as well." Del Potro has been out for a month with a wrist injury but the victory left him seventh in the points race with the top eight qualifying for London next month.
