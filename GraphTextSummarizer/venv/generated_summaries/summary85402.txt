Traficant was a Democrat who represented Ohio's 17th Congressional District from 1985 to 2002. -- James Traficant Jr., who railed against government agencies while serving as a wild-haired, maverick congressman from Ohio, died Saturday after being critically injured in a tractor accident on his farm. Months after his release from prison, Traficant filed for office as an independent but lost his bid to regain his old seat to sitting Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat. A former football player at the University of Pittsburgh, Traficant went on to play the role of hometown hero after graduation, serving as a drug counselor and Mahoning County, Ohio, sheriff. Traficant fashioned himself as a maverick populist, spending much of his career railing against foreign aid and various government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the CIA.
