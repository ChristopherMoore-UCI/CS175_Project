The star of "Fury" said that he and co-star Shia LaBeouf nearly got into it with fellow actor Scott Eastwood -- Clint's son -- on the set of their new war movie. " "We were driving down the road, I'm in the turret, Shia is at the other turret, and Scott is on the back, spitting juice," Pitt told British GQ, Us magazine reported. " Pitt said he got along well with LaBeouf, who's been in the news recently for his eccentric behavior, including an incident at a Broadway show that led to his arrest and a trip to rehab. "Oh, I love this boy," Pitt said of LaBeouf. Tempers finally cooled and later Pitt realized something: Eastwood's action was actually in the script.
