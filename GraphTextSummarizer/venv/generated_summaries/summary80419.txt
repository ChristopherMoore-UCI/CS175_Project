-- Asafa Powell, the last man to hold the 100m world record prior to his compatriot Usain Bolt, admitted to a Jamaican disciplinary hearing on Tuesday that he had a hazy knowledge of the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned products The 31-year-old was testifying to the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) after testing positive for the prohibited stimulant oxilofrone during last June's national championships. A total of five Jamaican athletes failed drugs tests at the national championships in June, prompting the entire JADCO board to resign five months later -- with criticism over a lack of testing by the body's former executive director Renee Anne Shirley ringing in their ears. " Powell says he was advised to take the supplements after Xuereb, who the sprinter described as a good friend, told him he should be using them ahead of his early morning training. The oxilofrone is said to have come from a supplement called Epiphany D1, which Powell said he had been taking on the recommendation of his physical therapist Christopher Xuereb. Powell also told the hearing that he doubled the dosage of his supplements on the morning of his positive drugs test, saying he had been told by Xuereb to take two capsules of Epiphany D1 each morning for seven days before doubling the dosage the following week.
