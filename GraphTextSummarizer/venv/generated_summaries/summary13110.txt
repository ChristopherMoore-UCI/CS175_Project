Farmers keep some pupae from each generation, so they rarely need to catch more female butterflies from the wild, although they sometimes catch new male butterflies to maintain genetic diversity in their farms. "Because butterfly farmers get tangible benefits, they get money, people involved in butterfly farming conserve the area," says Saidi. He says the project's own studies show that because butterfly farmers rely on forests near their communities to provide host plants for their butterfly farms, many farmers now support forest conservation. The Zanzibar Butterfly Centre consists of a netted tropical garden that's home to hundreds of butterflies, all bred by local farmers. -- Farmers in Tanzania are helping to conserve threatened forests by cultivating an unlikely crop: butterflies.
