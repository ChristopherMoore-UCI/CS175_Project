Another opinion: Why the Cowboys still rule in Texas But 250 miles south of Dallas, the Houston Texans will take on the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC wild card game. All the Cowboys fans will be packing is a bunch of Haterade for the new King of Football in Texas: the Houston Texans. The expansion Texans is the talk of the state, and all the Cowboys fans can do is complain about Tony Romo and Jerry Jones. For decades, all of the talk has been about the Cowboys, that damn star, and lately, the monstrosity of a football palace built by owner Jerry Jones. We are about to see a tremendous run by the Texans, and when it comes to pro football in the state, no one will be talking about the bumbling Cowboys.
