Only one person was immediately confirmed as having suffered injuries, Lion Air spokesman Edward Sirait said at a news conference in Jakarta following the incident. The plane had flown earlier in the day from Palu, Central Sulawesi, to Banjarmasin, Kalimantan; it then proceeded to Bandung and then Bali, Sirait said. -- A Lion Air flight carrying about 100 people ended up in the Indian Ocean while attempting to land at Bali International Airport on Saturday, officials said. Lion Air crew can fly a maximum of eight hours per day, he said. The plane, a Boeing 737-800, has only been in use by Lion Air since March, Sirait said.
