It is the nightmare prospect for any jockey, his family and friends too, in a sport whose protagonists are constantly followed by an ambulance -- a regular reminder of the all-too-real threat of severe injury, potential paralysis and, in extreme cases, death. His road to recovery was hugely helped by a lengthy stay at Oaksey House, the purpose-built rehabilitation center opened in the southern English county of Berkshire and named after IJF founder Lord Oaksey. Not only does the IJF provide instant logistical support and limitless rehabilitative work at a state-of-the-art building, its host of initiatives also include the provision of mortgages for those whose incomes have been decimated by injury. Leaving all medical care to professional doctors, the IJF initially concentrates on arranging the logistical needs that can overload friends and family -- dispatching one of its so-called "almoners" to assess all the varying requirements. "Basically, we are a charity to support beneficiaries in a financial, medical and emotional way," Lisa Hancock, the CEO of the IJF, told CNN.
