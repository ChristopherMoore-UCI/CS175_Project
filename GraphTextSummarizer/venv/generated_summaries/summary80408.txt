"It is highly likely a large proportion of these drugs would have found their way onto the streets of Europe and the U.K.," said Neil Giles, deputy director for the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA), Britain's version of the FBI. "It has long been feared that cocaine traffickers might seek to exploit Gambia and other countries in the region as warehousing locations for drugs en route from South America to Europe," Giles said. Africa's Gold Coast is sometimes referred to now as the "Coke Coast." The bust -- the largest ever single seizure of cocaine in West Africa -- occurred last Friday in the capital of Banjul, according to SOCA. Criminals traffic about 250 tons of drugs to Europe each year, though not all of it makes it there, according to the United Nations.
