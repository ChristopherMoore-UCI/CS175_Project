-- Nine mine employees were hurt Monday when Anglo American Platinum security guards shot rubber bullets to break up a confrontation between rival union groups at a mine in northwest South Africa Anglo American Platinum Limited, a member of the Anglo American plc Group, describes itself as the world's leading primary producer of platinum group metals, accounting for 40% of the world's newly mined platinum. Last fall, several major South African mining companies, including Anglo American, were involved in labor disputes with their miners that erupted in violence. In October, police repeatedly clashed with protesters near one of Anglo American's mines, and the company fired about 12,000 striking workers who refused to attend disciplinary hearings. Its mining, smelting and refining operations are based in South Africa.
