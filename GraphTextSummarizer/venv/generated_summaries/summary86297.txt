Watch Holder talk about the pardon of Mark Rich Â» One of the lessons of the Rich case, Holder said, was the need for "full consultation with all lawyers in the pardon process." Holder said he "made assumptions that turned out not to be true" during the Rich pardon process, which became the "most intense" and "searing" experience he "ever had as a lawyer." Holder's willingness as deputy attorney general to go along with the pardon over the objections of Justice Department career prosecutors has continued to haunt Holder. Holder said there was a need to improve the pardon process, which seems to experience a "deterioration... at the end of every administration." Holder, in response to a question from Sen. Arlen Specter, said he did not recommend that former Clinton White House counsel Jack Quinn, who served as Rich's lawyer during the pardon process, circumvent the Justice Department and go "straight to the White House" with the pardon application. He continued that Holder had the character to serve as attorney general while restoring morale at what Leahy termed a "demoralized" Justice Department. Holder noted that there were "a lot of people in support of that clemency request," including former President Jimmy Carter and civil rights leader Coretta Scott King.
