" For her coach Levine, seeing Chin win was a special moment -- maybe even one of the best moments of his life. The country star had picked "The Voice's" top talent for three seasons in a row, but on Tuesday it was Adam Levine who beamed with pride as his finalist, Tessanne Chin, sealed the win. The 28-year-old songstress from Kingston, Jamaica, triumphed over third-place finalist Will Champlin and runner-up Jacquie Lee, with her performance of Whitney Houston's "I Have Nothing" on Monday night's show being the icing on a season of top-notch performances. On Tuesday night, "The Voice" simultaneously found its Season 5 champion and ended coach Blake Shelton's winning streak. After her big win, Chin was left in "just complete and utter shock," she told CNN.
