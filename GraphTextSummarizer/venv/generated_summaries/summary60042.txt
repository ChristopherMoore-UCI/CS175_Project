And for those who can't wait, an exhibition entitled "Van Gogh Up Close" opens at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in February, while the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is currently focusing on Van Gogh's studio practice. Van Gogh lovers will hopefully be able to visit the restored house in 2015. According to Teio Meedendorp, an expert on Van Gogh at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, local people in the Borinage still "have a lot of sympathy for Vincent himself, because he had an eye for their needs and troubles. Its windows are boarded up, the red-painted exterior is peeling and the roof could do with re-tiling -- but this derelict house in a village in the Borinage region of Belgium was once the home of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. The house and surrounding industrial area, in the village of Petit Wasmes, might not look too impressive, but it was here that Van Gogh decided to become an artist.
