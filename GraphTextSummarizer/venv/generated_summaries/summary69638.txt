Republicans facing pressure from conservatives ahead of the November vote were reluctant to back any kind of hike in the borrowing limit, a core issue for the political right because it represents rising federal debt. Without a purely Republican majority, Boehner decided to split up the GOP plan by holding separate votes on repealing the military pension cuts and a clean debt ceiling increase. After Wednesday's Senate votes, Lew said the debt ceiling plan along with a recent budget agreement and spending bill "will provide certainty and stability to businesses and financial markets and should add momentum to the economic growth forecasted in 2014. " At the same time, Boehner declared himself disappointed about what he called a "lost opportunity" to address unsustainable federal spending. " Wednesday's result was a blow to tea party conservatives who oppose any kind of increase in federal borrowing.
