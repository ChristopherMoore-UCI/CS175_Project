Veteran storm chaser Tim Samaras, 54; his chase partner of a decade, Carl Young, 45; and Samaras' son, Paul Samaras, 24, a photographer, died Friday in an EF-3 tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma. Tim Samaras' brother, Jim Samaras, said he was stunned to learn of his brother's death, simply because Tim Samaras was so well-versed in the ways of tornadoes. " Tim Samaras, whose team's work was featured on the Discovery Channel's "Storm Chasers," had been on twisters' trails for more than a quarter-century, and The Weather Channel described him as a self-taught forecaster and engineer who developed much of the equipment he used to measure storms. Tim Samaras also co-authored the book "Tornado Hunter," held a patent for a thermal imaging system for internal combustion engines and had a patent pending for a "new, 3-dimensional windspeed measurement," according to a copy of his resume posted at TWISTEX, a company he founded to learn more about tornadoes with the goal of increasing public warning times. At a meteorological conference, Tim Samaras encouraged Young to gather data from inside tornadoes for his thesis, and a partnership was born.
