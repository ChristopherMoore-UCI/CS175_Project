Without elaborating, Boyer said she thinks her daughter "was manipulated into this situation." Baker, whose home Shannon was found in, was also charged in connection with the incident, Washington County Sheriff Bobby Haddock has said. The maternal grandmother of a 7-month-old Florida girl found hidden in a small cedar box under her baby sitter's bed says her daughter, who was charged in the case, is troubled and needs help. Police think Chrystina Lynn Mercer gave Shannon Lee Dedrick to the sitter -- who is the baby's paternal aunt, Susan Baker -- and 10 hours later reported the girl missing. The baby is in protective custody with the state and is in good health despite her ordeal, according to Boyer, who says she drove nearly 900 miles in 14 hours from Texas to Florida when Shannon disappeared. "As confused as Tina is, I have to tell you, she has emphatically stated that she did not and would not ever harm her child," Mercer's mother, Kandis Boyer, said Thursday on HLN's "Nancy Grace."
