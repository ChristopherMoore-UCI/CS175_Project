-- The House of Representatives side of the U.S. Capitol is closed Thursday because of a construction-related incident, officials said. Laura Condeluci, spokeswoman for the Architect of the Capitol, said there was a "potential release" during "asbestos abatement work" on the House of Representatives side. "Samples have been collected to determine whether there was potential exposure," Condeluci said. Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said the incident is confined and not suspicious. Hazardous materials crews were on the scene.
