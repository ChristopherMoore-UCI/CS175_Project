About 150 personnel, including 80 U.S. Marines, were evacuated early Saturday and were driven across the border into Tunisia, U.S. officials confirm to CNN. The decision to use vehicles to drive the Americans across the border was seen as the best low-profile approach to conducting the evacuation rather than sending U.S. military helicopters and troops into Tripoli. A senior State Department official said some of the staff will be sent to other U.S. embassies in the region and others will return to Washington. The Pentagon had pressed for weeks to evacuate the embassy, especially after the Tripoli airport came under repeated militia attack, leaving Americans no way to get out via commercial air, the official said. U.S. officials stress operations have been "temporarily suspended" until "the security situation on the ground improves."
