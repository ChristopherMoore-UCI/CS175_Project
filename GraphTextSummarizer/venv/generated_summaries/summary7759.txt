First responders treated two people with injuries that were not life-threatening and then took them to nearby Tufts Medical Center. The collapse occurred on the 12th floor of what's slated to be a 33-story residential high-rise, causing damage from the 11th floor's roof down to the fifth floor. According to a sign posted outside the site, near the city's Chinatown district and around the corner from Boston Common, the building was slated to be completed in the middle of next year. -- A building under construction in downtown Boston partially collapsed Thursday morning, sending two people to the hospital, the city's fire department said. The fire department later explained that one of those had "a serious head injury," while the other had a minor injury.
