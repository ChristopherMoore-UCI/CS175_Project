In the other Group E clash, AS Roma scored their first win of the Champions League campaign with a 2-1 win over Romanian side CFR Cluj at the Stadio Olimpico. Alexander Frei put the home side ahead after 18 minutes with a fine strike before World Cup star Bastian Schweinsteiger netted a second-half penalty to level and then scored the winner from close range in the 89th minute. -- Bayern Munich came from a goal down to forge a 2-1 victory over Basel in Switzerland on Tuesday in their Champions League Group E clash. Last season's runners-up were beaten by Mainz at the weekend in a setback to their Bundesliga title defense, but showed their mettle in Switzerland to secure a second successive win in the Champions League. The win left Chelsea on top of Group F after two wins in their latest attempt to bring Europe's top prize to club owner Roman Abramovich.
