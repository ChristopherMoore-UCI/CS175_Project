Kerry was subpoenaed by Oversight panel Chairman Darrell Issa of California after new emails surfaced that Republicans say support their contention the Obama administration politicized its public response to the September 2012 assault. It's not clear whether the recent formation of a House Select Committee to investigate Benghazi will impact the Oversight probe. The attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in eastern Libya killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. According to the letter to Issa that was copied to top members of the Select Committee as well, the State Department said Kerry could not accommodate the Oversight panel's demand that he appear on May 29 due to scheduling conflicts. The Republican-led Select Committee is still organizing and hasn't scheduled any hearings.
