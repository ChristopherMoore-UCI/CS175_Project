Finley Boyle, a 3-year-old Hawaii girl who suffered massive brain damage after undergoing a dental procedure last month, died Friday night, a hospice said Saturday. The girl died with her family by her side, said Kenneth L. Zeri, president and chief professional officer of Hospice Hawaii. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Hawaii's First Circuit Court, alleges that Geyer had no plan in place to respond to medical emergencies, such as the one Finley suffered. " Finley's parents are suing a Kailua, Hawaii, dentist, alleging negligence and dangerous conduct. Finley was moved from a hospital to the hospice in late December.
