Those words sound like science fiction, but NASA and a company called Flexsys are developing wings that change shape in response to flight conditions and weather. "Now we have wings that are made heavier to withstand gusts, but with this technology, they may not have to design heavy wings like that anymore," said Rigney. NASA shows off new flight technology This week, NASA invited dozens of aerospace bloggers and social media mavens to see new aviation technology at its Armstrong Flight Research Center in California's High Desert, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. Now, thanks to NASA research in the 1960s and '70s, pilots control newer airliners via electronic wire-based systems. You may have been flying with NASA technology for years, and didn't even know it.
