The royals are visiting central London's Baker Street station -- a stone's throw from the home of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary fictional detective Sherlock Holmes at 221B Baker Street. The royals will also meet the head of London Underground and other transport officials. The royals will also meet with representatives of the Railway Children charity, which works to help vulnerable children who live alone and at risk on the streets. -- Queen Elizabeth II is to head below ground Wednesday with Prince Philip and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground. The queen was forced to cancel some visits last week because she was experiencing symptoms of gastroenteritis.
