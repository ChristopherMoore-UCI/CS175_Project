A run of four birdies in the last six holes saw him card a final round 68 for 12-under, one shot clear of compatriot Branden Grace and two ahead of Dutchman Joost Luiten and third round leader Tommy Fleetwood of England. The South African won the 2010 British Open at St Andrews and lost a playoff to Bubba Watson at the 2012 U.S. Masters but injuries ruined his challenge in the majors last season. Oosthuizen is hoping he can take a well-deserved break and go into the first major of the season in Augusta in good shape. "I've got three weeks now that I really need to work on my back," Oosthuizen told the official European Tour website. Luckily this week I didn't have to hit a lot of drivers, but once I get to Augusta I need to hit driver," he added.
