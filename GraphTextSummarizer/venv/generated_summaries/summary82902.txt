"What really particularly attracted me to 'Half of a Yellow Sun' was that ... there were these characters -- middle, upper-middle-class characters, educated characters, Nigerian characters -- who I suppose had been seen in quite a few novels set in Africa, written by Africans, but they had never been seen in any movie set in Africa," says Bandele. "I was really fed up of going to the cinema and watching a movie about Africa and all you saw were them as victims without any say over their own destiny," explains Bandele. Upon completion of his debut film, Bandele was approached by MTV's Staying Alive Foundation to direct "Shuga," a popular TV series aimed at educating viewers on HIV/AIDS. " For Bandele, this is what it all comes down to -- telling stories that matter whether it is on stage or screen. " Some three decades later and Bandele has become a celebrated novelist and playwright who most recently moved behind the camera to try his hand at directing.
