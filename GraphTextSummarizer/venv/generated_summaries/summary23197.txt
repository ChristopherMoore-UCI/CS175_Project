" "Often, they come and they see there's central London, there's King's Cross, there's Elephant and Castle, there Stratford "We really wanted King's Cross to be a mixed-use project with lots of offices, homes, retail, a proper destination with lots of different characters across the site and very much making the most of the fantastic heritage we have here," said Robert Evans of Argent Developers, the company charged with bringing the project to life. When finished, 2,000 new apartments and 23 new office buildings will stretch across 650,000 square meters (6.9 million square feet) of land to the north of central London. Two new underground stations will connect the area to central London. (They ask) it's central London, why isn't everyone redeveloping this?" "(They are) coming over here with large checkbooks, huge ambitions, and a great deal of skill."
