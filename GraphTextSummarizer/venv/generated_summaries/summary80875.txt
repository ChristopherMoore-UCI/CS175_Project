The U.S. State Department announced this summer that it had received reports that Syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the United States. Thaer al-Nashef, who describes himself as a "political activist against the Syrian regime," said Friday he believed the kidnapping of his pregnant 25-year-old wife, Mona al-Gharib, was the work of Syrian intelligence agents operating in the country. Egyptian police confirmed that al-Nashef filed a police report about his wife's disappearance on Friday. Al-Nashef is a freelance journalist in Egypt and serves as a TV anchor for several networks, including January 25 TV, which was launched after the revolution, which toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The Syrian government has been accused of seeking retribution against relatives of Syrian activists working against the Bashar al-Assad regime from abroad.
