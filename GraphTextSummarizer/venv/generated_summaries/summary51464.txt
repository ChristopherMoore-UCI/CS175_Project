All systems green," SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on Twitter Friday afternoon. The company said the problem appeared to be fixed by Friday afternoon. The Dragon suffered a temporary glitch with its thrusters after it launched into orbit Friday from Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX became the first private company to deliver supplies to the station on NASA's behalf in October. NASA chose SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle and the Dragon spacecraft to resupply the space station in 2008.
