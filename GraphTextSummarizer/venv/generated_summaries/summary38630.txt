The suspected terror cell in Verviers, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van Der Sypt said. Greek authorities say they are cooperating with Belgian authorities on an investigation, and on Sunday Belgium requested the extradition of one of the suspects arrested in Greece. Belgian federal prosecutor Van Der Sypt, however, said the Belgian investigation "gave us enough reason to ask for the extradition of one of the persons that were arrested yesterday by the Greek authorities." The investigation revealed that one of the people arrested in Greece could be involved in the plot that was stopped in Belgium, Van Der Sypt said. As many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people could be ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, a Western intelligence source told CNN.
