Sunday's violence is the deadliest soccer-related violence in Egypt since a 2012 stampede left more than 70 people dead and 1,000 injured at a match in the city of Port Said. Victims from Sunday's clashes were taken a morgue in central Cairo, where family members and friends waited for the bodies. But the Facebook page of the Ultras White Knights, a hardcore Zamalek group, said that members were tear gassed as they tried to go through a single, small-gated entrance that was opened to allow them into the match. The violence took place ahead of a scheduled match between Zamalek and ENPPI. At least 19 people died Sunday when soccer fans clashed with police outside a stadium in Cairo, the health ministry said.
