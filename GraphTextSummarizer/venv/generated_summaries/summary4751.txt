-- Remains discovered in Virginia earlier this week are those of missing police officer Kevin Quick, a Virginia State Police spokeswoman said Saturday. State Police spokeswoman Corrine Geller said three people were arrested Thursday in connection with the case -- 22-year-old Gert Wright, 49-year-old Leslie Hope Casterlow and 31-year-old Anthony Stokes Jr. All three are being held without bond at Henricho County Jail on felony charges of being "a principal in the second degree" to Quick's death and of gang participation. Quick was a reserve captain -- a volunteer officer -- in the small central Virginia city of Waynesboro. On Saturday, police confirmed that a man's body found Thursday was indeed Quick's. A second sister, Shantai Shelton -- who has not yet been charged directly in Quick's case -- was picked up on an outstanding warrant from Louisa County, east of Charlottesville, where Sunday night's armed robbery took place, Geller said earlier this week.
