As Egan's statement suggests, she's not the first to tackle fiction on Twitter and other digital short forms. In 2008, Penguin Books launched the "We Tell Stories" project in which six of its authors used interactive media, including Twitter, to tell new tales. But in a nod to the social media age, The New Yorker is offering up new fiction on Twitter in a series of 140-character bursts. And in 2009, author and noted Twitter-phile Neil Gaiman worked with BBC Audiobooks on an interactive novel built from tweets. "Black Box," a new story by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jennifer Egan, was to begin appearing on the New Yorker Fiction Twitter account Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.
