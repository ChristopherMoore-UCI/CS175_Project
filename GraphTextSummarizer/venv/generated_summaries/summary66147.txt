Occupy Portland protest covered by CNN affiliate KATU -- teensy-weensy swimming pools and way small diving boards -- for the diminutive butterflies, of course. "Whatever the motivation, we are relieved," says Portland Parks & Recreation Director Mike Abbate. A driver noticed the diminutive tree Friday "roots and all, lying on its side just outside the park," Portland Parks & Recreation said. "Remorse does not mean case closed'," says Portland Police Bureau Sergeant Pete Simpson. What's billed as the world's smallest park, tucked inside a concrete circle just 2 feet across, is a quirky Portland kind of place.
