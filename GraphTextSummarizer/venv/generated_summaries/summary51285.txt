The cause of the crash is not clear but is under investigation, said Tim Monville, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. The Polk County Sheriff's Office identified the family as Ronald Bramlage, 45; his wife, Rebecca Bramlage, 43; and their children, Brandon, 15; Boston, 13; Beau, 11; and Roxanne, 8. Ronald and Rebecca Bramlage were both graduates, and Fred Bramlage, Ronald's father, was the lead contributor to the Bramlage Coliseum, a multipurpose arena that is home to the men's and women's basketball teams. Its final destination was Junction City, Kansas. The flight originated at Treasure Cay Airport in the Bahamas and landed at St. Lucie County Airport at 10:15 a.m. Thursday to clear customs.
