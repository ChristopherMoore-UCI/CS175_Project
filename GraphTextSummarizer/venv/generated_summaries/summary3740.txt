On Monday night, brother Dustin Erickson told HLN's Vinnie Politan that for all the talk about Smith, his main focus is on his sister. "We had to look at every aspect of the case before we could come out publicly and state that Mr. Smith is our primary focus," Rooney said at a news conference. Attempts to reach Smith by phone -- at numbers believed to be his and that of his parents -- and social media -- via Facebook e-mail, on a profile believed to be his -- for comment on Monday's developments and the case generally have thus far been unsuccessful.‬‪ ‬‪ He has refused authorities' offer to take a polygraph test in the case, Rooney told reporters. " Police Chief Paul Rooney identified Dale Smith Jr., who relatives say is the father of two of Michelle Parker's children, as the lone suspect in the case. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, said in Monday's news conference that the naming of Smith as a suspect is "huge."
