This decision has been taken with the aim of doing something to shake things up and for the good of this group of people that I feel very close to." Domenicali went on to thank the team, fans and Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo "for having always supported me." " Marco Mattiacci, who is currently President and CEO of Ferrari North America, will replace Domenicali, Di Montezemolo said. Ferrari is the sport's oldest and most successful team with 16 constructors' championships but the Maranello-based manufacturer has struggled in recent seasons and is currently lying fifth after three races of the 2014 with just 33 points and no podium finishes. Despite having former world champions Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso at the wheel, Ferrari have made little impact in the opening three races this year and continue to struggle with the new engine and chassis regulations. Ferrari's quest for a first podium of the season resumes at next Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.
