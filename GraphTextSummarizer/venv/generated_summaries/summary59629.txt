"We didn't want to just go through the dictionary and give them more words," Mary Olive Thompson, outreach coordinator for Kansas City Public Library, said at the time. But soon, Kush and Sophia were more than two young, ace spellers from Kansas City. As Thompson noted, "both students are young enough -- they could face each other again" next year. He beat fifth grader Sophia Hoffman, who went out on the word "stifling," earning a spot in the Scripps National Spelling Bee. The D-E-F-I-N-I-T-I-O-N of a good spelling bee may have forever changed in Missouri.
