After the announcement that Lukashenko had prevailed with 79% of the vote Sunday, according to preliminary election results, opposition candidates and their supporters took to the streets in Minsk, the capital, and clashed with police. -- Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who preliminary results show has easily won election to a fourth term, praised police actions in dispersing post-election demonstrators and castigated the protesters as "vandals and thugs. And, in particular, I now expect the government to account for the arrests of presidential candidates, journalists and human rights activists." "While voting on election day was overall assessed positively, the process deteriorated significantly during the vote count, with observers assessing almost half of vote counts monitored as bad or very bad," the organization said. The Russian news agency Interfax earlier reported that Neklyayev was hurt in clashes with riot police.
