Van Blargan said Yates told Machlinski in a phone call on Mother's Day that Yates had met the suspected shooter, saying he was a "very nice guy" and "could deal with him" but that the man had "some major issues. While she said that "doesn't excuse" the shooter's actions, "I believe that if he would've gotten the help that he was there to get, maybe sooner, or got more help and other people recognized the signs, because there are signs, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure those signs out. Michael E. Yates Jr. was one of five service members shot to death at a stress clinic in Baghdad, Iraq. Van Blargan said Yates -- who was a father himself -- is going to be missed. She and Yates' stepfather, Richard Van Blargan Jr., spoke with reporters Wednesday in Maryland.
