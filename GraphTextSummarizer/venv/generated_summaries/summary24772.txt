" Schneider said Obama's agenda -- which includes massive government spending -- represents a challenge to the Republicans' core principle of smaller government. The National Republican Senatorial Committee last month released an ad accusing Obama of backpedaling on numerous campaign promises, calling him out for signing a spending bill with thousands of earmarks, mishandling the AIG bonus scandal and failing to rein in government spending. Supporters say President Obama is tackling an aggressive agenda, while critics say he's leaving Republicans behind. Now, after 100 days in office, observers are asking the same of him: Has President Obama lived up to the expectations that candidate Obama created? And I think that people are learning to trust Obama that when he talks, he's not just articulate, but he's shooting straight," said presidential historian Doug Brinkley.
