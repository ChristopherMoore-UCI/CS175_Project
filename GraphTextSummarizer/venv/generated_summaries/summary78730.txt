"Every day, our staff suffer aggressive abuse from clients, so they have unfortunately gotten used to aggressive situations," Sablon said. The workers have demanded new security measures to keep staff safe. Guy Sablon, a spokesman for the company that runs the Brussels public transport network, STIB, told CNN there are no buses, trams or trains operating in the city. -- Public transport in the Belgian capital, Brussels, was paralyzed for a fourth day Tuesday after staff walked out to protest the death of a co-worker in an assault. Brussels is home to NATO, the European Commission and European Council, as well as many other international organizations.
