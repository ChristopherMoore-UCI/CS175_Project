OK, maybe it's not that classic, but that's the story between Chris Christie and his fellow New Jersey native Bruce Springsteen. Christie not mad about Springsteen parody One New Jersey resident asked Christie to just give it up and destroy his Springsteen CDs. "Democrats and Republicans may have very different views of the governor's job performance, but one area where Christie has fostered unabashed bipartisan support is his idolization of Bruce Springsteen," said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a release about the poll. A new poll indicates that nearly half (48%) of New Jersey residents think it's "kind of cool" that their governor is a superfan of The Boss. While Springsteen and Christie have met a couple of times and Springsteen praised Christie for his leadership after Superstorm Sandy, Springsteen has done little else to show high regard for the governor.
