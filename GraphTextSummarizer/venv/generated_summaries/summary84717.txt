Tony then heads to Franklin County to learn more about the heroin epidemic that is gripping the area, not unlike multiple rural New England communities. Bourdain spends a day at sea with Scott and Beau, who are fourth generation fisherman -- scallopers, to be exact. Scott and Beau explain how the industry is changing, making it increasingly difficult for independent fishermen to continue the traditions their families have held sacred for generations. Tony also makes a stop at the second-oldest bowling alley in America for some candlepin bowling, going head-to-head with the Holy Rollers, a team of septuagenarians. On a lighter note, Tony also visits People's Pint, an eco-conscious local brewery and gastropub that relies totally on food and resources within a 20 mile-radius and composts nearly all of its refuse.
