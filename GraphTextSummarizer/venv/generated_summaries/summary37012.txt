Robin Thicke and the team at VH1 learned that lesson the hard way Tuesday when the hashtag #AskThicke, created for a Twitter Q&A session with the singer, backfired in a big way. "Do you think Tim Howard can save your marriage?" tweeted @PlaidAndDots, referring to the goalie for the U.S. team at the World Cup. "Y'all knew that #AskThicke was going 2 be a disaster. "Any general tips for women trying to avoid men like you?" "Robin could use a good #AskThicke in," tweeted @Doolies67. Users flooded the micro blogging site with biting criticisms of Thicke, his music, and his treatment of women, particularly his wife. The Q&A went forward, despite the backlash, with Thicke seeming to address the controversy at one point.
