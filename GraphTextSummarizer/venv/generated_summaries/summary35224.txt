For many girls in Afghanistan, the simple act of walking to school can be a life-threatening journey. So the secret of getting and keeping girls in school is to get more female teachers. Amid the violence, however, there is promise: In a country where just 6% of women 25 and older have received any formal education, millions of girls are at long last enrolling in school. "The overall education of girls in Afghanistan is a great success story," said Christine Roehrs, spokeswoman for Save the Children in Afghanistan. The legal age for marriage is 16 in Afghanistan, but there have been many reports about girls being forced to marry well before that.
