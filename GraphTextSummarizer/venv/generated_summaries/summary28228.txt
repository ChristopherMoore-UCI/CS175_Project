One of the most influential singer-songwriters of the late 20th century, Mitchell, 71, mentioned her crossover experiences in New York magazine interview about wresting her legacy from the biographers who don't understand her, the recording industry that's tried to limit her and the sexist movie stars and singers who have decried her fashion sense. "When I see black men sitting, I have a tendency to go -- like I nod like I'm a brother," she told New York magazine. The Canadian wisp of a singer feels she shares an affinity with black men. Mitchell said that, inspired by someone walking down Hollywood Boulevard, she dressed up -- in blackface -- like the man for a Halloween party. Joni Mitchell thinks she's experienced being a black man.
