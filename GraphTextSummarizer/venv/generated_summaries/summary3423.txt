Western sanctions were implemented after Moscow annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists battled Ukrainian government forces in the nation's east. Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugged off repeated questions about the impact of Western sanctions on his nation during a nationally broadcast annual Q&A session.

"We need to encourage our Iranian partners," Putin said, referring to a preliminary deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. On Israeli and Western fears that such a system would embolden Iran, Putin scoffed.
