"I was here that day when Tiger won and then broke down," says Nick Smith, a native of Liverpool and one of many who tailed Woods for the entirety of his round on Thursday. Especially in this part of the world, because Liverpool's love affair with Woods clearly hasn't slowed in the eight years since he last walked the fairways at Hoylake and claimed the 2006 British Open title. And by the time a delicate chip on the 16th tiptoed towards the hole and offered a tap-in for birdie, Woods had made a blitz of five in six holes. -- You can tell when Tiger Woods is stalking a major championship. The bellow that communicated its success underscored the joy those present felt at capturing their own slice of Woods magic firsthand.
