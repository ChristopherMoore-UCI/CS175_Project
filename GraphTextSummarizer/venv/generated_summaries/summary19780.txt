Macau is the world's top spot for the gambling industry, reporting a staggering $45 billion in gambling revenues last year -- nearly seven times the $6.5 billion that casinos in Las Vegas made during the same period. The casino hub has been further hit by a large anti-corruption police investigation last month, which led to a crackdown on an international gambling ring that was operating an illegal $600 million World Cup betting operation out of a hotel in Macau. According to analysts, the sudden dip can be attributed to the month-long football World Cup prompting punters to swap casinos for online sports betting. The former Portuguese colony made $3.4 billion from gambling in June, 3.7% less than in June last year and down 18% month-on-month. -- Macau, the world's biggest casino hub, has overtaken Switzerland in the wealth stakes, being named the world's fourth richest territory by the World Bank.
