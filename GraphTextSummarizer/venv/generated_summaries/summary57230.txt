Brown, 24, allegedly was driving a car that rear-ended another car in Los Angeles in May. The Los Angeles city attorney filed charges of hit-and-run driving and driving without a license, according to spokesman Frank Mateljan. In a court filing in February 2013, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. "Reports that Chris Brown had physical contact with a female patron at the nightclub Heat are totally false and unfounded," Brown's rep told CNN. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is "at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting," District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown is also scheduled to be in a downtown Los Angeles courtroom that afternoon for another hearing to set a date for his trial in his probation violation case.
