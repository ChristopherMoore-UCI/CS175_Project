Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican who represented Maine in the Senate until 2012, said she decided not to run for reelection when she realized she could not invoke change within the system because "partisanship and politics would not diminish." -- When Senators Trent Lott and Tom Daschle ran the Senate, partisan politics was nonexistent and the chamber ran with no hiccups. The Democratic-led Senate imposed controversial rule changes in the middle of the current session. Lott said that when he ran it by the current Senate leaders, Republican Mitch McConnell and Democrat Harry Reid, they were "both moderately not happy." But Tuesday, the two former majority leaders said that partisanship has gotten so extreme that things need to change.
