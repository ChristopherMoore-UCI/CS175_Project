Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff signed the order Thursday instructing Probate Court Investigator Cary Ornelas "to prepare an investigation report addressing the status" of Paris Jackson and "recent media reports concerning her welfare." Beckloff appointed Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, to be sole guardian of Prince, Paris and Blanket soon after the singer's sudden death on June 25, 2009. The children's cousin T.J. Jackson, who was appointed guardian while the family matriarch was missing, was then made a co-guardian. Paris, 15, is in a Los Angeles hospital at least until Saturday for evaluation after an incident early Wednesday in which she cut her wrist and called a suicide counseling hot line. "We're completely supportive of the judge's action," Perry Sanders, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, said Friday.
