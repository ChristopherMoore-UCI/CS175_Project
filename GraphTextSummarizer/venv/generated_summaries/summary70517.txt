The whole point of exploring random articles is to see where the wormhole takes you on the Web, to learn about new things and hopefully not end up watching a Nickelback video on YouTube. According to Wikipedia, Ondracek is a 24-year-old professional ice hockey player from Havirov, Czech Republic. His name was Tomas Bata and, according to the article, he made several discovery trips to the United States, and even toured Ford factories to learn more about the intricacies of mass production. And then you eventually leave the wormhole because your brain has gone far too long without porn or cat videos. By contrast, I played one season of club hockey my freshman year in college, but was 5 feet 9 inches and built like a malnourished fifth-grader.
