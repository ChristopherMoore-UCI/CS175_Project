The nearest active quarterback to Brees and Unitas is Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, whose current streak of touchdown-pass games stands at 37. That's not exactly news, because throwing touchdown passes is what Drew Brees does -- and does and does and does. The league eased its suspension of Saints coach Sean Payton to allow Payton to be in the Superdome to witness the event. The accomplishment breaks the NFL record set by Hall of Famer Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts during a stretch that started in 1956 and ended in 1960, according to the league's official website. According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, over those 48 games, Brees has thrown for 114 touchdowns (compared to Unitas' 102) and connected with 14 different teammates in the end zone.
