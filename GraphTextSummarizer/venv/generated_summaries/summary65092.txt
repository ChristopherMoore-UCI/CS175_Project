In its Tuesday statement about firing Gray, Sky News said the move was made "in response to new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behaviour... relating to an off-air incident that took place in December 2010." The statement did not elaborate on the December incident. Richard Keys, the commentator who resigned Wednesday, had been overheard disparaging assistant referee Sian Massey, saying women don't understand the offsides rule, in conversation with fellow commentator Andy Gray. "It is disappointing that Richard's career at Sky should end in these circumstances," said Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports, in a Wednesday statement. On Wednesday, Keys said in a radio interview with a British radio show that he had called Massey on Sunday to apologize on behalf of himself and Gray.
