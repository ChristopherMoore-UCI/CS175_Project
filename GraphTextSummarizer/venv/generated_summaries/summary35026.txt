Marquez's emphatic victory offered the Mexican some redemption after he failed to win any of the first three fights against Pacquiao. Pacquiao has now lost two fights in a row after his defeat to American Timothy Bradley in June, though he did make a purse of around $25 million for the fourth installment of his battle with Marquez. -- He may have knocked out eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao during their recent bout in Las Vegas but if Juan Manuel Marquez wants a fifth fight against the legendary Filipino he'll need to get permission from his wife. " The fighter was fined last October for wearing political propaganda in support of PRI in his third fight against Pacquiao. Marquez dedicated his victory to his family, coaching staff, and especially to the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto.
