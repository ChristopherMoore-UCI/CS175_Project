The 31 Chinese tourists were traveling in two tour groups: the Xiamen Airlines International Travel Service Co. and the Xiamen Tourism Group International Travel Service Co. Chou Jih-shine, the vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation -- a quasi-governmental agency which covers cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations -- said that the agency had informed its Beijing counterpart. Hours after the crash, TransAsia Airways CEO Chen Xinde extended a "deep apology to the victims and our crew. Thirteen people are confirmed dead and dozens remain missing after the TransAsia Airways ATR-72, carrying 58 people, veered out of control en route from Taipei to Kinmen, off the coast of the Chinese province of Xiamen. Some were also going to Xiamen to assist two Chinese travel agencies, Chen said. " He said 31 of the passengers aboard the flight were Chinese tourists, including three children.
