One of these historic windmills is "De Kat," meaning "The Cat," which uses wind power to create pigments for paint. Piet Kempenaar, the miller at De Kat, has been working with windmills for over 30 years. " Windmills are a passion Kempenaar has had since he started his studies as a miller in 1978, and he'll continue to preserve this art for as long as the wind continues to blow -- and as long as the Zaanse Schans continue to preserve this reminder of the Dutch Golden Age. The Zaanse Schans neighborhood celebrates the past as a working community whose roots can be traced back to the 17th century and it's one of the few places in the world where you can still find functioning traditional windmills. Kempenaar has to pay close attention to the wind because it dictates the day's work.
