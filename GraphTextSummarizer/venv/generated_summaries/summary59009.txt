DeAngelis told Vinnie Politan of CNN's sister network HLN that he gets requests "on a regular basis" from people working on student newspapers, term papers and documentaries who want to talk "about Columbine, school safety, things of that nature." Authorities arrested 18-year-old Dallin Morgan and a 16-year-old boy who, fascinated by the mass 1999 killing at Columbine High School, had interviewed that Colorado school's principal six weeks earlier. " According to police documents, the 16-year-old later told authorities that he did not want to be compared to the Columbine killers because he was smart enough to kill more people. Columbine High Principal Frank DeAngelis sat down for an interview with this Utah teen on December 12, 2011, according to police. The plot was uncovered Wednesday at Roy High School in Roy, according to police.
