"And I do want to express my heartfelt sympathy to the Bizilj family and their friends for this terrible accident." Christopher's father, Charles Bizilj, was present at the time of the shooting and videotaped the entire incident. -- A former police chief was found not guilty Friday of involuntary manslaughter in the 2008 death of an 8-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with a micro Uzi machine gun during a gun show. The two were in charge of the show's shooting range and are accused of having provided the Uzi that killed Christopher Bizilj. During the gun show, 8-year-old Christopher Bizilj was firing the micro Uzi when he accidentally shot himself in the head. And I put my hand against the back of his head," Charles Bizilj told members of the Hampden County jury.
