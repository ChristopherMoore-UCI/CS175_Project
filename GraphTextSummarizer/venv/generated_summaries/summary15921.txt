-- Born a man, Fallon Fox became a woman through surgery and then trained to fight in mixed martial arts. In fact, Hunt said, mixed martial arts guidelines don't require a sex-change surgery, but they do require two years of hormone therapy for transgender fighters. Transgender fighter looking to get licensed Fox subsequently told Florida authorities that she had a California license, and now the Florida boxing commission is also reviewing Fox's license application, the magazine reported. Sports Illustrated writer Loretta Hunt wrote of Fox's 2006 gender reassignment surgery and winning her pro debut in May 2012. "The reaction has been positive," said Fox, 37, who revealed her story recently to Sports Illustrated after a journalist with another publication began to investigate her private surgery.
