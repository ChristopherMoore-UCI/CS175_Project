In a televised address on Thursday, Maduro said he ordered the arrest of Tracy, who he accused of "financing violent groups." Tracy, 35, of Los Angeles, was arrested Wednesday at the Caracas airport as he was preparing to leave the country, Reporters Without Borders said. But Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman, said the accusations are the latest in a series of allegations in recent weeks made by the Venezuelan government that "foreign actors" are attempting to influence political developments in the country. "The U.S. continues to categorically reject any allegations of U.S. government efforts to destabilize the Venezuelan government or to harm anyone in Venezuela." Now he's in the spotlight after being arrested on allegations of funding opponents of newly elected President Nicolas Maduro, successor to the late Hugo Chavez. " The U.S. State Department said Friday it was aware an American was arrested in the Venezuelan capital, but declined to comment on the specifics of the case because of privacy considerations.
