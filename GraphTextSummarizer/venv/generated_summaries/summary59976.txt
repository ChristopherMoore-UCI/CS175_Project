Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin created G.R.L. as the "next generation" of her original group last year. Battle, 25, was an "X Factor" finalist in 2011 and a singer with G.R.L., a girls group created last year to replace the Pussycat Dolls. He found her hanging in in a closet about four hours later, according to Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter. G.R.L. collaborated with Pitbull on the song "Wild Wild Love," which rose to No. 30 on Billboard's Hot 100 this year. G.R.L. performed on ABC's "Good Morning America" last month.
