-- World number one Dinara Safina's wait for her first grand slam title continues, after she was beaten in straight sets by compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final of the French Open at Roland Garros. Kuznetsova held serve to make it 5-2 and then her pressure on the Safina serve paid dividends again with a seventh double fault on match point. Kuznetsova kisses the French Open trophy after her comprehensive victory over Dinara Safina. It was the second straight year she has lost in the final here, after going down in straight sets to Ana Ivanovic of Serbia last year. Despite the result, Kuznetsova said she believed Safina was a worthy world number one.
