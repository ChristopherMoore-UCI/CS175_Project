The National Hurricane Center said a broad area of low pressure over southern Florida is forecast to move slowly northwestward into the Gulf and toward the north-central Gulf Coast this week. The oil spill hasn't just hurt BP's bottom line -- it's inflicted heavy blows on Gulf coast industries like tourism and fishing. A relief well is expected to start the final shutdown within the week, said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man in the region. Allen said the closer of two relief wells alongside the capped, formerly gushing BP well in the Gulf is 17,909 feet deep and less than 100 feet from intercepting the main well. "We are pleased that BP made an initial contribution and has taken an important step toward honoring its commitment to the president and the residents and business owners in the Gulf region," Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli said in a statement confirming BP's $3 billion installment.
