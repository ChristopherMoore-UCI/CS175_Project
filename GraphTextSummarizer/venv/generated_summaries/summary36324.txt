On her own page, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg posted a photo Monday of herself, Detlor and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (who is 28, the same age Detlor was in 1939). She may be nearly four times as old as its founder, but Florence Detlor likes Facebook. As of Tuesday morning, Detlor had 652 Facebook friends. "Honored to meet Florence Detlor, who at 101 years old is the oldest registered Facebook user," Sandberg wrote. By comparison, the number of users from 18-29 who said they use networking sites rose a much more meager 13%.
