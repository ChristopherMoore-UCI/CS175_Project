I read a lot of science fiction, but I also mixed it up with a lot of other genres: crime, literary fiction, as well as nonfiction. British crime novels are very different to American crime novels, which is a natural divergence, obviously, as crime and mystery are usually set in the here and now, and the UK and U.S. are different places, shared language and experience aside. It also just happened to have everything I love about science fiction and fantasy jammed together, but I think that's part of the appeal of "Empire State." Among science fiction and fantasy, there are a genres and sub-genres: hard science, swords and sorcery, cyberpunk, steampunk, apocalyptic stories, time travel and space opera, just to name a few. But there is a universality to story that isn't just limited to science fiction.
