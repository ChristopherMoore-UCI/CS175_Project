Not long after Robert Klein began working on his man cave, his friend Craig Harrell paid Klein a compliment. Klein points out that his bar is nicer, but says he's got his buddy's back: Harrell's wife thinks a dishwasher would be a practical addition to the man cave, but Klein is trying to convince her that the keg refrigerator Harrell wants is a good idea. Somehow, as Harrell was mowing, Klein's new sprinkler system went off, soaking Harrell and his dress. At the party Klein threw to show off his new bar and theater, Harrell was ready. Klein said his friends wanted to talk about two things while he was building his man cave: how his amazing bar was coming along and how they thought Harrell would lose the bet.
