Thirty houses in St. George have already been inundated, according to Neil Roberts, the Queensland police and emergency services minister. The floods have already damaged hundreds of homes in Roma and another town, Mitchell, according to Roberts. -- Australian authorities on Monday pleaded with hundreds of people who had chosen to remain in a town in the path of rising flood waters to vacate their homes. The level of the Balonne River in the town of St. George, in the eastern state of Queensland, swelled to 13.63 meters at lunchtime on Monday, breaking its previous record, and was expected to crest overnight above 14 meters. The authorities had already been using military helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane to airlift thousands of stranded Queensland residents to safety.
