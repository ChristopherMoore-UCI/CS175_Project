The victim's father, Greg King, read a statement in court Monday on behalf of Larry's mother. In September, a judge declared a mistrial in the case of McInerney after a nine-week trial when jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked on whether he should be found guilty of manslaughter or murder in the death of Lawrence King. But last month, McInerney agreed to plead guilty to killing King "under the penal code sections for both murder and voluntary manslaughter," as well as to using a firearm in that crime. Friends said King, an eighth-grader who lived in a group home called Casa Pacifica, was proud of being openly gay. Other students said McInerney was also subject to some harassment because King had a crush on him and made it publicly known.
