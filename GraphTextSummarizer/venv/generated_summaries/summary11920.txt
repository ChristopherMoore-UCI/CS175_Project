The creators of a scandalous sexy calendar for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have revealed a new gift for him at his 59th birthday: a children's coloring book with the main characters Dima (short for Dmitry) and Vova (short for Vladimir), closely resembling President Dmitry Medvedev and Putin, working and playing together. Vova, who got a new school case this year with an All Russia's Children Front emblem on it, spends his days giving wise advice to other kids in a "white building with a flag on the rooftop" -- a "difficult job no one else apart from him is able to do," the captions under the book's pictures read. The calendar was briefly on sale in Moscow supermarkets for 260 rubles (about $8.50) but was pulled from shelves after public outcry over the racy photos and innuendo. The book's publishers, Maksim Perlin and Vladimir Tabak, presented the book Thursday ahead of Putin's birthday on Friday. "So we decided to create a coloring book for kids where the two leaders of the state would be their age."
