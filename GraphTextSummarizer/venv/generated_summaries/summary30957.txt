He was a seeker after first causes and had the mental prowess to plow through massive amounts of information and ideas, simultaneously considering the data, the pragmatics, the theory, and the theory of theory. Aaron went on to make serious contributions to Creative Commons (an organization that releases licenses so authors can let their work be more easily reused), Open Library (a public library of online works), Reddit (an immensely popular open discussion forum), Markdown (a simple way to write Web pages), web.py (making it easier for developers to create Web applications), Jottit.com (type-and-post website) and much more. You may notice a pattern in the projects Aaron worked on: They're about making it easier to share information on the Internet. Yet it would be a mistake to peg Aaron only as a liberator of information for the public good. Access to information and to one another were, to Aaron, tools in the struggle to lessen the world's raw unfairness.
