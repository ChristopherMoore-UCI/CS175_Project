According to a report published in April by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 869 women in that country were victims of honor killings last year. Iqbal, a neighbor of Parveen's family, said he and Parveen were supposed to marry, with the family's approval, last year. Farzana Bari, a human rights activist based in Islamabad, said in many cases people outside the family don't step in to protect the victim "because it's a private matter." Bari said the number of honor killings is probably much higher than studies show because many families don't report the killings, and the killers often avoid prosecution. The United Nations estimates 5,000 women are murdered worldwide by family members each year in "honor killings," so named because the woman's actions are considered to have brought shame on her family. " Most honor killings in the Middle East and Central Asia occur in rural areas.
