-- School bullying is the target of a two-day summit in Washington that kicked off Wednesday morning with Education Secretary Arne Duncan saying bullying undermines learning in schools. "It is an absolute travesty of our educational system when students fear for their safety at school, worry about being bullied, or suffer discrimination, taunts, because of their ethnicity, their religion, sexual orientation, disability, or host of other reasons," said Duncan. One reason is that bullying generally involves a power imbalance, he said.. "The key thing that defines bullying versus teasing is that bullying has ... an impact on the student's ability to achieve and to want to be at school," Jennings said. Just under a third of students ages 12-18 reported that they had been bullied in school in a recent study by the National Center for Education statistics. "Teasing sometimes is unpleasant but (if) it escalates to the point where you actually see students do worse in school or actually avoid areas in school or avoid coming to school, then it goes from teasing to bullying."
