The debate returned several times to the question of whether United States military and intelligence personnel should be allowed to waterboard suspected terrorists, a tactic banned by President Barack Obama shortly after he took office in 2009. Moderators pressed the candidates on a range of topics during the 90-minute debate in South Carolina, including terrorism, Iran's nuclear capabilities, China, the war in Afghanistan, the so-called "Arab Spring" and foreign aid. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized Pakistan in harsh terms and agreed with Perry's proposal to vastly reduce the amount of federal money allocated for foreign governments. The Republican candidates for president outlined their foreign policy and national security visions in a debate Saturday tackling issues that have largely taken a backseat in a presidential race shaped by the troubled economy. But former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a former diplomat who has positioned himself as the only candidate in the race with serious foreign policy experience, disagreed.
