The futuristic-looking "Planet Solar," which is 100 percent powered by sunlight, is the brainchild of Swiss engineer Raphael Domjan, a former paramedic with a passion for innovative design and renewable energies. Batteries on Planet Solar will be able to store enough energy gathered from the sun to allow the boat to sail in poor conditions for three days, said Faigaux.

Wherever the boat goes, Domjan hopes to teach people about alternative ways of consuming energy. Planet Solar will be covered in 470 square meters of solar panels -- the equivalent of two tennis courts.
