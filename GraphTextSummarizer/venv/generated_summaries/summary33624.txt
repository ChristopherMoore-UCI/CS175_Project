Burruss had reportedly told a radio station in August that the couple were on hiatus from their relationship, and the person posting to the Twitter account Burruss refers to as Jewell's identified himself as "Kandi's ex-fiance." Burruss, an award-winning singer-songwriter and former member of the R&B group Xscape, also posted a blog on the site "Hello Beautiful" in which she hailed Jewell for not only being a good father to his children, but also to "other children that he raised and loved like his own, including mine." "So AJ was a father to many," Burruss said in the blog posting. Burruss spoke openly of negative comments about Jewell that appeared on Web sites and in the media. On her Twitter account, Burruss mentioned her surprise that Jewell had apparently set up an account on the networking site the day he died. According to police reports, Jewell was taken to a hospital, where he died of blunt force trauma to the head.
