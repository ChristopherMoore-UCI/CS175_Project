Kent Couch and Fareed Lafta, who had hoped to reach northwest Montana by Sunday, landed late Saturday afternoon southeast of Prineville, Oregon, team officials said. The men were disappointed but not injured, flight spokesman Mark Knowles told CNN. "Unless the wind starts taking them somewhere at this point they won't break distance records," Schliep told CNN before the decision to land. Schliep, who operates an appliance service in Bend, helped Couch construct the rig. Kent is very disappointed they did not get what he set out for." Couch and Lafta, seated side-by-side in a specially built rig, went aloft at Couch's service station in Bend, Oregon.
