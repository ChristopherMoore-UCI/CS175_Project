-- Scores of youths attacked police in Northern Ireland for a second consecutive night Tuesday in an expression of rage over a parade in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast. Outbreaks of violence also ignited in East Belfast, Derry and other parts of Northern Ireland. Monday's violence was centered in Catholic areas of Belfast ahead of the main day of the Protestant marching season, when loyalists parade through the streets. Nationalist youths threw stones, gasoline bombs, golf balls and fireworks at police attending the Orange Order parade -- held on a date often marked by sectarian violence. The Troubles pitted mostly Catholic republicans, who want the province to become part of the Republic of Ireland, against pro-British loyalists, who are mostly Protestant.
