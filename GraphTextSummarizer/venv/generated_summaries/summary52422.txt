English Premier League side Swansea City have sacked manager Michael Laudrup. Club captain Garry Monk replaces Laudrup "for the foreseeable future," Swansea said. Laudrup is the seventh manager to be sacked this season in England's top flight and follows the recent departures of Malky Mackay (Cardiff City), Andre Villas-Boas (Tottenham Hotspur), Steve Clarke (West Bromwich Albion) and Martin Jol (Fulham) who were all dismissed in December. " Laudrup guided Swansea to the League Cup glory and ninth in the Premier League table last year and this season has been far from disastrous with the club lying 12th in the table and into the last 32 of the Europa League. But it's a decision made in the best interests of Swansea City Football Club and our supporters.
