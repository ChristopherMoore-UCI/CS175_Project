Transponders enhance the reflected signal and provide the additional information for air traffic control. A senior Malaysian air force official said Tuesday that the plane traveled hundreds of miles in the opposite direction from its original destination, and had stopped sending identifying transponder codes before it disappeared from radar screens. Air traffic controllers may then request pilots to turn the transponders off or to standby. It is constantly being radar pinged, helping air traffic controllers on the ground determine the airplane's speed and direction, too. " History Transponders have been around since World War II and commonly used in general aviation since the late 1960s, said Fryar.
