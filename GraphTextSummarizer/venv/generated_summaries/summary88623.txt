" The new initiatives announced Wednesday include creation of a national advisory committee on violence against women that will work with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and others to come up with best solutions for reducing domestic violence and helping the victims. -- President Barack Obama got help from baseball great Joe Torre at a White House event Wednesday highlighting new steps the government is taking to reduce domestic violence. Obama noted 25 percent of women in America experience domestic violence at some point in their lives. " "Awareness is probably the biggest deterrent to domestic violence and abuse that goes on," said Torre, who with his wife started the Joe Torre Safe At Home Foundation to raise awareness about domestic violence. He described new initiatives that focus on protecting children, improving legal protection for victims, increasing arrests and successful prosecutions of sexual assault cases and helping victims attain financial independence.
