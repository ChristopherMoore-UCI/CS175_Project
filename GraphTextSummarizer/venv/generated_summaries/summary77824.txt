"It'll be tough in that sense, seeing Carmen everyday, because she will remind me of Ben," Phil Ledford told CNN affiliate WCPO. Carmen ended up at Cincinnati's Care Center, a critical care veterinary hospital where she has been ever since. Phil Ledford's brother Ben Ledford was Carmen's original owner. First responders to the fire found Carmen on top of Ben Ledford, trying to shelter his face from the heat, smoke and flame, according to WCPO. Carmen was initially battling severe lung damage and smoke inhalation, Dr. Daniel Carey, a vet at the hospital, told WCPO.
