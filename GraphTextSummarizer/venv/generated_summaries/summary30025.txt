"For Cain, it looked like he couldn't remember what he actually believes." So far, no other candidates are defending Cain's behavior and lack of serious intent or world view. Of course, Cain was unfriendly in that first moment in which he said he wouldn't allow any Muslims to serve at high levels of government (now a Cain classic!). It was bad, but it wasn't as bad as Cain's Libya moment. "The only thing Perry couldn't remember was the name of a Cabinet agency," Todd Harris, GOP political consultant who is unaffiliated with any of the campaigns, told CNN's Kevin Bohn. Not because they support Romney or Rick Perry or Newt Gingrich, but because they believe that Cain just might be sucking all of the oxygen out of the GOP race.
