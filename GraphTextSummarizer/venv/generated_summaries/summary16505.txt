-- Even before one reaches the front door of Canon's headquarters in Tokyo, one can sense the virtual stampede of employees pouring out of the building exactly at 5:30 p.m. Japan's birth rate of 1.34 is below the level needed to maintain the country's population. "It's great that we can go home early and not feel ashamed," said employee Miwa Iwasaki. Keidanren, Japan's largest business group, with 1,300 major international corporations as members, has issued a plea to its members to let workers go home early to spend time with their families and help Japan with its pressing social problem. But there are several other factors compounding the problem -- among them, the high cost of living, and social rigidity toward women and parenting. Analysts say the world's second-largest economy faces its greatest threat from its own social problems, rather than outside forces.
