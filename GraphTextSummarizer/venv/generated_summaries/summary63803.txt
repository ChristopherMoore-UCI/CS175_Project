West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said about 300,000 customers were without power Wednesday morning. Tomblin said Wednesday that while food is in short supply, "we've made a lot of progress" since the storm. The lack of power and limited food supply have put her in the same boat as millions of others this week. Pepco power company, which serves the D.C. metro area, said it expected to restore power by the end of Wednesday to 90% of its customers who lost electricity. " David McMann, in Charleston, West Virginia, has paid a price for the storm and lack of power at his home.
