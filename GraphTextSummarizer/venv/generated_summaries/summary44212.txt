In recent years, I have been using "AmeriChina" to describe the high expectations of the future of China-U.S. relations. Such China-U.S. summits have been known for both the substance of the meetings as well as the pomposity and the glamorous bells and whistles of high diplomacy. The world is holding its breath for the informal summit between U.S. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in California. Furthermore, as the two largest economies and most important countries in the world, the more China and the U.S. can see eye to eye on major international issues, the easier it will be to prevent escalation of international crises -- and the more effective they can be at solving them. The sense of shared destiny encapsulated in the concept of "AmeriChina" will help foster a new way of looking at the China-U.S. relations.
