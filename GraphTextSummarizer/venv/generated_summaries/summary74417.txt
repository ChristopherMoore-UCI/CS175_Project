That contest provides one of the centerpieces of the film, but having decided on a cinematic strand to recreate Ballesteros' childhood, Evans now needed someone who could play a young Seve. Taking its cue from a similar sporting opus "Senna," about the life of Brazil's Formula One star, it is produced by Stephen Evans, whose credits include "The Madness of King George" While a large portion of the film is made up of stirring archive footage, a thread of dramatized reconstructions chart the story of Ballesteros' formative years as a teenager. And in this age of better access to facilities and media trained stars, does Evans ever think golf will see his like again? Whether I'm proven right or wrong we'll see in the next few months but people who don't play golf have heard of Seve." Now, 25 years after Ballesteros secured the first of his five major titles at the British Open, and three years after his death, a film entitled "Seve" charts the career of golf's most charismatic star.
