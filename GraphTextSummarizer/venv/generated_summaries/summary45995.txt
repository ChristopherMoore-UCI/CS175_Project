-- Paris Jackson, the 15-year-old daughter of Michael Jackson, was rushed to a hospital after cutting one of her wrists early Wednesday morning, sources close to the Jackson family told CNN. Jackson trial lawyer Kevin Boyle spoke to reporters outside of court Wednesday afternoon, saying Paris can decide if she will testify during their part of the case, but AEG Live has subpoenaed her, calling her a key witness. Paris called a suicide counseling hotline early Wednesday, which lead to a counselor calling 911 to the Jackson home in Calabasas, California, those sources said. Paris posted messages to her million-plus Twitter followers late Tuesday evening: "i wonder why tears are salty?" "yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away "now it looks as though they're here to stay" The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said its deputies "responded to a medical situation" at an address that matches the Jacksons' Calabasas home at 1:27 a.m. Wednesday. " AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam denied his team was tough on Paris Jackson in her deposition.
