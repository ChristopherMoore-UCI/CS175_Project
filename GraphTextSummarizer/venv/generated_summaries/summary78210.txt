-- Surveillance video shows Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner walking up to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at a constituent event and firing point blank at her face, the Washington Post reported Tuesday, citing two sources who have seen the videos. The videos showed that U.S. District Judge John Roll was killed while covering Giffords' district director Ron Barber, who was one of 13 people wounded in the January 8 shooting outside a Tucson supermarket, the Post's sources said. The Washington Post report says that Loughner, 22, shot Giffords from about two or three feet away and then turned to his left, firing on people -- not shown in the video -- who were seated or standing in line for the event. The sources said that video ends at that point, but others show Loughner firing until he runs out of ammunition, when he was tackled by people attending the event. The Washington Post reported the parents of alleged gunman Loughner have not been able to provide much information and have told authorities they had little recent contact with Jared.
