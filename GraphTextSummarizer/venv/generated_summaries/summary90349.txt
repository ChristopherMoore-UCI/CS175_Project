In the separate penalty phase of a trial, where the question is not guilt or innocence, but life or death as punishment, a jury should be left with no lingering doubt -- no real doubt, however irrational -- about the convicted killer's guilt. But for those prisoners sentenced to death or life without parole, corrections should administer punishment: an unpleasant, restrictive daily regimen designed to continually convey society's intense disapproval of the crime and the criminal. For the worst of the worst whom we have condemned, daily life on death row should be their punishment. Prison administration should make every effort to connect punishment to crime. Western culture has essentially committed us to a presumption of life, of innocence and we have long required special proof of guilt before we punish with death.
