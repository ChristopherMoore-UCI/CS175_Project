ISIS has also been active in southern Libya, attacking a Libyan army checkpoint in Sokhna in January and killing 16 people. The savage killing of 21 Egyptian Christians in Libya -- all of them dressed in ISIS' trademark orange prison garb -- is another indication of ISIS' ability to take advantage of collapsed or collapsing states and of its growing presence in North Africa. The Long War Journal concluded that most of the new ISIS group were low- to mid-level militants -- a sign of "the competition between smaller and emerging militant groups in South Asia, some of which are seeking to align with the Islamic State brand." ISIS is under pressure in parts of Iraq and battling a variety of adversaries in Syria, but it's metastasizing at warp speed elsewhere, most dangerously in Egypt and Libya. ISIS first announced itself in Libya in October.
