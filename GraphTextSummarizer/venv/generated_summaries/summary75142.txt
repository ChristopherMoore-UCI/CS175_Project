I used to win races when I was a kid, but now even though I train thousands of miles, and run marathons and 50 mile ultra-races, age makes it unlikely I'll ever win anything again. Through the long history of the Olympics, no country has won more medals than the United States. In the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, my friend American marathoner Meb Keflezighi wanted to win. I like winning as much as the next soul, but treating anything except ultimate victory as passÃ© or a cause for shame is a mistake. And while the rest may come across as adequate amateurs, they are almost all rare, elite individuals with astonishing skills -- even when they finish near the bottom of the rankings.
