Shenzhou-8 blasted off on November 1 from a launch facility in the Gobi Desert in northwest China -- one month after the first space laboratory module Tiangong-1 was launched into space. China's space ambition soars "Breakthroughs in and acquisition of space docking technologies are vital to the three-phase development strategy of our manned space program," he said. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, the first stage in a "three-step" strategy to develop its manned engineering project. "Achieving the space rendezvous and docking is another historic technical breakthrough for China's manned spacecraft project," said Wu. Shenzhou-8 is scheduled to return to Earth on November 17, while Tiangong-1 will remain in space to wait for the next docking test.
