I want to have the opportunity to win majors, I want to play in Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups. Before Points' win, which earned him a place at the Masters and a winner's check of $1.16 million, the U.S. PGA Tour event had been buzzing with laughter after the likes of McIlroy et al posted pictures of themselves on Twitter mimicking Jason Dufner's unfortunate photograph of himself looking rather disinterested in a Texas classroom surrounded by children, while performing a charity visit last week. " Other sports starts quickly got in on the act, peppering Dufner's Twitter timeline with their own version of the online phenomenon -- former tennis player Andy Roddick even tweeted a picture of his dog "Dufnering". Remarkably Points earned his place at the Masters thanks to some help from his mother's putter as he finished one shot ahead of compatriot Billy Horschel and Sweden's Henrik Stenson. " McIlroy, who announced during the tournament that he would postpone a UNICEF charity trip to Haiti in order to add this week's Texas Open to his schedule, finished tied for 45th -- 12 shots behind Points.
