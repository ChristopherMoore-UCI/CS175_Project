Rother, executive vice president of policy and strategy for the largest senior citizens' advocacy group, said properly addressing excessive health care costs and waste requires addressing both health insurance coverage and how health care treatment is delivered. At issue is how to provide coverage for an estimated 46 million uninsured people while reversing a climb in health care costs. "The bottom line ... is: Do individuals looking for health insurance in the private market have choice and competition?" "All I'm saying is ... that the public option, whether we have it or we don't have it, is not the entirety of health care reform. Instead of a public option, the negotiators are considering a plan proposed by Conrad to create nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that could negotiate coverage as a collective for their members.
