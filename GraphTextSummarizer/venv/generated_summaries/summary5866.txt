Historically, the biggest check to presidential war power has been when Congress is assertive, with its power over the military budget and oversight. Congress should move forward with a vote on their legislation, putting a strong congressional imprint on the policies dictating what kind of military force will be used. By holding back on spending bills and constantly raising the possibility of government shutdowns, Congress prevents federal agencies from carrying on the business of government. The "do-nothing" Congress is the most misleading expression in politics. Congress, they say, will sit idly and do nothing while the world burns.
