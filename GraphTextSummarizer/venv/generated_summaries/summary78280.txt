Harte-McAreavey's bereaved husband, Gaelic footballer John McAreavey, and her father, leading Gaelic football coach Mickey Harte, supported each other as they walked behind the coffin and helped carry it to the church. The mass was led by McAreavey's uncle, Bishop John McAreavey, who married the couple on December 30. "An evil act ended Michaela's young life last Monday, it robbed John of his beautiful wife, it deprived the Harte family of their precious daughter and sister, it deprived the McAreavey family of the daughter-in-law they looked forward to having. "We presume they were inside and burgling the room when the lady returned and were surprised and attacked her," Mauritius police Superintendent Yoosoof Soopun, who is leading the investigation, said last week. In the Northern Ireland Assembly Monday, Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson said memories of the murdered honeymooner had united people in grief.
