" Kashif Parvaiz, 26, and Antoinette Stephen, 27, were indicted in Morris County Superior Court in the 2011 death of 27-year-old Nazish Norrani, Parvaiz's wife. A release from the prosecutor's office said that while being treated for his wounds, which were not life-threatening, Parvaiz had described the shooters as three men who shouted "slurs about terrorists" at the couple before fleeing on foot. Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi said at a news conference shortly after the killing that the fact that Noorani, a Muslim, was killed during the holy month of Ramadan "made this case especially compelling to us." And according to an affidavit filed in the case, Parvaiz subsequently told police he arranged for Stephen to kill his wife and wound him while the couple was out for a walk on August 16, 2011. Attempts to reach the attorneys for Parvaiz and Stephen were unsuccessful Thursday.
