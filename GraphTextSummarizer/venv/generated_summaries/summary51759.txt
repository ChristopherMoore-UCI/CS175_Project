-- Cell phone video recorded from inside a car clipped by a FedEx tractor-trailer truck before it slammed into a bus carrying students in Northern California is being reviewed by investigators, the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. The driver of the Nissan Altima that passed the bus just before the crash reported seeing flames coming from underneath the FedEx truck, but investigators have found no physical evidence of a fire before the collision, said Mark Rosekind, an NTSB board member. The NTSB team is looking at the FedEx driver's last 72 hours to determine whether he had enough rest and whether he was using his cell phone when he lost control of his truck, Rosekind said. Despite the initial lack of physical evidence of a fire before the crash, "nothing is ruled out yet," Rosekind told reporters at a news conference Sunday. The investigation shows the southbound truck did not brake as it crossed the median at a 10-degree angle and entered the northbound lanes, Rosekind said Saturday.
