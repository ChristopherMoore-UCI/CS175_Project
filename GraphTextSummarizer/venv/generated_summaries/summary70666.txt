This team deserve a little more credit than the press always give us." Bayern Munich, which had already won the group, defeated CSKA Moscow 3-0 courtesy of goals from Thomas Muller, Sebastian Rode and Mario Gotze. Samir Nasri's stunning 60th minute strike and Pablo Zabaleta's late effort gave City all three points and secured second place in Group E behind Bayern Munich. Sergio Aguero, who scored a hat-trick in the 3-2 win over Bayern Munich was ruled out with a knee injury, while captain Vincent Kompany failed to shake off a hamstring problem. City was also without its talisman midfielder Yaya Toure, who was suspended after being sent off during the 2-1 defeat by CSKA Moscow. "We recovered our normal performance, playing good pressing and playing well with the ball," Manuel Pellegrini, the Manchester City manager, told Sky Sports.
