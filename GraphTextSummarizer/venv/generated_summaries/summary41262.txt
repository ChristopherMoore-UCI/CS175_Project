"Franklin's ships are an important part of Canadian history given that his expeditions, which took place nearly 200 years ago, laid the foundations of Canada's Arctic sovereignty." Since 2008, there have been six major Parks Canada-led searches for the lost Franklin Expedition ships, Harper said. "I am delighted to announce that this year's Victoria Strait Expedition has solved one of Canada's greatest mysteries, with the discovery of one of the two ships belonging to the Franklin Expedition lost in 1846," he said in a statement. British sailor John Franklin left England with two ships in 1845 in an ill-fated attempt to sail the Northwest Passage. Modern explorers have succeeded where Franklin failed, but Canadians never stopped hoping they would find the lost ships of the Franklin Expedition. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that one of the two ships was found.
