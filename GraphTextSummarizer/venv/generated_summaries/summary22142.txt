Colvin, a Yale graduate renowned for reporting on war's more human consequences, had for years worked in conflict zones and high risk areas, despite losing an eye in 2001 during a grenade attack in Sri Lanka. "We felt we had to do something so there was a place that people could donate," said family member Michael Colvin. Colvin, 56,  was the only British newspaper journalist inside the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr. The day before she was killed, Colvin had given media interviews to networks like ITN and CNN about the ongoing clashes in Homs, and about a child who was killed in the city. Colvin reported Tuesday that there was "constant shelling in the city" and that the child's death was "just one of many stories" in violence-wracked Homs.
