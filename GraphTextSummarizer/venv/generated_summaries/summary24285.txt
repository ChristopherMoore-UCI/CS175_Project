Measure your coolness quotient at the Moroccan-inspired Andy Wahloo (Rue des Gravilliers) or jostle for space at La Perle (Rue de la Perle). Kick-start the evening with an aperitif or two at one of the tiny bars along Rue Vieille du Temple, such as the '50s-inspired Pick-clops, La Belle Hortense or Le Petit Fer a Cheval. The bars of Rue Oberkampf attract an eclectic crowd as the after-dark action moves further east into the slowly gentrifying neighborhood of Belleville. For chilled tunes, cocktails and top people-watching, visit the Hotel Costes (Rue St-Honore), a veritable temple to opulence. More chilled out and with an unsurprisingly eastern theme is the Buddha Bar (Rue Boissy d'Anglas), another old favorite that still packs in the beautiful people.
