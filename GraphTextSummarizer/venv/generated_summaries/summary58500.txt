Accommodation rights for pregnant workers need to catch up to accommodation rights for persons with disabilities. The courts' remaining objection to providing ADA accommodations to pregnant workers is pregnancy is "the natural consequence of a properly functioning reproductive system" and therefore cannot be a disability. They've reasoned the physical limitations accompanying pregnancy are too short-term and minor to qualify as disabilities. The ADA significantly differs from earlier disability laws that viewed persons with disabilities as defective. Pregnant women who experience comparable physical limitations should also have the opportunity to receive accommodations that will enable them to continue working.
