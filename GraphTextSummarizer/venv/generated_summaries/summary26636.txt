-- The head of Dublin-based budget airline Ryanair says that airport operators are holding the aviation industry back -- and describes the average airport as an unnecessary "international shopping center." Michael O'Leary, CEO of the carrier he described as "the McDonald's" of air travel, told CNN airport operators were hampering the growth of low-cost flight by leveling unrealistic charges on airlines. "[The] airport terminal serves very few purposes any more, except that it is an international shopping center, owned and run by rich airports. O'Leary said while Ryanair was affected by the current economic climate, and particularly by high oil prices, the airline tended to do well during economic downturns. "What happens in a recession, and what happened in the last three downturns in Europe [is that] Ryanair has grown faster. " O'Leary said airports could no longer justify many of the costs they passed on to carriers. And if you want those low airfares, we need low airport costs."
