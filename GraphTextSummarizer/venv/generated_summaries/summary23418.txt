Zimbabwe's minister of defense, Emmerson Mnangagwa, told parliament that the college would offer "specialized military training and learning of security issues" taught by senior officials in defense forces and civilians both in the country and from abroad. Shepherd Mushonga, a member of parliament from Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party, said he was surprised that Chinese companies including Anjin Investments Private Limited -- which has interests in diamonds - had been contracted to construct the college that is being built about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Harare. Zimbabwe's upper and lower houses of parliament passed the deal late Tuesday after heated debate. -- Zimbabwe's parliament has ratified a 20-year $98 million loan from China to build a defense college, despite objections from members of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party that the poverty-stricken country should prioritize the spending in other ways. Earlier this year, the visiting Chinese vice premier, Wang Qishan, signed about $700 million in loan agreements with Zimbabwe.
