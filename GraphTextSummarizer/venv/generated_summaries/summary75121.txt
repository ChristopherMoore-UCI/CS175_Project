A day of demonstrations Demonstrators filled the streets amid the instability ushered in by the military's overthrow last year of the democratically elected Morsy, and the ensuing crackdown by security forces on the Islamist movement that supported him, the Muslim Brotherhood. Dozens more people were wounded in clashes throughout the country between anti-government protesters and security forces. Islamist extremist groups have threatened to avenge the military coup that removed democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy from power last year. Four people were wounded when unknown gunmen attacked a security camp in Suez with a rocket-propelled grendade, state media are reporting, quoting security officials. The Anti-Coup Alliance, which supports deposed President Mohamed Morsy, claimed nine people were dead in one neighborhood alone after fierce confrontations.
