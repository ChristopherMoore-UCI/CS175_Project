The full interview with Bill Clinton will air on CNN Espa√±ol at 6 p.m. ET Friday and on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET. Former President Bill Clinton reflected on the months of protests that have swept across America in response to the deaths unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement, saying in an interview airing Friday that the country needs to make "people feel that everybody matters again. Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and the recent birth of Chelsea Clinton's first child, Charlotte, has been the fascination of many. As is the case with every interview, Bill Clinton was asked about his wife's presidential aspirations and when, in particular, Hillary Clinton expects to announce her candidacy. " Clinton, who was in Miami for the Clinton Foundation "Future of the Americas" summit, argued that the two issues at play in the protests were whether law enforcement made the correct decisions and how police departments can improve their relationships with communities.
