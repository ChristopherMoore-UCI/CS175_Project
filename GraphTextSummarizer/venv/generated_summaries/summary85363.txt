The obvious starting point for a road trip on Canada's east coast is Halifax, Nova Scotia, a hub of live music pubs, summer festivals and historic architecture. From here the coast winds around inlets of evergreen islands until you reach historic Chester, which is known for the artists' studios along its minuscule main street. The Olde Lantern Inn & Vineyard (Grand Pre): in the heart of winery and Fundy tide country. Two weeks With more time you can go directly up to Cape Breton, along the circuitous roads of the 'Cabot Trail', over high sea vista points, where whales breach offshore and you have to watch for moose on the road. Drive through mazes of rural roads and maybe get lost on the way to Maitland to sign up for a day of rafting the tidal bore in an inflatable dingy -- depending on the phase of the moon this can be relaxing or one of the most adrenalin-charged experiences of your life.
