Breaking decades of tradition, the Royal Ballet has been running a full-length commission of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" since 2011, replacing the Nutcracker as the mainstay of London's Christmas dance season. Theater designer Bob Crowley goes beyond faithfully rendering Lewis Carroll's original story into dance scenes, but uses plenty of his own smoke and mirrors -- sometimes literally -- to create breathtaking stage craft. Alas, you may have to wait till next year but there is real magic within the walls of Royal Opera House at Christmastime in London. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland runs until January 16, 2015 at Royal Opera House, London. The animal marches, Chinese-dragon like, up and down the wide stage of the Royal Opera House.
