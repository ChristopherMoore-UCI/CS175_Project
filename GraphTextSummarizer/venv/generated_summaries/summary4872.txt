Obama on the Redskins Black journalists accused their Native American counterparts of showing racist videos during the panel of ranting black fans cheering for their beloved football team, including extensive video of the team's then-beloved, now maligned Chief Zee, the African-American man (Zema Williams) who's been the team's unofficial mascot for 35 years. The football team's glorious history may indeed stretch back 80 wonderful years, but what intelligent person, or even a diehard football fan like me, could seriously argue that 80 years of entertaining football history could ever compare to the thousands of years that the original Americans have inhabited this land? It's time to get on the right side of American history. It was a panel discussion between African-American and Native American journalists from across the country to consider whether the Washington Redskins name was racist. Predictably, many Redskins fans are livid that the president would jump into this fight.
