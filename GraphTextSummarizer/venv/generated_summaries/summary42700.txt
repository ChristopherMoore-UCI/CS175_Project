As craft beer continues to rise in popularity, the trickle-down effect of that growth means more beer festivals popping up all over the United States. Paste UntappedDallas Paste magazine has taken its love for indie music and craft beer and turned it into a series of festivals taking place throughout the country. Other beer festivals have live music, but let's be honest, it's usually local bands that provide background noise. But instead of resting on its laurels, it continues to champion craft beer with the Firestone Walker Invitational Beer Festival. The festival is described as "a day where we can all put down our sales and marketing pitches and simply commune and share our beers and stories with people who are truly interested in craft beer."
