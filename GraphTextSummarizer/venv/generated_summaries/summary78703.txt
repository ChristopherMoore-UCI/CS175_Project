OSU students went on spring break "right as this was exploding," Rodriguez said, and local health officials contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to warn other departments to be on the lookout. -- An outbreak of mumps, first reported at The Ohio State University, has spread beyond campus and into the community, health officials said. Forty-five of those are linked to the university outbreak, said Jose Rodriguez, spokesman for the health department. The department is working with other universities to make sure they are ready to vaccinate members of the university community and promote infection control measures. There is no specific treatment for mumps, and patients usually recover after a week or two, but occasionally the disease can cause serious complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, deafness or inflammation of the breasts or ovaries in girls who have reached puberty, the CDC said.
