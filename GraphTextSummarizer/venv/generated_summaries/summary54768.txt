"We express our condolences to the victims of the Yeonpyeong island incident and will make efforts for the sake of peace between North and South Korea so that the situation does not deteriorate," Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo said during a meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Sunday. Lee added that "South Korea has endured endless provocations from the North since the Korean War, but if North Korea carries out an additional provocation, we will take strong countermeasures." The United States, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and North Korea are the six countries that have been involved in the discussions, which were put on hold in 2008. North Korea said the South provoked the attack because shells from the South Korean drill landed in the North's waters. "The United States is consulting with South Korea, Japan and other countries on China's proposal for emergency talks on the North Korean crisis," a State Department spokesperson told CNN Sunday.
