Tankleff was 17 when his parents were found stabbed and bludgeoned to death in their Belle Terre home on the North Shore of suburban Long Island. Suffolk County investigators, led by Detective K. James McCready, extracted a confession from Tankleff that was used to convict him. The $3,375,000 settlement resolves a claim brought by Tankleff in 2010, Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said Wednesday. Martin Tankleff, 42, served 17 years in state prison after being convicted in the September 1988 murder of his parents, Seymour and Arlene. In a statement released by Tankleff's legal team, he expressed his satisfaction with the lawsuit.
