Even when bullies wrote horrible things about Hope on a MySpace page called the "Shields Middle School Burn Book" and started a "Hope Hater Page," the young girl kept silent. At age 13, Hope Witsell struggled in middle school. In the year or so that has passed since Hope Witsell took her own life, her mother has started a group called Hope's Warriors. School officials told CNN they believed the social worker had tried calling Hope's mother to alert her but weren't sure if she had left a message. The school alerted Hope's parents.
