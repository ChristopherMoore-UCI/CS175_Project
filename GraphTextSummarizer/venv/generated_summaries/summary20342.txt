"Thank you very much to all of you, and tomorrow we will again continue the conversation that we have been having since the beginning of this electoral campaign," Rousseff said soon after the count, according to video on Bandeirantes television. Rousseff is the hand-picked successor of President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who has an 80 percent approval rating. Voting is mandatory in Brazil for anyone over age 18 and under age 70. He had 32.68 percent of the vote with nearly 99 percent of votes counted, the Superior Electoral Court said. The runoff election is scheduled for October 31.
