During an open public comment session, some patients and patient advocates told of the horrors they've encountered with silicone implants, in some cases imploring the manufacturers to make sure future studies are well-designed and protect women. "For more than 20 years, FDA has been asking manufacturers to conduct and report rigorous studies on the safety and effectiveness of breast implants. -- Makers of silicone breast implants have not followed up on thousands of women who received them as required by the Food and Drug Administration as a condition of approval, agency advisers said Wednesday. "We believe these sources may provide the data FDA requires on potential medical conditions in women with breast implants and would most likely capture any early 'safety signals,' " Allman said. In contrast, Nicole Noel told the panel she would again get silicone implants after the birth of her second child.
