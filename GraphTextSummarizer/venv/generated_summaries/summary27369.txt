No Valentine for Sarah Michelle Gellar: With only a repeat of "Hart of Dixie" for a lead-in, "Ringer" (1.1 million, 0.3) fell a stunning 40 percent from last week to a series low (and down 50 percent from its midseason return two weeks ago). In its new (and much tougher) time period, "Cougar Town" delivered 4.8 million viewers and a 1.8 adults 18-49 rating Tuesday night. Meanwhile ABC's "The River" (5.0 million, 1.7) is getting washed out, falling 29 percent its second week. It's arguably unfair to compare "Cougar Town" to its own 3.4 premiere last year (from which it's down 47 percent).
