This new type of touch screen, which was demonstrated for the first time at a tech conference in New York this week, uses a small static force to control friction between a user's finger and the touch screen. He said this technology isn't the "magic bullet" that will bring multitouch, tactile touch screens into the mainstream. Unlike other attempts at touch-screen technology with "haptic feedback," or impulses that stimulate the sense of touch, TeslaTouch has no moving parts. It has the same effect as a buzz," said Chris Harrison, one of the Disney researchers and a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. Another touch screen table is working at the Disney Research offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he said.
