The foundation says it has spent $1.5 billion on diabetes research, $40 million of that on research on artificial pancreas systems. In type 1 diabetics, the pancreas makes very little or no insulin, a hormone that controls glucose levels, or the amount of sugar in your blood. A high school senior at 18 now, she has participated in four clinical trials and two have involved artificial pancreas systems. "Our goal is to drive the development of artificial pancreas systems," Kowalski said. There are two types: A reactive low glucose suspend system that stops insulin infusion when a predetermined level has been reached, and a predictive low glucose suspend system that anticipates a hypoglycemic event based on the current blood sugar level and how fast those levels are falling.
