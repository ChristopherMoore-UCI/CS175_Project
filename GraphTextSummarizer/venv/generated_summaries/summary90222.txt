On the morning of May 24 of this year, two gunmen ambushed and murdered Amazon activist José "Zé" Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva and his wife, Maria do Espírito Santo da Silva in the Brazilian state of Pará. The grisly death of Zé Cláudio and Maria -- shot point-blank with a hunting rifle, and Zé Cláudio's ear cut off to prove the hit took place -- harkened back to other violent moments in the history of the Amazon, such as the assassinations of Father Josimo Tavares in 1986, Chico Mendes in 1988 and Sister Dorothy Stang in 2005. The former rain forest around Zé Cláudio and Maria's settlement is a prime example of such irresponsible land use. The morning of their deaths, Zé Cláudio and Maria had been driving to Marabá, the biggest and most important city in Pará's interior.
