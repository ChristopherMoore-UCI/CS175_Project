-- Abu Dhabi stepped in to help troubled fellow emirate Dubai and its state-owned holding company, Dubai World, with $10 billion in financing on Monday. "The remaining funds would also provide for interest expenses and company working capital through April 30, 2010 - conditioned on the company being successful in negotiating a standstill as previously announced," Sheikh Ahmad Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee said in a statement released Monday. Dubai World shocked investors globally when it asked Nov. 25 for a debt standstill at Dubai World, the government's flagship holding company, for payments owed on its $26 billion in debts. The holding company includes DP World, the shipping magnate, Nakheel, developer of some of the city's largest projects and investment company Ishitar. "This law will be available should Dubai World and its subsidiaries be unable to achieve an acceptable restructuring of its remaining obligations."
