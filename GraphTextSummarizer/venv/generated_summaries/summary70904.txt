Jaguarshoes Collective founder and café owner Nick Letchford was already using Bitcoin as a form of currency when he decided to install the machine after meeting a fellow enthusiast who pitched the idea to him. In fact, only a handful of venues in bustling London actually accept Bitcoin as a means of payment. I saw it as very much the way forward," Letchford told CNN's Nina Dos Santos, at the café in London. "We can put a 5 pound note into the Bitcoin ATM and it will give you a value of Bitcoin that exchanges to that value of 5 pounds," explained Letchford. While only about 1-2 per cent of Letchford's customers currently buy with Bitcoin, he still sees this as the way forward.
