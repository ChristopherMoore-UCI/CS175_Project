The Sewol disaster caused widespread outrage in the country over lax safety standards and the botched rescue attempt, prompting President Park Geun-Hye to promise an overhaul of national safety standards. Kim Kyung-il was sentenced in the Gwangju District Court for professional negligence and making false reports, court officials said. On arriving at the scene, Kim failed to broadcast an evacuation order through his ship's loudspeakers and made no effort to induce passengers to abandon ship, which constituted professional negligence, a court spokesman said. The captain of the first South Korean coast guard ship sent to rescue passengers from the doomed Sewol ferry has been sentenced to four years in prison for negligence.
