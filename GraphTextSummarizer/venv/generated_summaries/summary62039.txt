While most Sunnis may want nothing to do with ISIS's apocalyptic jihad, coexisting with the Shia is less and less appealing to them. A year ago, when ISIS started to move across the border from Syria into Iraq, I took the pulse of a couple Sunni Iraqi tribal sheiks and officers from Saddam Hussein's army, asking them why they didn't drive them back into Syria. But while ISIS does of course employ terror as a tactic, getting hung up on the word "terror" causes us to miss a more critical truth: that ISIS is a straight-line manifestation of an aggrieved religious sect -- orthodox Sunni Islam. The minority Alawite regime in Syria -- the Alawites are a Shia offshoot -- continues to slaughter large numbers of Sunnis. Letting the jihadists serve as your spearhead may sound risky to us, but what it tell us is that the divide between Iraq's Sunnis and Shia is truly unbridgeable.
