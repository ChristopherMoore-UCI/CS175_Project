Also known as Electric Town, Akihabara is a district of electronics stores clad in illuminated signs. It also boasts excellent shopping and hosts a flea market every other Sunday. Harajuku is also home to six-floor Kiddy Land (6-1-9 Jingu-mae), one of the city's best toy stores, with a huge selection of Hello Kitty products. The real treat here, as at many Tokyo department stores, is the fantastic basement-level food hall ("depachika"). For the less adventurous, but more discerning shopper, Harajuku's main thoroughfare, Omotesando is lined with elegant boutiques, including Louis Vuitton, Prada and Loveless (3-17-11 Minami-Aoyama).
