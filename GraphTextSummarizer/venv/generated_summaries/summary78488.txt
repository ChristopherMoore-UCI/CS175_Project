Someone forgot to send the memo to the Northeast and Upper Midwest where some folks are digging out from up to 15 inches of snow and temperatures in some areas are well below zero. Freeze warnings swept in an arch from central Alabama to North Carolina, with forecasters telling farmers to harvest or protect tender vegetation. Winter isn't ready to give up yet as a lingering storm was dumping more snow across most of Maine on Wednesday, after hitting the rest of the region a day earlier. While temperatures are cold in the Northeast, in the teens in many areas, the Upper Midwest is in deep freeze. A winter storm warning remains in effect until noon for central and northwest Maine, where 8 to 14 inches of snow are expected.
