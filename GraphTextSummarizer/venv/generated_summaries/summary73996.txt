Former Argentina captain Agustin Pichot admitted the decision well help to provide the impetus for participation growth within Argentina. The tournament would be played from mid-August for an eight or nine week period through until early to mid-October. The International Rugby Board (IRB) have made a commitment to Argentina to provide them with more international fixtures to help fully integrate the Puma's into the international playing calendar. "We will work with all stakeholders to try to ensure that appropriate conditions of invitation are met, including the participation of Argentina's top players and the implementation of a sound and sustainable financial model," he added. It is proposed that Argentina, bronze medalists at the 2007  World Cup, will join Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to create a new Four-Nation tournament.
