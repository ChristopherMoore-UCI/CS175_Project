"Allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was sent to Iran by the CIA are simply untrue," department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said earlier this year. An Iranian court has dismissed a lower court's death sentence for an American ex-Marine accused of espionage in Iran, state media reported Monday. The lower court previously had convicted the 28-year-old of "working for an enemy country," as well as membership in the CIA and "efforts to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorism," the semi-official Fars news agency has reported. "The Iranian regime has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies, of eliciting forced confessions, and of holding innocent Americans for political reasons. The Hekmatis said their son served in the U.S. Marines from 2001 to 2005.
