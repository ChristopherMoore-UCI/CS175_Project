CNN: What is your role as an ambassador? Davis: The way I perceive my role as an ambassador -- which I think is personal for everyone -- is that I travel to places that I'm interested in, where there's a story or a particular situation with women usually, and I just talk to people and I'm a witness to their story.

That's what I love about the CNN Heroes program: that it's people all over the world who may just be on their own trying to fix something. But it's wonderful for me to be able to talk about it to other people, because I think sometimes we're not aware of how other people are living.
