The new rules, which will require luggage to be transported on quieter air-filled tires, are the idea of City Commissioner Victor Zappalorto, according to the Il Messaggero newspaper. The local Il Gazzettino newspaper says the new rule will be legally binding as it'll be written into local building code Zappalorto has suggested the legislation will be an opportunity for an entrepreneurial luggage to cash in in by creating a Venice-friendly suitcase that runs on soft tires. 'Serious discomfort' City officials have reportedly said the noise from hard-wheeled suitcases and traders using trolleys was causing "serious discomfort." City officials have become so tired with the cacophony of rumbling luggage they're introducing fines of up to 500 euros ($620) for anyone caught using one. For years Venice has battled the effects of rising waters on its historic architecture, but now it's facing a new threat -- wheeled suitcases.
