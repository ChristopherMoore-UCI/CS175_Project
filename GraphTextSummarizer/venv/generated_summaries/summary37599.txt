NOW: Iraq's phantom WMD The Bush administration certainly wanted to go to war, and it advanced eradication of weapons of mass destruction as the main reason. U.N. inspectors were asked to search for, report and destroy real weapons. Iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow And during a telephone chat with Tony Blair on February 20, I told the British prime minister that it would be paradoxical and absurd if a quarter of a million troops were to invade Iraq and find very little in the way of weapons. At any rate, whatever view one took of the evidence of weapons, no one could believe in 2003 that prostrate Iraq was a threat to any other state. If not, why had Iraq stopped U.N. inspections at many places around the country throughout the 1990s?
