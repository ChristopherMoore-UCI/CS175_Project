United Nations staff and international aid workers often travel with armed Kenyan police escorts from their bases to the various camps. MSF has evacuated part of its team working in Dagahaley and Ifo, two of the three refugee camps in Dadaab, the statement said. Aid workers have long worried about security in Dadaab, particularly since the refugee processing center at the border has been closed by the Kenyan government for several years. MSF identified the victims as Montserrat Serra, 40, of Girona, and Blanca Thiebaut, 30, of Madrid. "We are doing all we can to ensure their safe and swift return," said Jose Antonio Bastos, president of MSF in Spain.
