-- President Barack Obama's toast to Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday was interrupted when the orchestra at the state dinner began playing "God Save the Queen" before Obama finished. Obama continued with his toast, speaking over the music in citing the special relationship between the British and American people and quoting William Shakespeare's tribute to "to this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England" from "Richard II. When the music ended, Obama repeated, "to the queen," and the audience, clearly confused by the turn of events, delayed a few seconds before applauding. "To Her Majesty the Queen," Obama began, but the orchestra -- apparently thinking the president had concluded -- started playing the British anthem. Following the queen's toast to him and the playing of the U.S. national anthem, Obama began his toast by thanking her and commenting on her reign and the close ties between their countries.
