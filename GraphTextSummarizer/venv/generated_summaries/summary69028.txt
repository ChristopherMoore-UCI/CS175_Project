-- Self-styled superhero Phoenix Jones unmasked himself before cameras Thursday and vowed to keep fighting crime after prosecutors delayed a decision on whether to press assault charges against him. Told charges had not been filed against him, Fodor put the rubber hood back on and left the court with a swarm of media cameras following him. The only difference is that I try to stop crime." Fodor also said he would invite the public to accompany him on future patrols. He was arrested early Sunday on four counts of assault after police said he used pepper spray on a group of people leaving a nightclub. Seattle Police said Fodor overreacted, and asserted that the city is not in need of vigilante crime fighters.
