-- Baltimore Colts defensive tackle Art Donovan, a hall of famer who spent his later years regaling television audiences with amusing anecdotes about his time in the NFL, has died. "The Pro Football Hall of Fame is saddened to learn of the passing of Baltimore Colts great Art Donovan," said Steve Perry, hall of fame president and executive director. Storied career Donovan played in the NFL for 12 seasons, starting at age 26 after serving in World War II. "The world is not as bright tonight because we lost someone who could make us all smile," Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said Sunday night. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay also weighed in.
