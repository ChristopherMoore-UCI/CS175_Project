-- A dam burst in the northeastern village of Cocal left a 12-year-old girl dead and three people missing, fire department officials said Thursday, according to Brazil's state news agency. Steady rain has flooded communities across 10 states since early April, killing dozens of people and forcing nearly 800,000 from their homes, according to the Brazilian civil defense agency. Fire officials said 800 to 2,000 homes located near the dam were inundated, but civil defense officials estimated 500 families -- some 2,500 people -- were affected. Concern over the dam's integrity led officials to order residents to evacuate Cocal for 15 days. Steady rain has flooded communities across 10 states in Brazil since early April.
