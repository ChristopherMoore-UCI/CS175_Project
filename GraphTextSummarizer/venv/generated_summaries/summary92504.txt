In the 2003 comedy "Head of State," Rock runs for president and as expected, strikes a chord with the American people before hitting a few speed-bumps along the way. In the opening episode of this ABC drama, the first woman president goes before Congress and talks of hope and aspirations and of American being a force for good across the globe. Douglas defends his relationship with Annette Bening's character and in the process, talked about gun control and climate control. Either way, the film does deal with the politics of running for president and Spencer Tracy apologizes to the woman he loves and to the American people through a radio address. We have had the first Catholic president, the first African-American president and, yet, we still haven't had the first woman president.
