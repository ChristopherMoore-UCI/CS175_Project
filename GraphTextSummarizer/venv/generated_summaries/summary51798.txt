The suburb wasn't a new concept; people had been attempting to push their way out of crowded cities for as long as there had been crowded cities, and rail service and streetcars made it possible to build communities on city outskirts. The most popular exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair was Norman Bel Geddes' Futurama -- sponsored by General Motors -- which posited a future of superhighways leading consumers through muscular cities and bucolic towns. Southern California, which is often depicted as one big suburb, was the center of this emptiness (it doesn't hurt that the region's chief industry is fantasy), but it's an image that transfers anywhere, from Chicago ("Ordinary People") to Elm Street ("A Nightmare on Elm Street"). In the suburbs you could have your own picket-fenced home, just like the ones in small towns of yore. Today's suburbs are increasingly multicultural and, in some cases, have developed their own skyscraper-filled "edge cities," in the term popularized by journalist Joel Garreau.
