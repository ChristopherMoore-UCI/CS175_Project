He said eye fatigue comes from staring at the artificial, pixelated light from our screens. The Glyph has a battery life of about three hours, Tang said. Avegant is based in the heart of Michigan's manufacturing region and hopes to manufacture the Glyph as much as possible in the United States, Tang said. The technology that powers the Glyph centers around a set of 2 million microscopic mirrors -- 1 million per eye -- that reflect visuals, including 3-D, into the user's eye. The Glyph headset, from Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Avegant, will create visuals that don't need a screen -- just your retinas and your brain.
