So when Miley Cyrus took the VMAs stage on Sunday and proceeded to provocatively dance (with teddy bears, no less) before removing even more clothing, was she committing the offense the Internet has claimed, or simply upholding 30 years of VMAs tradition? "Raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by Miley Cyrus' #VMAs performance," tweeted E! Online. Yet the reaction to Cyrus appears to be more eviscerating than previous years. In the days following her 18th birthday in 2010, Cyrus was subjected to more scrutiny when a video surfaced of the star smoking a bong apparently filled with salvia. The following year, Cyrus was criticized for her Teen Choice Awards performance, during which she danced atop an ice cream cart -- complete with a pole -- while singing her hit, "Party in the U.S.A." The moment would infamously become known as Cyrus' "pole dance."
