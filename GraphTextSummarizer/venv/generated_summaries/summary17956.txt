As the 10-year anniversary of that day approaches, CNN asked security experts to weigh in on changes in aviation security in the United States since 9/11 and to offer a glimpse of what's likely to happen next. "The TSA is exhibiting much more open-mindedness and has already accepted the concept that there is a need to look at people as well as what they carry," said Rafi Ron, president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel. "Just to do things based on something that already happened in and of itself is frankly illogical and is not supportive of good security," he said. Ron said his professional experience with Israeli airport security, widely considered to be the best in the world and heavily reliant on behavioral analysis and profiling, doesn't mean he would suggest the United States go to the same lengths. They're not calling for illegal racial or ethnic profiling, Bloom, Ron and security analyst Douglas Laird said.
