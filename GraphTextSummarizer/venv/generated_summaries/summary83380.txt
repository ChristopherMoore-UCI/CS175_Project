At the final meeting of the ski season in the pretty French resort of Meribel, Vonn raced to more records on the women's World Cup tour -- a seventh downhill season title and her 18th crystal globe overall. " Vonn, who credits boyfriend Tiger Woods with inspiring her recovery, fended off the challenge of Austria's Anna Fenninger to claim the downhill crown by 103 points. If Vonn wins tomorrow she will equal Swede Ingemar Stenmark, who owns an overall record of 19 crystal globes. Vonn and Fenninger will renew their rivalry Thursday for the super-G title, where Vonn holds an eight-point lead over her challenger. "This downhill title probably means more to me than the others because I've been through so much," Vonn told CNN's Alpine Edge.
