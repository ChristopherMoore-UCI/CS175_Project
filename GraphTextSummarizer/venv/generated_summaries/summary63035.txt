Gatlin, however, had the consolation of winning the $40,000 prize for being the overall Diamond League champion over the distance, with Bolt second. Bolt's compatriot Nesta Carter was given third place after sharing a time of 9.94 with Moscow silver medalist Justin Gatlin of the U.S. while Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole was fifth in 9.98. The 26-year-old, who like Bolt won three golds in Moscow, set a meeting record of 10.72 to head off American Alexandria Anderson (10.92) and fellow Jamaicans Carrie Russell (10.99) and Kerron Stewart (11.19). -- Usain Bolt ended his season on a high note with a comfortable 100 meters victory at the final Diamond League meeting in Brussels on Friday. It was just 0.03s slower than the time he set in regaining his world title in Moscow last month.
