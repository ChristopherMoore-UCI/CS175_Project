But de Kock showed remorse, meeting with victims' families, some of whom publicly forgave him, and helping the Missing Persons Task Force locate bodies, a fact noted by South African Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha. In asking for a mitigated sentence, de Kock said the unit he commanded "was established with the full knowledge and approval of senior government officials and police generals," according to the ANC's webpage. When apartheid fell and the ANC gained control of the government, de Kock cooperated with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 1994 to achieve full disclosure of apartheid-era misdeeds. "In the interests of nation building and reconciliation," Masutha said Friday, he was granting parole to de Kock. Eugene de Kock was the most notorious assassin of South Africa's apartheid era, commanding a death squad that kidnapped, tortured and killed black activists.
