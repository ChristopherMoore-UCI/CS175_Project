" Mubarak's ouster -- fueled by 18 days of angry protests -- was preceded by last month's overthrowing of Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, helping stoke demands for reform in the Arab world. Tensions erupted in another restive North African nation as security forces in Algeria on Saturday clashed with anti-government protesters who chanted, "Change the power." More than 3,000 demonstrators, including activists, students, doctors, and parliament members, joined the rally but were blocked by more than 30,000 police officers, said league president Mustafa Boushashi. "Population growth and associated problems -- unemployment and underemployment, inability of social services to keep pace with rapid urban migration, inadequate industrial management and productivity, a decaying infrastructure -- continue to affect Algerian society," the U.S. State Department says in a background note about Algeria. The league is one of the main opposition groups that organized the rallies -- unauthorized gatherings that came a day after embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down.
