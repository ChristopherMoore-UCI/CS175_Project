People often think that it only happens in poor families, but the truth is that domestic violence affects women of all ages, classes and backgrounds. In these situations, women may try to appease their partners to defuse the situation and reduce the risk of violence. Reports of abuse are routinely dismissed, calls for help are downgraded, and dangerous men are left free to commit violence -- or worse. It's important that we recognise the signs of abuse at the earliest opportunities, and help women to get support before the violence escalates. Back then, domestic violence was still thought of as a private issue, to be dealt with behind closed doors.
