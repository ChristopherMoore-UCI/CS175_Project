"I hear that Abenomics is bringing merit to big companies, but for small companies like my husband's one, there is no benefit," she says. "They say that employment is getting better, but all I see is the price of things going up, and that is hurting me." But rising prices is actually one of the key targets of Abenomics. "I wish that Abenomics would bring my quality of life up, because at the moment it's just the rich people who are getting the benefits. On top of that you have corporates making more money, they have basically doubled, so you have employment up and profit up and consumer sentiment on the rise." But there are still plenty of winners from Abenomics.
