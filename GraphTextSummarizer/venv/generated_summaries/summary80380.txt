" But one of the goals of Varanasi's MIT lab is to develop potential commercial products, not just publish research in academic journals. LiquiGlide is made from a secret cocktail of edible, nontoxic materials that can be sprayed into bottles or other food containers. But it's not exactly what Kripa Varanasi had in mind when he and his students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set out to develop a new kind of slippery coating that would help de-ice planes, or keep water droplets from sticking to steam turbines in power plants. Videos on the LiquiGlide site show it working its slippery magic on plastic bottles of jelly and mustard, too. "I never thought a ketchup bottle would make us this famous," said Varanasi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.
