Alvaro Eduardo Guzman-Telles, 29, said in a Facebook post in December he was "going to personally kill and behead Daniel Pantaleo" and that "this is a written threat and has to be taken extremely seriously," the FBI alleges in a federal indictment. Pantaleo, a New York City police officer, put Garner in a chokehold while trying to arrest him last July on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes. Garner died after the encounter, but a grand jury declined in December to indict Pantaleo, sparking large demonstrations across the nation. He was arrested last month and faces a charge of interstate transmission of threatening communications, according to the indictment. " The New York office of the FBI tracked the social media posts back to an address in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where Guzman-Telles' mother was questioned.
