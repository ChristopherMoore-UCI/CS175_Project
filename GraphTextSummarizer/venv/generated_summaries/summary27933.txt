At the beginning of the third set I thought that was a key moment because he had momentum on his side." In later play, in-form Mardy Fish maintained his impressive run with a straight sets win over dangerous outsider Kevin Anderson of South Africa, 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-3). 27th seed Cilic took the second set but the Swiss maestro then took command and ran out a 6-3 4-6 6-4 6-2 winner at Flushing Meadows. Cilic, who had thrashed Bernard Tomic in the second round, looked set to cause an upset until 4-4 in the pivotal third set. In Saturday's night session, world number one Novak Djokovic -- who has lost just twice in 2011 -- defeated Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-3 6-4 6-2 to set up a last 16 clash with Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov. Djokovic told reporters: "I played well at important moments and got the crucial breaks in all three sets. The Australian Open and Wimbledon champion had only dropped three games in his first two matches, but he was given a sterner test against Davydenko, a semifinalist here in 2006 and 2007.
