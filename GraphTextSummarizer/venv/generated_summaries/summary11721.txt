"We are lifting the grain export ban from July 1 this year, but I am asking you to work most actively, as you did in recent years, and ensure the work of the agriculture ministry, other government departments and financial institutions so as to support our agricultural producers in this difficult period, and the sowing campaign, which is not fully over yet, let alone the harvesting," Putin said. The government forecast for the 2011 wheat crop has been set at about 85 million tons, and agriculture experts estimate that with the grain export ban lifted, Russia may export 10 to 13 million tons of grain in 2011, mostly wheat. -- Russia will lift its grain export ban on July 1 this year, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced Saturday. Putin made the announcement at his country residence during a meeting with Viktor Zubkov, his deputy in charge of agriculture.
