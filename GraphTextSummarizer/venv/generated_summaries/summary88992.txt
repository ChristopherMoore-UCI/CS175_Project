-- Zimbabwe's education system is beginning to battle back from years of neglect and an exodus of teachers. Watch kids trying to learn When CNN visited a Mathabisana primary school in Umguza, in the southwest of Zimbabwe, headmaster Nonkululeko Ndlovu said that at one point teachers used charcoal as a substitute for chalk. Ndlovu said: "When the parents bring a chicken to sell or to offer as school levy, teachers sometimes buy it, so if they agree on the price, the teacher would get the item, pay the fees, and then if there is any change, he would give the parent the change. "We cannot all go out and leave Zimbabwe empty without teachers. According to the education department, 20,000 teachers have left the country in the past two years and half of Zimbabwe's children have not progressed beyond primary school.
