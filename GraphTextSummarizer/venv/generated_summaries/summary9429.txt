As first lady, Michelle Obama has managed to be both iconic and accessible, a hard-to-achieve but quintessential balancing act for the greatest of political leaders. Moreover, those of us who often long to see President Obama be more confrontational, or even angry and aggressive, sometimes see more of that raw fighting spirit in his wife. The political stars might certainly be aligned: Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois is a Republican in the Obamas' Democratic home state and would be up for re-election in November 2016, just as the Obama White House would be drawing to an end. -- It's not surprising there's speculation that Michelle Obama might run for the United States Senate â€” although one should note that at this point, that's all it is: speculation â€” made mainly in a Reuters article written by Keith Koffler, editor of the website White House Dossier. In 2006, Sen. Barack Obama reported a salary of $157,082.
