Snacks are big with Lyft drivers, but few have taken it as far as entrepreneur and Lyft driver Chris Biggs -- aka Cookie Wars Lyft. But the silly accessory and Lyft's social-focused approach ended up infusing the makeshift fleet with peppy, perky and chatty personality and attracting outgoing drivers. Sidecar is a service similar to Lyft and also asks passengers to sit up front, but it hasn't seen the same boom in creativity from drivers. Starting in California meant Lyft had a big pool of disco-loving, baked-goods making eccentrics, actors and Burning Man attendees willing to be drivers. (Lyft drivers don't see how much they were paid until the end of their shifts.)
