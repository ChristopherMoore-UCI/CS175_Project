Web sites offering resource guides to help happy couples (in-state and out) sprouted up, bearing names such as Iowa's Gay Wedding Planner and Iowa Gay Wedding Directory. According to a study conducted by The Williams Institute, a UCLA School of Law-based think tank that researches sexual orientation law and policy, more than 2,900 of the state's same-sex couples will marry within three years and nearly 55,000 out-of-state couples may flock to Iowa for the honor. Everything changed for this Iowa nurse on April 3, when the Midwestern state's Supreme Court unanimously ruled to overturn a ban on same-sex marriages. Many activists who followed the Iowa case, Varnum v. Brien, to the state's Supreme Court were anticipating the April 3 announcement. Iowa, for example, ruled against slavery in 1839, desegregated schools in 1868 and, for the first time in the country, granted a woman a license to practice law in 1869, as outlined in a One Iowa brochure.
