From Flaam, "Nutshellers" catch the most scenic of fjord cruises. Nearly every train arriving in Flaam connects with a bus or boat to Aurland, also on Sognefjord. Sognefjord offers Norway's best combination of scenic wonder and accessibility. While most "Norway in a Nutshell" tourists zip immediately from the train onto the scenic fjord boat in Flaam, those with time enjoy an overnight stop on the fjord. You can finish the day there by browsing the touristy but fun wharf area, or zipping up the funicular to the top of 1,000-foot-tall "Mount" Floyen for city and fjord views.
