Dutch photographer Anoek Steketee and filmmaker Eefje Blankevoort were in Rwanda in 2008 when they first heard "Musekeweya." "We came to the conclusion that we needed to provide a context, use the audio of the soap and find a form to tell a layered, nuanced story of the relation between the fictional story of the radio soap and the daily reality of contemporary Rwanda," Steketee said. The radio drama raised important questions for Steketee and Blankevoort, and they wanted to explore the way this fiction could contribute to real reconciliation. "I photographed listeners in their homes, on the streets, during the broadcast of "Musekeweya,' " Steketee wrote in an e-mail. Steketee and Blankevoort began exploring this issue first through photography.
