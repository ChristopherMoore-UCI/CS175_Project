Click to Listen to PJ Harvey's "Let England Shake" Always an underrated guitarist, Harvey makes use of the jaunty rhythms of British folk music, but takes no comfort in the past. "Let England Shake" sounds a world apart from the introspective piano confessions of Harvey's last solo album, 2007's "White Chalk." But Polly Jean Harvey, as always, does things her own way, so there's no celebration on "Let England Shake." For England, she holed up in a rural 19th-century church, accompanied by longtime collaborators like John Parish, Mick Harvey and producer Flood. Even as she sings, "Take me back to beautiful England," she focuses on war, imperialism and bad sanitation.
