Erie County officials said one of the deaths was from a car accident and three other people died due to cardiac issues that resulted from shoveling snow. -- There are 5 1/2 feet of snow outside and on top of Chrissy Hazard's home in the Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga, New York. In Alden, New York, a 46-year-old man was found dead inside a car buried in 12 to 15 feet of snow, authorities said. CNN Severe Weather Expert Chad Myers said that 20 to 30 more inches of snow will fall Thursday during a 10-hour window. Instead hundreds of dump trucks venture out to haul snow away from the 10 square miles that have been pummeled by the lake-effect snow.
