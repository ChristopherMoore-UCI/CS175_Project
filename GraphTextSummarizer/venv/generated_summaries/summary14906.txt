A very VIP patron One person who is currently in the queen's fashion inner circle is couturier and wedding dress designer Stewart Parvin. An ensemble fit for a queen Both Parvin and Rehse told CNN the queen is very involved in the design process, culminating with fittings at Buckingham Palace. Kelly and her team use old and new fabrics when designing for the queen using material given to her from when she was a princess, according to the Buckingham Palace website. She always has an opinion on it and she has a very informed opinion and she knows when it's right and she knows when it's wrong," said Parvin, who designs two couture collections a year and was in 2007 awarded the Royal Warrant -- given to designers who have worked with the queen for five years or more. Over the past six decades, Her Majesty has employed the talents of several British designers.
