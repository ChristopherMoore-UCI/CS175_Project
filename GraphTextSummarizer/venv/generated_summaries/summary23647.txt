-- India has long been cited as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, but it hasn't always been the most hospitable place for business travelers. "Infrastructure that we created for 2020 are already getting filled up by 2012," says Amitabh Kant, the man who is planning to bring India up to speed by 2017. The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, a $90 billion state-run enterprise, will involve connecting the 932 mile stretch between Delhi and Mumbai with new ports, airports, highways and rail links. Despite the wealth of foreign investment in India, Kant also notes that the drive for change is coming from within the country. India's middle class is 400 million strong, and Kant reckons that by 2021 it will account for 47% of the country's GDP.
