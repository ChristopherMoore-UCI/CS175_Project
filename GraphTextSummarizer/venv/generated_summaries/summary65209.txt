Josephine Cochran of Shelbyville, Illinois, irked that the servants chip her fine china in the sink (darn servants!), designs the first dishwasher, a motorized machine with racks that hold dishes in place as soapy water shoots from below. The Scott Paper Company introduces the first paper towels, designed to help prevent the spread of cold germs from cloth towels in public restrooms (eek!). Five California businessmen invest $100 each to found America's first commercial liquid-bleach factory, using brine extracted from salt ponds. In Scotland, stale human urine is used as a cleaning agent for laundry. (It takes 50 gallons to do a single load of laundry!)
