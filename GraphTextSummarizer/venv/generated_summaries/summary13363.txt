Members of a "tactical team" entered the Lincoln City, Oregon, room of 26-year-old Michael Boysen around 7 p.m. (10 p.m. ET), emerging with no injuries, said city police Chief Keith Kilian. Boysen was taken into custody about an hour after authorities used water cannons to blast down part of the front door to the suspect's room, a move that showed authorities' intent to "just kind of step ... things up a little bit," according to Kilian. During the course of their investigation, detectives said they learned that Boysen had talked about killing his grandparents, acquiring guns and going after authority figures. The hotel clerk contacted police around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday after watching a news broadcast and identifying Boysen by face and by name. His grandparents picked him up, drove him around running errands and held a gathering for family members at their home to welcome him back, said King County Sheriff John Urquhart.
