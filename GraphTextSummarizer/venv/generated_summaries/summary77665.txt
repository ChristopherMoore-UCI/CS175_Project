Hilary Swank plays Amelia Earhart and Richard Gere plays husband George Putnam in "Amelia." Dressed for the title role in a wardrobe of jumpsuits, leather jackets, scarves, and slinky evening wear dashing enough to stop air traffic, Hilary Swank's Earhart doesn't so much talk as make stump speeches -- even when she's at her own breakfast table. (Entertainment Weekly) -- "Amelia" is a frustratingly old-school, Hollywood-style, inspirational biopic about Amelia Earhart that doesn't trust a viewer's independent assessment of the famous woman pictured on the screen. For a time, the freethinking woman also conducted a love affair with aeronautics pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor), now best known as the father of writer Gore Vidal. All of them add up to banners that might as well be flown from an aircraft tail over a beach: Amelia Earhart lived free in life and love!
