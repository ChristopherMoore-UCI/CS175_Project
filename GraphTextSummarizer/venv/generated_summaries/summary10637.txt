Mexico and the other nations signed a declaration expressing their "strong condemnation and profound rejection of the law," said Senate President Carlos Navarrete Ruiz. The U.S. Justice Department filed suit against the law, SB 1070, this month on the ground that Arizona is usurping federal authority to control the border and enforce immigration law. -- Mexico has received the support of parliamentary leaders from 10 nations in opposition to Arizona's controversial new immigration law, the Mexican Senate president said Wednesday. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Navarrete said Mexico received support from Uruguay, Panama, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guatemala, Cuba, Turkey, Senegal, Micronesia and Ghana. The Arizona law, which is scheduled to go into effect later this month, requires anyone being investigated by police for a possible crime to provide proof of legal residency.
