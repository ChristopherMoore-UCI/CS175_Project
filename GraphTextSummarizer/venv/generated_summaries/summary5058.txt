"The Obama White House should put Ted Cruz on the payroll," Republican Rep. Peter King of New York quipped to the Washington Post following Cruz's latest foray into House affairs. But Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who attended the dinner meeting with Cruz, said the attendees did not make a pact on the House bill and denied that he twisted any arms to kill it, as Republican leadership aides have claimed. At the time, Cruz rallied tea party allies in the House to join his dogged opposition to Obama's signature health law, which remains a partisan political flashpoint. Cruz also penned a fundraising appeal for the Madison Project, a PAC that set its sights on dethroning establishment figures ranging from Cochran to McConnell to Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts. Ted Cruz appears to have played a key role in the emergency border bill falling apart in the House.
