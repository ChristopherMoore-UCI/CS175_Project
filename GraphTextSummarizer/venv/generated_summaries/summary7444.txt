" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said two inquiries had been launched into the incident to discover how the ship hit the reef. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), is advising people to avoid the beach for health reasons. A rescue center has been set up in the city of Tauranga to clean oil from animals affected by the spill and MNZ has 12 teams working to assist oiled wildlife. Efforts to recover oil from the grounded ship, now heading south down the coast, are being hampered by high winds and strong swells. "This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea," the organization's Steve Abel said.
