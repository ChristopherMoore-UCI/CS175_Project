-- Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback Michael Vick will join the Humane Society of the United States in speaking about the horrors of dogfighting with students of two high schools in New Haven, Connecticut, on Tuesday. "Vick will share his story with students, and illustrate why they should refrain from dogfighting and speak out against animal cruelty," the animal rights group said in a media statement. Vick will be joined by Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society during the talks. Vick left a Kansas prison in May 2009 to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. The NFL indefinitely suspended Vick in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation in Virginia.
