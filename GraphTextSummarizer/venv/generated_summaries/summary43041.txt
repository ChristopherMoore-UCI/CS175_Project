"PETA has obtained shocking photos and video of circus trainers as they beat elephants and subject them to violent training methods using barbaric devices such as bullhooks," Brooks said. "It should come as no surprise that elephants and other animals sometimes snap and attack circus employees and members of the public," said Robbyn Brooks of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). People at the Irem Shrine in Wilkes-Barre, which has been hosting the James Hamid Circus all week, rushed to help but not before the trainer sustained life-threatening injuries, said police Lt. Steven Oshefski. Animal rights activists decried the use of animals in circuses. The victim is not being identified until next-of-kin have been notified, Oshefski said.
