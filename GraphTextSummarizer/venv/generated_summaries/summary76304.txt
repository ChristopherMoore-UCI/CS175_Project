-- A U.S. flag that once flew over cleanup and recovery efforts at ground zero and was stolen from a Long Island home was finally returned to its rightful owner on Friday, reports CNN affiliate WPIX. "There are other flags out, and for whatever reason they came here and took ours," Ielpi-Brengel said to WPIX. "We put the flag out certain times of the year just to remember," Ielpi-Brengel told WPIX. Tragedy turns the mundane into memorial CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Zachary Slater contributed to this report. The flag was also accompanied with a note simply stating, "I am sorry, I had no idea," WPIX reported.
