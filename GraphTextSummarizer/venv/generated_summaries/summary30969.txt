Syed Ashraful Islam, secretary-general of the ruling Awami League and a government minister, said demonstrators set fire to the Communist Party of Bangladesh office and ransacked several other business establishments in Purana Paltan in central Dhaka. The list also includes mandatory Islamic education, bans on the free mixing of men and women and on the public installation of sculpture and a declaration that Ahmadiyya Muslim sect is non-Muslim. Tens of thousands of supporters of the Hefazat-e-Islam movement blocked nearly all the roads leading into the capital, Dhaka, as they pressed a list of demands, including the anti-blasphemy statute. Islam warned that the government would go tough if did not end its program and leave Dhaka peacefully. The bloggers launched a sit-in campaign at Dhaka's Shahbagh Square in February, demanding a ban on Bangladesh's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami.
