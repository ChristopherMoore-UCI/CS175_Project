After the show, I take P'Trique backstage through a crush of editors and retailers to meet the man himself: designer Carlos Miele. Derek Blasberg, editor-at-large at Harper's Bazaar, even had a cameo in "S**t Fashion Girls Say at New York Fashion Week." Once we're inside, it instantly becomes clear that P'Trique has a fan club in the land of the double kiss: Fern Mallis, Carlos Souza, Ken Downing -- big names in fashion, bowing to the man in the pink vintage dress. He's Patrick Pope, a Los Angeles-based Web producer who moonlights as P'Trique, the star of the viral videos, "S**t Fashion Girls Say." P'Trique has come to New York Fashion Week, at CNN's invitation, to spend the day with me at the Tents.
