Koepp shifts backward and forward in time when it suits him, but altogether too much of the romantic sparring takes place on the hands-free as Wilee and Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) hurtle in different directions. Wilee takes his handle from the Coyote, but he's got more in common with Road Runner, zipping through the city's canyons, slaloming around cabs and pedestrians, oblivious to red lights and traffic regulations. The Coyote role -- one Robert Monday -- falls to Hollywood's current go-to crazy, Michael Shannon ("Take Shelter," "Boardwalk Empire"), who sucks up all the juiciest dialogue as a guy with impulse control issues. "Premium Rush" is loaded with on-road action, scarcely pausing for breath as courier Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) -- For some reason, moviemakers haven't been falling over themselves to glorify the exciting and heroic lives of bike messengers -- which at least leaves director David Koepp with a clear field.
