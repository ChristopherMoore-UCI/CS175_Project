A posting on the website Pastebin said that Stratfor subscriber data, including information on 4,000 credit cards and the company's "private client" list, had been released. -- Stratfor, a global intelligence company, has been hacked but it was unclear Monday whether the breach and apparent release of credit card information was the work of the activist hacking group Anonymous. "Stratfor is an open-source intelligence agency, publishing daily reports on data collected from the open Internet," the posting said. " "The leaked client list represents subscribers to a daily publication which is the primary service of Stratfor," it continued. "We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained."
