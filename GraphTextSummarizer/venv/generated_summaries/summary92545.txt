The vast majority of Wyoming's gray wolves live in the northwest section of the state, where the animals will be managed by state wardens as "trophy game" year-round, federal officials said. Wyoming officials must ensure population levels of at least 150 wolves and 15 breeding pairs, and the federal wildlife service will monitor the species in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho for at least five years to ensure the animal's recovery, officials said. Wyoming officials will regulate the timing, methods and numbers of gray wolves taken through regulated hunting. Wolves found to be preying on livestock also may be controlled, federal officials said. Wyoming wildlife chief Brian Nesvik said, "We are taking a conservative approach to wolf hunting seasons during this time of transition from federal to state management.
