-- Greece is set to impose further austerity measures and a number of privatization plans in return for more international aid to avoid defaulting on its debt. The additional measures come at a time when daily strikes and demonstrations are being held across Greece against existing plans. Thousands of people were in their tenth day of protest Friday at Athens' main square and there have been several outpourings of anger in recent days against ruling politicians by angry crowds. The move comes after a 110 billion euro European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund bailout last year has failed to cover the country's needs. Greece's creditors are were expected Friday to announce a decision on the release of that money.
