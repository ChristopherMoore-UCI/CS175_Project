The incident started Friday night when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. Friday's death of Tony Robinson, an unarmed biracial 19-year-old, has made Madison the latest epicenter of protests of black males killed by white officers. For the second time in his career, Madison, Wisconsin, police Officer Matt Kenny is being investigated for using lethal force. Because Robinson did not have a weapon, his death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. When Kenny went to the apartment where the report came from, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said.
