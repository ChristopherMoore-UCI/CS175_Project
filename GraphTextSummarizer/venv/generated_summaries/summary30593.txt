The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. "There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks," Ngai told local media. " "We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks," Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. Nestled in a tranquil hillside, Hong Kong's newest Buddhist monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world's second tallest statue of the Goddess of Mercy -- a Buddhist deity. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery.
