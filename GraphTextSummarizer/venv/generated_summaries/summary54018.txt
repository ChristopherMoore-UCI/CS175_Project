" Federal law currently doesn't offer any standard for companies to notify customers following breaches, though some states have notification laws. One well-regarded report on data breaches produced by Verizon says there were 621 confirmed breaches in 2012, and that many breaches go unreported. Holder's proposal in some ways contrasts with how law enforcement has dealt with past breaches. It would enable law enforcement to better investigate these crimes -- and hold compromised entities accountable when they fail to keep sensitive information safe. Holder says the breach at Target and another retailer Neiman Marcus around Christmastime last year shows the need for better tools for law enforcement.
