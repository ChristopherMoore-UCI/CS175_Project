-- Vaccine manufacturing giant Sanofi Pasteur opened its doors to the media Wednesday, inviting reporters to a first-of-its-kind, up-close look at its H1N1 flu vaccine production facility. "These are extremely important data," said Wayne Pisano, president and CEO of Sanofi Pasteur, "because they once again make clear not only the immunogenicity of Influenza A [H1N1] 2009 Monovalent Vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, but also the fact that this vaccine has a safety profile similar to that observed with seasonal influenza vaccine in all age groups studied." While no cameras were allowed inside the production facility during the tour, journalists were taken through the bulk influenza vaccine manufacturing facility, where the virus is injected into eggs to produce vaccine; the quality contol and sterility lab, where safety testing is done; and the formulation and filling facility, where single dose syringes and multidose vials are filled. By the end of this week, Sanofi will have shipped 20 million doses of H1N1 vaccine, according to the company. Sanofi also will deliver 50 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine before the end of the month, the company said.
