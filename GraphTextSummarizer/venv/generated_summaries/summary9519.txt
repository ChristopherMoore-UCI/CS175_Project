" Servetas had been anxiously awaiting a Supreme Court decision even as she planned her wedding six weeks ago, after Brazil removed barriers to gay marriage in May. She picked out a vintage-style cream-colored dress, and Amaral chose Ralph Lauren velvet pants. Even if Servetas had married Amaral in Washington, D.C., or one of 12 states that allow same-sex marriage, she was barred from sponsoring her wife for immigration purposes because of DOMA. After that, she will sponsor Amaral for a green card -- under U.S. law, her marriage in Brazil will be recognized as legal. The company is struggling and Servetas misses everything about America. On Wednesday, Servetas took the first steps back to America.
