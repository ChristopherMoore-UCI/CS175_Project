Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, recently analyzed data from more than 91,000 children to determine whether children born outside the United States were as likely as American children to develop allergies. That was true for all types of allergies, including food allergies, although the association was strongest for asthma. When food allergies are a weapon for bullies Silverberg and his colleagues started the study after realizing they were seeing foreign-born children at their practice developing allergies much later in life. Her research team at Henry Ford Hospital was the first to show that having a pet in the house during your child's first year of life may protect him or her from developing allergies -- a finding that's since been duplicated in other studies. But in the past researchers have focused on allergens in the air, Silverberg said, such as pollen or ragweed, instead of other environmental exposures.
