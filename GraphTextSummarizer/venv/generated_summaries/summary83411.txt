Comets are considered frozen relics of the formation of the solar system and examining comets provides us with an insight into the conditions and composition of that time. We have been to comets before with spacecraft, observed them for centuries from the ground, but for the first time with Rosetta, we will "live" alongside a comet for over a year, sniffing and tasting it, scratching it with the lander, seeing how it is made up and how it evolves in time with its interaction with energy of the Sun. Comets preserve the first solids, including ices, formed in the solar system, so the Rosetta measurements will tell us a whole lot about how the solar system formed. Claudia Alexander, project scientist, U.S. Rosetta Project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA: Rosetta is an attempt to explore not only an object (comets) that we don't yet fully understand, but also reach backwards in time, like a detective, to piece together more about our origins. Understand comets, and we have a shot at understanding the genesis of life itself -- and for me there is no bigger or more exciting theme than that.
