The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy and research organization, says in a new report released to CNN that liquid formula from the nation's top baby formula makers is sold in cans lined with bisphenol-A, or BPA. While parents don't have definitive answers, they do have choices, including powdered formula or liquid formula not packaged in cans, and BPA-free baby bottles. "We're talking about millions of babies exposed every year to this toxic chemical that's found in infant formula." While the FDA acknowledges it is actively reviewing safety data on BPA, it sees no reason to ban it or restrict its use in formula cans. BPA is a fairly ubiquitous chemical used in polycarbonate plastic products, including baby bottles and metal can coatings.
