Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, has not been seen publicly since he was pushed from office by the military on July 3 after mass protests over his leadership and suspended the constitution. The Obama administration will not make a formal determination as to whether the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy by the military was a coup, a senior administration official told CNN's Jill Dougherty on Thursday. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the head of Egypt's military, has called for mass demonstrations Friday to support the country's armed forces. There has been growing concern about among world leaders about the increase in violence since Morsy's ouster. The news, first reported by The Associated Press, came as Egypt braced for rival rallies set for Friday by Morsy's supporters and those who backed his ouster by the military.
