"The Florida State University community is extremely saddened by the shootings that took place early this morning at Strozier Library, in the very heart of campus, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of all those who have been affected," University President John Thrasher said. As the incident unfolded, anxious students sent tweets and text messages to loved ones. 'It was very scary' Graduate student Alex Lauren said students were escorted from the library to the first floor of a nearby building, where they continued hearing gunshots. "The library was packed," said Mary Coburn, the vice president of student affairs. All three are students.
