" Obama confronts Iran, Syria at U.N. Obama also offered world leaders details about U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed this month when a mob overtook the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya. President Obama on Tuesday stressed that's how the United States prefers to solve some of the world's most complicated issues, particularly those in the Arab world. Hope and optimism That statement echoed a theme running through Obama's United Nations speech: hope. Within hours of that claim, Obama took the podium at the annual gathering of U.N. member nations and discussed the threat of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. Obama tried to drive that home not only at the U.N. but at an afternoon Clinton Global Initiative event, also in New York, where he spoke about ending human trafficking.
