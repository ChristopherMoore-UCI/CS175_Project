Panda fever The birth of Yuan Zai, which means both "child of Yuan Yuan" and "rice ball," sparked panda fever on Taiwan. -- A chorus of "oohs," "ahs" and "I want ones" sounded from Taiwan Monday as the first giant panda to be born on the island, the six-month-old cub Yuan Zai, was unveiled to the public at Taipei Zoo. The cub's mother, Yuan Yuan, and her mate, Tuan Tuan, were given to Taiwan by China in 2008. Around 10,000 people lined up to see Yuan Zai Monday, the zoo said, some arriving hours before opening time. Yuan Zai is expected to generate NT$500 million ($16.6 million) through commercial opportunities within the next six months, the Taipei City government said.
