-- Russian election authorities officially registered Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Monday as a candidate for president in next year's election, they announced on their website. " Tens of thousands turned out to protest the election results that returned Putin's United Russia party to power, but with a smaller majority. Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted "Putin out." Russia's third-richest man, the billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, announced this month that he will run against Putin for president. Putin will represent his United Russia party, the Central Election Commission said.
