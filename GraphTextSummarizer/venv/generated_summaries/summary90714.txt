If there isn't a participating cab company in the area, Taxi Magic will give you phone numbers for local companies so you can call and arrange for a cab yourself. There are some excellent apps out there that allow you to check flight status, see the standby list, book flights and even check in. Some airlines have better apps than others. Your airline app Apps will store a mobile boarding pass so you can just flash your phone to get on the airplane (not in all airports, but it's getting there).
