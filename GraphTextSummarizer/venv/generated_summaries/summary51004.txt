A hearing on the finances of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will be held Thursday in connection with a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of the man he is accused of killing, according to court documents. Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of Lloyd, 27, a Boston area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend. The lawsuit, filed Monday in a Massachusetts state court, claims Hernandez "maliciously, willfully, wantonly, recklessly or by gross negligence" caused the death of Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors told CNN that Hernandez allegedly planned and carried out the slaying: Lloyd was shot five times with a semi-automatic .45-caliber handgun. A witness that sources have described as Hernandez's "muscle man" said he was with the ex-Patriot the night of a 2012 Boston double homicide.
