"Using vintage yachts is completely different to modern sailing - it's not all about performance and technology," said Angelo Bonati, chief executive of sponsors Panerai, who also spent three years and more than $3.8 million restoring a 1930s boat which will race this week. However, this year will also be an emotional event, with the death of Cannes Yacht Club president Jean-Claude Montesinos earlier this month. Also setting sail will be the 1930 Shamrock V. Originally owned by legendary English tea magnate Thomas Lipton, it was the fifth and final yacht he fielded in the America's Cup -- without success. "There are 100 of these boats at Cannes, and there are not much more than 300 of them in the world," said Celine Castellanet, organizer at the Cannes Yacht Club which helps run the regatta. "When they're launched they take a long time to stop and turn around." "Unlike modern yachts, they don't have hydraulics, so sometimes it takes 10 guys pulling on the same rope."
