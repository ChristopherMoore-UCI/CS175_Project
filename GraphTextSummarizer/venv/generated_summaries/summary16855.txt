-- A day after a report documented that many New Jersey homeowners hit hard by Superstorm Sandy were wrongly denied aid, the state announced that it will reopen the appeals process for those "initially deemed ineligible" for funding. We were just shocked by the sheer magnitude of it." Superstorm Sandy caused major devastation throughout New Jersey and neighboring states when it struck the U.S. mainland in late October 2012. At the same time, the U.S. Attorney's Office is investigating claims from Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that members of the Christie administration linked Sandy recovery funds to her approval of a real estate development project in her city. Of the 1,033 who appealed the denial, 788 -- or 79% --- were told they were, in fact, eligible for recovery funds A similar percentage of residents who were denied up to $10,000 to cover non-rebuilding costs also had their rejections overturned in the appeals process. The Fair Share Housing Center report came at a critical point in the recovery effort in New Jersey.
