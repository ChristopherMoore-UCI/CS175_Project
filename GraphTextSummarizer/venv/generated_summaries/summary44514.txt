Long-standing tensions between the predominant Bodo tribes people and minority migrant Muslim settlers erupted into bloodshed nearly a week ago and has largely gripped the province's Kokrajhar district, which borders on neighboring Bhutan to India's north, said Assam police chief J.N. Chaudhury. Angry mobs disrupted rail service by attacking train cars with bricks and sitting on tracks, bringing service to a standstill. Five of those killed died when police fired on mobs engaging in rioting and arson, according to Chaudhury, who said that the district had witnessed similar fighting in the 1990s and the early 2000s. "We are not originating any new trains until we have clearance from the state authorities," he said, adding that train service was being gradually restored as security personnel moved in. India is known for its diverse mixture of cultures, religions and ethnic backgrounds, which at times has led to conflict between groups.
