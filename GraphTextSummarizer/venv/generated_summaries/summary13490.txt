-- Babette Beatty laughs when asked whether she's seen the cover of this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Kind of like the woman on the cover of the January 20, 1964, issue of Sports Illustrated, a photo that launched an institution. Sports Illustrated never told Beatty that she was on the cover. She had been featured in the Paris collections and on the cover of Elle and other fashion magazines. Beatty remembers staying in what could be described as a less-than-five-star hotel, flying to shoots in the morning and then partying late with members of the Mexican air force.
