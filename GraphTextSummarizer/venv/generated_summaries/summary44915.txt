"I think Georgia surpassed expectations in this year's World Cup," Alex Payne, a Sky Sports broadcaster who regularly covers rugby, told CNN. Canada were thrashed 79-15 by host nation and tournament favorites New Zealand in their final match and Rees believes if the Canucks want to improve on the international stage, they need to re-evaluate their structure, beginning with a bigger pool of players to choose from. Eye on the Eagles The U.S. Eagles have participated in each World Cup since 1987 (except 1995, when they did not qualify), but going into this year's Cup, they had only ever won only two matches, both against Japan. "When that flag is waving and the anthem plays before the game, if that doesn't get you going, you need to see a cardiologist," former Eagles player and coach Jack Clark told CNN. Just 11 days later, they beat Namibia 30-0 to record their first World Cup success.
