Police mismanaged a shootout connected to the deaths of four Oakland, California, police officers last March, making a series of poor decisions that might have contributed to the record death toll, an independent board says. But the building was not "formally scouted; no effort was made to ascertain the status of apartment building residents, the apartment building's interior configurations, as well as individual apartment floor plans," the report says. The board this week released a sometimes scathing report that paints a vivid picture of the chaos that descended on an east Oakland street on March 21 after a convicted felon opened fire on officers during a traffic stop. â€¢ Police leadership violated policy by assembling a SWAT team from officers on scene instead of waiting for the official special weapons and tactics team to arrive. But the report's most severe criticism focuses on how Oakland police handled the surge of 115 police cars that rushed to the scene after the traffic stop.
