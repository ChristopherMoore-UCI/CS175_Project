-- Serena Williams slammed Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev for his "insensitive, sexist and racist" remarks in describing her and sister Venus as the "Williams brothers" on a late night TV chat show. On the men's ATP Tour, the race to secure a place in its eight-man Tour Finals in London next month is hotting up. Williams, who won the U.S. Open title last month, added: "I thought they were in a way bullying. " Tarpischev, who has been banned by the WTA for a year and fined $25,000, has also made a public apology, but that has clearly not satisfied 18-time grand slam champion Williams. Tarpischev is chairman of the annual event in the Russian capital Moscow, and after his remarks about the Williams sisters, the WTA is demanding he stands down from that position.
