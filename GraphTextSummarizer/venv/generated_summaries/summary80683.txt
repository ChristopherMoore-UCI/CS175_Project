The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman. -- Former football star O.J. Simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced late Sunday. " Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict. "Whether the property belonged to Mr. Simpson or not is still in debate," Nichols said. Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches.
