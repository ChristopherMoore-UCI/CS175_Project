A very good friend of mine has his own comic book company, and for years, he's been telling me about John Constantine being his favorite comic book character and "Hellblazer" his favorite book. It's based on the story of cult character John Constantine, the chain-smoking exorcist antihero from the "Hellblazer" comic books. I'm fortunate enough to have as my partner David Goyer, who has brought comic books to life in films. " CNN visited the Atlanta set of "Constantine" and spoke with Constantine himself, Matt Ryan, as well as his co-star Charlie Halford (who plays one of John's sidekicks, Chas), and later spoke to executive producer Daniel Cerone. Cerone: It's a little bit easier for us, since we're not a show about superheroes, and John Constantine doesn't have superpowers.
