On July 5, trucks carrying supplies to NATO troops crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the first time in seven months, officials said. Pakistan reopened routes into Afghanistan a month ago after closing it to NATO traffic in anger at the killing of 24 Pakistani troops by coalition forces. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants have to be trucked in from Pakistan. -- Militants killed a driver of a container truck carrying supplies for NATO in Pakistan's tribal region on Monday, a government official told CNN. The Pakistani Taliban threatened to attack NATO trucks when the border reopened, saying the supplies are used to target its members fighting against occupation in Afghanistan.
