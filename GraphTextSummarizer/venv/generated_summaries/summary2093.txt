We know this because, once again, the Democrats are out in force with voices raised, full of outrage, trying to convince women that new laws are needed to ensure that they receive equal pay for equal work. However, much of the research on women voters in recent years supports the notion that women believe that men get paid more for the same job than women do. Equal pay for equal work. Never mind that the Ledbetter Act had little to do with the premise of equal pay for equal work and everything to do with the time limit for trial lawyers looking to exploit a potential claim. First, every Republican should affirm, without hesitation, support for the concept of equal pay for equal work.
