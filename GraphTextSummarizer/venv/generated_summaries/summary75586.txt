Iran warned the United States on Tuesday not to return a U.S. aircraft carrier group "to the Persian Gulf region. After Tuesday's warning from Iran, a Pentagon spokesman issued a statement saying "deployment of U.S. military assets in the Persian Gulf region will continue as it has for decades. Vahidi said a number of observers from other countries had been present during Iran's recent military exercises in and around the strait, and suggested that Iran could hold joint maneuvers with neighboring countries, Fars said. The commander spoke at the Port of Chabahar in southern Iran, as forces held a military parade the day after Iran ended naval drills in the region, IRNA reported. His statement is the latest rhetoric stemming from Iran's threat last week to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz.
