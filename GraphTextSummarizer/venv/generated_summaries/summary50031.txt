Hours later, President Barack Obama signed into a law a bill that temporarily -- from June 30 through July 6 -- assures there will be continued funding for certain transportation projects and halts potential student loan interest rate hikes, according to a news release issued by the White House shortly after 8 p.m. Friday. -- Congress gave final approval Friday to a giant transportation funding bill as part of a package that includes a measure holding down interest rates on federal student loans. The deal would also limit how long undergraduate students can go to school without accruing interest on student loans to six years. A White House statement said the legislation prevents middle-class families from getting hurt by congressional inaction on extending transportation funding and preventing the federal student loan rate from doubling. The transportation bill funds construction for highways, bridges and other transportation projects for two years in every state and congressional district in the nation.
