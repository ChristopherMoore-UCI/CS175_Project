The scandal is of particular interest to the kink community, who say it raises two common topics of concern in their world: discrimination over sexual activity, and the gray area between consensual activity and assault in BDSM. Two major issues reside at the heart of the scandal: a $55 million lawsuit against the CBC in which Ghomeshi alleges that he was fired for his sexual proclivities, and anonymous allegations reported by the Toronto Star from three women accusing Ghomeshi of sexual violence and nonconsensual BDSM activity. In his Facebook post, Ghomeshi says he has always been interested in a variety of sexual activities but only those that "are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners." But consent to rough sexual activity that does not cause serious bodily harm is not assault, she said. By bringing BDSM into the mix through his Facebook post, Ghomeshi ignited conversation in legal circles and the kink community over whether the "kinky defense" will prevail in his lawsuit and the court of public opinion.
