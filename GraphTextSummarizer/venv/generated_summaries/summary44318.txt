Western powers accuse Russia of sending troops and equipment to help separatists in eastern Ukraine in their fight against Ukrainian government forces. 'A new low in relations' To pressure Russia over the situation Ukraine, the United States and Europe have imposed sanctions targeting Russian citizens, officials and industries. As well as the conflict in eastern Ukraine -- which has killed more than 4,000 people since April, according to the United Nations -- Russia and the West are also in dispute over Moscow's seizure of the Crimea Peninsula from Ukraine. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who was visiting Kiev on Friday, said he discussed "the threat to Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity posed by Russian aggression" in his conversations with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Lavrov's comments Saturday represent "a new low in relations," according to Russia expert Ben Judah.
