Read related: New fashions inspired by New Delhi Sarojini Nagar Market A pilgrimage site for bargain-hunting fashionistas, the Sarojini Nagar Market stocks all the latest couture designs before they hit European and American boutiques with eye-popping mark-ups. If the rag-tag pandemonium of New Delhi's more traditional bazaars and market stalls is taking its toll, or you hanker for the sight of some familiar shops, then the row of upscale designer boutiques, cosmetic outlets and chain stores in Khan Market will be just the ticket. With a preponderance of market stalls, bazaars, shopping malls and street vendors, New Delhi is a consumer paradise, lending a much-needed retail counterpoint to all that earnest sightseeing. For instance, head to Himachal for blankets and shawls; Tamil Nadu for sandalwood products; Uttar Pradesh Emporium for the incredible stone-inlay work popularized by the Taj, as well as copper, brasswork and leather items; Kashmir Emporium is the place for carpets; and Orissa for fabrics and traditional paintings. -- New Delhi strains under the weight of its own UNESCO World Heritage sites.
