When it comes to cell phones and safety, the majority of problems have involved phone batteries that burst or catch fire under heat or pressure, he said. "We have seen very few incidents related to shock or electrocution (involving cell phones)," said Scott Wolfson, communications director for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Wolfson said American consumers have reported a few isolated cases of phones smoking or catching fire while recharging. Some knockoff chargers don't have proper insulation, potentially exposing users to overheating, fire or electric shock. It's not clear what kind of charger Ma was using, although her sister said she had bought her phone in December at an official Apple store and was using the original charger to recharge the device when the incident occurred, according to a post on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site that is similar to Twitter.
