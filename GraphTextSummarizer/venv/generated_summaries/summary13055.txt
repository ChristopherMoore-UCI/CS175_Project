But there's a chance Bergdahl might not know much about Taliban commanders. An Afghan Taliban commander not authorized to speak to the media confirmed to CNN that Bergdahl was captured by insurgents with links to the Haqqani network in Pakistan. Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN Monday that administration officials didn't notify Congress in advance because they faced an "urgent situation" with deep concerns about Bergdahl's health. "The recovery and reintegration of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress," Bob Bergdahl told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. Bergdahl was believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, which is affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda.
