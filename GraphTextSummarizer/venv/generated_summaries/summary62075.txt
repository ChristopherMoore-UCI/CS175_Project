"We anticipate identifying other suspects and other victims." Scott Rosen, 54, told CNN two of the suspects paired up when they worked the scam on him. -- South Florida authorities are asking for the public's help to find a group of "foxy thieves" they say are drugging men they pick up at high-end bars and stealing tens of thousands of dollars in cash, jewelry, guns and other valuables. This is what Subhanna Beyah, 25, Johnnina Miller, 25, Keshia Clark, 27 and Ryan Elkins, 23, have allegedly been doing for the past few months in upscale bars in South Florida. "They're attractive women that go into a bar and they have a scam and they work it again and again," said Dani Moschella, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. The Broward County Sheriff's Office released photos of the four suspects, all in their 20s, and have attained arrest warrants for them.
