If you want to start your own project, the site provides tool kits you can use to help teach your friends, families and neighbors topics ranging from disaster preparedness to well being. As the official MLK National Day of Service, the nation is called to remember his legacy through service and social leadership. The Corporation for National and Community Service, the body charged with leading the day of service, also has tools to find and start projects for the day of service. In so many ways, the day will be a living testament to the dream of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who would have been 84 years old on January 15. Just as King believed we all can make a difference to end discrimination, he believed everyone had the power to uplift society through service.
