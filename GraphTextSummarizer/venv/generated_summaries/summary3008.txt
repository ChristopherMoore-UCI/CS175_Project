He rose to lead the group's informal spy network of "hawks" in northern Mexico, and most recently was in charge of cartel operations in southern Mexico, the ministry said. -- One of Mexico's most-wanted fugitives, an original member of the violent Zetas drug cartel, has been arrested in southern Mexico, officials said Tuesday. The Zetas is one of Mexico's major drug trafficking organizations, which are involved in various turf wars throughout the country that have resulted in thousands of violent killings. Flavio Mendez Santiago, alias "El Amarillo," was arrested Monday in a federal police operation in a town north of Oaxaca, Mexico, Mexico's public security ministry said. Arrest warrants were out for Mendez in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and the federal district where Mexico City sits.
