Those who are familiar with China's post-1949 history also won't miss the irony that the Communist government is marketing Confucius as the icon of Chinese culture. In the end, the key to China's soft power hinges on modernizing Chinese culture instead of marketing its ancient heritage. The elements of Chinese soft power frequently cited by foreigners when asked about their views of China include the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, pandas, Kung Fu, and the Peking Opera. While Confucianism has much to say about nearly every aspect of Chinese society, it does not advocate aggressively spreading Chinese culture outside the Middle Kingdom. What China really lacks is not culture per se, but modern culture that can easily resonate with people around the world Instead of promoting the controversial Confucius Institutes that are interpreted by some as a sign of cultural colonialism by a rising China, the Chinese government would be better off attracting foreigners to China through scholarships, research grants, and cultural products.
