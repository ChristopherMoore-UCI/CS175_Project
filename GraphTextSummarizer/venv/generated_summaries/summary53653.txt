"These names have gone, the Pan Ams and the British Caledonian and others, but of course their businesses went into other businesses, and that tells us that consolidation is the way forward in this industry," Tony Tyler, CEO of International Air Transport Association (IATA), told CNN's Richard Quest at the group's 70th AGM in Doha, Qatar. Pan American World Airways was one of the first to blaze a trail across the Atlantic with its spacious cabins, ladies-only powder rooms and modest overhead lights. Since the birth of commercial aviation the airline industry has been characterized by the concept of risk versus reward, with some of the best-known names failing, many merging and consolidating along the way. With 8 million passengers taking a plane each day, the 3 billion journeys made last year are more than just a flight for many. After its recent bankruptcy, it was the last major U.S. carrier to merge, with U.S. Airways.
