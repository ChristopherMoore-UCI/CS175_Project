The gunman used Tuff as a conduit to relay information to police, which in this case meant McCray, who took Tuff's call at the dispatch center. In the next breath, Tuff asked him, "And what else sir?" The suspect darted from the office to outside a few times, becoming particularly "agitated" in Tuff's words when police fired back with bullets "coming from everywhere. The scariest moment, Tuff said, came when -- after having fired shots, several times, at police positioned outside -- the suspect went into his bag, reloaded his gun and packed his pants and jacket pockets with yet more bullets. The man with the rifle eventually let it be known, via Tuff, that he was no longer threatening to shoot any police officers who approached; by then, he was communicating with them about where he should put his gun, where he should get down on the ground in surrender, and how police would come and get him. Thankfully, she had a "true hero" partner in Tuff who, with her clear descriptions and calm demeanor, made it so the call-taker and thus police could very easily "visualize what she was seeing and what she was going through."
