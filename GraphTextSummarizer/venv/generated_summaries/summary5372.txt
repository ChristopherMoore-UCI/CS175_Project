" 'Politics of food' In Cairo, Italian photographer Sandro Maddalena visited the trash piles of the Egyptian capital's Garbage City -- a slum settlement where mainly Coptic Christians subsist by recycling refuse. This atmospheric moment, captured in a village in Vietnam by British photographer Tessa Bunney, was awarded the prize for best food photography this week in a competition that attracted more than 6,000 images from around the world. -- A woman, her face a mask of concentration, hefts a huge sheet of translucent dough into the air as sunlight and steam fill the air. His image, which shows dirt-blackened pigs in a sty surrounded by garbage, was presented a "politics of food" award for showing the realities of food production. Another, by Jonathan Gregson, showed steam rising as a worker roasts coffee beans in Rwanda -- a photograph you can almost smell as well as see.
