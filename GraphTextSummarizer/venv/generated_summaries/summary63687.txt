In response to Reader's comments, Miller said that all players were treated "equally and fairly." "Mr. Troicki was afforded, and took, the opportunity to provide evidence to the Independent tribunal and the Court of Arbitration for Sport, both of which concluded that he had committed an anti-doping rule violation," said MIller in an emailed statement sent to CNN. Gorodilova denied that claim but when the Court of Arbitration for Sport -- Troicki appealed his original 18-month ban from the ITF -- issued its irrevocable verdict in November, it stated: "The CAS panel considered that the DCO should have informed the player in clearer terms of the risks caused by his refusal to undergo a blood test but that, despite the misunderstanding between the player and the DCO, there was no suggestion that Mr. Troicki intended to evade the detection of a banned substance in his system. "Honestly, it's been a tough year," Troicki told CNN in a telephone interview. He went back to school, studying sports management at Alfa University in Belgrade, and Reader said the rest Troicki's body received should add a "couple of years" to his career. Troicki's suspension came with at least one positive.
