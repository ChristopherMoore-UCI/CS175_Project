This year, the Justice Department also put out a report on U.S. efforts to combat trafficking efforts at home. The blacklisted countries are subject to U.S. sanctions if they don't make greater efforts to fight trafficking. African countries Nigeria and Mauritius are praised in the report for making strong efforts to combat trafficking. For the first time, she said, the United States next year will rank its own efforts at combating trafficking along with the rest of the world. The report, mandated by Congress, features data and statistics from 175 countries around the world regarding the amount of human trafficking that goes on within their borders.
