Gordon Van Gelder, editor and publisher of Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine, the second-oldest continuously running science fiction magazine in the U.S., says Ellison was always far from a mainstream writer. "Harlan Ellison was very influential in the new wave era of science fiction in the late 1960s and 1970s when the genre changed from the traditional science fiction of hard science and adventure stories to writing that took up social consciousness, exploring the soft sciences of psychology and sociology and where the prose became more experimental," Peck added. -- Renowned speculative fiction writer Harlan Ellison is about to be inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, recognizing a career that has spanned more than five decades in which he's made contributions to literature, television and film. Ellison made his first sale to that magazine in 1961 and was a major contributor in the late 1960s before writing a film column for years. " Fans of the original science fiction TV classic series "Star Trek" know Ellison as the author of one of the most critically acclaimed episodes, "The City on the Edge of Forever," which featured Joan Collins.
