-- Rescuers searched frantically for survivors after a packed ferry carrying at least 250 people capsized in southern Bangladesh, killing at least 32 people, police said Tuesday. The 55-year-old survivor said he "jumped into the river and was rescued by people in another passing ferry." Dewan and his family were traveling to Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, to see his brother-in-law off to the United States. Ferry accidents are common on Bangladesh's vast river network. About 30 people were initially rescued after the ferry collided with the cargo boat on the river in Munshiganj district, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Dhaka. The water authority's chairman, Khandker Shamsuddoha Khandaker, told reporters the ferry had been traced 70 feet (more than 20 meters) under water.
