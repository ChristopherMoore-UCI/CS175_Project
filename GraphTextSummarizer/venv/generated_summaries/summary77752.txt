Sulfur -- the game changer Changes to regulations in the sulfur content of marine heavy fuels are set to make the price of bunker fuel -- typically among the heaviest and dirtiest of fuels in the distillation process -- more expensive. Shippers traditionally favored polluting residual bunker fuels because they were cheap, with large ships having the space to transport the pre-heaters necessary to make the fuel volatile. Futuristic concepts for container ships powered by alternative energy range from windmill-powered propellers to banks of vertical metal sails. After all, bunker (ship fuel oil) expenses account for the largest part of the total costs in the shipping industry," said Laura Walther, researcher at CML in Hamburg. At the moment they can wash the exhaust with scrubbers but on big ships this is very complex and very expensive.
