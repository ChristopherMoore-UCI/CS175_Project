Pelosi stands firm against ground troops before Syrian funding President Barack Obama said Wednesday the international community and a coalition of at least 40 nations will degrade and defeat the group, which is bent on forming a caliphate from Syria to Iraq, in which strict Islamic law, or Sharia, governs all aspects of life. -- The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee on Wednesday cautioned the United States against engaging with Iran in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Ahead of Kerry's testimony Menendez said he wants to hear "specifics" about the plan to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He added the country has a history of creating "sectarian divisions of Iraq" and is "is one of the patrons of (Bashar al-) Assad" and his regime in Syria. "I want to hear what success looks like [in Syria and Iraq] after fighting comes to an end," the senator said.
