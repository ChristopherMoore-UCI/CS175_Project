Hook, once again struggling with the boot, should have slotted over a three-point attempt early in the second half but it was quickly forgotten as veteran wing Shane Williams, playing in the final World Cup match of his career, produced a moment of magic in the 49th minute. The World Cup reaches a climax Sunday at the same venue, with hosts New Zealand hoping to lift the Webb Ellis trophy for the first time in 24 years when they take on France, who have never won the tournament. Wales, who have enjoyed their most successful World Cup campaign since the tournament was last held in New Zealand 24 years ago, finished with a flourish, wing Halfpenny grabbing a try on the 80-minute mark. Australia's James O'Connor, with a penalty that struck the upright, and Leigh Halfpenny missed kicking chances for their respective sides to leave it 7-3 at halftime. Two-time world champions Australia lost fullback Kurtley Beale to injury after eight minutes, but center Berrick Barnes crossed for a converted try for the Wallabies to open the scoring at Eden Park.
