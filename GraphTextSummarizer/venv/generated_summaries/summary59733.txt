The number of new Ebola cases in Liberia has been declining, but public health leaders say that there are still "little mini outbreaks" and that "until there is a very last case, (an epidemic) is not over until it is over," Fauci said. "Shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate Ebola vaccine," Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chairman of global vaccines at GSK said in a company release. In Liberia there have been 370 cases of health care workers becoming infected with Ebola, 178 of them have died according to the World Health Organization. The first people to get the vaccine will be health care workers who are some of the population that is most at risk for catching Ebola. There are other Ebola vaccines being tested by companies in the United States and in Russia.
