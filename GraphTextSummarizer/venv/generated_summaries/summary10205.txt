If you can hack the happiness molecule like I have, then I've been of service. One more suggestion: Last year I decided to end every conversation with the word "service," as in, "I am at your service." I found that individuals who release the most oxytocin -- I call them "oxytocin-adepts" -- were more satisfied with their lives compared to those who release less oxytocin. My experiments have shown dogs are better oxytocin stimulators than other pets, and better stress-reducers, too. Romantic, friendships, family, and they even shared more money with strangers in laboratory experiments.
