Since 2012 researchers have made great strides in the hunt for the so-called "God particle" at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, where scientists at the CERN particle physics laboratory are looking for particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies. As particles zoom around in this field, they interact with and attract Higgs bosons, which cluster around the particles in varying numbers. The Standard Model of particle physics lays out the basics of how elementary particles and forces interact in the universe. Certain particles will attract larger clusters of Higgs bosons -- and the more Higgs bosons a particle attracts, the greater its mass will be. The Higgs boson is part of a theory first proposed by Higgs and others in the 1960s to explain how particles obtain mass.
