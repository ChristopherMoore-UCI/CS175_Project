" Court papers say the conversations took place between September and May. Ramos and Abreu were charged with three counts of conspiracy in the second degree, and one of criminal solicitation in the second degree. Officer Jose Ramos, from the NYPD's 40th Precinct in the Bronx, was charged Thursday along with his wife, Wanda Abreu, who is accused of using Ramos' pension money to pay off a hit man. Ramos already faced numerous charges of attempted robbery, attempted grand larceny, transportation of what he believed to be drugs to drug dealers and revealing the identity of a confidential source. "He said explicitly: Go ahead, do it; but do it right away." Both Ramos and Abreu pleaded not guilty. "We're very shocked and my client denies all these charges, and we're going to fight them," Dawn Florio, Ramos' defense attorney, said Thursday.
