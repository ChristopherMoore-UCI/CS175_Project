Among the bodies to have been recovered are those of the ship's captain Alexander Ostrovsky and his wife, local officials in Tatarstan told Russian media at the site of the accident. He also promised 400,000 rubles ($14,250) to those who suffered major and moderately severe injuries, and half that sum to people with minor injuries. The ferry was built in 1955 in Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials. The bodies of two more children were recovered Wednesday from the ship, Russian authorities told CNN, bringing the number of bodies recovered to 102. Four people face charges over the sinking of the ship Sunday, which Russian media are calling the most devastating river accident in the country's history.
