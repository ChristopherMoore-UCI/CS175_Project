-- Internet giant Google has been stopped from gathering images in Greek cities for its Street View service until it provides further guarantees about privacy. Despite pledging to recognize local privacy laws, Google has come under fire from privacy campaigners who fear the application could be abused by criminals or even snooping government agencies. "Google takes privacy very seriously, and that's why we have put in place a number of features, including the blurring of faces and license plates, to ensure that Street View will respect local norms when it launches in Greece. Launched in the U.S. two years ago, Street View provides users with access to 3-D "pedestrian's-eye" views of urban areas by zooming into the lowest level on its Google Maps and Google Earth applications. A month earlier, the BBC reported that Google was forced to pull a number of images from Street View after receiving complaints about pictures that included a man entering a London sex shop, and a drunken reveler being sick at a bus stop.
