The Serbian world number one had opted to take a break following his defeat to Nadal at Roland Garros, rather than playing in Wimbledon warmup tournaments. -- Top seed Novak Djokovic began the defense of his Wimbledon title with an emphatic Centre Court victory over Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero on day one of the championships. American 11th seed John Isner, the winner of the longest ever tennis match at Wimbledon in 2010 against Nicolas Mahut, was beaten in five sets by Colombia's Alejandro Falla. Second seed and two-time champion Rafael Nadal plays his opening match against Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci on Tuesday, while home hope Andy Murray faces Russia's Nikolay Davydenko. Former finalist David Nalbandian, who was disqualified from last week's Aegon Championships final when he injured a line judge at London's Queen's Club, lost in straight sets to eighth seed Janko Tipsarevic.
