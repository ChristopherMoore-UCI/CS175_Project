Facebook thought that user popularity would translate to investor appeal and counted on its members to buy shares in the IPO. Imagine telling Facebook underwriters and founder Mark Zuckerberg: "You can either sell a lot of shares at a lower price or fewer shares at a higher price. In this respect, Facebook's weak stock value is an advantage as it can offer new hires options at prices comparable to pre-IPO rates. Unfortunately, Facebook's revenue model depends on ample screen real estate in order to please advertisers without annoying users. Put another way, companies with solid revenue models are richly rewarded while companies foolish enough to go public before proving their model are punished.
