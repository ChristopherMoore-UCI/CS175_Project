While Woods struggled, fellow American Nick Watney charged into the clubhouse lead at 12-under after a superb second round 64 in North Carolina. World number two Rory McIlroy, playing his first event since the Masters, also prospered among the morning starters, shooting a four-under 68. It left the Northern Ireland star on six-under overall and still well-placed to claim the top seven place which would see him leapfrog England's Luke Donald to top spot in the rankings. -- Tiger Wood missed the cut at Quail Hollow in his first tournament since a disappointing showing at the U.S. Masters. McIlroy won the 2010 edition with closing rounds of 66-62 after just making the cut.
