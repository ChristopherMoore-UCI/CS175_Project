If true, the collective's final act was the posting of what it said were internal company documents from AT&T along with private data from other companies. It is unclear whether LulzSec members played a role in the Sony PlayStation Network breach, where hackers broke into Sony Pictures' website, compromising the accounts of over 1 million users, and the gaming company Sega, stealing the details of nearly 1.3 million users. But it posted what it claims is proprietary information from Sony Pictures and other Sony properties' websites. In one post, the collective seemed to suggest that by making its attacks public, it'll push websites to increase security. "For the past 50 days we've been disrupting and exposing corporations, governments, often the general population itself, and quite possibly everything in between, just because we could," the group said Saturday in a statement posted on multiple websites.
