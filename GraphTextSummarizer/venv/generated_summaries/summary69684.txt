-- Chinese authorities have ended the waiting game over when political pariah Bo Xilai will face court over corruption charges. The leadership might want the issue out of the way, but Bo's punishment will send strong signals as to how serious the government is about cracking down on political corruption, some experts said. It's understandable that Xi wants to eliminate Bo Xilai, even Deng Xiaoping has removed (Communist Party chief and rival) Hua Guofeng. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Mao and former leader Deng Xiaoping. Even after Xi was formally installed as party chief last November, political bargaining continued and involved the question of how to deal with Bo Xilai.
