They just won't know whether it's missing Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa or not. " Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Genovese crime family figure Anthony Provenzano, who was also a chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey. In 2004, authorities removed floorboards from a Detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot Hoffa.
