The Nonhuman Rights Project filed three separate suits on behalf of four chimpanzees in New York state last week in a bid to secure for Tommy, Kiko, Hercules and Leo -- all male chimps held in various parts of the state -- the "right to bodily liberty." The group said it plans to file more lawsuits across the country on behalf of captive animals "who are scientifically proven to be self-aware and autonomous," such as elephants, dolphins and whales. Three New York courts have rejected one group's legal effort to grant captive chimpanzees in that state the same rights as a "legal person." "These outcomes allow the NhRP to proceed to the appellate courts,"  NhRP spokeswoman Stacey Doss told CNN. Tommy lives in a cage on a trailer lot in Gloversville, New York.
