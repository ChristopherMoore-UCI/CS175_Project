Dotcom had assets frozen and was arrested in the crackdown that included a police raid on his luxurious house near the capital, Auckland and was remanded to Mt. Eden prison. -- Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom has announced he is launching a new political party in his adopted home of New Zealand. In New Zealand, Dotcom has worked on various projects -- with politics being the latest. "When you have a family with five kids, and you're facing an indictment with potentially 80 years in prison, you're not in a good state of mind.
