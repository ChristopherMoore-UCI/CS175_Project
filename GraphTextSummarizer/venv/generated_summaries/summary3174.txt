Kinect lets users control their Xboxes, and in-game avatars, through voice commands and by moving their bodies to simulate movements in a game. "Your feedback matters to us and it shapes the products and services we build," said Xbox chief Phil Spencer in announcing the move, which suggests Microsoft heeded gamers' complaints that the Xbox One was too expensive. In a post Tuesday morning, Microsoft also announced the Xbox One and older Xbox 360 console will no longer require a Live Gold subscription, which cost $60 a year, to access streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube and HBO Go. Beginning on June 9, Microsoft will offer the Xbox One for $399 in all markets where it's sold -- a $100 price cut from the bundled version with Kinect. If customers buy an Xbox One for $399 and later decide they want Kinect, Microsoft said a standalone Kinect sensor will become available for sale this fall.
