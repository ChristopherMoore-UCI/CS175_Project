Some black and Hispanic children said white club members made racist comments to them during that visit, asking why black children were there and raising concerns that "they might steal from us." Some kids from the Creative Steps Day Care center say club members made racist remarks. The club canceled contracts with two other day care centers because of safety and crowding, swim club director John Duesler said. Other group members sent negative e-mails to club board members after the incident. It notes that the swim club maintains that it canceled its relationship with the day care center because members were requesting that their membership fees be refunded and because of safety concerns "attendant with overcrowding of the shallow end of the pool by a large number of non-swimmers."
