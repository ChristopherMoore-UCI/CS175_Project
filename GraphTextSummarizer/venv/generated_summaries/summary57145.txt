Classy and elegant, Rugamba's label House of Tayo combines bold African patterns and textures with western accessories to produce wax-print bow ties, colorful pocket squares and infinite scarfs for "Afro-dandies" in Rwanda and beyond. MR: I think it's not necessarily Rwanda alone because I also lived in a couple of African countries, but I feel like general use of color, variation and also the presentation. We sat down with sartorially chic Rugamba to chat all things dandy: how to get the look; African influences; style icons and who he'd most like to see don his designs. There's a special collection of bow ties I'm making right now and what will happen, the box will have a QR code and when you scan the QR code you can see your bow tie being made. Also the fact that its made in Rwanda and I'm using bits and pieces that are sourced locally.
