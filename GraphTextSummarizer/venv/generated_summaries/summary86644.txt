A few meters away from the long cookie line, old ladies hold up paper signs advertising the cookies for sale. Instead, people are going crazy for tins of butter cookies. The tiny shop, located in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's main shopping districts, is swarming with people handing over wads of cash for the "little bear cookies" as they are known across Asia. Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying 'fake' Jenny's cookies. Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny's cookies -- at $9 a tin.
