" Manson was 28 when she burst out of the Madison, Wisconsin, music scene in 1995 with guitarist Steve Marker, bassist Duke Erikson and drummer Butch Vig. As the man who produced the Smashing Pumpkins' "Gish" and Nirvana's "Nevermind," Vig may have had the name, but it was Manson who became the face of Garbage: a flame-haired Scottish vixen who prowled the stage in boots and a minidress, taking "Stupid Girls" to task and pouting that she's "Only Happy When it Rains. " The group's subversive wit and sonic collision of pop, alternative rock and electronica placed them squarely outside the mainstream, yet it was the mainstream that embraced them. "I think we've come to the realization that it's OK to be a bit odd," said Manson. It's just unfortunately all the issues that we had culminated whilst we were touring," Manson recalled.
