-- Roughly 700 students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, will be given a powerful antibiotic to guard against meningitis after coming in contact with four people diagnosed with meningococcal disease, county health officials said Tuesday. On the opposite U.S. coast, Princeton announced last week that it would make an unlicensed vaccine for meningitis B available to undergraduate students, as well as graduate students living in dorms or the Graduate College and annexes, and other university community members with particular medical conditions. "The CDC is the lead on the vaccine issue," Klein-Rothschild said Tuesday. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis "should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly," according to the CDC. The first three cases were confirmed to be caused by type B bacteria, which is the same bacteria strain causing an outbreak of meningitis at Princeton University.
