" Black hole fears are "baloney" Fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole Earth. In the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. Although physicists acknowledge that the collider could, in theory, create small black holes, they say they do not pose any risk. Such fears prompted legal actions in the U.S. and Europe to halt the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge. Five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told CNN there would be no danger from potential black holes.
