Cosby and Constand's lawyers said in Monday that Schmitt's earlier statement "was not intended to refer in any way to Andrea Constand." "As previously reported, differences between Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago," the lawyers said in a joint statement. NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just "shaking his head no." "There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives," Cosby's lawyer said Sunday. "Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced," John P. Schmitt, the lawyer, said in a statement Sunday. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment." "Neither Mr. Cosby nor Ms. Constand intends to comment further on the matter.
