In a statement the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) urged developed nations to establish training programs that would allow African research students to stay in Africa or study in other developing countries. Students from around the world participate in the program, with roughly 40 percent of students based in countries in Africa and a good proportion in Southeast Asia, said Sharon Huttly, the dean of studies. The Gates Award for Global Health, which is awarded annually to an organization that makes exceptional contributions to international health, will be used partly to developing new courses, providing scholarships and offering support for distance learning students. Distance education is by no means novel, but instructors say the London School program is particularly enhanced for students in the developing world and unique in its international audience. "When I speak to distance learning students, many of them say this has opened up an opportunity that otherwise wouldn't have come to them -- to stay in their own countries and at the same time access teaching materials of an international quality," he said.
