Bobo's brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading Bobo away from their home in Darden in April 2011. Austin's role in the case, according to attorney Luke Evans, was to cooperate with authorities in exchange for immunity from prosecution. But shortly afterward, the TBI resumed its work on the Bobo case after the district attorney took himself off the case and appointed a special prosecutor to handle it, according to The Jackson Sun. Days after Austin was granted immunity in March 2014, the state tried to void the deal and tried at least twice to indict Austin, his attorney said. In a statement, the agency said that the district attorney accused the TBI of misconduct, along with other law enforcement agencies.
