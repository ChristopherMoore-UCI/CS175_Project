After performing the high-energy songs "End of Time" and "Baby Boy," the latter of which got special effects treatment, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams popped onto the stage to join their former groupmate. Beyonce released that song as a solo artist, but Rowland and Williams joined in on Sunday's show. The best (and the worst) halftime shows in Super Bowl history Beyonce took back the reins from there, closing out with a performance of "Halo." "Everybody, I want to feel your energy," Beyonce said as she asked fans to keep waving their hands in the air, many of whom were equipped with blue lights. That left some questioning whether she'd do the same in New Orleans on Sunday, but Beyonce clarified that she would "absolutely" sing live during the game, something that seemed evident as she soared through a decade-plus of hits.
