The conservative instincts in much of Turkish society, such as an excessive respect for authority at the expense of individual rights, provide fertile ground for Islamic groups to flourish and for conspiracy theories to take hold. With elections scheduled for August, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan needs this year to be better than the last. They come ahead of local elections in March, followed by presidential elections in August in which Erdogan plans to run. Whatever the outcome of the ongoing saga, the seeds of division have been implanted in the informal Islamic coalition between Erdogan supporters and the Gulenists. Gulen, on the other hand, is an Anatolian group rooted in Turkish nationalism and focused on social and religious activities.
