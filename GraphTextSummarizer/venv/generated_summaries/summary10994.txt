" Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters, and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. Nicholson recounted for jurors Tuesday the ways in which Komisarjevsky aided Hayes during the crime, including driving him to the Petit home, helping him beat William Petit and helping him restrain other family members. " The trial has gone on for a little over three weeks, during which time jurors heard emotional testimony detailing the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters -- 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. "Make no mistake about it, this intrusion into the Petit home was Mr. Komisarjevsky's idea," Nicholson said. Komisarjevsky, in his view, didn't kill William Petit when he had the chance, and he closed doors to the girls' room to buy them time to survive the fire.
