He told Parliament August 11 that "when people are using social media for violence, we need to stop them." -- British Home Secretary Theresa May sat down with officials from the social media industry Thursday, her office said, as the government considers trying to ban people from social networking during or after crises. Thursday's meeting was about "whether and how we should be able to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality," the Home Office said in a statement prior to the discussion. Police and politicians have pointed to social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as mobile messaging services like BlackBerry's, as tools used to organize looting and violence. The group has not taken a position on whether people should be barred from social networking.
