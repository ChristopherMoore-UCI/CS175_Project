Japan rejects China's demand for an apology "Senkaku Islands is Japan's traditional territory," Tamogami said. "I am very angry with China," said student Shohei Fukumoto. China should apologize and pay for the repair of the vessel because the captain was in Japan's territory when the accident happened, according to Fukumoto. Protesters held up Japanese flags and chanted, "We will not allow Communist China to invade our territory." -- Anti-China protesters gathered Saturday in Tokyo and six other major cities in Japan to rally against what it calls an invasion of disputed islands that both claim are part of their territories.
