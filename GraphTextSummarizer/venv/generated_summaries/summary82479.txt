The staffing search for a Hillary Clinton campaign manager is heating up, and a Clinton spokesman acknowledged  Thursday that the former secretary of state is "casting a wide net" when talking to different people about about a would-be presidential bid. Mook: The then 33-year-old political operative was seen as a man on the rise when he steered Gov. Terry McAuliffe to victory in Virginia in 2013 and is regularly mentioned by people close to Clinton as a smart choice for campaign manager. People close to Clinton say that Smith would be a good, outside-the-beltway choice for campaign manager. "I'm a huge charter member of the Hillary Clinton fan club." Before working for McAuliffe, Mook was the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and in 2008 steered the Clinton presidential campaign to wins in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana.
