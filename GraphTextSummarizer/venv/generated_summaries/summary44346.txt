"We're going to transfer power without any kind of wires," says Dr Hall, now Chief Technology Officer at WiTricity, a startup developing wireless "resonance" technology. " The technology opens the door to any number of mobile electronic devices which have so far been held back by limited battery lives. When Hall first saw the wireless bulb, she immediately thought of medical technology -- seeing that devices transplanted beneath the skin could be charged non-intrusively. " It works like this: WiTricity builds a "Source Resonator," a coil of electrical wire that generates a magnetic field when power is attached. WiTricity has already demonstrated the ability to power laptops, cell-phones, and TVs by attaching resonator coils to batteries -- and an electric car refueler is reportedly in the works.
