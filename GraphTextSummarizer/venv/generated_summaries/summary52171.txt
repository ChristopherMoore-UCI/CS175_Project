For example, says Tan, a major fashion label could use the Pink Cloud model to promote itself during fashion week. The collective, which is made up of partners Eric Tan, Leon Lai and Nico Schlapps, is hoping to make New York its launching point. Snoozebox is another company that offers portable accommodation, often pegged to major events, such as the London Olympics last year and the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in June this year. The company is hoping to simultaneously address two pressing issues plaguing many urban landscapes: vacated office space and insufficient hotel vacancies. Pink Cloud's solution is to create temporary hotels in empty office buildings.
