ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13. British police are investigating a video released Friday that shows an unmasked and apparent British ISIS fighter, a spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron says. " UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups -- and that most will try to return, bringing their extremist views with them. Officials from Britain's intelligence agencies, Foreign Office, Home Office, police and military updated Cameron Saturday on work to take down the video of Henning and find those responsible, the Downing Street spokesperson said. UK jets began flying reconnaissance flights over Iraq a week ago, and on Tuesday dropped their first missiles on an ISIS heavy-weapon position and an armed pickup truck in Iraq, according to the UK Defense Ministry.
