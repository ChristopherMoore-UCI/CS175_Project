Saturday's announcement came after opposition leader Hassan Mushaimaa said he had returned to the islands nation, where he planned to join the tens of thousands of protesters camped out at the Pearl Roundabout in the heart of the capital. The anti-government rallies in Bahrain have occurred alongside similar protests in other regional states, but they have also unfolded amid major gestures by the kingdom. Thousands of people have been demonstrating in Bahrain in recent days for political reforms and other concessions. In September, Bahrain said it requested Interpol -- the world's largest international police organization -- to help in arresting Mushaimaa, whom the government accused of a terrorist plot to destroy state buildings and of planning a coup. Mushaimaa said after arriving in Bahrain that he was preparing a speech about the protesters' demands for a new regime.
