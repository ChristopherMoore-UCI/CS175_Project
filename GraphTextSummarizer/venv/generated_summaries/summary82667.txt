-- After several delays, NASA said Friday that space shuttle Discovery is scheduled for launch in five days. NASA said its managers had completed a readiness review for Discovery, which will be making the 28th shuttle mission to the ISS. The space shuttle Discovery, seen here in January, is now scheduled to launch Wednesday. With the completed array the station will be able to provide enough electricity when the crew size is doubled to six in May, NASA said. According to NASA, the readiness review was initiated after damage was found in a valve on the shuttle Endeavour during its November 2008 flight.
