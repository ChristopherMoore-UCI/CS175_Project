-- A judge in Aruba Friday rejected a prosecution request to hold U.S. citizen Gary Giordano for 30 additional days in connection with the disappearance of his traveling companion, Robyn Gardner, his attorney told CNN Friday. Prosecutors immediately filed an appeal seeking to reverse the ruling and prevent Giordano from leaving jail, said Taco Stein, Aruba's solicitor general. Giordano, 50, denies being responsible for the woman's disappearance, insisting that he'd been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled her to swim back, according to statements from the prosecutor's office. The judge's ruling does not require Giordano to remain in Aruba; Lejuez said he believes Giordano will leave as soon as he is freed. The Gaithersburg, Maryland, resident has acknowledged taking out a $1.5 million life insurance policy on Gardner days before they traveled to Aruba, investigators have said.
