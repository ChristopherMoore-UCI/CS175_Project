-- Is the world of Formula One ready for Senna v Prost: The Sequel? Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg's battle for the 2014 championship is drawing tantalizing comparisons with the sport's most famous rivalry between former McLaren pairing Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Senna and Prost dueled for the F1 world championship as McLaren teammates in 1988 and 1989. But the Mercedes team is keeping a cool head with executive director Toto Wolff confident he can stop any drama between his drivers getting out of hand. "I now have the lead, which is great," Rosberg told the Mercedes F1 website. After the controversy, Hamilton suggested their teenage friendship was in danger of fracturing into Senna and Prost's acrimonious relationship.
