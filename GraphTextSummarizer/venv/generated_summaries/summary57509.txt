As a result, Miller says roles dried up — because "people don't want to see films with people they don't approve of in them." There's more blunt honesty where that came from in Miller's big Esquire UK interview, the magazine's latest cover story. And while she claims that she was always "totally professional" on movie sets, offset, the actress "had no business sense whatsoever": "I never read a review or paid any mind to what anyone said," Miller admits. The trouble began when 2004′s Alfie remake was released — and 22-year-old Miller suddenly skyrocketed to fame, due to her roles as both the film's costar and Jude Law's girlfriend. Two years later, Miller is staging something of a film comeback with roles in three movies, including the Vince Vaughn comedy Business Trip (which... maybe she shouldn't get too excited about) and the true crime drama Foxcatcher (which was originally set to open Dec. 20 but has been pushed to an unspecified date this year).
