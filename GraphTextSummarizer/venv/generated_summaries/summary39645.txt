Globovision is Venezuela's last remaining television broadcaster that is openly critical of President Hugo Chavez. Globovision defended its coverage of the prison standoff, which started with a riot that killed at least 22 people and turned into a nearly monthlong standoff between prisoners and national guard troops. Globovision is currently fighting the fine in court, and accused the high court of interfering with their appeal process. The high court's "grotesque and despotic" decision forces the station to pay the original fine immediately, before its validity is decided in a lower court, Globovision said. The original fine stems from Globovision's coverage of a standoff at the Rodeo II prison in June and July.
