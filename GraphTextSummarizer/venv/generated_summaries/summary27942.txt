However, the GOP opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue, saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government. A White House statement said that opposing what it called the balanced plan by Senate Democrats would amount to prioritizing "tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans." "I would respectfully disagree that the American people are going to suddenly demand more tax hikes," an aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said. The issue extends a long-running political dispute over government spending and federal deficits that dominated President Barack Obama's first term, as well as his successful re-election campaign last year. House Speaker John Boehner noted on Thursday that the House passed bills last year to prevent the cuts from affecting the military, but Senate Democrats never acted.
