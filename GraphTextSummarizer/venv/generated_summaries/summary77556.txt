-- President Barack Obama announced Friday that Ash Carter is his pick to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. "With a record of service that has spanned more than 30 years, Ash is quietly regarded as one of our nation's foremost national security leaders," Obama said Friday from the White House's Roosevelt Room, with Carter standing by his side. In addition to his service in national security, Carter also has a long list of academic accomplishments, ranging from a stint as professor and chair at Harvard's Kennedy School, to a physics instructor at Oxford. "The Secretary believes strongly that this day belongs to Ash Carter and his nomination to be the next Secretary of Defense," the official said. The Philadelphia native has on several occasions been awarded the Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal -- the department's highest honor -- and has received multiple medals for his contributions to intelligence.
