Rich kids are not the only kids who have good schools, because Capital Prep's 80 percent black/Latino, 60 percent poor students attend one of America's top high schools, according to US News & World Report. Magnet schools are publicly funded and publicly run theme-based schools, complete with unions and subordinate to the local school board.

We knew that the students were returning to failed schools with very low expectations -- and results to match.
