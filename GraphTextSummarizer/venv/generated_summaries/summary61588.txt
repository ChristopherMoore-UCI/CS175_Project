But the 1985 World Series comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals was the Royals' last taste of glory until Wednesday, when this year's team rumbled back into the Fall Classic, sweeping the Baltimore Orioles to win the American League Championship Series. It wouldn't even be June yet and Royals fans were already ready to give up.

"It's been a long time since I've seen professional athletes have fun and enjoy the heck out of coming to work every day," he told sports host Jim Rome this week. For much of the past 29 years, the Royals haven't been a baseball afterthought, they've been a non-thought, except for their loyal fans.
