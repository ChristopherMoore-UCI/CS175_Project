-- After a sudden increase in shootings over the weekend, the New York Police Department has deployed more officers, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. "When we have hot temperatures, we see that the crime rate seems to go up," New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday. "It is unusual in a city of 8 million people, but we never read that much into one day," said Browne, who said it was the "first time in memory" that the city had such a lull in violent crime. As weekend temperatures topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit, New York City saw a sudden increase in shootings, with 26 people felled by bullets in 72 hours -- seven fatally. At the close of 2012, Bloomberg called New York City the "safest big city in America," giving the NYPD credit.
