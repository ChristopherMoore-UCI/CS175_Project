In pictures: Life in 'trash land' captured by photographer A series of works entitled "The Hell of Copper," by Burkina Faso-born Nyaba LÃ©on Ouedraogo, shows how a dump in Ghana's capital Accra is used to dispose of electronic waste from Europe and the United States. "A Look," by Congolese photographer and filmmaker Kiripi Katembo, shows flooding in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. "Climate change," by Nyani Quarmyne, shows a resident of a Ghanaian fishing village sitting on top of his home -- which is rapidly disappearing beneath the sand as the sea encroaches on the village. The exhibition has been held every other year since 1994, but this year's show features a number of works examining ecological issues. -- Global warming and environmental concerns are some of the themes being explored at a major exhibition of African photography.
