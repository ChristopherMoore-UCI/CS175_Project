Police have not said how Solis may have been involved in the killing, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Police in Pomona, California -- about 30 miles east of L.A -- issued an arrest warrant Monday for Henry Solis, an LAPD rookie, in the shooting death of a local man over the weekend. A  Los Angeles police officer wanted on murder charges "should be considered armed and dangerous," according to authorities. The victim -- identified as 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr. -- later died at a Los Angeles hospital. "The suspect knows he is wanted, and that police are actively searching for him.," Pomona police said in a statement.
