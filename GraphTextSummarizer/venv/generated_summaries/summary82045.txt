Charity watchdog groups said some American charities want to impress potential donors and therefore claim huge amounts of dollar values in medicines and other goods shipped abroad to poor countries. Documents obtained by CNN show that Charity Services International, a private South Carolina company, claimed to have shipped nearly $40 million in medicines and other donations on behalf of 15 small charities to Guatemala in 2010. A spokesman for the Order of Malta , Enrique Hegel, later told CNN that it received two or three shipments a month in 2010 and 2011 from American charities, "depending on the season." Hixon also said Breast Cancer Society had "amended" some of its IRS filings to eliminate $12 million worth of claimed donations to Guatemala. In addition, she said the Breast Cancer Society had given "$36 million of medicines and supplies to those in desperate need" to other Central American countries and to West African nations.
