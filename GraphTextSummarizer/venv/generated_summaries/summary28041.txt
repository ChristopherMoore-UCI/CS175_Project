Endorsers often create tremendous value for the companies that rely on their services -- that is why the best endorsers are so richly compensated, and why most top athletes in America make more money from sponsorships than from salary or winnings. Marketers who rely on athlete endorsers know they can be in for a rocky road -- their allied partners can suffer from injuries, a loss of form, scandals, rumors, and a range of other woes -- and they need to adapt accordingly. -- The announcement that Accenture has decided to end its marketing relationship with Tiger Woods -- now that the superstar is making headlines for his infidelity and sudden break from the sport of golf -- is raising larger doubts about the strategy of relying on celebrity endorsers. Would it not be better for firms to shy away from aligning themselves with celebrity endorsers? In a recent study in which I analyzed hundreds of athlete endorsements, I found that sales for brands in a variety of consumer-product categories jumped an average of 4 percent in the six months following the start of an endorsement deal, even after controlling for advertising expenditures and other factors that could be expected to drive up sales.
