-- Oil from a small leak in Brazilian waters -- the second in less than two months -- has reached the shores of Rio de Janeiro state, environmental authorities said. In response to the spill, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a suit last week against Chevron and oil rig operator Transocean Ltd. for about $11 billion. In early November, some 3,000 barrels of oil spilled into the ocean at a deep-water well drilled by U.S. oil giant Chevron. In the case of this second spill, authorities said they would initially levy a $5.4 million fine on Modec, the rig operator. The accidents, though small, are getting high-profile treatment as Brazil begins to develop more deep-water sites in extreme depths off the coast of the state of Rio.
