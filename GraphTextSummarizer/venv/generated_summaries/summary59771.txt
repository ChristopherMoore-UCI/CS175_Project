Computing power Aaron said computers that have lots of voice data to pull from can sound, at times, nearly human. With more than a decade of voice research under our belts, why can't computers speak our language -- or at least sound a bit more human? To try to get computers on the right track, voice technologists record human actors reading all kinds of wacky sentences, which are designed to elicit as many phoneme combinations as possible. Parts of computer voices are also generated entirely from equations and models, not actor-read sounds.
