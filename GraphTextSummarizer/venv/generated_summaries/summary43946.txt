One defendant, Yasin Hayal, received a life sentence for conspiring in the planned killing of Hrant Dink, editor-in-chief of the Armenian-language newspaper "Agos." After Tuesday's court ruling, Dink's family and attorneys, along with several hundred supporters, marched in protest through the streets of Istanbul in sub-zero temperatures carrying signs saying "We are all Armenian." At the time of the murder, Dink was defending himself in court against a number of cases accusing him of "insulting Turkish identity," for comments made about the massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. Investigative journalist Nedim Sener later wrote in a book that Istanbul police were aware of threats to Dink's life. "The Turkish authorities have failed to address state officials' alleged involvement in the killing of journalist and human rights activist Hrant Dink," Amnesty International wrote this week.
