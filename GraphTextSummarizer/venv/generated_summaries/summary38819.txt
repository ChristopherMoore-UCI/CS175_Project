"It is very gratifying to win in the innovation category, which speaks so much to CNN's commitment to harnessing technology in unique and distinct ways," said Tony Maddox, CNN International Managing Director. -- A collaboration between Twitter and CNN during football's 2010 World Cup in South Africa has landed a top television award for innovation. South Africa 2010 was the first World Cup to be held since Twitter became one of the leading social media technologies and, at its peak, the interactive processed more than 13,000 tweets a minute when England played the United States in a group match on June 12. During the tournament, won by Spain, Twitter Buzz handled more than 11 million World Cup-related tweets. CNN's Twitter Buzz was an interactive screen which reflected the Twitter traffic on a particular topic, usually a player or a team.
