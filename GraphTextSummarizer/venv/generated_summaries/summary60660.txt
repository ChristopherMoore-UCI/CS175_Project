"Sometimes, the investigators that work these bank robberies do get lucky in terms of the robbers doing something stupid, leaving something behind that is an incredible investigative lead," Steve Emmett, a spokesman for the Atlanta FBI office, told CNN affiliate WSB. -- A brazen gunman wearing a porcelain doll mask robbed an Atlanta, Georgia, bank and made off with a stash of money, the FBI said. The FBI is asking anybody with information to call its Atlanta office at 404-679-9000. The man entered the Chase Bank, put on the porcelain doll-type mask and jumped on the counter of the bank, brandishing a silver semi-automatic handgun, the FBI said. The FBI has clear pictures of him looking nervous as he enters the bank Tuesday morning before he donned the mask.
