"I can't imagine anything more serious than firing a weapon from a moving vehicle into another moving vehicle on a corner such as Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo," Clark County District Attorney Steven Wolfson said Thursday. Harris was detained "without incident" in the Los Angeles neighborhood and will be held pending extradition proceedings, Las Vegas police said in a news release. Earlier Thursday, Las Vegas police said they no longer considered the woman -- identified as Yenesis Alfonso, also known as Tineesha Howard -- "a missing person or a person of interest." "Mr. Harris is in custody, and that's where we hope to keep him," said Las Vegas police Lt. Ray Steiber. Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, 26, was apprehended around noon (3 p.m. ET) on Thursday in North Hollywood, California, said FBI spokeswoman Lourdes Arocho.
