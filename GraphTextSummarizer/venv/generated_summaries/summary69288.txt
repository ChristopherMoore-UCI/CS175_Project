According to a Carlos III hospital spokeswoman, Romero started feeling ill on September 29. Carlos III hospital indicated late Thursday that seven more people -- a doctor, three nurses, two beauticians, a doctor and a hospital staffer -- have been admitted for observation. She called Carlos III hospital on October 2 and was directed, per protocol, to an external medical department under the umbrella of Madrid's regional health service, the hospital spokesman said. That Romero may have gotten Ebola at Carlos III is a major cause of concern, especially if she did -- as she told Spanish newspaper El Mundo -- follow the necessary protocols while caring for the missionaries. Romero's case began after two Spanish missionaries -- Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo -- contracted Ebola in West Africa.
