Germany Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich was held 0-0 at second-bottom Hamburg on Saturday, leaving Pep Guardiola's team fourth on goal difference after a second draw in four matches. France Marseille went top on goal difference after Saturday's 3-0 win over Rennes, as France forward Andre-Pierre Gignac scored twice. The draw left Diego Simeone's team a point behind Barca in second, with Granada third on goal difference after winning 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao. Atletico conceded an early goal to Pablo Hernandez but led 2-1 at halftime through Miranda and defender Diego Godin before Nolito leveled with a 53rd-minute penalty. City rival Atletico Madrid, which won the Spanish title last season but lost to Real in the European final, dropped points in a 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo later Saturday.
