"It is the nightlife capital of the region," said Naomi Sargeant, managing director of city guide Time Out Beirut. Beirut's vibrancy is partly an expression of a Lebanese lust for life, a determination to seize the day after having endured years of war and associated traumas, said Sargeant. There were two or three clubs in Christian east Beirut, the same in the city's Muslim west. In 1984, in the midst of Lebanon's civil war, Naji Gebran started hosting regular gatherings at his Beirut beachfront apartment for the purpose of "musical therapy." It is at that point, said Sargeant, the genuine bon vivants are likely to continue partying, heading to beach clubs to the city's north and south for a swim and another drink on a sun lounger.
