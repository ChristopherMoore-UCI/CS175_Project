Special Envoy to Syria Kofi Annan, to discuss some issues related to his mission in Syria. " Russia and China have balked at supporting tough U.N. Security Council action against Syria. " The action, the council said, "confirms its position rejecting the Syrian regime's persistence in killing unarmed Syrian people and ignoring all efforts to resolve the current tragic situation in Syria. -- The six countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council will close their Syrian embassies, the council said Thursday, calling on the international community "to stop what is going on in Syria.
