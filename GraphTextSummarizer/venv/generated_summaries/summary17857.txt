" British minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said his government "is deeply concerned by reports of a build-up of Syrian security forces and armored vehicles in the besieged city of Homs," also the "scene of disturbing crackdowns in recent months. "Evidence received from reports, videos and information obtained by activists on the ground in Homs indicate that the regime is paving the way to commit a massacre in order to extinguish the revolution in Homs and to discipline, by example, other Syrian cities that have joined the revolution," the council said. -- Syria's leading opposition movement warned Friday of an impending government "massacre" designed to crush activists in the city of Homs, which has emerged as a center of anti-regime unrest. At least 17 people were killed Friday in Homs and at least 29 were killed elsewhere across Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group. " Human Rights Watch last month issued a report detailing "the systematic nature of abuses against civilians in Homs by Syrian government forces."
