Jordan believed that if she died, Jude's biological father, a yoga instructor, would have gained custody, according to Brenner. Former pharmaceutical executive Gigi Jordan testified that she knowingly gave a lethal concoction of drugs to her 8-year-old autistic son. Her first husband "knew that Jude was her soft spot." Jordan "believed he was going to kill her, leaving a sexual predator to exercise his paternal rights," Brenner told the jury. Fighting back tears as she took the stand for the first time in her second-degree murder trial, Jordan said Wednesday that she knowingly gave herself and her son, Jude Mirra, enough drugs to kill them both. "Did you climb on top of Jude and grab his jaw and forcibly put liquid drugs down his throat," defense lawyer Allan Brenner asked.
