Meanwhile, fighting in northern Sri Lanka between government and rebel forces escalated on several fronts Friday, while Tamil Tiger rebels killed seven people in a roadside bombing. -- Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa claimed Friday there was "a conspiracy with certain international forces" to belittle his government's military victories against Tamil Tiger rebels. Rajapaksa said there were efforts to belittle military victories "to turn the attention of the people to other directions." Government troops were said to be meeting fierce resistance as they advanced on the Tamil stronghold of Mullaitivu and a naval blockade remained in the northeastern seas. Friday's incident came as troops pursued their military campaign in the northern Wanni region to recapture remaining rebel strongholds, military sources said.
