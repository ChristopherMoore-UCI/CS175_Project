-- During his trip to northwest Syria in late April, Ole Solvang talked to dozens of people who told him gut-wrenching stories. Though Solvang has interviewed victims in numerous conflicts, Syria stands out to him because of the estimated tens of thousands of people who rights workers suspect have been unlawfully detained. Less than a week earlier, in late March, al-Assad announced that he would implement the United Nations peace plan. Solvang and his team knew the risk they took in entering Syria. At 33, Solvang is already an experienced conflict documentarian, interviewing victims of violence in Russia, the North Caucasus and Sri Lanka.
