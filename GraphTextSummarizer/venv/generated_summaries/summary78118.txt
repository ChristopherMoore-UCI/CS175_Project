-- Champion elect Sebastian Vettel recorded the fastest time in practice Friday for the Japanese Grand Prix during an afternoon session overshadowed by the news of the death of Maria de Villota. If results go Vettel's way, he will emulate the feat of fellow German Michael Schumacher and Argentina legend Juan Manuel Fangio in claiming four straight F1 crowns. " Vettel, who has won the last four Grand Prix races to open up 77 point lead over Alonso, cautioned against placing too much emphasis on Friday practice. But the thoughts of the drivers were with De Villota, a reserve driver for Marussia until a horror crash in testing a year ago curtailed her F1 ambitions. Now, all we can do is pray for her and for her family." Jenson Button, ninth best for McLaren spoke for many: "Today's news about Maria de Villota is horrendous and tragic.
