China is not part of the International Space Station (ISS), which currently orbits the Earth while space experts and astronauts conduct experiments in a range of fields, from physics to astronomy. Only China, Russia and the United States have sent men into space. "This is not to say that China will never cooperate with others in space, but it would prefer to do so from a position of strength once it has developed a more capable and robust space program," says MIT's Fravel, who specializes in China's military affairs. But hardly anyone considered China as a serious player in space exploration. China is forging ahead to build its own space station, even though the costs would be enormous, while the U.S. and other space powers have apparently discarded that option.
