Chad Smith, drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, has apologized to fans of Brazilian football team Flamengo after wiping his backside with one of the club's shirts. The incident occurred during a drum clinic in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte last week, when Smith shoved a red and black Flamengo shirt down the back of his trousers prompting booing from large parts of the gathered crowd. Smith, a key member of the American band since 1988, later sought to further endear himself to Flamengo fans by posting a picture of himself cheering on Instagram wearing one of the club's jerseys. The 52-year-old has since attempted to build bridges with fans of Flamengo, which claims to be Brazil's best-supported club with 30 million fans. Flamengo is one of Brazil's most successful clubs and is one of five to have never been relegated from the top division.
