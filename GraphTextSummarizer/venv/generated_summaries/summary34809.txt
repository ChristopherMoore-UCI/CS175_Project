Great ideas often don't result from a single "eureka" moment, but instead come from what Johnson called "the slow hunch," as they evolve and interact with other ideas. Other ideas were mixing and mating in Oxford at the first day of TED Global, which is a product of the nonprofit TED, dedicated to "ideas worth spreading. Matt Ridley, author of "The Rational Optimist," says the sharing of ideas -- or in his phrase, "ideas having sex with each other" -- is a tremendously powerful force driving human progress. "Until the rise of the coffeehouse, the entire population was effectively drunk all day," Johnson said in a talk aimed at explaining how ideas get started. The first coffeehouse to open in England, a still-operating caf√© on High Street in Oxford, is more than a place to get a beef and horseradish sandwich, according to author and blogger Steven Berlin Johnson.
