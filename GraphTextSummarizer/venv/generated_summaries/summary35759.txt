If there is a lockout, players won't get their salaries or bonuses, and if the shutdown forces the league to cancel games next season, the NFL estimates a loss of $400 million in revenue each week. "You've got owners, most of whom are worth close to a billion dollars, you've got players who are making millions of dollars," he said during a joint news conference with visiting Mexican President Felipe Calderon. The overall number of games per season, including exhibition games, would remain at the current 20. -- Negotiations between NFL owners and the players union on a new collective bargaining agreement were given a 24-hour extension Thursday, according to a statement from the league. "My working assumption, at a time when people are having to cut back, compromise and worry about making the mortgage and paying for their kids' college education is that the two parties should be able to work it out without the president of the United States intervening." Currently, the owners take about $1 billion off the top of league revenue, and the players get 60 percent of the rest.
