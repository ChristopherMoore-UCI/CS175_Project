-- A federal court has ruled in favor of Texas, which wants to ban state funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates participating in a health program for low-income women because the family planning network performs abortions. The court's decision Tuesday serves as a setback for Planned Parenthood and abortion providers, under attack from conservatives across the nation who say government dollars should never support abortions. But Texas lawmakers object to Planned Parenthood because the organization is the nation's leading provider of abortions and is a vocal advocate for abortion rights, Gov. Rick Perry and Republicans in the Legislature have worked to cut off its state money. Texas opposed government funding for Planned Parenthood clinics because the organization provides abortions and has been in a long-running battle with the federal government. The program does not pay for abortions, and participating Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas do not perform the procedure.
