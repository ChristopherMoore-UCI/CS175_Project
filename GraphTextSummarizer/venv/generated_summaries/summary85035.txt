Although the government failed to convict the Kentucky men on hate crime charges this week, the Justice Department's top civil rights official, Thomas Perez, said prosecutors would not be discouraged from bringing other cases. Federal hate crimes law was expanded in 2009 to include a victim's perceived sexual orientation, gender or disability. -- Two cousins have been convicted of kidnapping a gay man in Kentucky, but the Justice Department failed in the same case to win a guilty verdict in the first test of an expanded hate crimes provision covering sexual orientation. Both men were attacked and killed in separate incidents in 1998 that drew national attention to toughening hate crimes laws broadly. Perez called the kidnapping a "vicious and criminal act" and said his department would vigorously investigate possible hate crimes.
