"We have decided to kill U.S. and French sailors if they happen to be among our future hostages," said Abdullahi Ahmed, a member of a pirate group based at Harardhere, a coastal town in central Somalia. On Sunday, U.S. Navy snipers opened fire on the lifeboat after seeing one pirate point an AK-47 at the captain's back, the U.S. military said. -- Two pirates in Somalia vowed revenge Monday, after the U.S. military killed three pirates and freed a U.S. ship captain who had been held hostage for several days. They were killed two days after the French military freed four hostages, including a child, who had been held by pirates for nearly a week on the yacht, Tanit, off Somalia's coast. For five days the pirates held Phillips in the lifeboat as U.S. Navy ships closed in and lingered nearby.
