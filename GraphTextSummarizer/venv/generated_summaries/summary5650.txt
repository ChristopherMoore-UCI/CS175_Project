" Verdict doesn't end debate in Trayvon Martin death CNN Legal analyst Paul Callan agreed Monday that federal prosecutors are "in sort of a tough spot."

Civil rights groups are planning nationwide vigils, and more than a million people support an online petition drive calling for admitted shooter George Zimmerman to face federal charges in the February 2012 killing. Zimmerman's acquittal on Saturday showed the Florida jury rejected that he intended to kill Martin for any reason, including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated Martin's civil rights.
