Kim and Kang, playing partners on Sunday, spent two hours reviewing TV footage with officials before Kim was persuaded to sign for a six by the Korean Golf Association rules committee. The former world No.1 is still searching for an elusive first title of 2013 -- something his tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki finally managed to achieve on Sunday. Kang said he felt "horrible" after winning the title at the expense of his good friend and overnight leader Kim Hyung-Tae. The 24-year-old golfer was left wondering what might have been as he finished just one stroke behind champion Kang Sung-Hoon after carding a four under round of 67 Sunday. McIlroy sunk an eagle, four birdies and a bogey at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club in Cheonan near Seoul.
