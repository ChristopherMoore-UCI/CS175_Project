In regards to white collar crime, Breuer faced extensive criticism for the Justice Department's failure to bring major prosecutions against the nation's largest financial institutions responsible for financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. The announcement came the day after Breuer celebrated a victory in the criminal investigation of BP in the 2010 Gulf oil disaster. Breuer apologized for an inaccurate letter to a senator in which the Justice Department denied the ATF allowed guns to be smuggled to Mexican drug cartels. In fact, his nearly four years in the job makes Breuer one of the longest serving Criminal Division chiefs. But Breuer insisted that the banks and their employees needed to be protected against an implosion that could cause greater problems.
