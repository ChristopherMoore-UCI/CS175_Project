On March 21, 2006, the first Twitter message was published by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who wrote, "just setting up my twttr." In recent years,Twitter has become arguably the leading platform for real-time chatter around breaking news and live TV events such as the Oscars and the Super Bowl. You can also look up the first tweet of any other user, from NBA star Kobe Bryant ("The antisocial has become social #mambatweets") to billionaire Warren Buffett ("Warren is in the house"). To commemorate Friday's eighth anniversary of the first Twitter message, Twitter has introduced a tool that lets users relive their Twitter debuts. Type your Twitter handle into the search field and it spits out your first-ever tweet in its full, date-stamped glory -- typos, clever witticisms, clumsy hashtags and all.
