A common sight Neighbors in Longwood, north of Orlando, say bears often roam through the area -- especially when looking for food thrown out by humans. Florida Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Karen Parker said officials aren't ready to call the case a bear "attack" yet because it's not clear what led up to the incident. "We're calling it a bear incident simply because we simply don't know what happened," Parker said. Unprovoked black bear attacks in Florida are extremely rare. "Unless we get the full cooperation with everybody in every neighborhood around here, the bears are going to come in for a free lunch," Parker said.
