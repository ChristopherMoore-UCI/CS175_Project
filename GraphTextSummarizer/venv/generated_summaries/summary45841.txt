"Mr. Aristide has chosen to remain outside of Haiti for seven years," Toner said. " "Consolidation of democracy in Haiti depends largely on the will of politicians to adopt the principles of a peaceful transfer of power and to accept election results in accordance with mechanisms provided by the electoral law," said a statement from the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti, which has been in Haiti since Aristide's departure. Aristide, a polarizing figure in Haiti, became the second former president to return to Port-au-Prince this year. "I think that the Haitian people are very happy, happy to know that we are on our way heading to Haiti, happy to know that finally their dream will be fulfilled by things on the ground because they fought hard for democracy," Aristide said. " Aristide was shuttled out of Haiti in 2004 on a U.S. plane after bloodshed on the streets and charges of authoritarianism and corruption.
