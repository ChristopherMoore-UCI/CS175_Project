While Tencent's rival Alibaba also has a similar service, called Hong Bao, which launched last year, WeChat's app allows users to randomly distribute up to 200 yuan ($33) within a group of friends, adding a fun element of unpredictability to the process. Some analysts believe that linking the payments to WeChat's in-app payment service could be a game-changer, as it streamlines the process of paying for microtransactions, potentially making users more likely to make in-app purchases in the future. Of course, China's internet giants have not been slow to capitalize on this trend, with Shenzhen-based Tencent last week launching their 'New Year Red Envelope' app, an add-on to its phenomenally popular WeChat messaging service. -- A growing number of Chinese are keeping their cash in their wallets this Lunar New Year as the traditional exchange of red packets of money is moving from the physical world into the digital space. "The tradition of giving red packets is a symbolic gesture," said Steve Wang, Chief Economist, Reorient Group.
