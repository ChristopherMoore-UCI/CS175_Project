Israel's two previous wars -- in 1956 against Egypt alone and in 1967 against an alliance of all its neighbors -- had terminated in lightning Israeli victories. Altogether, many analysts drew a grim conclusion from 1973 about the future of the Jewish state: Israeli military supremacy had come to an end. Despite Israel's ultimate military success, the war was interpreted by many as something close to a defeat for the Jewish state. Meanwhile, the Palestinian problem has settled into seething stalemate, with governments in Gaza and the West Bank more or less at war with each other and neither able to say "yes" to anything Israel proposes. In 1973, Israel's enemies scored their first battlefield successes since the foundation of the Jewish state.
