Here's my story: I bought tickets online through Cheapoair.com from Philadelphia to Tapachula, Mexico. When Eileen Mather lands in Mexico City on her way to Tapachula, Mexico, she learns her airline ticket isn't valid. Reservations can be lost, paper tickets and boarding passes can be misread. When we arrived in Mexico City, Aviacsa Airlines representatives told us that Cheapoair hadn't paid for the last leg of our trip. So I had to buy new tickets.
