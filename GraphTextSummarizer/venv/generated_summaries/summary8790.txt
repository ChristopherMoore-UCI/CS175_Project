Chris Reiger says the family hasn't ruled out the possibility of a kidnapping but adds that "none of this adds up. None of it." August Reiger, who was his class valedictorian, has experience traveling abroad, including in his mother's home country of Syria, his father said. August Reiger has been missing since Sunday, when he went on a hike on a mountain overlooking the town of Banos. Lira de la Paz Villalva, governor of Ecuador's Tungurahua province, said local authorities don't have any leads about what could have caused the teen's disappearance. August had just graduated from the Classen School of Advanced Studies in Oklahoma City, said Shannon Schmoyer, Reiger's father's cousin.
