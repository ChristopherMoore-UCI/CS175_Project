Dwayne Perry of Cartersville told CNN affiliate WSB that he is none too happy about last week's "raid" conducted by the governor's drug suppression task force. Upon realizing that it had dispatched officers to confiscate a popular gumbo ingredient, the Georgia State Patrol, which operates the task force, issued an apology, both to Perry and publicly. It seems like a humorous mistake, only because no one was hurt, but there have been numerous instances in which innocent citizens have been injured or worse when police acted on bogus information. "Here I am, at home and retired and you know I do the right thing," Perry told the station. He received many calls about all of the police officers at his home, Perry said, and he worries that his reputation in the community may suffer.
