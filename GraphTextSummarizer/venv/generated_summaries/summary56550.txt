Stretton called the family's attorney late Saturday night "and said she could be out by July 4," Marcella Bracamonte said on "Good Morning America" Sunday. CNN discovered that Stretton is on the California's Vexatious Litigant List, a list of people who continually bring legal action, regardless of merit, against others with the sole intention of harassment. The family's saga started in March when Marcella Bracamonte hired Stretton as a nanny, who was expected to help out with household chores. More than three weeks ago the Bracamonte family fired Diane Stretton, 64, but she refused to leave their home. A judge even ruled in Stretton's favor, deciding the Bracamonte's did not terminate Stretton's employment in a legal manner.
