The body of 50-year-old Belgian Eric Palante was found at the 143km mark of the previous day's stage from Chilecito to San Miguel de Tucuman, the longest of the grueling race. The marathon motor rally, for cars, motorbikes and trucks, was originally staged between Paris and Dakar in Senegal. Organizers of the annual event said Palante's death would be examined by a judge in the Catamarca Province of Argentina, but reported on their official website that "no alert" had been received ahead of his fatal accident. " Palante is the 27th competitor to die in the rally since it was first staged in 1978, while more than 50 have died overall, including spectators, support crew and the media. "It is with great sadness that the organizers and the entire family of the Dakar offer their condolences to Eric's family and friends.
