-- When U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday it would be wrong to seek regime change in Libya by force, Republican lawmakers took issue -- saying removing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is and should be precisely the goal. "If we tell Gadhafi, 'Don't worry, you won't be removed by force,' I think that's very encouraging to Gadhafi," McCain said, after Obama delivered a speech explaining U.S. intervention in Libya. Isn't the danger for the people of Libya Gadhafi?" He added, "The president of the United States did not define a clear goal. Boehner sent a letter to Obama last week in which he asked specific questions about the Libya mission, including whether the U.S. military would take on a larger role if the coalition fell apart. McCain said the president's words were "puzzling" because Obama has previously said that U.S. policy is for Gadhafi's ouster.
