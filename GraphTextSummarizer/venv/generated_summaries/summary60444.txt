Five people were taken to Glen Rose Medical Center in Glen Rose, Texas, where they were in stable condition, CEO Gary Marks said. But by 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), fire officials had turned off the valves that were feeding gas to the fire. A 36-inch underground natural gas pipeline exploded into flames Monday in Johnson County, Texas, killing one and injuring at least five people before officials were able to shut the flow of gas, officials said. Video showed the site of the fire -- cattle country -- in the center of a patch of scorched grassland. "There was a crew working on the line, and they apparently ruptured it somehow and caused an explosion," Cleburne City Manager Chester Nolen said.
