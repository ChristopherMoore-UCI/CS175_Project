Essa, 41, will be eligible for parole in 20 years, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Bill Mason said. A Cleveland jury convicted Yazeed Essa last week of aggravated murder for poisoning Rosemarie Essa, his wife and the mother of his two children, with a cyanide-laced calcium pill. Dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit, Essa did not betray an emotion as Judge Deena Calabrese lamented that she could not hand down a stiffer sentence "I regret that you have the benefit of committing this crime under the old law," Calabrese told Essa. In January 2009, Essa was extradited to Cuyahoga County, according to the prosecutor's office. The defense also attempted to cast suspicion on Essa's mistresses.
