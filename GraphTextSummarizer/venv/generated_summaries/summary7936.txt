-- Federal agents arrested 10 current or former Delta employees Thursday for their alleged involvement in drug trafficking at airports in Detroit and Houston, authorities said. In March 2010, federal agents seized 45 more pounds of marijuana from two Delta employees at the Detroit airport, the statement said. A Twitter post from the airline said Delta fully cooperated with federal authorities in their investigation. " The investigation -- dubbed "Operation Excess Baggage" -- began in January 2010, when Jamaican authorities seized 53 pounds of marijuana from a suitcase, the immigration and customs agency said in a statement. "Delta does not tolerate employees found using their position for illegal activity and these employees have been suspended without pay," the post said.
