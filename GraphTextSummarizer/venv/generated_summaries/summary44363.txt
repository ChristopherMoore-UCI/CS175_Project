-- Holders Brazil needed a last-gasp equalizer from Fred to salvage a 2-2 draw against Paraguay in their Copa America Group B match Saturday in Cordoba. Paraguay then took a shock lead with Dani Alvez losing the ball to Santa Cruz, who found Haedo Valdez. But Paraguay, themselves held by Ecuador in their opener, leveled 11 minutes into the second half through Blackburn striker Roque Santa Cruz. Jadson replaced Robinho in the starting line up as Brazil coach Mano Menezes rung the changes after the disappointing performance against Venezuela. They took a first half lead through Jadson, but trailed 2-1 with only a minute left when substitute Fred spared their blushes.
