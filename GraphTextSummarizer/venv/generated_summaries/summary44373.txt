When Bennett reached 999 made shots, coach Tyler Sanders put him in his first-ever varsity game on Saturday against rival Gainesville High. But he kept at it, and over the years teammates and coaches kept count as Nicholas came in early to shoot or heaved up half-court shots during practice. But Nicholas Bennett, a senior at North Hall High School in Gainesville, Georgia, didn't hit a game-winning basket. But the real highlight came at halftime, when he stepped to half court and began launching shots in his trademark underhand style. " "This was such an exciting experience," Bennett told the Gainesville Times afterward.
