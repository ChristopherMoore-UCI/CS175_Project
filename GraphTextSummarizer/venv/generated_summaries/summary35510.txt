-- The West Virginia coal mine where 29 miners died in an explosion in April had a sudden and large inundation of methane gas the day of the accident, the mine owner said Thursday. A preliminary report on the disaster by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration found that the Upper Big Branch mine had "a significant history of safety issues" and that the agency was closely monitoring Massey Energy. More than 50 of the citations were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected, according to federal mine safety records. Recovery crews found some of the bodies in a section of the mine where readings showed high levels of gases, and the crews needed breathing gear to enter, said Jama Jarrett, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training. "To put it in perspective, a methane release of this size would completely fill a 2,000 square-foot house with an explosive atmosphere in under 40 seconds, and could fill the volume of a typical mine entry to explosive levels in under 25 seconds," Schemel said.
