Organic food, or food grown without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, antibiotics or hormones, now accounts for more than $31 billion in sales each year. Moreover, some scientific advancements have even engineered food with more nutrients than organic farming produces. Because it doesn't use as many fertilizers, organic farming requires more land to grow the same amount of food as conventional industrial farming. It turned out that people who ate organic meat in the winter were more likely to get a campylobacter infection, which could lead to food poisoning. Most people who buy organic food do so for its purported health benefits.
