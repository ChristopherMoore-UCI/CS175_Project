The company said it hired a private investigator to follow and videotape Thornton for several weeks after it was suspected he was stealing from his truck, according to CNN Hartford affiliate WFSB. East Windsor, Connecticut, police arrested Christy Quail, 33, and charged her with sixth-degree larceny after getting a videotape showing her accepting beer from a truck driven by Omar Thornton, according to dispatcher Sharon Bourke. Thornton went on a shooting rampage Tuesday after his employer, Hartford Distributors, said it had asked him to resign for stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Thornton's girlfriend told CNN he was being racially harassed at work, but Hartford Distributors' president said Thursday that there were no grievances filed with the company or with Thornton's union. -- Police arrested a woman Friday who they said accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by the man who killed eight people and then himself in Connecticut this week.
