It all moves along so quickly; on the day in 1988 that Toews was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the papers carried stories saying that Jordan had scored 50 points in a playoff victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on this same stretch of West Madison Street where he now sat cheering for Toews. One of the people in the arena wearing a Toews jersey was a 47-year-old fan: Michael Jordan. For generations, the Stage has been a part of New York City life. What must it be like for Toews, knowing that Jordan is not only watching him play, but also wearing his jersey? The person with whom I spoke was Steve Auerbach, co-owner of the famous Stage Deli on Seventh Avenue in New York.
