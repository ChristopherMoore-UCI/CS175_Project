The Los Alamos fire, which is officially called the Las Conchas fire, has forced nearly 10,000 people from their homes in the town. Jerome MacDonald, operations section chief for the multi-state southwest area Incident management team, said fire officials flanked the fire on the east side Thursday in an attempt to curb high winds from the southwest. "We have seen fire behavior we have never seen before," Fire Chief Doug Tucker told reporters Thursday. But Tucker said that the waste is stored in drums that are kept on a blacktop with no vegetation around and are safe from fire. The Las Conchas Fire began on private land Sunday and expanded into the Santa Fe National Forest and Jemez Ranger District, according to InciWeb, an online database that keeps track of natural disasters such as fires and floods.
