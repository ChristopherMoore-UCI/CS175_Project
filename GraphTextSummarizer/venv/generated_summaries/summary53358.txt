I know football is just a game, and the Patriots demolished the Colts 45-7, and clearly would have beaten them even if they played with a ball made of marshmallow fluff. I have spent so much emotional capital and enthusiasm raising them as Patriots fans while living in New York, and now I am beginning to regret it. For all the Patriots playoff games this year, my sons and I have all donned our No. 12 Tom Brady jerseys. I am 42, and have been a New England Patriots fan for 42 years, plus nine months when you include that prenatal season. I managed to compartmentalize that, buy my kids their Patriots gear and cheer for them anyway, perhaps hoping that it was some kind of anomaly.
