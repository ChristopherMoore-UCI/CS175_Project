Bollettieri also questions the failure of U.S. tennis to discover talent at grassroots level from working class backgrounds. Despite the support for McEnroe, the flow of young U.S. talent onto the professional circuit remains a trickle rather than the hoped for flood. " Bollettieri also believes the worldwide growth of tennis with many more countries now producing top-ranked players is responsible for the relative decline in U.S. standards. Roddick remains the only U.S. male in the top 10 of the ATP Tour rankings, with John Isner and Sam Querrey solid performers in the 20s. -- Serena and Venus Williams may still be the players to beat on the women's circuit while Andy Roddick has enjoyed a recent renaissance on the men's tour but strip away this illustrious trio and there are real fears for the future of American tennis.
