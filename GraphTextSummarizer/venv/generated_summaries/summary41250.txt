At least 50 people have died in Somalia after drinking contaminated water from a well in northern Mogadishu, an official in that East African country said Thursday. Of course, available quality drinking water is just one of several pressing issues in Somalia. The United Nations reports that 115 people die every hour in Africa from diseases linked to inferior sanitation, poor hygiene and contaminated water. That's especially true in parts of Africa, and even more so in Somalia, which has some of the lowest rates of water coverage in the world. While access to drinkable water has improved in recent years, it still remains a major and sometimes deadly problem in some places.
