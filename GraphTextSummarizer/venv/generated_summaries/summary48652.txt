Local news outlets identified the man as Jim Keady, a former Asbury Park councilman whose history of protests includes being deported from Indonesia after railing against Nike's labor practices in the country. Christie warned the man that things would "get very interesting and very fun" if he didn't sit down -- but the heckler, seated in the front row during a speech in Belmar, wasn't deterred. -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie once again flashed the pugnacious attitude that's made him a gladiator to some and a bully to others on Wednesday, telling a heckler to "sit down and shut up." "I'll tell ya," Christie said in apparent response to the man, "there's about a thousand things I'll do tonight. "I'd be more than happy to have a debate with you any time you like, guy, 'cause somebody like you doesn't know a damn thing about what you're talking about except to stand up and show off when the cameras are here," Christie said.
