American contractor Alan P. Gross has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against the Cuban state. "Alan Gross has been accused of doing nothing more than giving peaceful people access to the internet," Boomgard said, adding that his detention has been "without the benefit of due process and in violation of international law." Gross, 61, was found guilty of working on a "subversive" U.S. project intended to undermine the Cuban government by distributing illegal satellite communications equipment, according to Cubadebate, a state-run website in Cuba. Boomgard has asked Cuba "in light of the critical medical situation confronting Alan and his family" to release Gross on humanitarian grounds. Last year, the topic of Gross' imprisonment prompted one of the highest-level diplomatic exchanges between the two countries in recent years.
