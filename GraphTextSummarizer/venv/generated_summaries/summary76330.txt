Fresh from Helena Costa becoming France's first ever professional female football coach for a male team, reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has announced double grand slam winner Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach. Murray has been playing his way back into form and fitness and reached the last four at Roland Garros, before a resounding defeat to eventual champion Nadal. The duo have just two weeks to prepare for Murray's title defense at the All England Club at Wimbledon. " Murray and Mauresmo have initially agreed to a short-term arrangement, with the latter, like Judy, committed to the French Fed Cup team. "I'm really excited to be able to work with Andy," Mauresmo said from Roland Garros, where she was working as a commentator for Eurosport.
