"Once in the body, the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active TB," the City of El Paso's Department of Public Health said in a statement. -- More than 700 infants and 40 health care workers have been exposed to tuberculosis, commonly called TB, at a hospital in El Paso, Texas, according to the city's Department of Public Health. An employee at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso came to work with an active case of TB some time between September 2013 and August 2014. The Texas Department of State Health Services conducted an on-site investigation at Providence Memorial Hospital last week and cited the hospital "for deficiencies that represent immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety," said Carrie Williams, the department's director of media relations. There were 9,582 recorded cases of TB in the United States last year.
