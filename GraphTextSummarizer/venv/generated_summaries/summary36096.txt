Touring Toyota Toyota Kaikan Museum and plant tour, 1 Toyota-cho, Toyota, Aichi; advance online booking required. This giant factory full of giant robots produces cars for the world's best selling automaker -- Toyota sold 9.98 million vehicles in 2013. From a second floor glass bridge inside Toyota's Motomachi plant, our tour group stares down at production lines on either side of us, noses pressed to the glass. At the end of the tour, we play a series of timed games meant to demonstrate the remarkable skills required of Toyota's plant workers. Studied at universities and schools around the world, the Toyota Production System is considered by many to be the most well-run and efficient self-correcting production system in the world Although Toyota has been remarkably transparent about its renowned system -- opening its plants to anyone who wants to observe or study them -- emulators (automotive and beyond) have struggled to match its remarkable success.
