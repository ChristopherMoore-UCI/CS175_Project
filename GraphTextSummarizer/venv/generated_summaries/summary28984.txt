-- The Nevada Supreme Court Friday upheld former football player O.J. Simpson's convictions for kidnapping with a deadly weapon and other charges in his 2008 Las Vegas armed robbery trial, but ordered a new trial for co-defendant Clarence Stewart. Simpson also contended the Las Vegas trial court improperly admitted hearsay statements. On September 13, 2007, Simpson and five men held two individuals at gunpoint and removed about $100,000 worth of trophies and other sports memorabilia from a Las Vegas hotel room. "We conclude that the district court did abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to sever (Stewart's trial from Simpson's) because it prejudiced Stewart by having a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict, and we therefore reverse the judgment of conviction," the court wrote. That 2008 Nevada conviction came exactly 13 years after Simpson was acquitted in Los Angeles, California, in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.
