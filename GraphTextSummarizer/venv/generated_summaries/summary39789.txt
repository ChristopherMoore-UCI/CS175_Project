New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was arrested Thursday on charges that he used his position as one of the state's most-powerful politicians to amass millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks, federal prosecutors said. The complaint outlined an elaborate, alleged corruption scheme driven by influence and greed, including the siphoning of state funds to a doctor referring cases to the law firm where Silver worked and securing tax breaks for real estate developers. "Over his decades in office, Speaker Silver has amassed titanic political power,"  Bharara told reporters. That said, Mr. Silver looks forward to responding to them -- in court -- and ultimately his full exoneration." Silver, who was released on bail, spoke briefly to reporters as he left court. He received those fees by, among other official acts, awarding $500,000 in state grants to a university research center of a physician who referred patients with asbestos-related illnesses to Silver at the law firm where he worked, the complaint said.
