The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call for emergency medical help at the couple's Pacific Palisades home Saturday morning, LAFD spokesman Brian Humphrey said. "Sadly, we can confirm that Martin Short's wife did pass away," Camille Kuznetz said Monday. -- Nancy Dolman, the wife of actor-comedian Martin Short has died, Short's representative said. Dolman, 58, was a comedic actress and, like Short, a native of Canada. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office had no record of her death, but the office would only be aware if a death was sudden, unexpected or from unnatural causes, a spokesman said.
