Stevens raced in last season's final race in Abu Dhabi for Caterham, another struggling team, which has been scrapped from the 2015 list after failing to find new funding. Last year's champion constructor had been content to allow world champion Lewis Hamilton and Rosberg rack up the laps on medium compound tires but in the afternoon session at the Circuit de Catalunya, the German star was given his head. Not least because it has run for over 1,000 laps in the three pre-season tests at Jerez and Barcelona, which end Sunday. Financially-troubled Marussia came out of administration this month after failing to take part in the final three races of last season when its cash ran out. It was also over a second better than his nearest rival on the day, Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas of Finland.
