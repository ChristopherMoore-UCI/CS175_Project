-- Timothy Haydock, an emergency room physician and Kennedy family friend, is expected to take the stand Thursday in the trial of the son of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Nurses describe alleged assault by Kennedy son His testimony is expected to fit the defense's narrative that Kennedy's actions, which were in part captured on hospital surveillance video, were the result of an overly aggressive hospital staff and the product of a father's instincts to protect his child.
