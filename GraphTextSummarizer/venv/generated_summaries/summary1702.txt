Transocean said it's possible that individual alarms might be providing notification of "minor issues or a non-emergency," and "repeated false alarms increase risk and decrease rig safety." Allen said the cap placed over the damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico will remain sealed and continue to stop oil from escaping even if the more than 2,000 people who have been working at the well site are off the water. Meanwhile, at a federal hearing in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Friday, a Deepwater Horizon chief engineering technician testified that the rig's general alarm system -- which is designed to detect a sudden rise in natural gas -- had been disabled because rig managers "did not want people woke up at 3 in the morning due to false alarms." If the storm continues on its path, it could slam into the area of the BP oil spill and possibly push more oil to shore. Allen also addressed the "good and bad part" of a tropical storm hitting the Gulf region: While he acknowledged how a storm surge could drive the oil into beach and marsh areas, where it would have not been driven otherwise, Allen says the increased weather activity may "actually help" disperse the oil.
