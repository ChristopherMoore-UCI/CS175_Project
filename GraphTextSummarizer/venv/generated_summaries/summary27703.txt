Confronted and questioned at the Raleigh airport on July 25, Greenoe initially said they were non-working samples that belonged to Jolie Rouge, according to the complaint, but later told authorities that he bought the weapons "as a means to provide high quality firearms to his employees while providing overseas maritime protection," since he could not buy high quality weapons overseas. The availability of firearms poses a serious risk and our investigation will be continuing over the coming weeks and months." After being brought into the country, allegedly by Greenoe, the firearms were then sold in Britain, court documents said. Greenoe's defense attorney, Mark Edwards of Durham, North Carolina, declined comment to CNN on Tuesday. TITAN, a task force in Britain's North West region for serious and organized crimes, said in a statement Tuesday it was also investigating Greenoe. Steven Neal Greenoe is suspected of buying more than 60 firearms in North Carolina and transporting them to England on at least nine occasions, according to court documents.
