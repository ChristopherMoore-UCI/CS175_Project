Maxim Healthcare Services is a leading provider of home health services throughout the United States, and bills federal health care programs for care it provides to patients. The case came to the attention of authorities when Richard West, a Medicaid beneficiary in New Jersey, called the Department of Health and Human Services to complain about billing irregularities in his Medicaid statements, according to Tom O'Donnell, the special agent in charge at the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General that covers the New York and New Jersey region. He estimated that between 3% and 10% of health care costs in federal programs are lost to fraud. The details of the settlement with Maxim Healthcare Services were announced Monday in a press conference at the U.S. attorney's office in the District of New Jersey, in Newark. Maxim said in Monday's statement that its conduct "did not adversely affect patient health or patient care."
