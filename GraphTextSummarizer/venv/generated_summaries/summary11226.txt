So will Davis open the floodgate of girls playing sports that boys traditionally play, wondered Norville, the television host and best-selling author? What do you think Mo'ne Davis' impact will be on girls and sports? And the more athletes such as Davis who can command the attention of men, women, boys and girls alike, the more success for women's sports, which still don't get the respect, attention and TV contracts that male-dominated sports receive. She's an inspiration to any little girl who wants to play baseball some day -- and to all the women who know firsthand the doubters and naysayers that Davis has no doubt encountered on her path to World Series history. The message to girls is pursue your dreams no matter what, said Orender, who has created a nonprofit called Generation W focusing on inspiring women and girls.
