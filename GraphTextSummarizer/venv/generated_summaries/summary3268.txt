Infants who undergo surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia in their first two years of life may be at increased risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as they grow older. Still, there is some evidence that suggests a link between general anesthesia and ADHD is plausible. By contrast, infants who had two or more experiences with anesthesia had a dramatically higher 17.9% chance of developing ADHD, according to the study, which appears this week in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Very few young children undergo surgery requiring general anesthesia, and those who do typically have serious medical conditions that can't be ignored. Concerns about the potential impact of general anesthesia on brain development first arose about 10 years ago, after studies showed that young animals exposed to anesthesia had brain changes that were associated with behavioral problems.
