Some residents still take food to radiation monitoring stations to ensure safety. However, checking food for radiation is not cheap. "We have around five to seven customers a day come and check their food for a fee of Â¥3,500 ($42)," says Hidetake Ishimaru, a member of Measuring Stations for Children of the Future, a non-profit organization that sets up stations around Tokyo to test for radiation in food. "Absolute values are very hard to measure," says Pieter Franken, director of Japan Operations at Safecast, a non-profit organization that collects and shares radiation measurements. After an earthquake-triggered tsunami engulfed the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant in northeastern Japan, setting off the most serious radiation scare since the 1986 Chernobyl accident, Japan is still struggling to build a centralized radiation-detection system, leading to difficulty in measuring radiation and ambiguous safety guidelines.
