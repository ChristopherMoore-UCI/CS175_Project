" The study was also conducted by Nir Halevy, acting assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Adam Galinsky, professor of management and organizations at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. "But it was people who had power and lacked status who used their power to require other persons to engage in demeaning behavior." The research found that "individuals in high-power/low-status roles chose more demeaning activities for their partners (e.g., bark like a dog, say "I am filthy") than did those in any other combination of power and status roles." "Our findings indicate that the experience of having power without status, whether as a member of the military or a college student participating in an experiment, may be a catalyst for producing demeaning behaviors that can destroy relationships and impede goodwill," the study said. "We found that people who had high power and high status, they were pretty cool," Fast told CNN. -- A new study by three universities shows that people holding positions of power with low status tend to demean others, one of the authors said.
