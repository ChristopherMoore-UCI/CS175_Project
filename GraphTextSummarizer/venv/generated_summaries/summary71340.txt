-- Oxfam will relocate workers and scale back operations in South Sudan's Upper Nile state following a surge of violence along the border with Sudan Those two states, along with the Nuba Mountain region, straddle Sudan and South Sudan's ethnic and political lines. The aerial attacks in Upper Nile state follow the bombing Thursday of the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan's oil-rich Unity state, which prompted an international outcry. Tensions have been rising since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July. "Such attacks represent a dangerous escalation of the situation and serve to increase tension at a time when Sudan and South Sudan need to reach a negotiated solution on outstanding issues."
