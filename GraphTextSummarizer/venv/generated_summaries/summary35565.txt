The accident comes as Brazil faces an approaching deadline to finish construction on its World Cup stadiums. The Arena Corinthians is one of the venues that will host World Cup matches in 2014. Brazil suffered a setback last month when a judge ordered the suspension of construction at another host venue due to safety concerns. The judge stopped work at the Arena de Baixada, in the city of Curitiba, over concerns that workers were in danger of "being buried, run over, falling from heights and being hit by material, among other serious risks. "We are less concerned with timelines," Andres Sanchez, the former president of Corinthians, told reporters, according to Agencia Brasil.
