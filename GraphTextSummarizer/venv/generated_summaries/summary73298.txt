The new regulations, which came into force on December 1, ban various acts being depicted in online pornography produced in the United Kingdom, including face-sitting, female ejaculation and spanking, in part to protect children from being exposed to potentially harmful content. 'Canary in the coalmine of free speech' Myles Jackman, a lawyer specializing in sexual liberties and obscenity law, has also opposed the new regulations. What he describes as a "declaration of state censorship" will affect millions of consenting adults who choose to view British pornography, he said. "The whole point of the law was to protect people against violent acts of sex, but who can state what is violence when you've got consenting adults?" she said. She told CNN that the bill could be perceived as being sexist because the banning of certain acts appears to target women's sexual enjoyment.
