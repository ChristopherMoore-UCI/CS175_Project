Since 2003, Bella Coola has whisked guests from Vancouver to this remote paradise. But Bella Coola Heli Sports has a genius Plan B, C, D, and so on, for the inevitable down days. Summer and fall rates at Tweedsmuir Lodge include a two-night minimum, and during peak grizzly bear season, which runs Sept. 1-Oct. 14, guests must book three- to five-night packages at $2,272 to $3,555 ($2,480-- $3,880 Canadian) Conceived as an exclusive year-round resort appealing to the hard-core athlete looking for the kind of snow porn experience they've seen in ski movies, Bella Coola also keeps the grumpy, grounded adventurer content. I don't get a nibble even though trout can be caught year round in the Bella Coola Valley, about 1,000 kilometers north of Vancouver.
