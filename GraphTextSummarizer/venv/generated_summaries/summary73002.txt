-- Floyd Mayweather will not be fighting Shane Mosley for a world title on May 1 after the "Money Man" refused to pay the World Boxing Association's sanctioning fee. The five-time world champion takes on Mosley in Las Vegas on May 1 but insists his legacy is more important to him than fighting for "Sugar Shane's" welterweight title. "I did not want to fight for the WBA title," Mayweather told Sky Sports. Mayweather referred to his opponent as "a solid welterweight with great accomplishments," but dismissed his chances of a victory at the MGM Grand. When Shane punches, a lot of times he closes his eyes.
