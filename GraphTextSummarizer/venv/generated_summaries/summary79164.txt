Blues legend B.B. King was hospitalized for dehydration, though the ailment didn't keep him out for long. B.B. is short for Blues Boy, part of the name he used as a Memphis disc jockey, the Beale Street Blues Boy. King, 89, has used various models of Gibson guitars over the years, and named each one of them Lucille. Some of his hits include "The Thrill Is Gone," which won him his first Grammy in 1970, "There Must be a Better World Somewhere" and "When Love Comes to Town," a collaboration with U2. King's dehydration was caused by his Type II diabetes, but he "is much better," his daughter, Claudette King, told the Los Angeles Times.
