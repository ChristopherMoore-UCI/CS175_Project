Sheriff's deputies in San Bernardino County released composite sketches of the suspects during a news conference on Tuesday. Two men broke into a house in the San Bernardino area on Sunday and tied up the boy, Briant Rodriguez, his mother and other siblings. Both suspected kidnappers are Hispanic males -- one 5-feet, 5 inches tall, between the ages of 18 and 20 with a thin build, unknown hair and eye color, last seen wearing a black baseball hat, blue jeans and green T-shirt. Briant Rodriguez, 3, was taken by armed men during a home invasion in San Bernardino, Caifornia, police say. They said the parents are not suspects.
