It was the first major loss of a loved one for the boy with autism from North Baddesley, England, who relies on a consistent routine to avoid meltdowns, his father, Ross Goodall, said Things finally began to take a turn for better on Monday, when Thomas received a comforting video message from actor Peter Capaldi, who plays Thomas' favorite TV character on "Doctor Who." After Thomas' grandmother died, Ross Goodall reached out to Capaldi through his agent and explained that Thomas was having a hard time dealing with the death of his grandmother. When Capaldi took over the role from Smith in 2013, it was a big deal for Thomas, Ross Goodall said. His signature outfit consists of a checkered shirt, suspenders and bow tie in honor of the 11th incarnation of the time-traveling doctor played by Matt Smith -- one of Thomas' favorite doctors. -- The past few weeks have been hard for 9-year-old Thomas Goodall, who lost his grandmother in early October.
