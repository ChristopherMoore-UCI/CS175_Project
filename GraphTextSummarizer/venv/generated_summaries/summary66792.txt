As the nation choked on its cornflakes, many took to social media to express shock and dismay and repeat the question, "Is this a joke?" At an Australia Day function in Canberra, Abbott was forced to defend his decision and dismissed the reaction on Twitter as "electronic graffiti." At the time, Abbott said the honor of becoming a "Knight and Dame of the Order of Australia" would be extended to "Australians of extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit." Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Australia had entered a timewarp to extend the honor to English royalty. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has shirt-fronted the Australian public by awarding a Knighthood to a foreigner who already has a lot silverware in the pool room: Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. He married in Queen Elizabeth II in 1947, who is head of the Commonwealth and is required to sign off on Abbott's decision, an irony not lost on Australia's comedians.
