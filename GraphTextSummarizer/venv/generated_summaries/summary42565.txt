Ending years of speculation over the future leader of one of India's largest and most influential business groups, Tata Sons Wednesday named 43-year-old Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as the successor to business icon Ratan Tata, the man who has led the $80 billion conglomerate for the past two decades. Mistry is not new to the group; he has been on the board of Tata Sons since 2006 and will now serve as the group's deputy chairman until Ratan Tata retires in December 2012. His family owns 18% stake in Tata Sons, making the family the second biggest share-holder behind Tata Trust which has a 67% stake. At home, Tata made headlines when he launched what he has described as his favorite venture the Tata Nano -- the world's cheapest car. With more than 100 companies in various sectors from steel to automobiles to tea, spread across 80 countries, Tata Sons employs almost half a million people around the world.
