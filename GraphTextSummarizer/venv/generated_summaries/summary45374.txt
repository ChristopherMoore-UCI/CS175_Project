The Glazers have been criticized by United fans after it was revealed that their takeover involved a £660 million debt in finance leveraging, which they have been paying off with club revenue since. British media have renewed speculation that Qatar's royal family will make an offer of a reported £1.8 billion ($2.9 billion) for a club that U.S. billionaire Malcolm Glazer and his family bought in 2005 at an overall value of £800 million. While domestic matchday income for the period dropped slightly from £33.1 million to £32.8 million, and media revenue stayed similar, commercial turnover including overseas merchandising climbed from £19.2 million ($31 million) to £25.5 million ($41 million). "The board notes recent press speculation regarding a possible bid for Manchester United," the statement said. United's bid to win a record 19th domestic crown continues at Wigan on Saturday as Alex Ferguson's team seek to restore a four-point lead over second-placed Arsenal -- who face Birmingham in Sunday's League Cup final.
