I went from getting feelings to having dreams, to seeing symbols that meant things, to seeing things actually happening to other people, to feeling that what's happening to other people is happening to me. With modern technology and the frantic pace of life, most people today spend their lives running. I say to people, "You don't walk down stairs blindfolded, you don't drive a car blindfolded -- why would you want to make massive life-changing decisions when you can't see what you're doing? I'll tell you a group who uses intuition: people who do martial arts. I've given lots of talks, to all kinds of groups, and sometimes you'll get people -- usually men -- who will say, "I think it's a load of old rubbish."
