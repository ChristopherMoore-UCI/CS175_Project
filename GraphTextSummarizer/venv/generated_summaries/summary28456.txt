Escalante, 79, was surrounded by his wife, children and grandchildren when he died at his home in Roseville, California, said Edward James Olmos. "Stand and Deliver" told the inspirational story of how Escalante turned the failing calculus program at Garfield High School in east Los Angeles into one of the top in the nation. Olmos visited Escalante's bedside Monday night, he said. "He really made us understand that it didn't matter what color, race, creed or ethnicity any of us are." Olmos disclosed earlier this month that Escalante was "seriously ill" with cancer and needed help paying for his medical care. "We lost one of the true giants of education and inspiration in this country," Olmos said.
