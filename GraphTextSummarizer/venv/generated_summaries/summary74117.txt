How could a person expect to live free of discrimination in a country where a majority of states don't protect gay people from being fired or evicted because of who they are? The reality is that gay people, especially in sometimes-hostile states like Mississippi, which I visited last year to report on LGBT rights, spend a lot of their time trying to cover up who they are because they fear discrimination. Uganda last month passed a law intensifying criminal penalties for homosexual acts. Or that, because LGBT people can't be readily branded as gay, they don't deserve special protections under the law. These bills vary, but the undercurrent is that some religious groups want protection so that they could, in some instances, deny services to LGBT people based on their religious beliefs.
