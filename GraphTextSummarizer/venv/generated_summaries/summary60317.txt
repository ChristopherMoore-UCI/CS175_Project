Watch what the jurors have to say Â» Spector went on trial in April, charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of B-movie queen Lana Clarkson after a night out in the clubs of Hollywood. Normally reclusive, Spector had spent a rare night out on the town, found Clarkson at the House of Blues at closing time and invited her home for a drink in the wee hours of February 3, 2003. Prosecutors pointed to the leopard print purse slung over Clarkson's shoulder as evidence she was trying to leave when she was shot. Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson  was depressed over a recent breakup, grabbed the gun and  took her own life. At issue was whether Spector pulled the trigger -- or whether Clarkson did.
