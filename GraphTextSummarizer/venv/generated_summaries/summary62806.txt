The FDA advises dog owners whose pets are exhibiting such symptoms as fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain and nausea to seek immediate veterinary assistance. -- A leading pet product company has issued a voluntary recall of nearly 75,000 bags of dog treats due to salmonella concerns, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Hartz is urging dog owners who have purchased the recalled treats to immediately throw them away. Consumers with questions regarding the recall should contact Hartz at 1-800-275-1414.
