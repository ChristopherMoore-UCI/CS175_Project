The virus could be adapting to better grow and cause disease in humans, said Dr. Mark Denison, a professor of pediatrics and longtime coronavirus researcher at Vanderbilt University. Another previously reported Saudi Arabian patient also died from the disease, which lacks a cure or vaccine. A full genetic series, obtained from four infected cases in Al-Ahsa, was recorded in the gene bank, said ministry spokesman Dr. Khalid Marghlani. In addition, fewer MERS infections have been seen in health care workers than during the SARS epidemic, the WHO said. It helps us understand the virologic evidence of person-to-person transmission."
