The story does end on a (slightly) positive note: Thanks to the work of Marion's grandson, Elbert Marion, Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey granted Jack Marion a posthumous pardon in 1987, 100 years after his execution. Not the Marion type William Jackson Marion and Jack Cameron met at a Kansas boarding house in 1872. The Brothers Boorn In May of 1812, when Richard Colvin vanished, speculation amongst the townspeople of Manchester, Vermont, was that his brothers-in-law, Jesse and Stephen Boorn, were responsible. The trial and conviction of Jack Marion was seriously abbreviated. Along their journey, the two made a brief stop in Beatrice, Nebraska to visit Marion's in-laws before moving on.
