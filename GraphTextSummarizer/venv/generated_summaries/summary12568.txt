On a blistering hot July morning, Debbie Higgins arrived at Arlington National Cemetery to honor the memory of her son, Marine Lance Cpl. With hands over their hearts or raised to their foreheads in salute, family members watched and listened as a wreath was laid on the tomb and a single trumpet played "Taps." After the ceremony, a motorcade made its way through the cemetery grounds to Section 60, the part of Arlington where many of the fallen soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. The service was part of a weekend of remembrance for relatives of U.S. military personnel killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. The seat of the motorcycle is made from the door of the Hummer in which Higgins' son was fatally wounded during his last tour in Iraq just a week before he was scheduled to come home. But Higgins has also made her own personal tribute to her son: a motorcycle, painted with his image, which carries the symbol and motto of the U.S. Marine Corps: Semper Fidelis -- Always Faithful.
