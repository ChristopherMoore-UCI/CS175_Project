Security forces used tear gas and batons in some areas to break up unruly demonstrations, Police Commissioner A.K.M Shahidul Hoque told CNN by phone from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. The opposition BNP called Sunday's general strike, the first in Bangladesh in over three years, to protest against the governance of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, additional home secretary for Bangladesh, told CNN that road traffic in the city of Dhaka was relatively less. Hasina's Awami League party-led alliance swept Bangladesh elections in December 2008 in a landslide. Officers said they provoked the strikers to damage public property.
