After last week's investigation at the Buddhist temple, authorities arrested a woman on charges of performing illegal abortions and opening an unlicensed clinic, said Col. Sombat Milintachinda, chief of the investigation team. Police said the fetuses came from illegal abortion clinics. The law would decrease the death rate of women during abortion and reduce the rate of deformed or disabled babies born during botched procedures, he said. The proposed law would allow unprepared, underage mothers and poor parents who can't afford to feed their children to get abortions, lawmaker Satit Pitutacha said. Abortion is illegal in Thailand, unless a woman is endangered by pregnancy or has been raped.
