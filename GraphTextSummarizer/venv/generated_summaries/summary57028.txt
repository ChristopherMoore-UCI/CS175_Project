The mission is to reduce terrorist and criminal activity by improving and expanding biometric identification as well as criminal history information services. Facial recognition is a key part of the agency's ambitious $1 billion Next Generation Identification System (NGI) -- a state-of-the-art biometric identification system that also includes iris scans, DNA analysis and voice identification. Facial recognition is a computer-based system that automatically identifies a person based on a digital image or video source -- which is then matched to information stored in a database. From fighting terrorism to processing payments in the blink of an eye, facial recognition is set to change our ideas on privacy. But facial recognition technology isn't always so straightforward.
