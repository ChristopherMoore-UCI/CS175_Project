-- An Enigma machine which featured in a Hollywood movie about the codebreakers of World War II has smashed auction estimates and sold for a world record price. Other items sold at the auction included a 104-year-old cookie taken on polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition. The story of the codebreakers has inspired several books, and a movie starring Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet. Christie's said the previous record for an Enigma machine was Â£67,250, at the same auction house, in November 2010. The Enigma machine sold Thursday was one of several used in the 2001 film.
