In Louisiana, where Blackwater was contracted to supply security services after Katrina, employees there "submitted a variety of bogus receipts," the suit said. " The suit said Blackwater overbilled for travel expenses and "created phone invoices to obscure the fact that Blackwater had failed to keep any of the necessary contemporaneous documentation on travel." It said Blackwater didn't monitor the "deadly weapons" it provided employees and "lost track of countless weapons. Melan Davis, who was involved in record-keeping, said Blackwater billed the government for prostitution services in Afghanistan from a Filipino female, whose name was on Blackwater's payroll roster under a category called "Morale Welfare Recreation." The married couple filed suit in December 2008 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia under the False Claims Act.
