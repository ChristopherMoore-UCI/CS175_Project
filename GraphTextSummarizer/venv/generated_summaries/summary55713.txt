The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. "We ... continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from Yemen and have capabilities postured in the area to address them," State Department Spokesman Jeff Rathke said late Saturday. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions.
