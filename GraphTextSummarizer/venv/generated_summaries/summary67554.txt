I think it can be a brilliant solution to the problem of adults wanting a child in their lives or wanting more children in their lives and the problem of children who want parents in their lives. That's not the situation for the majority of orphanage children around the world, who don't have caring grandparents or aunts and uncles a short walk or bike ride away. "I think it really highlights the bigger picture that there are so many children living in poverty in Malawi, and while Madonna has good intentions ... children would be better off staying in their own communities whenever possible," said Karen Hansen-Kuhn, policy director for ActionAid USA, a development group that also works in Malawi. I think it gives people an odd perspective on what international adoption can mean for children who don't have any support network outside the walls of an orphanage. ... There's a culture in orphanages that children are eager to escape from, and it's a culture of being reared as a group and not being doted upon by parents.
