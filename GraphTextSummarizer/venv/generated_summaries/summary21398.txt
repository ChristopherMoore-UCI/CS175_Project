-- Classic rockers Van Halen on Thursday abruptly postponed more than 30 tour dates, following their June 26 concert in New Orleans. Roth left the band in 1985 after a falling-out with guitarist/founder Eddie Van Halen and was replaced by vocalist Sammy Hagar, who was with the band until 1996. At different times, Eddie Van Halen has undergone treatment for alcoholism and cancer. The band is on tour in support of its new album, "A Different Kind of Truth" -- the first complete album with original lead singer David Lee Roth since the platinum-selling "1984," which was released on the last day of 1983. Van Halen, which formed in 1974, has a turbulent history.
