The strongest tornado, rated a maximum EF5 on the Fujita Tornado Scale, tracked for nearly an hour and a half along a 38-mile path from Chickasha through south Oklahoma City and the suburbs of Bridge Creek, Newcastle, Moore, Midwest City and Del City. Moore is located between Oklahoma City and Norman -- home to the University of Oklahoma -- on the south side of the metropolitan area. -- Monday afternoon's devastating tornado in the Oklahoma City suburbs brought to mind a May 1999 EF5 twister that killed 36 people and smashed some of the same communities. Monday's tornado in Oklahoma city, with a preliminary rating of at least EF4, also struck Moore and Newcastle. The second deadliest tornado in the Oklahoma City area occurred on June 12, 1942, with 35 residents killed, according to the National Weather Service.
