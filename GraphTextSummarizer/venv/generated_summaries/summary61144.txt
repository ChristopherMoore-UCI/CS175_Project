Cassadee Pope wins season three of "The Voice" Pope -- a native of West Palm Beach, Florida, and the former lead singer of the Warped Tour vets Hey Monday -- admits she was hesitant at first to audition for "The Voice." 'The Voice:' Season three awards Pope evolved significantly as a singer on The Voice, shedding her pop-punk roots and embracing country music, the genre of choice for mentor Blake Shelton. But after moving to Los Angeles to try her hand at a solo career, struggling to pay the bills and exhausting all her contacts in the music business, Pope says she was forced to reconsider her options when The Voice came calling again. In addition to winning the show, Pope, 23, is still coming to grips with the fact that she sang "I'm With You," one of her "all-time favorite songs," with its original vocalist, Avril Lavigne. While initially dismissive of the genre, Pope says now that she sees many similarities between it and her more familiar pop-rock.
