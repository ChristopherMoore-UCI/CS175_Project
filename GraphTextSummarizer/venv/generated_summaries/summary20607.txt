According to the California Innocence Project, the woman later admitted that Banks had not kidnapped or raped her during a consensual encounter at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where Banks was a middle linebacker with a scholarship offer from the University of Southern California. At age 17, fearing a potentially long sentence, the college football prospect followed the advice of his attorney and pleaded no contest to assaulting a Long Beach, California, high school classmate in 2002. "Our standard is beyond a reasonable doubt," spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said, referring further questions to Long Beach police. "We do not believe Mr. Banks did the crime he pled guilty to," Deputy District Attorney Brentford Ferreira said after court. Although he did not have the opportunity to play college football, Banks maintains a dream of playing for the National Football League.
