To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets. The data could be used to inform public policy, allowing public officials and politicians to receive feedback from their constituents in real time. This is why researchers owe a debt of gratitude to Twitter for its policy of open access to public tweets (exemplified by the recent donation of its entire public tweet history to the Library of Congress). Our study is preliminary; we need more data to do a proper evaluation, and the results are subject to any number of biases (people using language differently across the United States, and different demographics using Twitter at different times). Even so, initial results demonstrate that Twitter data contain a wealth of information, and that even relatively simplistic approaches such as ours can extract interesting results.
