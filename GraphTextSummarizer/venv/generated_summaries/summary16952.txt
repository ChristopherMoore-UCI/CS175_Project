Bono talks to B.B. King in exclusive clip Guitarist Hamish Anderson, whose band was serving as King's opening act during the trek, tweeted, "Very sad to hear the news of BB King's sickness and subsequent cancellation of the tour. B.B. King is friends with everybody "[King] was immediately evaluated by a doctor and diagnosed with dehydration and suffering from exhaustion whereby causing the eight remaining shows of his current tour to be canceled," King's official site posted. Blues legend B.B. King was forced to cancel the remainder of his current tour after falling ill following a October 3 show at Chicago's House of Blues. The 89-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer had eight gigs left on his current trek, including stops at his namesake B.B. King Blues Club in New York. "The combination of the rigors of the very long drive and high blood sugar due to his medication error resulted in a performance that did not match Mr. King's usual standard of excellence," the statement read.
