"I think he was a misguided young man who got manipulated by social media." During questioning at the airport, Mohammed Khan told FBI agents that a person he met online had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in Istanbul, federal authorities said in October. That person, Khan allegedly told the agents, was to take him to ISIS territory. Now Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, is accused of trying to support ISIS. Authorities arrested Mohammed Khan at O'Hare International Airport in October as he was about to embark on a flight to Istanbul. Turkey, the complaint notes, is a common transit point for foreign fighters from Western countries who travel to join ISIS.
