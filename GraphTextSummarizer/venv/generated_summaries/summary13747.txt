Azeri Defense Minister Safar Abiyev pledged Tuesday in Tehran not to allow other nations to use Azerbaijan's territory to launch attacks on other countries, particularly Iran, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. In turn, Iran has furiously accused Azerbaijan of allowing the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, to launch terrorist operations across the border. -- Authorities in Azerbaijan have arrested 22 people they say were spying for Iran and plotting attacks on Israeli and Western targets, the government announced Wednesday. His comments followed a warning from Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi last month against aiding Israel in such attacks, the news agency reported. Israeli and Western counterterrorism officials believe that elements within the Iranian regime most likely sponsored the plots in Azerbaijan, looking for revenge after the killing of several Iranian nuclear scientists.
