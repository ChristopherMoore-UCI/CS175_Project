The superintendent of police for Sultanpur district, Pratibha Ambedkar, was preparing for a visit by state Chief Minister, Akhilesh Yadav when she got a call from her office about a man threatening to set himself on fire. Police said Durgesh Kumar Singh came out of the crowd Monday as India's state-owned television station Doordarshan recorded the debate at a park in Sultanpur, about 100 miles from the city of Lucknow. "People were just too shocked to know what was happening," local photographer Pankaj Kumar Gupta told reporters. During elections, several news channels often stage shows in villages and towns across the country, engaging politicians with local voters. Voting in Uttar Pradesh, one of the country's most populous states, began Wednesday morning.
