Serie A side Napoli have completed the signing of Argentine international Gonzalo Higuain from Real Madrid. The Uruguayan striker, who scored 29 goals for Napoli last term, joined French champions Paris Saint Germain earlier this month in a deal worth a French record â‚¬64 million ($84 million). The Argentine joins a growing list of new signings as Napoli's new manager Rafa Benitez prepares for an assault on both the Serie A title and the Champions League. Striker Jose Callejon and defender Raul Albiol both joined the Italian club from Madrid earlier this month while Belgian international winger Dries Mertens signed from Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in June. "Real Madrid C. F. announces that Gonzalo Higuain has been transferred to Naples," read the statement.
