-- A 21-year-old Hofstra University junior was fatally shot early Friday in an exchange of gunfire between a suspected home invader and police who came to the house, officials said. Andrea Rebello lived with her twin sister in an off-campus house in Uniondale, New York. "They were best friends by choice." Conklin-Spillane said while on her way to Sleepy Hollow High School in New York she heard a student had been killed. When police arrived, there was an exchange of gunfire that left Andrea and the suspect dead. At some point during the night, the twins' female roommate was able to leave the home and call police, a Nassau County police spokesman told CNN on Friday.
