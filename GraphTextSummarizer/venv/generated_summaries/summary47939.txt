In contrast, the first sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived at Arapahoe and entered almost immediately after the shooting was reported, Sheriff Grayson Robinson said. It occurred within 17 miles of two other infamous Colorado gun rampagesâ€”the Aurora movie theater shooting and Columbine High. On April 20, 1999, the Columbine High mass shooting happened about 8 miles from Arapahoe High. Arapahoe is part of the Littleton Public School district and Columbine part of the Jefferson County School District. The timing and location of the Arapahoe High School shooting make it certain that memories of other mass shootings won't go away.
