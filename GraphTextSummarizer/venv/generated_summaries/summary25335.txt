Family members of some victims in those cases told "Larry King Live" the LAPD should have notified them about the exhibit. " "This is an opportunity for homicide investigators from all over the country to get together, to share ideas, to share best practices and to talk about some of the most famous cases in Los Angeles history, as well as their current cases." The exhibit opened to the public Wednesday, and "thousands of guests have stood in lines for up to two hours to glimpse Los Angeles' history," said the letter from Cooley and Beck. " "It's about the history of Los Angeles, as told through the eyes of homicide investigators of the Los Angeles Police Department," Beck said Tuesday on CNN's "Larry King Live. In addition, Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley and Police Chief Charlie Beck, in an open letter Thursday, apologized to any other victims' family members who might have been offended by the other items in the exhibit, running Tuesday through Thursday at the California Homicide Investigators Association's 2010 conference.
