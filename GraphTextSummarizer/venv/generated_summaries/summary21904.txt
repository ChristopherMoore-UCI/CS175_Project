Facebook Home is a free Android app that makes some mild changes to a phone's lock screen and home screen to deliver more Facebook features. The main app screen has three new buttons along the top for posting a status or photo or checking into a location on Facebook. Swipe left or right to see the usual selection of Android apps, which have suffered a bit of a demotion in the Facebook Home world. You can like or comment on a status update or image directly from this screen, tap and hold to get a better look at photos, and swipe to flip through the updates going back in time. Camera shortcuts are common on most smartphone lock screens, and it seems like a curious omission seeing as how most people are taking those photos just to put them on Facebook or Instagram.
