The announcement from the president marks the first step in NATO's long-awaited plan to hand over security to a series of provinces across the country, leading up to 2014 when it is expected that Afghan security forces will be in control of the whole country. -- Seven areas of Afghanistanwill begin to be handed over to Afghan forces to maintain their security in July, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said on Tuesday. During that speech, Karzai credited the influx of 70,000 international forces in 2010 for improving the situation and helping Afghan security forces. Certainly Afghans will be in the lead but we are still here and will still help," said Lt. Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. "We are determined to demonstrate Afghan leadership and ownership of the transition process," he said.
