CNN: How does it feel to be part of Paris film history and growing up in the birthplace of modern cinema? Mathieu Kassovitz: It's very inspirational to have seen all these movies that made French movie history and film history, period, and being able to go to the same places and see where all these pre-war movies were made. Paris is still the same as it was, so the spirit is the same also and it's kind of elevating for us directors to be in a town with a city soul, a lot of soul. Paris is a city with soul, it's a city with a past. CNN: What do you think it is about Paris that encourages creativity in people?
