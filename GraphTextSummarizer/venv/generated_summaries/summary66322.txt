Before the plane could take flight, Cho ordered Park to get off the plane, Kim said. Kim said she was coached by Korean Air not to mention Cho's yelling and physical abuse. The flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts testified that she and the chief flight attendant knelt before Heather Cho, the former vice president at Korean Air, and the daughter of the airline's chairman in apology. After the incident, Kim said she was told by a Korean Air manager what to tell South Korean investigators from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. She added that she never received an apology from Cho, also known by her Korean name, Cho Hyun-ah.
