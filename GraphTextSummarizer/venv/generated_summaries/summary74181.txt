CNN: You all have day jobs, don't you? We've got guys in Chicago, Vegas, Atlanta, here in New York. No Chaser sang for CNN in New York recently, talked about their surprising career turn and where it leaves their day jobs. Watch Straight No Chaser blend their voices Â» "Holiday Spirits" mostly features festive covers such as "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" and "Silent Night," all sung in the a cappella tradition but with creative and entertaining tweaks. We hope that that momentum -- not only with YouTube, but with our album -- keeps going so we can get right back in the studio and come out with some fresh new music that's not holiday.
