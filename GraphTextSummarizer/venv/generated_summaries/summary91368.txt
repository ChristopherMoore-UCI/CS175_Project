Islamabad, Pakistan -- A Pakistani government minister who had said he was getting death threats because of his opposition to a controversial blasphemy law was shot to death Wednesday. Bhatti had been critical of the law, saying at one point, "I am ready to sacrifice my life for the principled stand I have taken because the people of Pakistan are being victimized under the pretense of blasphemy law. "The assassination today of Shahbaz Bhatti in Pakistan -- a true hero for human rights and religious freedom for all -- illustrates how barbaric that country's system of blasphemy laws really is. He was shot and killed in Islamabad on Wednesday morning, Pakistani police said. Blasphemy laws don't keep the peace, but embolden extremists," said Leonard Leo, the commission's chair.
