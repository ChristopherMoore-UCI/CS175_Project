-- Former South African President Nelson Mandela is now in critical condition "We have seen the latest reports from the South African government that former President Mandela is in critical condition," Caitlin Hayden, a U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement. "The African National Congress joins the presidency in calling upon all of us to keep President Mandela, his family and his medical team in our thoughts and prayers during this trying time," it said. Last year, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front. Mandela's impact extends far beyond South African borders.
