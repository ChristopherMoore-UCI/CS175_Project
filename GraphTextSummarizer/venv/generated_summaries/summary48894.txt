Fight Network's Sarah Davis wrote, "I can appreciate all the cameos made by UFC personalities and fighters, whether they play themselves or not and there are a lot of fight scenes with superman punches, Kimura locks and body shots." Since "The King of Queens," James has made a name for himself in the PG arena, headlining family films like "Paul Blart: Mall Cop" and "Zookeeper." Some people have the idea that "Here Comes the Boom" is "just going to be Paul Blart falling around a ring, being the fat guy, tripping over his own feet," James said. " Part of James' appeal as the everyman is his size, which is occasionally written into his story lines, as fans of "The King of Queens" already know. That make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theater." James will next appear in "Little Boy" and "Grown Ups 2," which is due out in July 2013. "This is for families and for kids." "Here Comes the Boom" is a very different kind of physical comedy, full of knockouts and arm bars.
