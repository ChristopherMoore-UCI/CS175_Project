Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein aggressively defended her decision to release a controversial Senate torture report Tuesday, despite assertions from the CIA that interrogation techniques detailed in the report were effective in thwarting attack plans, capturing terrorists and saving American lives. In a testy interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room," Feinstein said she wasn't going to get into whether CIA Director John Brennan was lying about the torture techniques' effectiveness, but that "there's a big difference of opinion." The report, which details the CIA's extreme interrogation techniques used on terrorists after the September 11th attacks, was released by Feinstein's committee despite a last-minute pleas from Secretary of State John Kerry and members of Congress not to release the information to the public at this time. Asked if she would feel guilty if American lives were lost as a result of the report, Feinstein said, "I would feel very badly, of course. "If Mr. Brennan is making an argument that this kind of torture works, we can submit all kinds of experts to say it doesn't work," Feinstein said.
