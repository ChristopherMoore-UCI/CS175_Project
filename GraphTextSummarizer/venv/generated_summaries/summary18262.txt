CBC News reported the judge rejected her argument that Toronto animal services staff duped her and acted illegally by seizing Darwin. But after Darwin's public escape and appearance, she was fined and forced to hand Darwin over to animal services. The judge also ruled that Nakhuda purchased Darwin knowing that it was illegal and lied by later saying the animal was a gift, CBC News reported. Toyne said Darwin is making good progress, becoming a young adult macaque instead of a small child. Nakhuda vowed to get Darwin back and filed a lawsuit against the sanctuary.
