Monaco have come a long way in a very short space of time and, with the money the club's Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev has to spend, it is a team that has every chance of upsetting the status quo in French football next season. With a signing of this caliber (Real Madrid's experienced Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho will also play for Monaco next season), French football will seriously start closing the gap on the top European leagues. " Not that Monaco's "grand projet" has been universally welcomed by all in French football. "Monaco has enjoyed a position in French football that is totally unfair and that hasn't been questioned," France Football's English correspondent Philippe Auclair told CNN. Monaco said French Federation president Noel Le Graet, "acting on behalf of both the FFF and the LFP, demanded from AS Monaco FC a huge payment of $258 million in return for ending the current conflict without the club having to relocate its headquarters to France in order to remain in the French Championship."
