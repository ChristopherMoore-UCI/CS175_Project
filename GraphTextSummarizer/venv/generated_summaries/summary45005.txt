Gov. Chris Christie will meet with Prime Minister David Cameron when the New Jersey Republican heads to the United Kingdom for a trade mission this week, a trip that will give Christie a chance to strengthen his foreign policy credentials as he prepares for a potential presidential run. With the United Kingdom as New Jersey's third-largest trade partner -- more than $7 billion annually -- the governor is leading a delegation of New Jersey business leaders to meet with representatives in the life sciences industry, including pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Along with sharpening his foreign policy chops, the trip gives Christie a chance to prove that he's able to tone down his "Jersey Guy" persona. Christie's three-day tour -- his third international trip since September -- starts Sunday with a Premier League game between Arsenal and Aston Villa. Christie traveled to Mexico in September and to Canada in December, placing a heavy emphasis on energy policy while visiting the United States' neighbors.
