-- South Korean star Park Ji-sung has signed a two-year contract extension at English Premier League champions Manchester United. But last season he was a key figure as United completed a hat-trick of Premier League titles. Park, who will be a driving force in South Korea's World Cup challenge in South Africa next year, has played 127 times for United, scoring 12 goals. " Park has had to work hard to establish himself as a regular member of United's starting line-up and was devastated to be left out of the squad for their 2008 Champions League final success against Chelsea. The 28-year-old Park has been handed a contract extension at Manchester United.
