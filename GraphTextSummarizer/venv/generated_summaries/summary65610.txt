"That is why women and men in Texas and across the country strongly oppose attempts to deny funding to Planned Parenthood health centers, and will fight with us to ensure Planned Parenthood health center doors across America are open today and open tomorrow. Ending funding for birth control, annual exams, or cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood would hurt the millions of American women and families that rely on Planned Parenthood health centers for health care," Richards added. "Governor Rick Perry should not be able to decide which health centers a woman can go to for birth control, well-woman exams or cancer screenings," Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said. "This case isn't about Planned Parenthood â€” it's about the women who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers for basic care every day. With that new law, Texas is no longer eligible for federal funding for women's health and, therefore, Planned Parenthood and other such establishments in the state will no longer be able to receive federal funding.
