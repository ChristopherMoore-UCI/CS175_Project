Walt Stubbs, Camden Point fire chief, says not only will the new location give the fire department better access to the community, but it will help integrate the local ambulance district with the fire station, improving emergency response times. As for the sewage treatment plant, that will enable residents to do away with personal septic tanks. Mark and Cindy Hill of Dearborn, Missouri, had unlimited options. The Hills also donated a scholarship fund to nearby North Platte High School in Dearborn, where both graduated. The fire station will have direct access to highways, and the ball field will be set further away from one -- allowing the kids to play out of the range of traffic.
