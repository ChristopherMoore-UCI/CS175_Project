"Diversity is a problem -- the access people have to making films, getting their story told and getting recognition. " NPR television critic Eric Deggans pointed out in a recent piece on its website that "it is a landmark year in one sense: We are seeing more people of color nominated for major awards than we have in the past," while also noting that black actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris Elba were nominated in both film and TV categories at the Golden Globes. And while Welsh said it's great to see more diversity in this year's nominees, he believes it matters whether or not the awards are actually garnered. " This is an era when USA Today can cause an uproar by referring, as they did in a headline, to the mostly black cast film "The Best Man Holiday" as "race-themed" and where "Saturday Night Live" held special casting for black actresses after complaints that the show lacked diversity. -- This year's roster of awards show nominees are more diverse than has probably ever before been seen in Hollywood.
