Terms such as "Haitian" or "Negro" can be used in addition to "Black" or "African American." A newly published U.S. Army regulation said until Friday that a service member could be referred to as a "Negro" when describing "black or African American" personnel.

"The Army takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race, color, religion, gender and national origin."
