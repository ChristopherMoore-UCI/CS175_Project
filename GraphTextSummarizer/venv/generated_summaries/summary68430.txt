There's no arguing that Apple set the standard for modern mobile devices with the iPhone and the iPad. Meanwhile there are others, especially Samsung, that appear to be innovating at a pace faster than Apple can. Apple also isn't nearly as versatile at adding new software features to its devices. A lot of that has to do with Samsung's massive marketing budget, but you can't ignore the fact that the company has innovated a lot by creating popular new product categories that Apple is wary to try. The Note 10.1 launched last fall, but it received a software update with a new version of Android and a slew of other features like the voice assistant Google Now, which is a lot more impressive than Apple's original Siri.
