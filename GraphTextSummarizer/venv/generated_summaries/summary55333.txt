-- Republican Scott Brown lost his second Senate race in two election cycles on Tuesday, as Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen defeated him to win a second term, according to a CNN projection. Over the summer, Brown used a series of crises to nationalize the race -- arguing that President Barack Obama and, by extension, Senate Democrats like Shaheen, are unable to govern effectively. But Brown lost that seat two years later, in a campaign against a much tougher Democratic opponent -- liberal icon Elizabeth Warren. Shaheen, meanwhile, turned to core Democratic economic issues and issues affecting working class voters and women. Shaheen said late Tuesday night that Brown had called her to concede, and praised him for a "vigorous race."
