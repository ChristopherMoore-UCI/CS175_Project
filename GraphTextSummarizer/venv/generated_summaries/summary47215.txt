The two-minute personal message was published Tuesday, the same day as Lula was released from the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital in Sao Paulo, where he underwent his first round of chemotherapy this week. -- Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who remains a popular figure in his country, vowed in a video posted on YouTube to beat his recently diagnosed throat cancer. Lula, known for the social programs he implemented at the same time that Brazil's economy soared, was Brazil's most popular president in recent history. Lula then underwent his first chemotherapy session, which went "without incident," according to the hospital. His hand-picked successor, Dilma Rousseff -- a cancer survivor herself -- easily won the presidential election.
