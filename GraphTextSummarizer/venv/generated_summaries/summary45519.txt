William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the British throne after William, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, the British Cabinet Office said Monday. Baby news sparks media frenzy British bookmaker William Hill said it would be paying out "a small five-figure sum" to people who had placed bets on William and Catherine having a baby in 2013. The news that he and Catherine are expecting their first child after 19 months of marriage was announced by the palace Monday as she was admitted for treatment, and followed months of tabloid speculation. "We fully expect that the betting public will get involved in speculating what the baby will be called," said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Tuesday that all 16 countries that recognize the British monarch as their head of state have formally agreed to the change and British lawmakers will change the rules as soon as possible.
