In a 2007 interview on CNN's "Larry King Live," Haim and Feldman discussed their battles with drugs. The announcement comes before the coroner has ruled on what killed Haim, the 1980s teen movie actor who struggled for decades with drug addiction. Heaslip, manager to both Feldman and Haim, said Haim had seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death. The doctor said that "Haim was not feeling well" and he needed to know what drugs had been prescribed for the actor, the source said. Several prescription-drug bottles were taken from Haim's apartment, Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said Friday.
