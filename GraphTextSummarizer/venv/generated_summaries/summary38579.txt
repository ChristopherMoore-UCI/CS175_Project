It marked a fairytale ending for Ainslie, who had trailed Hogh-Christensen through the majority of the competition, only to take gold at the last in front of a vociferous crowd at Weymouth, on England's south coast. Earlier in the day, Team GB's Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson were piped to the Star gold medal by Sweden's Max Salminen and Fredrik Loof. But he said he was unlikely to defend his crown for a fifth time at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. The Briton kept himself ahead of his Danish rival but slipped down the field and was dangerously close to losing his gold when Postma challenged New Zealand's Dan Slater for second place. The 35-year-old came ninth in Sunday's medal race but, crucially, finished ahead of his main rival for the gold medal -- Denmark's Jonas Hogh-Christensen.
