Despite previous statements that he had no plans to see "The Social Network," Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg did, in fact, watch the film on the company's field trip to the movies last Friday. I just wrapped up an interview with Facebook's iconic founder and Groups Product Manager Justin Schaffer at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, California. He's been asked a lot of questions about what exactly happened during Facebook's early years, he said in our interview. While Zuckerberg skirted questions about his opinion of Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of his early years, the 26-year-old CEO did say he's interested to see what effect "The Social Network" has on entrepreneurship. We've said all along that Zuckerberg should like the Facebook movie.
