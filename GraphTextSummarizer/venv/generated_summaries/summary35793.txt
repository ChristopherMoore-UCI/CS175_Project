Here are five enclaves in North America where French culture thrives: Montreal,Quebec Settled by French fur traders and later captured by the British, Montreal grew into a bilingual city with dual identities. Around the corner, the cozy Caf√© Le St. Malo, with its exposed brick walls and roaring hearth fire, serves up the kind of rustic fare you find in the French countryside, such as cassoulet (a one-pot dish of white beans and meat such as pork sausage and duck confit) and boudin noir (blood sausage). Today, nearly 95% of the residents are native French speakers. In a nod to New Orleans' Gallic roots, French statesman Charles de Gaulle gave the city a Joan of Arc statue, an exact replica of one that stands in Orleans, which today presides over the French Market and is feted annually with a parade. Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, French territory A remnant of France's exploits in Canada, these rocky islands some 15 miles off the coast of Newfoundland were deeded to the republic in 1816 under the second Treaty of Paris after a century-long tussle with England.
