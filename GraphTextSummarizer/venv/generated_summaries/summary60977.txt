"Some people describe it as a hole, because there is literally not enough light coming from the surface to allow the eye to discern the contours that are in that foil," Surrey NanoSystem's Steve Northam told CNN. Instead, the material is designed to help air-borne cameras, telescopes and infrared scanning systems work more efficiently by reducing stray light. According to Ben Jensen, chief technology officer of Surrey NanoSystems, it was a "major breakthrough by UK industry in the application of nanotechnology to optical instrumentation." Conventional black, such as black paint or fabric, absorbs between 95% and 98% of light. " The material, whose development was backed by the UK's Technology Strategy Board, was launched at this year's Farnborough Airshow in southern England.
