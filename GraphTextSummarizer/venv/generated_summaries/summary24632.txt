The whole book was about meat, serious meat, the kind I'd never been any good at cooking: beef chuck, short ribs, leg of lamb, brisket. By the time he got to Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Dried Cranberry and Apple Stuffing and Cranberry-White Wine Reduction Sauce, Bill had bought a new meat thermometer, digital, with protruding wires and flashing lights that made it look as though he'd lifted the whole apparatus from an intensive care unit. Bill wanted more meat in our dinner menus, apparently, and had brought me an instruction manual -- 600 pages long, I couldn't help noticing, and with the same sort of heft as the sirloin pork roast in the picture. I would stand around the kitchen for a while, looking for some lettuce to wash, and finally Bill would stride in and start pulling out frying pans and turning on three burners at once and flipping through measuring cups. There was a silhouette of a pig, connected by arrows to detailed line drawings of 13 hefty-looking cuts of raw meat.
