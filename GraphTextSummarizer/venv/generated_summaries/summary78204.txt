There were still a few artists who shone brightly thanks to a boost from a particular song -- such as Lorde with "Royals" and Robin Thicke with "Blurred Lines" -- but even those musicians have much more to offer beyond those undeniable hits of 2013. Where 2012 was dominated by artists who were carried on the strength of one song -- Carly Rae Jepsen, Gotye and Psy -- 2013 favored the more established, as well as the artists who showed that they had more than a single hit to offer. At No. 1 was Mr. "Suit & Tie" Justin Timberlake, followed by industry "Treasure" Bruno Mars and an enlightened Katy Perry. Kanye West went left with "Yeezus" while Jay Z tried to upset the way albums are released -- only to be upstaged by his wife, Beyonc√©, mere months later. -- It's fair to say that the year in music has been one filled with surprises.
