And No Kid Hungry's Cooking Matters program ensures kids are getting healthy meals at home by empowering low-income families with the skills to shop smarter, use nutrition information and cook delicious, affordable meals. Of the 20 million children who get lunch at school during the regular school year, only 1 in 7 are getting free meals in the summertime. There is good news for kids who need meals this summer, too. For example, moving school breakfast out of the cafeteria and into the classroom -- where everyone eats together -- means more kids start the day with a healthy meal. Of the same 20 million children who get lunch at school, only 10.5 million kids are eating school breakfast.
