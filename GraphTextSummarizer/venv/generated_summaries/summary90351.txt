Most of that money has probably gone to the lawyers anyway, a gaggle of men in suits, for whom greasing the wheels of justice -- even when that "justice" is really about upholding the honor of police and prosecutors who made big investigative missteps -- and getting paid take precedence over figuring out what actually happened. Amanda Knox concedes being 'tone-deaf' in days after roommate's murder Knox doesn't know what happened that night and is unable to provide us with a single new clue that could unravel the Gordian knot of police error, lies, national pride and xenophobic prejudice that turned a simple crime into an international mystery. In the end, this tragedy is about two very provincial families, one from suburban Seattle, one from north London, who have no idea what happened and who will never get answers, no matter how much money gets thrown around, no matter how many television interviews are granted,or books written or even court reviews concluded. In the publishing world, the reaction was summed up by an editor I know: "That used to be presidential memoir money." Since she can't give us any real answers, was her book and her coveted interview worth all the money -- a reported $4 million -- and bated breath?
