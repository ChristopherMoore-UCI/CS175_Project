British relationship expert Roy Sheppard has a new book, "How to Be The One," explaining how to strengthen your emotional core through four pillars -- self esteem, attitude, happiness and kindness/compassion -- in order to make sure you're ready for that moment. Do you think many men will read the book? Sheppard: Most relationship books are written by women for women. So many female friends tried insisting that the cover had an image of a swan or a pair of love birds because they all mate for life. Even scarier -- after years of searching for that special someone, "The One" might reject YOU because you're not "The One" for them. CNN: Sum up the book for us in a sentence -- how does someone become "The One"?
