The Michael Keaton film, about a former superhero-playing actor who tries to revive his career with a Broadway show, earned six Independent Spirit Awards nominations Tuesday, including best feature, best director (Alejandro G. Inarritu) and best actor for Keaton. In fact, as GoldDerby.com observed, several of last year's Independent Spirit winners -- including Matthew McConaughey ("Dallas Buyers Club"), Cate Blanchett ("Blue Jasmine"), Jared Leto ("Dallas Buyers Club") and Lupita Nyong'o ("12 Years a Slave") -- went on to win Oscars in their respective categories. And the Oscar for best picture went to "12 Years a Slave," which was also named best feature at the Independent Spirit Awards. The other nominees for best feature are "Boyhood," "Love Is Strange," "Selma" and "Whiplash." "Boyhood," the Richard Linklater-directed film that follows a boy for a dozen years as he grows up, is considered a strong contender for best picture this year.
