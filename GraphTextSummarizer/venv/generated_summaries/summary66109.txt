But long before one of this week's planned stress-reducing events ever happened, students were already buzzing about the possibility of rolling around with little Labradoodles and Shelties and Goldens. But like many, I first read about this trending puppy story in the National Post, where Jen Gerson reported that Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia had set up a "puppy room" to help students relieve stress. Gavin Jardine, vice-president of student life at Dalhousie's student union, told the National Post, "We haven't even printed posters. He told the National Post, "It fills a niche that people need right now because students are super stressed." Of course, as expected, you'll also find more than enough puppies to choke a horse.
