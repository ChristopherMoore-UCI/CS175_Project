Prince William and Duchess Catherine will set up their own temporary London home this summer as well, just a few miles away, at Kensington Palace, according to Clarence House, the office of Prince Charles and his family. The couple will retain their main home on the Welsh island of Anglesey, and their offices at St. James Palace, Clarence House said. The Duchess of Cambridge's widely acclaimed ivory and white satin-gazar dress, designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, goes on display at Buckingham Palace next month, according to the Royal Collection press office. The 1977 Rolls-Royce Phantom VI in which the Duchess of Cambridge traveled to Westminster Abbey, and the 1902 State Landau carriage used by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to travel along the processional route to Buckingham Palace, are already on public display at the palace, the Royal Collection says. The couple is considering alternatives for a more permanent home for when they visit London, Clarence House said.
