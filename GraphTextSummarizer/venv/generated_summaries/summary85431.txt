The point is that while other political leaders who hope to lead this country can take the time out to seriously address the longest-running protests in American history since the Montgomery bus boycott, Hillary Clinton sandwiches her comments in at the tail end of paid speaking engagements and keeps it moving. While Republican 2016 contender Rand Paul can come right out and say police militarization is a problem and that the officer who killed Garner should be fired, Hillary Clinton talks about restoring "balance." If Clinton thinks she's being smart by avoiding thorny race issues on the campaign trail, she's making a huge mistake. The crowds marching across America protesting the ugly intersection of racism, law enforcement and economics are some of the largest, most diverse groups of protesters seen in American history. While former President George W. Bush admits that he found the grand jury decision "hard to understand," Clinton is backing limited measures, including police body cameras, contained in Obama's executive actions resulting from the Ferguson controversy.
