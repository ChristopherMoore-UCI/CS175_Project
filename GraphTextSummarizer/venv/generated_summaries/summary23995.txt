Citing Windsor police, CNN partner CTV said the man has had previous encounters with Canadian law enforcement and confronted police officers minutes before the shooting on the bridge. U.S. officers shot a Canadian man who walked toward a border inspection booth waving what they said looked like a handgun early Sunday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the man stopped his car around 3 a.m. near a booth on the Ambassador Bridge, which goes between Detroit and the Canadian city of Windsor. After receiving a call reporting a man with a gun in the parking lot of a McDonald's near the border around 2:40 a.m., Windsor police officers arrived at the scene and ordered the man to drop his weapon, police said. But investigators later determined that the man was holding a replica of a handgun, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Kris Grogan said.
