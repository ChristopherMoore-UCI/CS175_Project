"Role Models" is the one that's coming out that was really, really enriching and fun and personal in many ways, because it's the first movie I co-wrote. This movie is all about role models, and as an actor, you are a role model to many people. Paul Rudd stars as Danny Donahue in "Role Models," which he helped write. [Wain, a member of the comedy troupe the State, directed and co-wrote "Wet Hot American Summer."] It is a commercial film, but there are some jokes in it that you just don't see in commercial movies. In his new movie "Role Models," which opens November 7, Rudd and Seann William Scott star as a pair of energy drink representatives who end up with a choice: jail time or 150 community service hours in a local mentoring program.
