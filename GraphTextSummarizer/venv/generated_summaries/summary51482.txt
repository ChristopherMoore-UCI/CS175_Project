Spanish fashion retailer Zara has apologized for selling a striped T-shirt bearing a yellow star that drew criticism for its resemblance to uniforms worn by Jewish concentration camp inmates. It's not the first time Zara has come under fire for using controversial imagery, according to the World Jewish Congress, one of many groups that called out the garment on social media. "The shirt emblazoned with the yellow star is in poor taste and is deeply offensive to Jews and Holocaust survivors. " "We honestly apologize," Zara said on Twitter in response to numerous outraged tweets. The offending item was removed from Zara stores and its website, according to a press release from Zara's parent company, Inditex.
