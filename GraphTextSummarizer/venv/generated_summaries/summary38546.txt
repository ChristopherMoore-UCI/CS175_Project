With the sensational final day of the tournament at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, McNeill finished second to Angel Cabrera and qualified for golf's next major, The Open Championship later this month in Merseyside, England. But that's exactly what he did at the PGA event, shooting a career-low 61 -- including a hole-in-one on the 8th hole. The PGA had tweeted Sunday that McNeill was "dealing with family health issues this week. Afterward, he emotionally alluded to "things going on elsewhere" and got choked up when interviewed by CBS analyst Peter Kostis. McNeill had already announced that he had withdrawn from the John Deere Classic, which starts Thursday, to be with his family.
