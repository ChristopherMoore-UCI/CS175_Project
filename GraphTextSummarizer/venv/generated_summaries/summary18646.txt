Babbitt was referring to the February 16 incident involving the controller's young son, who is heard in a recording -- posted on liveatc.net -- clearing a JetBlue flight for takeoff and later speaking to an apparent Aeromexico flight. Babbitt has directed a team to review air traffic control policies and procedures related to facility visitors. The FAA has suspended all unofficial visits to air traffic control operational areas during its investigation into the incident. During the recording, which is dated February 17, the child also speaks to an apparent Aeromexico flight. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown later said the incident took place about 7:30 p.m. February 16.
