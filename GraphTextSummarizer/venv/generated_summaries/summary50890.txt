"We play a lot of close games, and these guys are used to it," said Giants coach Bruce Bochy. The Giants' Hunter Pence scored on a double-play groundout by Brandon Crawford to give the Giants a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the seventh and Pence hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth to make it 2-0. The Giants proved they can win in many ways Thursday beating Detroit 2-0 after only getting five hits. The win gives the Giants a two games to none World Series lead and comes a day after the Giants pummeled the Tigers hitting three home runs in an 8-3 victory. Tigers starter Doug Fister gutted out six innings after being struck by a batted ball.
