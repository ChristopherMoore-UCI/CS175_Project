Fire and other workers were able to close a leaking valve on the tank in the Long Island town, Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy said in a statement. The leak also shut down rail service between Patchogue and Speonk, according to Long Island Rail Road spokesman Mike Lewi. After conducting an air quality sampling of 100 residences, officials decided to allow all residents to go home, said Suffolk County spokesman Dan Aug. Electricity was restored, with the exception of a shopping center that holds the 30,000-gallon underground storage tank. Red Cross spokesman Craig Cooper arrived at a local high school about 3 a.m. Saturday to help some of the evacuees, many of whom were without important medications. -- A propane gas tank leak that prompted the evacuations of an estimated 900 homes in Shirley, New York, was contained, officials said Saturday night.
