Fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care and many primary care doctors are leaving the field. I know this is true because I am struggling to find a primary care doctor to take care of my wife and myself. Dr. Vance Harris says primary care doctors get minuscule payment for saving the system huge sums of money. That's a tall order and it seems that few policy makers realize the value of primary care physicians. Good luck recruiting primary care specialists when we are projected to be short 39,000 by 2020, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians.
