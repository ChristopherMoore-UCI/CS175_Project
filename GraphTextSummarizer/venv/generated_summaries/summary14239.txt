PG&E runs three major gas pipelines, including the one involved in the San Bruno explosion, under "nine high-population-density neighborhoods in San Francisco," Herrera said. In a memo sent Tuesday to employees, Johns noted that a legal filing in July had been interpreted by some to mean that the utility "was leaving the door open to somehow blame San Bruno residents or the city of San Bruno for the accident itself. " The September 9, 2010, explosion blasted a 72-foot by 26-foot crater and destroyed 38 homes in San Bruno, near San Francisco International Airport. During a public board meeting after delivering their final report on the matter, National Transportation Safety Board investigators sharply criticized pipeline owner PG&E for the explosion, saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956. PG&E has consistently stated our position that we would do what we could to assist the residents of San Bruno and help them recover from this tragic accident."
