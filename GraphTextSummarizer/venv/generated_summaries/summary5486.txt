Tuesday night's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was chock full of buxom beauties, bedazzled bras and Beliebers. The show featured a short segment spotlighting South African model and Italian Vogue cover girl Candice Swanepoel. The behind-the-scenes cameras followed model Erin Heatherton backstage as a team of stylists struggled to pin her top hat to her head. Silver Screen Sirens Mars returned to the stage for a performance of "Young Wild Girls" in my favorite segment of the night. A bizarre song mix and circus motif, marked by the Angels' mime and clown costumes and professional aerial contortionists, made the first runway walk truly memorable.
