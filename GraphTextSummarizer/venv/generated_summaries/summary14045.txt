"You said that you have learned from this call to be more attentive to every caller and listen carefully to what they are saying and assuming nothing," wrote Diana Lock, the assistant director of the Law Enforcement Support Agency, which operates the 911 call center. -- A letter of reprimand was sent to the 911 operator who handled the emergency call from a social worker seeking help as Josh Powell killed his sons and himself in his Graham, Washington, home in February. His assumption that the caller was a mother involved in a custodial dispute contributed to the operator missing what "appeared to be many red flags," Lock wrote. It took eight minutes for 911 communications officer David Lovrak to send a police car, and it took an additional 13 minutes for a police car to get to Powell's home, according to the letter released Thursday. "When asked about this in the fact-finding you responded that custodial interference calls typically have heightened emotions and feel like emergencies to the person making the 911 call," she wrote.
