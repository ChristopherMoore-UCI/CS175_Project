When Lt. Gen. Rick Lynch first took over as commander of the largest Army base in the United States, a soldier's wife approached him and gave him a talking to about how soldiers don't "really" get to spend time at home when they come home from war. -- Families of tens of thousands of soldiers based at Fort Hood have one military wife to thank for a more normal routine at the base. But just after CNN's visit to Fort Hood, the Defense Department sent out a news release announcing that Lynch would be moving on to his next job in the Army. CNN spoke to one squad of soldiers who'd returned from a deployment to Fort Hood just a week before our visit. And no one at Fort Hood works weekends unless Lynch signs off on it.
