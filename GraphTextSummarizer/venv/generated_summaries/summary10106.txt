Before self-driving cars can start ferrying us to work, companies need figure out ethical issues (does it hit a deer or crash into the median?), improve basic driving functions, and work with governments on legislation to allow driverless cars on all roads. When the tech company first started experimenting with self-driving technology, it modified existing cars, like a Toyota, Audi and Lexus, by adding multiple cameras and sensors and an onboard computer. Google is just one of many companies developing driverless car technology. The round, white and gray car is designed without permanent driving tools like a gas pedal or wheel. The car's dome-like shape is optimal for giving sensors the widest field of view.
