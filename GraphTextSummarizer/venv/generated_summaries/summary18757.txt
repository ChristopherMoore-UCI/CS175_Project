The brainchild of newcomer Neill Blomkamp, "District 9" is a mash-up of the director's love for science fiction with his rearing in an apartheid-divided South Africa. It's an obvious nod to South Africa's own violent and divisive history, but director Blomkamp says he isn't aiming for political commentary. "I wanted to say, 'This is the city I grew up in, and this is what it felt like,' with a science fiction veneer to it so that it doesn't take itself that seriously." Documentary-like authenticity was of prime importance to Blomkamp, and was the reason for his casting of fellow South African unknown Sharlto Copley as leading man. -- Science fiction flicks featuring aliens can be a little formulaic: Aliens invade American territory, mass destruction ensues, and nine times out of 10, Will Smith rides to the rescue A company operative (Sharlto Copley) gets an alien's attention in "District 9." Sometimes the two are in the very same shot, Blomkamp said.
