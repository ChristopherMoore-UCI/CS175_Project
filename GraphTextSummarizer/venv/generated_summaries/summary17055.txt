This means Greece and Spain are in for years of high unemployment, reduced living standards, falling wages and deflation. Joining the eurozone meant Spain and Greece gave up the power to create money, the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness, and the power to set interest rates. The inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s, Spain and Greece couldn't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies. The European Central Bank set interest rates in line with economic conditions in Germany and France that proved too low for Spain and Greece (and Ireland). Spain's debt to GDP ratio is 100% -- a level not seen in Spain in more than 100 years.
