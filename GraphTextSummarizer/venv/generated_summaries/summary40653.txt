Also in eastern Jerusalem on Wednesday, the driver of a commercial van ran over pedestrians at a rail station, killing an Israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people, police said. Groups of young Palestinians threw stones and set off fireworks at Israeli police officers near one of the gates of the Temple Mount -- known by Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) -- when the site was opened to visitors, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. Israeli police officer killed, 13 hurt in driver's rampage Samri said the youths had gathered in the mosque overnight, amassing rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails with which to attack police. Israeli police clashed with Palestinians at one of the holiest sites in Judaism and Islam on Wednesday, leaving more than 15 people injured in the latest round of unrest at the compound in Jerusalem. The shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in Jerusalem and prompted Israeli authorities to close the Temple Mount for one day -- a move that outraged Palestinians.
