" Marco Simoncelli was not just one of Italy's most promising motorcycling stars, he brought sunshine into a hard world, in hard times. "Marco didn't give a damn about money," Paolo Simoncelli said. Seven-time world champion Rossi, who loved Simoncelli as a brother, explains it best: "Having a duel one-vs-one with Marco, it's like if you're going to have a punch against a huge guy: you already know you will always be the one beaten up. Back in May, after being heavily accused by Spanish press and riders of causing Dani Pedrosa to crash and break his collarbone, several death threats were addressed to Simoncelli from Spain ahead of the Catalunyan GP. This is another gift we get from Marco Simoncelli -- joyful, smiling, happy when alive -- and now his family are still inspiring us to love life even when anger would be justified.
