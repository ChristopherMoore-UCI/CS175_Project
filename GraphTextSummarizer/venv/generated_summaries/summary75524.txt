Bush helped lead the Saints to their first Super Bowl victory during the 2009-2010 season. From December 2004, the sports agents, who were hoping to represent Bush in the NFL draft, allegedly paid for hotel rooms, rent on a home where Bush's family lived and a limousine ride to accept the Heisman in December 2005. -- New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush announced Tuesday that he would forfeit the Heisman Trophy he won in 2005 when he was at the University of Southern California. "I will forever appreciate the honor bestowed upon me as a winner of the Heisman," Bush wrote in a statement released by his pro team, the New Orleans Saints. "The persistent media speculation regarding allegations dating back to my years at USC has been both painful and distracting," Bush said in a statement released by the Saints.
