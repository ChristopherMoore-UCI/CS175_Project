The five-count indictment charges James Everett Dutschke, 41, with producing and using the deadly toxin as a weapon, using the mail to threaten Obama, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland. New poison letters put ricin under microscope An affidavit released earlier said investigators conducted searches of Dutschke's home and former place of business and found incriminating items including latex gloves and a dust mask. -- A Mississippi man was indicted Monday in the mailing of ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and two other officials. The indictment claims Dutschke used such language in the messages "to make it appear that Paul Kevin Curtis was responsible" for the letters. If convicted Dutschke could face up to life in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.
