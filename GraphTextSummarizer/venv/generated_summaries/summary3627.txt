OKG did not immediately return CNN calls seeking comment, but numerous media outlets reported that Oskarhamn Unit 3 was back up and running Wednesday. "The operations management at unit O3 chose to disconnect the facility from the grid at noon on Sunday due to a large amount of jellyfish present at the cooling water intake," an OKG statement said. Since 1999, jellyfish have threatened plants in the Philippines, Japan, Israel, the United States and Scotland, according to media reports. "Furthermore we have reinforced our clearing system to deal with any future jellyfish invasions," the outlets quoted OKG as saying in a statement. A large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling-water intake at a major Swedish nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor this week, according to OKG, the company that runs the plant.
