PreCheck will be implemented at the busiest U.S. airports throughout the year including, Baltimore/Washington, Boston Logan, Charlotte Douglas, Cincinnati, Denver, Fort Lauderdale, George Bush, Honolulu, Indianapolis, JFK, LaGuardia, Lambert-St. Louis, Louis Armstrong New Orleans, Luis Munoz Marin, Newark Liberty, O'Hare, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix Sky Harbor, Pittsburgh, Portland, Ronald Reagan Washington National, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Tampa, Ted Stevens Anchorage and Washington Dulles. Officials say more than 336,000 passengers have already been screened through PreCheck lanes affiliated with American Airlines in Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Las Vegas and Minneapolis, and with Delta Air Lines in Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. In making the announcement at a news conference at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Homeland Security officials said PreCheck will enable TSA to focus its efforts on passengers the agency knows less about in a more risk-based approach to screening. "Good, thoughtful, sensible security by its very nature facilitates lawful travel and legitimate commerce," said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. "TSA PreCheck moves us closer to our goal of delivering the most effective and efficient screening by recognizing that most passengers do not pose a threat to security," said TSA Administrator John Pistole in a written statement.
