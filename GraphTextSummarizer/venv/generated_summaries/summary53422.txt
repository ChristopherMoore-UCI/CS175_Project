-- Former Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci -- who later served as U.S. ambassador to Canada -- died Saturday after battling ALS, the University of Massachusetts Medical School said. In 2001, Cellucci followed Weld's lead in leaving the Massachusetts State House for an ambassador's job following his nomination by President George W. Bush. Cellucci died at his home in Hudson -- the small town from which he rose from selectman to eventually governor and diplomat -- surrounded by family, the school said, adding it was announcing the news on behalf of Cellucci's family. "The governor refused to allow his challenging diagnosis to prevent him from continuing his lifetime's work of serving and helping others," UMass Medical School Chancellor Michael Collins said. They noted that Cellucci was the first Massachusetts official to back the elder Bush's losing 1980 presidential campaign, grouping him with other Bay Staters such as Andrew Card and Andrew Natsios who also served under the two Bushes.
