El Salvador's Chaparrastique volcano erupted Sunday, sending a dark cloud of ash miles into the sky, forcing thousands to evacuate from their homes and snarling travel in the Central American country as airlines canceled flights. Iberia and United Airlines also canceled flights that had been scheduled to arrive in San Salvador Sunday night. Authorities warned residents not to approach the area near the volcano, which is located in eastern El Salvador. Avianca airlines announced Sunday night that it had canceled 33 flights scheduled to arrive and depart from El Salvador as a precautionary measure due to the ash cloud. The international airport in San Salvador, the capital, redirected some flights to other airports, including in Guatemala, to avoid the ash.
