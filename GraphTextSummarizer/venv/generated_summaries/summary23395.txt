The pro-government rally on Tuesday followed violent clashes between protesters and security forces in the cities of Daraa and Latakia in recent days. The Syrian government resigned Tuesday amid an unusual wave of unrest that has roiled the nation, state TV reported. Syria's discontent is centered in Daraa, a southern city in the impoverished country's agricultural region, where security forces and anti-government protesters have sporadically clashed for nearly two weeks. At least 37 people have been killed since last week, according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Others waved Syrian flags, while some painted their faces and chests in national colors.
