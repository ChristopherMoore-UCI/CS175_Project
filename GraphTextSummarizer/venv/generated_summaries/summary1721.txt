Read more: African women need a hand-up not a hand-out In most African rural areas, expectant mothers are mostly taken care of by traditional birth attendants at their households, rather than at hospitals. According to the World Health Organization's Trends in Maternal Mortality Report: • Every 90 seconds a woman dies from a pregnancy related complication, that's 1,000 women a day • 90% of these deaths are preventable • 99% of maternal deaths that took place in 2008 (most recent data from 2010 study) occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (57%) and South Asia (30%) • 50% of all maternal deaths take place during the first 48 hours after delivery. On this glorious day, I want to put a spin on what we are all celebrating and ask each woman to take a moment to think about the thousands of women across Kenya and millions across Africa who may never celebrate Mother's Day. The causes for these astounding figures are not limited to the inability of women to access a health facility due to transportation costs; only 10% of women deliver at a health facility where a skilled birth attendant is present. A woman without proper education would not be self-protective in terms of reproductive health and a girl barely into her teens forced into early marriage risks her unprepared body in intercourse, both of which may raise the maternal death odds.
