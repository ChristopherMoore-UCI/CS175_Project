-- One person was killed and two people were injured after gunmen attacked Guinean President Alpha Conde's residence, a government spokesman said Tuesday. His election last year ended a two-year transition to civilian rule after a military junta took power in December 2008. The attack occurred in downtown Conakry, the capital city of the West African nation early Tuesday morning and the battle lasted two hours. Authorities believe the attackers may have been soldiers with the Guinean army, said Durus Yale Dore, a government spokesman. Journalist Amadou Tam Camara said the attackers were heavily armed and the group had a rocket launcher.
