In the ensuing years, militants in Gaza have regularly launched rocket attacks into southern Israel. -- Days after the death of a Palestinian in an Israeli prison, a rocket fired from Gaza landed in southern Israel on Tuesday, the first such attack since a cease-fire took hold in November. As Israel targeted Hamas military commanders and weaponry, Palestinian militants continued to fire rockets into Israel, battering the southern region and reaching Israel's two major cities -- Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The Erez Crossing between Gaza and Israel will be open only for medical cases, humanitarian aid or exceptional cases. Eight days of round-the-clock warfare followed between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian movement that controls Gaza.
