The carrier is offering its customers a free personal cell spot -- a router that plugs into an existing broadband connection to improve mobile phone coverage while at home. The technology already exists to let passengers make phone calls, but a tangle of airline and FAA rules -- not to mention potential backlash from other fliers -- is limiting this feature to quiet activities. All new smartphones purchased through T-Mobile will allow phone calls and texts over WiFi. T-Mobile claims that one of these custom devices, which usually retail for around $200, can cover a phone up to 3,000 feet in any direction -- hundreds of feel farther than existing cell spots. Why is T-Mobile pushing WiFi connections so heavily?
