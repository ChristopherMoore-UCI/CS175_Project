As of Sunday, Iggy was off the northwestern coast of Australia, said Tom Sater, meteorologist for CNN International. Most of those who died were struck by falling trees or debris from strong winds, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. -- Fourteen people were killed and another 60 were injured in Indonesia over a four-day period as a result of Cyclone Iggy, according to the country's National Disaster Management Agency. Iggy is forecast to stay offshore and avoid the coast of Western Australia, said Sater. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a cyclone warning for the coastal area from Onslow to Coral Bay, including Exmouth.
