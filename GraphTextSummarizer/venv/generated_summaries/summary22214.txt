Fresh food The brainchild of the process is former team member Nick Halmos, who is hoping Windsor and Jenner will be able to supplement their diet of freeze-dried food with edible and healthy food nutrients. Jenner finished third in the 2011 Transat, while Windsor has a pair of second-place finishes in prestigious trans-Atlantic races, but they know the opposition this year will be tough, even before the added pressure of the environmental pledges. Marine conservation groups have long campaigned for better environmental protection of our oceans, but have now found high-profile support from a pair of world-class long-distance racing sailors -- Rob Windsor of the United States and Britain's Hannah Jenner. Better" is the motto of Windsor and Jenner's 11th Hour Racing team and they want to be as good as their word. But Windsor and Jenner, among the favorites to win the Transat Jacques Vabre -- a month-long, 5,600-nautical-mile race from France to Brazil -- are pledging to stop the dumping as part of a new eco-friendly approach to ocean racing.
