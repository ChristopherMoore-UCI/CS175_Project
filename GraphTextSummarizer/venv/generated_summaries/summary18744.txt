The first four states would also face penalties if they move from February into January, but South Carolina GOP Chairman Chad Connelly dared the RNC to punish his state if Florida triggers the chaos. But top Florida Republicans have since demanded that their state go fifth in the 2012 process, after the first four "carve out" states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Florida Republicans told CNN this week, however, that the prospect of states like Missouri and Colorado also holding caucus or primary contests in February forced their hand. "But short of that, the Speaker's prediction seems accurate." Iowa Republican Party Chairman Matt Strawn issued a joint statement Thursday with his counterparts from New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, promising to leap ahead of Florida and into January if the Florida commission moves ahead with its plan. "We're going to continue working with Florida and other states until the deadline on October 1st to ensure they remain within the Party rules," said spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski.
