Scotland kept in the game thanks to the boot of Chris Paterson, who kicked five penalties and a Dan Parks drop goal, but they have now suffered three defeats and are battling Italy for the wooden spoon. First half tries from Heaslip and Reddan, both converted by O'Gara, always kept their noses in front, despite Paterson's usual metronomic kicking. When O'Gara  went over under the posts for his try, which he converted, the visitors led 21-9, but two more penalties from Paterson after the drop goal from Parks set up a nervy finish as Andy Robinson's men scented a late comeback. Recalled to the starting XV to claim his 106th cap, the 33-year-old Munster star inspired the Irish, who also scored first half tries through Jamie Heaslip and Eoin Reddan. The win seed Ireland join France and Wales on four points, while Scotland are now staring down the barrel of a likely wooden spoon showdown with Italy having lost three in a row.
