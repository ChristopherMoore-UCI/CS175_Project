That would be the same Stan Lee who co-created Spider-Man (as well as Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men and so many other Marvel characters). New York Times writer Michael Wilson delivered the drawing to Jamel, with Lee's signature in the corner. It was a story that moved Stan Lee, the creator of many of the best-known superheroes in history, into action: a Spider-Man-loving boy with autism named Jamel Hunter. According to the New York Times, a December Times article about the child, who reportedly didn't say a word until he was in preschool, caught the eye of one of Lee's neighbors, jazz musician Corky Hale. The Times story described how 8-year-old Jamel, who loves Spider-Man, had a birthday party at an East Harlem community center.
