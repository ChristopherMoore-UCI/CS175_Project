-- Sen. Rand Paul said this week that he would vote in favor of going to war with ISIS, but his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, made it clear Friday night that he sharply opposes further U.S. involvement in the Mideast region. Still, Rand Paul has largely opposed foreign interventions in the past, and his decision to support air strikes has been viewed as more hawkish than his previous stances. Congress has not voted specifically to authorize air strikes against ISIS, but Rand Paul has said he would vote in favor of doing so. Obama's proposed plan includes expanded air strikes against ISIS and arming and training Syrian rebels who are also fighting off the threat. Ron Paul never mentioned his son, who spoke the previous night on the same stage, during his remarks about foreign policy.
