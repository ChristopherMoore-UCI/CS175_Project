It blamed the spread not on a particularly virulent strain of the virus, rather it said this outbreak was so deadly because of a "combination of dysfunctional health systems, international indifference, high population mobility, local customs, densely populated capitals, and lack of trust in authorities after years of armed conflict. The WHO report concludes Ebola kept getting reintroduced "into Guinea -- with its notoriously porous borders -- from the large outbreaks in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone." The number of Ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rise to between 550,000 and 1.4 million by January if there are no "additional interventions or changes in community behavior," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report Tuesday. Another six-month report from WHO -- which assesses the situation in three countries at the outbreak's center, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- is dedicated to those health workers "who, as an expression of our innately shared human compassion, risked their lives, and lost them." Of the over 1500 who have died, 85 were health care workers.
