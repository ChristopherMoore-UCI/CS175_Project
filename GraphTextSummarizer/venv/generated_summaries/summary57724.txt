During deliberations, the judge asked for a progress report, and the panel's forewoman in open court announced the jurors had rejected the capital and first-degree murder charges, but could not agree on manslaughter. But state courts around the country are at odds on whether split verdicts on some counts allow retrial on all counts. " Blueford was prosecuted for capital murder, but the death penalty was waived if he were to be convicted. "The jury in this case did not convict Blueford of any offense, but it did not acquit him of any either," said Chief Justice John Roberts. The judge then declared a mistrial, but refused to give Blueford a partial victory on the capital and first-degree murder charges.
