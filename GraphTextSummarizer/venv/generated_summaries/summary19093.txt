Local fire and police emergency responders remain on the scene, according to local police. The passenger train is operated by the Arkansas and Missouri Railroad, said Ron Sparks, the railroad's police chief. A scenic fall tour turned into a nightmare ride for passengers in northwest Arkansas on Thursday after a freight train and a passenger train collision left dozens injured. The trains collided Thursday morning when the passenger train stalled on a small grade, apparently because of excess leaves on the track, according to police. The train departed from Springdale, Arkansas, and was headed to Van Buren to take passengers on a fall foliage excursion.
