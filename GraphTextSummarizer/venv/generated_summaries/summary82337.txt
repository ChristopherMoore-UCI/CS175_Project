-- China's extraordinary climb to the world's second largest economy was built on the back of Chinese workers, many of whom left rural farms to migrate for work in coastal factories. "The companies are looking for cheaper resources, cheaper land, cheaper labor in the home provinces, like in the rural remote provinces in China," Suki Chung, executive director, Labor Action China, told CNN. They're able to connect with others, see what others are doing," William Nee of China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based NGO which defends workers' rights, told CNN. But as China's wealth rises, workers are demanding a greater share of the wealth and better access to social services. Migrant workers often can't register in the cities where they work, and subsequently can't qualify for social services such as public education or social security.
