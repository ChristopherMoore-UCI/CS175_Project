During Hell week, instructors deprive the participants of sleep, then let them hit the rack just long enough for REM to begin, said Brandon Tyler Webb, a former SEAL who ran the sniper program at the Navy Special Warfare Command and was part of combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attrition rate for SEAL training is about 90 percent, Heben and Webb said. The discipline from SEAL training was intensely satisfying to Heben in his early 20s. In the Iran-Iraq war, SEAL teams conducted missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. The largest deployment of SEALs in the group's history came during the Iraq War, with SEALs directing missions that included securing all of the southern oil infrastructures of the Al-Faw peninsula and the off-shore gas and oil terminals, clearing critical waterways so that aid could flow into the country.
