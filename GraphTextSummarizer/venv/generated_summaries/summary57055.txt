In the immediate aftermath of earthquake, Nader and other art collectors in Haiti rescued thousands of pieces from the rubble that might have been forever lost. Nader hopes those who relish the visual feast will gather an understanding of the vital role that art plays in Haitian society. The painting is one of two restored works of art that is part of a larger show of 50 pieces created by Haitian artists -- the other rescued piece is "Beau Reve" by Celestin Faustin. " Marla Goldwasser, the director of Affirmation Arts in New York admitted she didn't know much about Haitian art before she took on the "Saving Grace" exhibit. "We wanted to give Haitian art, the Haitian people, a voice," she said about "Saving Grace," the first such show of Haitian art in the United States in over a decade.
