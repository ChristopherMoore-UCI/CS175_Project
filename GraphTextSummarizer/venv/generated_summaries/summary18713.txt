Moving forward, host countries and the international aid community should prioritize investment in access to quality education, with additional attention to building infrastructure to expand school spaces, understanding and addressing other barriers to access, developing transportation options, improving data systems, expanding school monitoring and support, and providing teacher training about refugee needs in the classroom. This means investing in building capacities of host country governments to provide education to these additional people in the future. This isn't unique to the current situation: In protracted refugee crises around the world, the average time until refugees can return home is 17 years, according to the United Nations. The United Nations announced earlier this month that Syrians are now the largest refugee population in the world -- more than 7.5 million Syrians are displaced internally, while another 3.2 million are registered refugees in neighboring countries. While each country officially allows Syrian children access to the public education system, barriers remain, including school space shortages, having to learn new languages, transportation, the need for children to work for their family's survival, and bullying.
