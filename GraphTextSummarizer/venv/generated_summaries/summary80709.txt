People will say that eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to lose weight. I know I've told people that making small, sustained lifestyle changes is the best way to lose weight over time. Pretty much everything we "know" about obesity and weight loss is wrong. They show that significant physical activity can help with weight loss, and that it has the added bonus of making you healthier in general. I tell you this because more and more, I think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path.
