Police talked to Roethlisberger, 28, and the woman at the scene immediately after the incident was reported about 2:30 a.m. March 5 at the club in Milledgeville, Georgia, said Deputy Police Chief Richard Malone. -- Authorities are no longer able to watch a video of scenes at a Georgia nightclub in the case of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger because a digital video recorder system recorded over it, an attorney said Thursday. The woman "alleged that he is the perpetrator," Malone told reporters. Attorney Lee Parks said the woman said she is "fully cooperating with law enforcement." Roethlisberger, who has been the starting quarterback for the Steelers for six seasons, has been accused of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old woman at a Georgia nightspot this month.
