Frustrated parents are dumping their teenagers at Nebraska hospitals -- even crossing state lines to do it -- and the state Legislature has scheduled a special hearing to try to stem the tide. "They've got a huge problem," said Linda Spears, vice president for policy and public affairs for the Child Welfare League of America. Heineman and Landry urged Nebraska parents who are having trouble coping to call the United Way's 211 resource line or Boys Town, a nationally known nonprofit child services organization based in Nebraska. All 50 states have safe haven laws, but only Nebraska's lacks an age limit. The case marks the first time a parent has crossed state lines to abandon a teenager in Nebraska, authorities said.
