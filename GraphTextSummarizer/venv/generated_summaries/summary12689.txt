So whether they look to district-scaled projects like the South Bronx Greenway in New York or Seoul's Cheonggyecheon, or to city scaled projects like the Petite Ceinture or Madrid's Calle-30, or to complex regional proposals like those for the Los Angeles River, cities can find innovative, non-partisan public works projects that not only begin the physical transformation required to attract future residents and jobs, but also catalyze a cultural shift in thinking about what kinds of policies and infrastructure we should be investing in. In a world that faces daunting challenges for sustainable urban development and increasingly polarized politics, perhaps a more important lesson is the project's role as a catalyst for cultural change. In either case, it is remarkable that in a region many view as the poster-child for urban sprawl, we also find the Atlanta BeltLine, a uniquely innovative, sustainable and ambitious idea that has begun to address not only the physical challenges of sprawl, but also to change Atlanta's cultural expectations for itself and for its future. And for regions of the world as culturally different as China and The Netherlands, where one can find evidence of the same early steps toward urban sprawl that America took six decades ago, Atlanta's grasp for more sustainable strategies should serve as fair warning. The Atlanta BeltLine began its current reincarnation as my thesis project on public transit, economic development and community revitalization.
