But in 1997, Burger King released the Big King, which was two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, served on a sesame seed bun. The Big Mac is McDonald's signature burger: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, served on a sesame seed bun. But it's also a sly wink at Burger King's new BK Breakfast Muffin Sandwich's undeniable resemblance to the classic Sausage McMuffin. In a new television commercial, Burger King's mascot, a slightly sinister king with an outsized, motionless plastic head, breaks into the headquarters of McDonald's and steals the recipe to their Sausage McMuffin with egg and cheese. Fortunately for competitors, McDonald's doesn't own the rights to eggs, sausage, cheese or English muffins.
