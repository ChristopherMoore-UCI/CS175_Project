But, Coast Guard officials believe human smugglers and builders of makeshift boats may be partly to blame. Ever since Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959, there have been incidents of mass migration from Cuba -- the most famous of which was the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when roughly 125,000 Cubans landed on Florida's shores within a six-month span. But most Cubans found at sea would be sent back to Cuba. Since the Obama administration announced a renewal of diplomatic relations with the Castro government on December 16, the Coast Guard says there has been a 235% increase in the number of Cubans found at sea, compared with the first two weeks of December. "Having this many people at sea, in very unseaworthy vessels -- it just makes for a very dangerous environment," said Fedor.
