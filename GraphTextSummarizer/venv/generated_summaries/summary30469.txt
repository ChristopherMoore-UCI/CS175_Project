Morsy now stands trial over the death of protesters as well as an array of other charges. Talking to Mubarak supporters and protesters on both sides, they did agree on one thing. The judge found Mubarak and co-defendants guilty on charges of failing to stop the killings of protesters. Egyptians crowded around televisions, struggling to glimpse former President Honsi Mubarak in a white prisoner's uniform when the court session began on August 3, 2011. The following August, security forces would clear Morsy supporters from two squares in Egypt resulting in more than 1,000 people killed.
