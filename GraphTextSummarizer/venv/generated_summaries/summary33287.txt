The Taylor Hooton Foundation has found PEDs that contain contaminants such as lead and other heavy metals, liquid mixers such as cooking oil, horse urine and other filthy contents. They can go online and find dozens of websites that offer to sell anabolic steroids and other PEDs online. The young athletes who appear to be our fit and finest could be facing decades of health trouble -- including liver abnormalities and tumors, increased risk for heart attacks, depression and more -- from taking PEDs. His father, Don Hooton, has committed his life to trying to help other young athletes steer clear of steroids. It's a sad fact that if they play high school or college sports, these youths probably already know of someone who has taken PEDs.
