King confidant Harry Belafonte told me last year for an interview on my TV One show, "Washington Watch," that King understood that black America, and all Americans, couldn't be truly free unless they had economic freedom. A lot has changed for black America since August 28, 1963, but when you examine the economic condition in 2013, we are still facing troubled times. When most folks think about the march, too much focus is on the "I Have a Dream" portion of King's speech and not the top two-thirds, which was a condemnation of the economic policies that stifled black growth in America. It should be singularly focused on driving an agenda that speaks to the unemployment crisis afflicting black America. As America has desperately tried to escape the recession that gripped the world over the past few years, black unemployment remains pathetically high.
