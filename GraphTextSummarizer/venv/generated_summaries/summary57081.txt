" But not everyone in Santiago has embraced the surge in graffiti art. It's an ongoing debate with implications for other forms of self-expression that have recently been commercialized such as sand animation, a form of performance art that involves the manipulation of sand.

For the private sector, graffiti art has become an effective way of capturing the attention of potential clients and generating a buzz on social media. As enterprises piggyback on the creativity of others, some people are asking whether the authenticity of graffiti art is being eroded -- whether something that once representing non-conformity has been tamed to promote the conformity involved in mass consumption.
