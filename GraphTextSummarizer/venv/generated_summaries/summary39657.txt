Taken out over the region in a Shell helicopter, the illegal oil-refining sites look like small pockets of hell -­ scorched earth with great flames leaping up from small dark craters. The four young men working the illegal refineries stand a respectable distance from the flames until it is their turn to pour more oil on the fire.
