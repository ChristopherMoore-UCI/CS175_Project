On Friday afternoon, Kasper Ilaug was inside his summer house, a cabin on Norway's Storoya Island, watching the Tour de France when the television broadcast was interrupted by a news flash -- a bomb had exploded in nearby Oslo. But his interest picked up when he saw that the building that had borne the brunt of the blast was Oslo's Government House, where his father used to work and his ex-wife and her new husband currently work. He saw people in a handful of other private boats that had lined up along the shore. "He said, 'You have to get in the boat of a friend of ours and rescue people from Utoya (Island), because something terrible is happening there,'" said Ilaug. "There's a lot of other people as well here who have done the same thing that I have done," he said.
