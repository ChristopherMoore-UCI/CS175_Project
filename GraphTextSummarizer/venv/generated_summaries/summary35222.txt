China's Jing Zhao also set a new best time in winning the 50m backstroke in 26.27, while world record-holder Rebecca Soni of the U.S. set another milestone in the 200m breaststroke as she clocked 2:16.39 to clinch a hat-trick of golds in the discipline. Brazil's Cesar Cielo Filho completed a double in the freestyle sprint events, taking gold in the men's 100m ahead of French swimmer Fabien Gilot and Russia's Nikita Lobintsev to follow up his victory in the 50m. Felipe Silva gave Brazil a third gold of the week when he won the 50m breaststroke in a championships-record time of 25.95 seconds. Sweden's Therese Alshammar equaled the record of women's overall medals by winning silver in the 100m butterfly to match the 17 achieved by former U.S. swimmer Jenny Thompson. All her victories came in championship record times. The American added gold in the men's 200 meter backstroke -- setting a new championship-best time -- and the men's 100m individual medley.
