-- Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has apparently released a new audio message calling for a jihad, or holy war, against Israel for its Gaza campaign. The last time bin Laden released an audio message was in mid-May, timed to coincide with Israel's 60th anniversary. The 22-minute message contains "an invitation" from bin Laden to take part in "jihad to stop the aggression against Gaza." Osama bin Laden, in an undated photo, apparently taped a message calling for jihad against Israel. The message is important to the incoming U.S. president because it signifies that bin Laden is still "out there," said Tim Roemer, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana who served on both the congressional and the presidential September 11 commissions.
