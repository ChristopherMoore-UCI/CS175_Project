"And by emphasizing prevention and wellness, it will also help improve the quality of health care for every American." Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, said the bill is intended to repair a "dysfunctional" health care system that is draining the U.S. economy while leaving 46 million Americans without health insurance. It proposes a 5.4 percent surtax on couples earning more than $1 million, a 1.5 percent surtax on couples with income between $500,000 and $1 million, and a 1 percent surtax on joint incomes over $350,000 or individual income over $280,000. -- House Democrats unveiled their revised version of health care reform Tuesday, offering a proposal that includes a government-funded health insurance option, requires both individuals and employers to participate, and taxes the wealthy to help cover costs. Democratic House leaders said the measure, titled "America's Affordable Health Choices Act," met the requirements set by President Obama for health care reform by lowering costs to consumers and businesses, letting people keep their current plan if desired, and preventing denial of coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said the bill "without any question will kill jobs, will limit access to health care, will raise taxes and will lead to a government takeover of health care."
