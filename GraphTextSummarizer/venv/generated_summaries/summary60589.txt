Mourinho refused to criticize Chelsea's outgoing manager Rafael Benitez for his decision to sparingly use the club's longtime captain John Terry last season. Nine years and a day after he was first unveiled at the English Premier League club as the brightest coaching talent in world football, Mourinho returned to London after what he described as the worst season of his career in Spain with Real Madrid. Three members of the club's coaching setup then are now managers at EPL clubs: Tottenham's Andre Villas-Boas, West Brom's Steve Clarke and Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers. Real could not win a 10th European title, though Mourinho guided "Los Blancos" to three successive Champions League semifinals after several seasons of waiting to reach even the last eight. Mourinho was called the "scourge of Spanish football" by Barcelona's vice-president and was also criticized by players such as Andres Iniesta, having controversially poked his finger in the eye of coach Tito Vilanova and presided during some ugly, ill-tempered matches between the two teams.
