Bride kidnappings happen in two basic ways: There are "consensual kidnappings," where the two people know each other and it is a kind of role-playing, then there's full-on, off-the-street abductions.

In August, VICE traveled to the Issyk-Kul region of Kyrgyzstan to investigate the origins and present-day incarnations of bride kidnapping. Although the tradition of bride kidnapping is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, authorities largely ignore the law.
