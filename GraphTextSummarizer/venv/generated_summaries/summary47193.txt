Some members of the cell phone industry are advising drivers to stop using cell phones on the road, but few have taken a stance on hands-free devices, because research has been limited. Some experts said drivers talking on cell phones are four times more likely to get into a crash than those who don't talk on their phones behind the wheel. "When you're on a call, even if both hands are on the wheel, your head is in the call," said Janet Froetscher, president of the National Safety Council, which in January urged legislators in all 50 states to pass laws prohibiting motorists from using cell phone devices. "It doesn't matter what kind of cell phone device they are using, because the impairments are so large," said University of Utah professor David Strayer, who used a high-tech driving simulator for his experiment. Some private industries, such as trucking and bus companies, prohibit their employees from using cell phones on the road.
