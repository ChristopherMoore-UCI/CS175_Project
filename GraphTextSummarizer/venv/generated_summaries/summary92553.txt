We all know that Will Smith "owns" the July 4 weekend -- so much so, there aren't any other big openings this week (aside from the small-scale "Kit Kittredge: An American Girl," which began in limited release last week). Jason Bateman and Will Smith star in "Hancock." Ray -- who owes the guy his life and has invited him into his home to meet the wife (Charlize Theron) -- encourages Hancock to surrender himself, serve some time, address his alcohol and anger-management issues, and wait for soaring crime statistics to pave his early release. In short, this is not the agreeable Will Smith we know and love, and even in this summer of edgier, angrier action heroes (see also "Iron Man" and "The Incredible Hulk"), Hancock may be the first full-blown jerk to front a blockbuster. It's as if we've been whisked from one kind of movie -- a brisk, superficial but entertaining high-concept comedy -- and into the theater next door, where they're showing some sort of tragic "X-Men" knockoff.
