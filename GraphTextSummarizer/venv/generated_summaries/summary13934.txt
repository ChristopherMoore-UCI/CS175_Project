A number of new titles also will become available for streaming on Netflix at or near the first of the year, including "Jack Reacher," "The Talented Mr. Ripley," "Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters" and seasons 5-8 of "Dexter," the spokesperson said. (It also includes "Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo" and "Killer Klowns From Outer Space.") Among the TV shows being purged from Netflix's streaming menu: the original "Dark Shadows," "Mr Bean" and "The Kids in the Hall." More than 80 movies and a handful of TV shows -- including "Titanic," "Top Gun" and some seasons of "Saturday Night Live" -- will no longer be available for streaming through the site as of Wednesday, according to a post on Reddit. A spokesperson for Netflix told CNN that the company routinely adds and deletes titles from its streaming service due to licensing contracts. If you're planning to stay home New Year's Day and stream classic movies on Netflix, you may be out of luck.
