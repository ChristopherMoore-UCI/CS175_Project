First of all, Valentine's Day is not built around a religious event like Christmas or Easter; nor does it have any special meaning to the nation such as Memorial Day or Veterans Day. For several years I have ripped into Valentine's Day. It's time to say enough is enough with Valentine's Day. It's time that we all take stock of our relationships and learn that we are to be loving and fulfilled 365 days a year, and not reduce our affection to flowers, candy, jewelry, clothes and a meal on one day a year. February 14 isn't the only time to send flowers to your woman (ladies, we wouldn't mind getting a surprise delivery as well!).
