Prince Andrew is named in the court filing in Florida as one of a number of prominent people who allegedly had sexual contact with teenage girls through self-made billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation. In the letter the woman's lawyers sent to Buckingham Palace, attorneys Paul Cassell and Bradley Edwards asked to interview Prince Andrew "under oath regarding interactions that you had with Jane Doe "Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times," she said, according to the court document. The attorney for her legal team confirmed to CNN that Buckingham Palace had refused to accept the letter to Prince Andrew and that it was returned to them. Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace issued a statement which said, "It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York [Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship" with the woman.
