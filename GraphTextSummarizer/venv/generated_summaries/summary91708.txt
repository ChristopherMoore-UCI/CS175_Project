Retina MacBook Pro: The Laptop From the Future [REVIEW] In addition to the adjustments to the Retina MacBook Pro line, Apple also took the price of its 13-inch MacBook Air down a notch: The 13-inch model with 256GB of flash storage now costs $1,399. "What's inescapable is that this first version of the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro isn't a winner when it comes to price and performance," wrote Mashable senior tech analyst Christina Warren in her review. The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro now starts at $1,499 for 128GB of solid-state flash storage, and $1,699 for 256GB of storage. -- Apple on Wednesday said it would cut the price of its 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display while simultaneously updating it with faster processors. The price cuts and speed bumps of the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro make a lot of sense in the light of reviews, which praised the laptop's high-resolution 2,560 x 1,600 display, but lamented that it didn't have the same kind of power to drive those pixels as its larger 15-inch sibling.
