-- A battle of former World No.1's in Tokyo saw Ana Ivanovic continue her 2014 renaissance with a fourth title of the year as she beat Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki in the final Sunday. While Ivanovic and Wozniacki have gone some way to booking their place in the end of season WTA Tour finals in Singapore, another former world number one, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, has called quits on her season. Williams, 34, has also shown improved form this season and arrived in China after losing in the Quebec City final to Croatia's Mirjana Lucic-Baroni last Sunday. Seven-time grand slam champion Venus Williams was an early casualty at the tournament, going down in three sets to rising young French player Caroline Garcia. Azarenka has slipped to number 26 in the rankings after missing a string of tournaments, including the big money event in Wuhan, China which started Sunday.
