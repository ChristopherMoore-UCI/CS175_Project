He said he experienced deja vu walking back in the court where she was convicted nearly a year ago and seeing "a new jury, new judge -- new judges. -- Former American student Amanda Knox went back to court Wednesday to appeal her conviction for murdering her British roommate. The family said the appeal would detail "a lot of conjecture in these motivations, a number of discrepancies as well as a number of inconsistencies and contradictions; as well as conclusions not supported by evidence." Jurors said they believed Knox played a role in the killing but that the death was not premeditated, according to a report released in April by the judges in the case. Knox, 23, was sentenced last December to 26 years in prison for the killing of Meredith Kercher at the villa they shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Knox's family said in April that she is innocent and that no forensic evidence puts her at the crime scene.
