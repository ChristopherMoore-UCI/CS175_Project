The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill that would make suing for pay discrimination easier by altering a time limit on such suits. Ledbetter was awarded $360,000 in back pay by a federal judge in Alabama, but the verdict was overturned in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling in May 2007. Current law says such employees must sue within 180 days of receiving their first unfair paycheck. The act, named for a former Goodyear Tire employee who sued the company for gender discrimination in 1998, would effectively overturn a 2007 Supreme Court decision on the limit. The legislation, which passed the Senate on Thursday, now goes to President Barack Obama, who has promised to sign it into law.
