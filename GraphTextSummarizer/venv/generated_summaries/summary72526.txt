-- A radiation monitor in California has detected a trace of radioactive material from the stricken nuclear power plant in Japan, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization said Friday. The origin was determined to be consistent with a release from the Fukushima reactors in northern Japan." "As of now, there are no concerns in Japan or elsewhere about human health," he said. It described the exposure as "approximately one-millionth of the dose rate that a person normally receives from rocks, bricks, the sun and other natural background sources." EPA spokesman Francisco Arcaute said monitors at three sites operated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District for the EPA have not recorded anything higher than the typical "background" levels seen before the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The test ban organization maintains a worldwide network of monitoring stations to look for evidence of nuclear explosions that could violate the prohibition in its namesake treaty, which has not come into force, against nuclear weapons testing.
