Project Ogre will not be completed for some time, and Kojima will continue to produce other games, he said. "The kind of game I'm making is some game that has a very wide entrance, a very open entrance," Kojima said through a translator in a phone interview with CNN last week. Kojima has called his upcoming game Project Ogre. "Metal Gear" series creator Hideo Kojima is renowned for his Hollywood-style video games, but critics say they leave little room for players to roam. Among gamers worldwide, and especially in Japan where Kojima Productions and publisher Konami are based, Kojima is treated like a rock star.
