Mike Mortell, chairman of the Martin Metropolitan Planning Organization, said the existing Palm City bridge "is in fine shape," but a bigger bridge is needed. Some residents say it's wasteful to spend money on a new bridge when there's one less than three miles away. But she said the congestion can be resolved without spending money on a new bridge. "I think we could actually have gotten federal stimulus dollars for projects that we all support and are necessary here." Supporters say the new bridge will ease traffic congestion, aid hurricane evacuations and create about 3,500 jobs.
