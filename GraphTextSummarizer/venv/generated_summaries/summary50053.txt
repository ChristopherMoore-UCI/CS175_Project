Kaim responded by accusing NATO warplanes and Libyan rebels of attacking power stations, high-voltage lines and pipelines. In an e-mail to CNN, NATO military spokesman denied accusations that the alliance targeted Libyan electrical power lines. "The tanker was taken with the help of NATO to Benghazi and it arrived at 1:30 in the afternoon to Benghazi seaport," Kaim said on Friday. Frustration could be felt at a recent government press conference, when a Libyan man repeatedly pressed Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on why some Tripoli neighborhoods had power while others suffered black-outs for days. "The Tripoli power cuts are caused by NATO and rebel attacks on power stations," announced a television presenter on Thursday.
