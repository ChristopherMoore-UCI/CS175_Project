And recently, for just a short time, Pizza Hut celebrated this milestone anniversary with an online-only Book It alumni program for those of us who participated when we were young. Inspired by President Reagan urging corporations to get involved in education (hooray, tax write offs!), Pizza Hut officially started its Book It program in 1984. Without free pizza my life is meaningless. -- I vaguely recall Pizza Hut's Book It elementary school reading incentive program. Good tattoos make good pizza.
