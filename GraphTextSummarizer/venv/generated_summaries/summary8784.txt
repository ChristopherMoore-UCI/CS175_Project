During their time in London earlier this year, the cast and crew stayed in the London Bridge area in 85 apartments. "For London, it's really nice that we have everyone in the same place, but in Madrid, we're in 24 different places," said Jerome Vezina, the travel and lodging coordinator. "Right now, we're in London, in the U.K., and we're working on making sure we have documents ready for Spain, for Russia, for France, because we're visiting those countries by the end of the year," said GeneviÃ¨ve Deslandes, the manager of the Canadian performing group's traveling show Kooza. More than just a circus, Kooza is a community that includes two physiotherapists and four chefs. On the road for 300 days a year, a Cirque du Soleil touring troupe of 175 relies on the same precise planning for its travel arrangements as it does for its acrobatic moves and dare devil routines. "We don't live in the present -- sometimes it's sad to say like that -- we really live in the future," Deslandes said.
