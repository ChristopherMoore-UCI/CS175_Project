Asked why the parents allegedly did this, Parker said, "Apparently, they have some type of belief that affects what they feed him and what type of medical care that they will allow him to receive." Then, on February 20, a National Park Services police officer noticed "something odd" about a man panhandling in Louis Armstrong Park in New Orleans, and as the officer interviewed the man, the panhandler texted someone on his cell phone, Parker said in a statement. The parents had lost custody of their son after Los Angeles County officials made "repeated attempts" to help the parents care for their son and found the boy suffering "from numerous medical conditions that could have been prevented with the proper care and medication," the statement said. The boy, tracked down Friday, was returned Saturday evening to the custody of his maternal grandparents in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, about 40 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, authorities said. -- A 5-year-old California boy, missing for two years after his parents lost custody and then allegedly abducted him, was found undernourished and weighing 38 pounds, Los Angeles County authorities said Tuesday. The boy was undernourished and had other medical conditions, authorities said.
