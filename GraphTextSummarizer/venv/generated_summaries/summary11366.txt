Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that despite a decade at war, men and women in uniform are not always on the radar of America's non-military families. -- America's top military official nudged the nation's newest class of officers Saturday to fight a different sort of battle and close a gap between themselves and civilians who do not always understand a soldier's sacrifice. Both Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have previously sounded concern over potential alienation of the military and have urged more dialogue to end the disconnect. "Our work is appreciated, of that I am certain," Mullen said in a commencement speech Saturday. America's all-volunteer military of 1.4 million members, he said, was a small, insular force compared to the general population -- scattered on bases across America or deployed to faraway places.
