The Obama administration is also pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions, a "cap and trade" policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions. The order also called on agencies to increase energy efficiency, conserve water and reduce waste, among other things. "Our goal is to lower costs, reduce pollution and shift federal energy expenses away from oil and towards local, clean energy." Achieving its goals for reducing greenhouse gas pollution would save $8 billion to $11 billion in avoided energy costs over the next decade, the White House said. Obama stressed the importance of energy efficiency in his State of the Union address Wednesday, saying "the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy, and America must be that nation.
