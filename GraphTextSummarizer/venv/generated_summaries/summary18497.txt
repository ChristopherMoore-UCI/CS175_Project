Coatesville has been hit by a string of arsons in recent months and although the arson task force investigating those cases made Monday's arrest, officials did not link the arrest to any other arson cases. Robert Tracey, 37, was taken into custody Monday afternoon for allegedly setting two fires Friday night, Chester County District Attorney Joe Carroll said. On January 23, Tracey, who was then an assistant chief of volunteer firefighters in Coatesville, told CNN affiliate WPVI that fighting multiple fires was "really taxing the fire department." -- A firefighter in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, was arrested Monday in connection with two recent arson incidents, authorities said. Carroll said eyewitness accounts, including descriptions of the suspect's clothes, helped lead to the arrest.
