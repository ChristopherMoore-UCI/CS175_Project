Take a look at the slums where Peñaflorida and his group spend their Saturdays » Through his group, Peñaflorida has successfully mentored former gang members, addicts and dropouts, seeing potential where others see problems. "I would probably be in jail right now, most likely a drug addict -- if I hadn't met Efren." Efren Peñaflorida, 28, also was bullied by gangs in high school. For the past 12 years, Peñaflorida and his team of teen volunteers have taught basic reading and writing to children living on the streets. Today, he offers Filipino youth an alternative to gang membership through education.
