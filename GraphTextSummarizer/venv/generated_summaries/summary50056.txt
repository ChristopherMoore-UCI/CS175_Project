"Last year, to recognize the importance of the players and the key role they have in building our sport, the USTA shared our vision to reach $50 million in prize money at the U.S. Open by 2017," Dave Haggerty, the USTA's chairman of the board and president, said in a statement Wednesday. Wimbledon and the U.S. Open lead the way in prize money of the four majors. "This year's prize money increase continues the commitment to make the U.S. Open one of the most lucrative purses in all of sports. It seems that every grand slam nowadays increases the total on offer and the U.S. Open didn't buck the trend after announcing it will pay out a tournament record $3 million to singles winners in September at Flushing Meadows. Overall, prize money climbs to a tournament record $38.3 million.
