The 37-year-old midfielder matched the mark of 519 league games set by Giuseppe Bergomi in 1999, having passed 700 in all competitions in the black and blue of the Nerazzuri in May's Champions League final win over Bayern Munich.

But it was one of the club's more recent signings who inspired a win which lifted Inter into fourth above Roma on goal difference and eight points adrift of leaders AC Milan, who travel to Lecce on Sunday night. -- Javier Zanetti equaled Inter Milan's Serie A appearance record as the Italian champions continued their revival under new coach Leonardo with a 4-1 win over Bologna on Saturday. It was the fourth successive victory for Brazilian Leonardo, who replaced the sacked Rafael Benitez last month.
