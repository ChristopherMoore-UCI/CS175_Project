Dozens of major cities including London, New York, Washington, Mexico City and Tel Aviv, will take part in the rides, according to organizers Improv Everywhere. The New York City-based group boasts of causing "scenes of chaos and joy" usually involving socially awkward or unusual situations. After the rides, participants will flood to pre-determined bars for cocktails and chatter. Other popular pranks have included sending hundreds of participants to a beach wearing black tuxedos and evening gowns, and flooding a Best Buy store with members dressed exactly like the staff. Improv Everywhere started the No Pants Subway Ride in New York 10 years ago, according to its website.
