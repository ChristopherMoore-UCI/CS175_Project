But the NRC said the web-surfing control room operators were directly responsible for monitoring the reactor and other plant systems, and that their actions violated plant procedures requiring operators to remain attentive and focused on their work. And importantly, the NRC said, the computer use did not present an avenue for hackers to gain access to reactor control systems, a modern-day fear at industrial plants. In a notice to Entergy Operations Inc., operators of the River Bend Station, the NRC said that it appears that operators "remained attentive to reactor operations, indications, and alarms" while surfing the Internet. The NRC chastised the plant, saying that while River Bend Station "had strong evidence that a safety culture problem existed," comprehensive actions were not taken for "at least a year. "This violation is a serious concern to the NRC not only because accessing the Internet ... has the potential to distract the licensed operator," the NRC said, but also because of the "large number of licensed reactor operators" who deliberately chose to ignore the ban.
