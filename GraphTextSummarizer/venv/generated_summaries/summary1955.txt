Such dizzying numbers understandably raise an important question, one that we have been wrestling with at least since Thomas Malthus famously predicted that rising populations would create a food crunch: Can the world's supply of food continue to meet demand? Most importantly, the number of calories per person per day tells us that there is enough food on the planet for us all. This number has actually been growing, suggesting that the amount of food produced per person has been steadily rising (in 1990 there were 2,619 dietary calories per person per day). 2,868: The number of dietary calories available on our planet per person per day in 2011, the last year for which data is available. Because fundamentally, the data show us that we have enough food.
