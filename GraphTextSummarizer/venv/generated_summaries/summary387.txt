The crowded population, primarily comprised of Tamil civilians, is subject to the continuing Sri Lankan government assaults. -- The United Nations humanitarian chief Wednesday criticized a two-day pause in the fighting between the Sri Lankan army and Tamil Tiger rebels as "inadequate. " John Holmes, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told reporters that the 48-hour break in hostilities was not sufficient, even as fighting resumed in the northeast of the country. Holmes also called attention to the fact that the press has been barred from covering the civil strife in Sri Lanka. The British and French foreign ministers released a joint statement as well on Wednesday, claiming that the LTTE is also using Tamil civilians as human shields.
