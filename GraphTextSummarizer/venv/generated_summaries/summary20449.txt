Tel Hazor in northern Israel has long been a treasure trove for archeologists, but a recent discovery of part of a 4,000-year-old Egyptian sphinx has been a most unexpected find. But every summer, archeologists, students and volunteers descend on Tel Hazor to uncover how the ancients lived. " But experts and volunteers say part of the rewards of working on the excavation is getting to know a different group of people -- those still living. "Maybe this was a gift which the Egyptian king sent to the local king of Hazor. It is also the only monumental piece of Egyptian sculpture found anywhere in the Levant," he said, referring to the region spanning the east of the Mediterranean Sea.
