Seventy years ago, Menachem Bodner was known as Elias Gottesman, Auschwitz ID A-7733. During the 70-year memorial for the liberation of Auschwitz on Tuesday, he visited the camp in search for his identical twin brother, separated shortly after liberation. And both survived Auschwitz to be taken into a care home for children after liberation. Menachem Bodner has been to Auschwitz three times: First as a child prisoner of just 4 years old. They had no idea that Menachem was alive and had assumed that he and his entirely family had perished in Auschwitz.
