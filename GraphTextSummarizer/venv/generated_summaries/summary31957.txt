The video series' founder, Joe Francis, filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court in July accusing his former employee, Ryan Simkins, of violating confidentiality agreements with the book. "Simkins agreed orally and in writing not to disclose confidential information or speak publicly in a manner that could harm the reputation of Mr. Francis or the Girls Gone Wild enterprise," his suit said. Bars, Boobs and Busted -- 5 years on the Road with Girls Gone Wild" was filed as an exhibit in the publisher's response to a lawsuit aimed at stopping its sale on Tuesday. An excerpt of the filing obtained by CNN described a purported encounter between Simkins and Hilton, who was naked in her dressing room during a photo shoot in Los Angeles. Hilton was about to fly to Europe to meet Francis, whom she was dating at the time, he wrote.
