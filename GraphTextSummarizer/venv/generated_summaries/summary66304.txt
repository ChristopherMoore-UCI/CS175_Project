Bieber sang a montage of three songs with Usher and actor Jaden Smith, the 12-year-old son of actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. Dylan sang and played his harmonica with best new artist nominee Mumford and Sons, and rising roots rockers, the Avett Brothers, in a salute to the comeback of acoustic music. Rihanna, who appeared to have recovered from her bout with the flu, also delivered a steamy rendition of her hit "What's My Name" with best new artist nominee Drake. Eminem was later handed a Grammy for best rap album for "Recovery," the best selling CD of 2010. Yolanda Adams, Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride and best new artist nominee Florence Welch sang a soulful montage of Franklin's hits, including "A Natural Woman," "Ain't No Way," "Knock On Your Door," "Think," "Baby I Love You" and "Respect." Franklin did not attend, but instead a video message was played.
