They found more than 40 firearms, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, knives and other weapons They found restraints indicating that "Oestrike held the victim, Brooke Slocum, in captivity there for a period of time before he murdered her," Wyoming Police Chief James E. Carmody said at a news conference Monday. The FBI has been enlisted to help the Wyoming, Michigan, police department investigate the murders of pregnant 18-year-old Brooke Slocum and her boyfriend, 25-year-old Charles Oppenneer. While executing a search warrant on Slocum's computer, police found e-mail exchanges with a local man named Brady Oestrike. The e-mails -- which originated with a Craigslist post written by one of the victims -- detailed plans for the 31-year-old Oestrike to meet the couple at a park -- the park where Oppenneer's body was subsequently found -- and pay them for sex, police said. While investigating Oppenneer's death, police learned that his teenage girlfriend, Slocum, was his last known contact, but she could not be located.
