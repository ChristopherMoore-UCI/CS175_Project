House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrel Issa slams IRS officials in the report for their "inability to keep politics out of objective decisions" and points to a "general loathing" toward conservative organizations. The latest report from House Republicans on IRS targeting of conservative groups - their sixth - says the tax collection agency "systematically targeted" conservative groups over the course of two years and ties the behavior to a "culture of bias" among IRS employees. "Conservative organizations were not just singled out because of their political beliefsâ€”they were targeted by IRS officials and employees who expressed a general loathing toward them even while begrudgingly admitting that those organizations were in compliance with...the tax code," the report reads. But most of all, the report charges that IRS staffers inserted their own political beliefs into their jobs, allowing their liberal bias to influence professional decisions on whether groups should obtain tax-exempt status. The report also slams Holly Paz, the director of the IRS's Rulings and Agreements section, for allowing IRS agents to use "inappropriate screening criteria."
