He then will appear with his son, former President George W. Bush, in a public event as he unveils a biography he has written about his dad -- an occurrence which is sure to draw a lot of public attention on both of them, their relationship and the Bush presidencies. "Throughout his long career in public service President Bush was always mindful of human rights and the need to advance the cause of peace in the world," said former Ambassador Ryan Crocker, dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. Bush 41 now waits to see whether his son former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will run for the White House as he has urged him to do -- although other members of the family have not embraced a possible third President Bush as enthusiastically. -- Despite being out of office for more than two decades, former President George H.W. Bush has been a regular feature in political news this year -- receiving awards for volunteer work or jumping out of planes to celebrate his birthday -- and this week he kicks up his schedule right as his last name is again buzzing with presidential speculation. In his new book George W. Bush not only discusses the professional highlights of his dad but also his influence on his own life -- growing up in Texas, recounting early campaign trips with him, his decision to go into politics then following in his footsteps into the White House and the decision to go to war in Iraq -- a country which dominated both Bush presidencies.
