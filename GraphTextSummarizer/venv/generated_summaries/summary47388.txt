Mali names new prime minister in abrupt change of leadership Mali held its first democratic elections in 1992 after decades of military rule. Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voiced new concerns about the political situation in Mali when soldiers loyal to the coup leader arrested interim Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra in unclear circumstances, and Diarra resigned. The two groups now control two thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. The new U.N. mission is also tasked with helping Mali reduce the threat posed by terrorist groups, including al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Movement of Unity and Jihad in Western Africa. The international community voiced concerns about al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and expanding its presence in Mali.
