Reese Witherspoon supports #AskHerMore: "It's hard being a woman in Hollywood" Notes Hollywood stylist Cristina Ehrlich of awards-season red carpets: "These women in many cases are being paid a great deal of money to wear these dresses. Stylists, a fashion commentator and a luxury-brand exec are speaking out about a movement that sneers at Hollywood's implicit deal: gratis gowns in exchange for money or mentions. Not surprisingly, fashion designers providing free couture dresses don't exactly feel the same way. In other words, ladies who look like a million bucks (and have been paid that much or more from deals with brands like Dior or Chanel) can't expect not to be asked about what they're wearing. They'd take the money any time, believe me." Is red carpet coverage sexist?
