On one side was the Moran family -- brothers Jason and Mark, father Lewis and matriarch Judy Moran. Crime patriarch Lewis Moran, who was facing drug charges, was shot dead while drinking at his local pub. Family matriarch Judy Moran was arrested as an accessory to the murder of her brother-in-law, Des Tuppence Moran. The Moran brothers accused Williams of undercutting them, by selling cheap pills on the street. Victoria's Purana police task force had spent years investigating the drug kingpin and they finally had enough evidence to arrest Williams, charging him with multiple murders.
