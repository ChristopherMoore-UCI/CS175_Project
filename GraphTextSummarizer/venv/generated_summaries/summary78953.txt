Bravo initially had told investigators he got into "an altercation with Aguilar" the night the college student went missing, police said. At the time, the police spokesman said that blood found in several locations in Bravo's vehicle would undergo an expedited analysis and be compared against known DNA samples of Aguilar. The suspect said he then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city, prompting police to warn that Aguilar may have been disoriented and/or seriously injured. But it hasn't been confirmed that this body, found in Levy County, is that of Christian Aguilar. Christian Aguilar, 18, was last seen on September 20.
