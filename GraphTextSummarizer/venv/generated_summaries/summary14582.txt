Hamas says it wants, among other things, the lifting of Israeli restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. Israel: Halt to violence is key Israel would be willing to ease sanctions "if all aggression from Gaza stops," Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said Monday. More than 60 construction industry companies, which provide crucial building materials, were hit by Israeli strikes, according to Palestinian officials. "We are not following Hamas policies, we are following Israeli policies," Hassouna said. But as Palestinian and Israeli officials hold indirect talks in Cairo to seek a more lasting end to hostilities, residents of Gaza are confronting the longer-term question of how the territory can rebuild.
