Departures: Perfect New York City hotel rooms Hotel Santa Teresa, Rio de Janeiro With a population that exceeds six million and growing tourism, Rio de Janeiro is one of the most energetic cities on the globe. Take two-year-old Hotel da Estrela in Lisbon's Campo de Ourique neighborhood. Make a beeline for two-year-old Hotel da Estrela in Campo de Ourique, a central neighborhood whose most interesting points of reference are mom-and-pop shops, relaxing parks and 18th-century churches. Its location in the Palmeraies, at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, means you are a drive away from the town square of Djemaa El-Fna and its snake charmers, the Koutoubia Mosque and thumping nightclubs like Ibiza import Pacha. While it may not offer lightning-quick access to the Hagia Sophia, it does feature stunning, uncluttered views of the Bosphorus Strait without the tourist din that haunts more central neighborhoods like Taksim or Beyoglu.
