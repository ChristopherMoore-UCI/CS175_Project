Double gold was the theme on day two of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi Sunday with Austria's Markus Salcher and Akira Kano of Japan achieving the feat at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. Roman Petushkov also collected his second gold medal of the Games with his teammates Irek Zaripov and Aleksandr Davidovich in second and third place. The other golds awarded Sunday came in nordic skiing events, with Ukraine picking up its first gold of the Paralympics. The 22-year-old Salcher, who was born with the right side of his body paralyzed, edged out fellow Austrian Matthias Lanzinger and Russian Alexey Bugaev. Kano wrapped up the same double in the sitting class, racing down the course in one minute 19.51 seconds, over two seconds clear of teammate Taiki Morri.
