-- Diego Milito scored in each half as Inter Milan beat Bayern Munich 2-0 to win the Champions League final and claim an historic treble. Growing in confidence, Inter should have been two up before the break as Milito turned provider to set up Sneijder, who shot straight at Butt with the goal at his mercy. Bayern had made the better start in terms of possession without creating a clear cut chance before Inter scored the crucial opening goal. Bayern could offer little threat as Inter comfortably held on for a deserved triumph having beaten Chelsea and reigning champions Barcelona en-route to the final. Robben forced a one-handed save from Cesar before Milito gave Inter a two-goal cushion with more superb finishing.
