Our premise is that new science, technology, and entrepreneurship can lead to: ● A rapidly growing economy with more jobs, more take-home pay and more economic opportunity; ● A new system of better learning at lower cost for your entire lifetime; ● A dramatic improvement in health outcomes and reduced costs leading to longer lives, greater independence for the elderly, and a dramatic increase in high-value jobs marketing American health innovations throughout the world; ● A modernized government that is much less expensive, more effective, and more reliable and accountable; ● A better environment through sound science, entrepreneurship, and focused problem-solving; ● A stronger, leaner, less wasteful national security system; ● A balanced budget within a decade through a combination of: -- greater economic growth; -- more government revenues from a larger economy and from royalties from energy and other natural resources; -- dramatic modernization of government to reduce waste and eliminate fraud; -- breakthroughs in health dramatically lowering the cost of health care; -- returning power to the states and to the people. Opinion: 3 ways to avert Washington's next disaster Budget Conference strategy Republicans in the Budget Conference should focus first on economic growth, second on increased revenue through increased energy royalties, third on modernizing government to reduce fraud and theft, and fourth on dramatic opportunities for better health outcomes at lower costs. An historic opportunity The dramatic breakthroughs in science, technology, and entrepreneurship are creating new policy opportunities for a better future with a better economy, more take-home pay, better health, more learning, greater national security, a better, smaller, modernized government, and a balanced federal budget. While Republicans are currently on defense, the failures and costs of Obamacare, the continuing weak economy in jobs and take-home pay, growing government debt, and inevitable failures of bureaucratic big government will only make it more obvious that Washington and the bureaucracy is hopelessly broken. What we are proposing is to replace the argument of more versus less with an argument of better future versus failed present.
