When Mandela was released in 1990, I was in South Africa covering it as a reporter, traveling with Jackson. What I believe did change during Mandela's time in prison was his view of what it would take to move his country forward after the end of apartheid as a free and democratic country for all South Africans. Beyond the country's healing, it also demonstrated that Mandela would be the president of all South Africa, not just a black South Africa. It allowed black South Africans to learn what happened to their loved ones who disappeared. Since Mandela passed, a narrative has emerged that he entered prison as a violent revolutionary and emerged as a nonviolent peacemaker and reconciler.
