The topic: the immigration debate and what she called a wave of hate sweeping the land -- one that isn't limited to illegal immigrants, but which is now affecting all Hispanics regardless of where they were born, what language they speak or what flag they salute. With lightning speed, the debate went from anti-illegal immigrant to anti-immigrant to anti-Mexican. Too many politicians are trying too hard to portray themselves as tough on illegal immigration. People ask why Mexico won't help stop illegal immigration. After nearly 20 years of writing opinions and insisting that I don't speak for all Hispanics, in recent months, I've heard from hundreds of Hispanics who -- appreciative of my middle-ground approach to the immigration issue -- insist that I can speak for them anytime.
