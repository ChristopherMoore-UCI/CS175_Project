-- A New Orleans bartender who accused Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. of pushing her has dropped all charges against him, bar management said Wednesday. Gooding and his attorney met with police Wednesday and was given a court summons, police said, but later in the day the bar's management said the bartender chose to drop all charges. The unnamed female bartender told police Gooding stopped by the Old Absinthe House in the French Quarter in the early hours of Tuesday with a group of people. She said Gooding soon became angry with other patrons who recognized him and wanted to take pictures with him. He won an Academy Award in 1997 for best supporting actor in the film "Jerry Maguire" and starred in this year's "Red Tails," about the Tuskegee Airmen.
