And even though it was supported by more than 70% of the American people -- Republicans, Democrats, and independents -- 100% of Senate Republicans said no." Democrats rejected a Republican proposal that was aimed, in part, at speeding infrastructure spending by easing regulations that can slow construction, because they oppose GOP plans to offset its cost by rescinding $40 billion in spending approved for this year. The GOP-backed measure would provide "a new, devoted revenue stream" by tying infrastructure spending to expanded domestic energy production, using revenue generated from new production to help pay for infrastructure initiatives across the country. "The president says he wants more money for infrastructure and he's said he supports more American-made energy, so I hope he'll work with us on this," Boehner said. Also on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner unveiled plans to move a separate infrastructure bill through that chamber. In a pair of votes aimed more at making political points than law, the Senate rejected competing Democratic and Republican proposals to boost construction of roadways and other infrastructure projects.
