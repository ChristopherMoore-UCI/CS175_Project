But then, just about every character in "Admission" has an enjoyably feisty intellectual attitude, from the wily dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn, for once not used as a walking punchline, and all the better for it), to Portia's switchblade-sharp office rival (Gloria Reuben), to the precocious students at John's school who question Portia about Princeton being a ''corporation'' devoted to the status quo. He's pushing one of his students for admission to Princeton; the kid, Jeremiah (Nat Wolff), is a prodigy with a troubled background, and John and Portia begin to tussle over his future from the moment they meet. Box office preview: 'The Croods' will oust 'Oz' from top spot Portia Nathan (Tina Fey) is one of Princeton's elite team of admissions officers. Kate Winslet confirmed for role in 'Divergent' Even with this soft-boiled romance at its center, "Admission" really is a movie about whether Jeremiah, with his lowly grade-point average and astonishing AP test scores, is going to get into Princeton. "Admission" has a promising first half, and the movie springs a real wild card in Lily Tomlin's brashly cutting and funny turn as Portia's mother, who wears her die-hard '70s feminism like a suit of burlap armor.
