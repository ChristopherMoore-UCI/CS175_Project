Firefighters arriving shortly after 11 p.m. Friday found three of four sides of a Decatur, Georgia, home on fire, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue spokesman Eric L. Jackson. Jackson said that local police are involved in the case, and that "charges are forthcoming." -- Two children -- who were among five in a suburban Atlanta house without any adults -- died and another is in critical condition after their home went up in flames, a fire department spokesman said Saturday. A 10-year-old was in critical condition Saturday morning at Atlanta's Egleston children's hospital. "They were bringing the kids out and that's it," neighbor Shantel Ammamoo told CNN affiliate WSB.
