"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat," Winston Churchill once told the British House of Commons. "This year marks the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death -- the blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill, and as such we expect there to be great interest in it. Churchill had fallen out of bed and fractured a hip, necessitating a multiweek stay at Middlesex Hospital. Duke's auction house has announced it will auction a vial of Churchill's blood, taken during a hospital stay in 1962, three years before his death. The blood was drawn by nursing student Patricia Fitzgibbon, according to the auction house.
