Every person with a smartphone already has, in essence, a personal jukebox in his or her pocket -- what's the need for real jukeboxes if everyone has an infinite and portable selection of music available at all times? " (And, for those who are accustomed to VIP lounges and skyboxes, users of the app can, from many feet away, ditch in line, according to AMI: "They can even bump their songs to the front of the queue by selecting the Priority Play option for an additional charge.") Lovers of jukeboxes have long known, through word of mouth, where the best ones in every city are. Jukeboxes, though ... well, jukeboxes were never meant to be regarded from a distance. So perhaps it will turn out to be a brilliant business decision to adapt jukeboxes to the smartphone era. So, on the surface, it makes sense that jukebox manufacturers would try to do all they could do to appeal to the smartphone generation.
