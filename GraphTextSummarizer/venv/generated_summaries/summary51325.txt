On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch also sounded the alarm, saying its interviews with victims and witnesses indicated unidentified rebel fighters had killed at least 184 civilians -- though the actual number is likely significantly higher -- and injured many others in attacks on villages in Beni territory. "Large-scale rebel attacks occurring nearly weekly have terrorized residents of Beni and left them uncertain where to seek safety," said Ida Sawyer, senior Congo researcher at Human Rights Watch. " "This sequence of violence, killings, assassinations, and human rights violations in Beni territory needs to stop immediately," he said, speaking after a visit to Beni to pay tribute to the victims of previous suspected ADF attacks. "UN and Congolese forces need to urgently coordinate their efforts and improve protection of civilians in Beni." Killings, rights violations Human Rights Watch cited U.N. and Congolese army officials as saying they believe the recent attacks were carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan-led Islamist rebel group that has been active in Beni territory since 1996. Human Rights Watch urged government forces and the U.N. peacekeeping force in DR Congo, MONUSCO, to work together to restore stability and to identify those behind the violence.
