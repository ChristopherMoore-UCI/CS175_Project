"I finished second to Anna Nordqvist at the LPGA Championship, and after that it was kind of on a downhill slope, slippery slope. Taiwan's five-time major winner Yani Tseng (68) was one stroke back from Wright, ahead of a clutch of players on three under including 2010 U.S. Open winner Paula Creamer. " So during her time away from the course, Wright set about taking her first steps on alternative career paths. She holed a 13-foot birdie putt to clinch the New Zealand Open last month, and after a solid first round she is on track to challenge for her first major title in California. The Australian turned her back on golf last October, struggling with the isolation of life on the LPGA Tour and under the weight of a condition which was driving her to drink.
