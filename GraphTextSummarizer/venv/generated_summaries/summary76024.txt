"She and her family are in a safe location, and the Government of Sudan has assured us of the family's continued safety," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday, confirming that Ibrahim had been released on bail. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. According to her lawyer, the case began when one of Ibrahim's relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. Ibrahim was trying to leave the African country for the United States with her family, her legal team said Wednesday. The U.S. State Department said Tuesday that Ibrahim and her family had been "temporarily detained at the airport" for questioning over issues relating to their travel and documentation.
