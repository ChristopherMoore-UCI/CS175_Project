The drama goes back to the woman's work as a lab supervisor at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the center of a maelstrom of Ebola fears in the United States. The turmoil started in September, when Duncan went to the hospital with Ebola symptoms, and health care workers initially sent him home with antibiotics. If the four do not develop symptoms by Monday, they will have managed to not contract Ebola despite being in close proximity to Duncan. It's where Liberian patient Duncan was misdiagnosed and later died, and where two nurses became the first people to contract Ebola in America.
