"I am not comparing myself to Mrs. Astor, but I've seen how you can be dismissed as not being good enough, or hip enough, and seeing it happen to Tony made me make sure that it didn't happen to my own daughter." NBC's "Today" show weatherman, Al Roker, also came to Marshall's defense, having met him at his church 10 years ago. Marshall's former attorney, Francis Morrissey, was also convicted of five counts relating to the case, including forgery and scheming to defraud Astor. The judge also gave Marshall's co-defendant, attorney Francis Morrissey, the same sentence of one to three years in prison. One of the most serious convictions involved Marshall giving himself a $1 million-a-year raise for handling his mother's affairs, said Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann. Astor's grandson, Philip Marshall, declined to comment after the sentencing.
