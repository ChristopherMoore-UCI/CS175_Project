If that doesn't get your senses sizzling or whet your appetite for seduction, there are plenty of others -- what shall we call them -- interesting scents that have been available in recent years. Burger King ads in Japan promise a limited-edition perfume for April Fool's Day to make you smell like a couple of all-beef patties. The name may lose something in translation, but Flame-Grilled Fragrance will sell for 5,000 yen (about $41) and comes with a free Whopper. Burger King did this a few years back in the United States with the fragrance Flame. Flame was billed as "the scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broiled meat."
