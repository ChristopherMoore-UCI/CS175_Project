Gov. Bobby Jindal seemed "over-coached and over-rehearsed," CNN's Candy Crowley said. "The Bobby Jindal you see on the Sunday shows was not the Bobby Jindal who showed up to give this speech," said CNN Senior Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. Jindal speech portrayed GOP as 'one trick pony' Four years later he was the Democratic nominee for president. But after nearly universal criticism was heaped on Gov. Bobby Jindal's high-profile response to President Obama's address to Congress Tuesday night, the Louisiana Republican may be wishing he had stayed home. While the president had the benefit of the ornate halls of Congress as his setting and numerous camera angles to give a sweeping view of the grand House Gallery, Jindal had to deliver his speech in a solitary room amid an almost deafening silence.
