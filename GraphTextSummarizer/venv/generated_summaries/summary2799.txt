Wilson shouted "you lie" after Obama laid out what the congressman said were "bogus claims" about health care reform "spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost." "The best example is the claim made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens," Obama said in his speech. Wilson has come under fire for shouting "you lie" to Obama during the Wednesday night address to Congress on health care reform. News of that cash haul comes after Wilson directly asked in a Web video for campaign cash to fend off attacks from political opponents and said he's standing by his opposition to Democratic efforts at health care reform. -- U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson -- the South Carolina Republican who heckled President Obama during his speech to a joint session of Congress -- has raised at least $1 million in contributions, a campaign aide confirmed. " In a YouTube video released on Thursday, Wilson said, "On these issues, I will not be muzzled, I will speak up and speak loudly against this risky plan." He added: "Supporters of the government takeover of health care, and the liberals who want to give health care to illegals, are using my opposition as an excuse to distract from the critical questions being raised about this poorly conceived plan."
