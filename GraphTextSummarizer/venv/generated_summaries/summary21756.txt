The government should not be in the business of giving unearned wealth to any group of citizens, but surely liberals and conservatives both can agree that politicians should not be taking money from middle class taxpayers and giving it to upper-middle class and rich taxpayers. A bailout is a perverse transfer from poor taxpayers to rich taxpayers. A bailout will encourage other industries to seek taxpayer handouts. Getting access to taxpayer money would be akin to giving an alcoholic the key to a liquor cabinet. It would discriminate against the 113,000 Americans who have highly-coveted jobs building cars for Nissan, BMW and other auto companies that happen to be headquartered in other nations.
