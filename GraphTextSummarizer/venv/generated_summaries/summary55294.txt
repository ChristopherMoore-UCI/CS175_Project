-- Police arrested dozens of people in downtown Oakland, California, Thursday night after hundreds protested the verdict in the trial of a white former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man, Oakland police officials told CNN. " Oakland police had prepared for protests and ways of quelling the demonstrations days before the verdict. At the high point of the protests, about 8 p.m., there were an estimated 800 people in the streets, Oakland Police Chief Anthony Batts said. Mehserle, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer at the time of the incident, was accused of shooting 22-year-old Oscar Grant on an Oakland train platform on January 1, 2009. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale.
