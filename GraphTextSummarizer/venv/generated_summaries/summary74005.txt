Then we started seeing bodies, body after dead body, wrapped in blankets on makeshift stretchers. When we passed the morgue two days later, many bodies had been partially unwrapped by family members hoping to find their loved ones. Every so often, rescuers would reach another dead body and family members would break out in a chorus of wails and screams. Several stories of mud and rock stretched down from the mountain that had unleashed this fury. That night, I settled in for an uneasy sleep in the car with my producer Wen-Chun Fan and photographer Brad Olson, knowing it was just a preview of the devastation we would witness.
