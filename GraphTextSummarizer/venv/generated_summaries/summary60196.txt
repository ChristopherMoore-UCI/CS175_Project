-- The United Nations, citing reports of cluster bombs being used by the Ukrainian government, calls the apparent use of such weapons "extremely alarming." Human Rights Watch issued a report Monday that cited "widespread use of cluster munitions" by government forces against pro-Russian rebels in southeastern Ukraine in early October. " Cluster munitions are rockets or bombs that hold dozens or hundreds of smaller bombs inside and are designed to discharge over a wide area when they hit the ground, according to HRW. The report added that though there is no conclusive evidence, it is likely that anti-government forces are also responsible for cluster munitions attacks. "The reports of use of cluster bombs are obviously extremely alarming," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said Tuesday. "The secretary-general reiterates his call for an end to use of these indiscriminate weapons and the importance of a world free of cluster bombs.
