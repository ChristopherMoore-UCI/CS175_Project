And Chris Lejuez, Carvajal's lawyer, argued that his client has diplomatic immunity, state media in Venezuela reported last week. Carvajal, who is wanted in the United States for alleged drug-trafficking ties, was Venezuela's head of military intelligence from 2004 to 2008 and was tapped as the country's consul to Aruba this year. Peter Blanken, chief prosecutor in Aruba, told CNN en Espa√±ol last week that a judge decided the arrest was "legal and correct." Since 2008, Washington has accused Carvajal of ties with drug trafficking and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group. Carvajal had a diplomatic passport and a regular passport.
