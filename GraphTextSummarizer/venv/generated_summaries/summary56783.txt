The analysis of the information from the data recorder, and the other so-called black box, the cockpit voice recorder, is expected to be part of the preliminary report that Indonesia is due to submit to international air safety regulators by January 28. That's the big question on the mind of Indonesia's Transportation Minister as investigators finish preparing the initial report into the crash last month of the Airbus A320-200 with 162 passengers on board. Jonan said none of the other planes in the area experienced the turbulent weather patterns that led the pilot of QZ8501 to request a change of course and an increase in altitude shortly before it disappeared off radar. Jonan oversaw an investigation into why Flight QZ8501 was able to take off on a Sunday, even though AirAsia lacked permission to fly from Surabaya to Singapore on that day of the week. While he calls the issue of flights operating without permission a "big worry," he says he believes it was unrelated to the crash of Flight QZ8501.
