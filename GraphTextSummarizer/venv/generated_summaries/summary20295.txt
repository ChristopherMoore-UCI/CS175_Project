A vessel carrying an estimated 200 people seeking asylum in Australia turned over last week 110 nautical miles northwest of Christmas Island. "We never know the exact number of people on board as they get on board illegally," Gagah Prakoso, a spokesman for Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency, said last week. Several ships carrying people seeking asylum in Australia have run into trouble near Christmas Island in the past two years. Merchant and naval vessels, as well as a patrol aircraft, carried out the rescue effort about 107 nautical miles north of Australia's Christmas Island, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. Christmas Island is a remote territory northwest of the Australian mainland and close to Indonesia.
