Further, the controller comes with its own accessory, known as a sub-controller, which will accentuate what's possible with Move. Shuehei Yoshida, Sony's president for worldwide studios, said Move will "demonstrate that the motion controller for PS3 will be the solution for both casual and hard-core gamers alike" and that the types of games Sony can create with it are "amazingly diverse." Among the types of games Move will work with include those that involve swords, bows and arrows, guns, punching and much more. A small device that looks like a microphone -- but with something on top of it that looks like a ping pong ball with an LED inside -- Move is Sony's bid to gain control over the motion controller wars that are currently led by Nintendo, with its Wii controller, and which many think will be dominated by Microsoft and its Project Natal controller system. While Sony is expecting consumers to use Move with a range of brand-new games, the company also clearly thinks that it will enhance game play in existing titles. As such, it showed off how Move can be used to move characters around in its hit title, Little Big Planet.
