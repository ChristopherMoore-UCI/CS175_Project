-- Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has reiterated his support for giving women the right to drive in Saudi Arabia, announcing via Twitter that it would help the economy and reduce the number of foreign workers there. " Al-Huwaider said that while she found it interesting that bin Talal put the issue in terms of how much it was costing the country, she has "stopped following any news reports about women driving" until she hears it addressed by Abdullah. In the deeply conservative kingdom, women are prohibited from driving, and many must rely on foreign drivers for transportation. And a lot of people in Saudi Arabia were against women getting educated. There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia.
