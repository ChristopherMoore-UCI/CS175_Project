FSB archives' chief Lieutenant-General Vasily Khristoforov told Interfax that the decision to destroy Hitler's remains and those of Eva Braun and the Goebbels family was ordered by the head of Russia's KGB -- forerunner to the FSB -- Yury Andropov [who briefly became Soviet leader in 1982]. A report published by Russia's Interfax news agency this week quotes the head of the FSB archives saying Hitler's remains, except parts of his skull and jaw, were burnt in 1970 and thrown into the Biederitz River in what was then East Germany. Nor do they think that the remains are likely to be those of Hitler's long term partner Eva Braun, who, so the story goes, killed herself at the same time and place as the Fuehrer in 1945. Yet despite the new evidence, Russian officials remain adamant that the remains are Hitler's and, in their defense, have released archive documents in an attempt to prove the bones are authentic. Whatever the eventual outcome is, in this, the latest in a long line of investigations into the most reviled figure of the 20th century, it seems certain that experts and conspiracy theorists alike will be picking over the bones of Hitler's life and legacy for decades to come.
