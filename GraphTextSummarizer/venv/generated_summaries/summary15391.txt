Lopez denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation. The decision to hold Giordano for 16 more days was issued after a jailhouse hearing Monday afternoon, Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said. Stein said Monday that Aruban authorities are holding Gardner's passport so it is not possible that she has left the country. "Today, nine days later, four voluntary interviews, two site visits, and more than 30 statements coming from different sources including witnesses and professionals, we cannot deduce that there is hard proof to sustain a demand by the public prosecutor against our client," Giordano's attorney, Michael Lopez, said in a written statement. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner, when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office.
