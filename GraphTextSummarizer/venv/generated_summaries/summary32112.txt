The United States is weighing a possible military role to help the Libyan revolt against leader Moammar Gadhafi, but top U.S. officials warn that the issue is controversial. Though opposition members all want to replace Gadhafi, they may not all be committed to a future democratic Libya, the officials said. " Two senior officials in the Arab League said the group's members have agreed not to accept any foreign intervention in Libya; they also agreed that they will consult with other Arab League members in order to protect Libyans' security. But she noted the Arab League statement issued Wednesday that rejected "any foreign interference within Libya on behalf of the opposition, even though they have called for Gadhafi to leave. " The administration is far from arming any opposition power, primarily because U.S. officials still don't know who the opposition is and what they are trying to achieve, senior U.S. officials said.
