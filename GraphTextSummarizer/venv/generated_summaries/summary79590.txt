British lawmakers tore into the chief executive of the security contractor that will be unable to deliver enough guards for the Olympic Games, forcing Nick Buckles to agree Tuesday that the fiasco is "a humiliating shambles. "The TSA staff will not be conducting security screening operations or security inspections," the statement said. G4S may lose $77m over guard shortfall Hammered by Vaz for saying he was "disappointed" about the failure, Buckles first said he was "deeply disappointed" and then that he was "sorry." Retired border officials and retired police officers are among those being brought in to supplement immigration staff, the Home Office said. Olympic-level security G4S has a Â£284 million ($444 million) government contract to provide security staff for the Olympic Games, but only 4,000 guards are trained and ready.
