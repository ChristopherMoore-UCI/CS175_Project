Kevin Broughton, communications director of the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, said, "many analysts accused Eric Cantor of paying more attention to Wall Street than to the people of Virginia's 7th District. Cantor, who was the No. 2 Republican in the House, lost his primary this year to unknown college professor David Brat. -- Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's new gig on Wall Street will line his pockets, to the tune of more than $1 million per year. Part of the reason was voters thought he was disconnected from his Richmond, Virginia, district by focusing instead on his duties as a fundraiser and national leader for the Republican Party. For disaffected conservatives, especially among the tea party, which came to life early in the Obama administration and took on a populist message, Cantor's move to a boutique investment bank, Moelis & Co., as a vice chairman and board member is proof that their concerns were spot on.
