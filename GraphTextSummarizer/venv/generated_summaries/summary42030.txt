It averaged 10.1 million viewers and a 3.6 adult demo rating once you add in a week of DVR playback. Fox has cancelled prehistoric dino drama "Terra Nova" after one season, ending months of will-they-or-won't-they speculation. Studio 20th Century Fox TV, however, says they fight "Terra Nova's" extinction event by shopping the series to other networks.
