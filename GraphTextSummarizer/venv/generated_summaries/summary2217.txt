Filipina caregiver Rose Fostanes won the country's version of the talent show, Wednesday, making it through the early rounds singing tunes by Tina Turner and Christina Aguilera among others, before her rendition of "My Way" by Frank Sinatra in the grand finale. For a migrant worker to have any kind of public profile is highly unusual in Israel, but for one to win ones of the country's most popular talent shows is a surprise to many, including Fostanes. The winner, who has been working in Israel for the past six years, says she has also experienced prejudice in the country and is unsure if her win might help change negative perceptions. If nothing else Fostanes says that she has received "a lot of love and care" from her fans in Israel. And Israel's version of the "X Factor" has done just that -- won not by a Jewish Israeli, but a migrant worker from the Philippines.
