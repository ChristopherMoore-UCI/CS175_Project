He said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed. Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, came home from work to find the door unlocked, lights on and a window that had been tampered with at the family's Kansas City home. She said she has not talked to her sons about it because she is reluctant to put them through "anything else." Asked what she would say to someone who might be holding Lisa, Bradley told NBC, "She needs her family, and we need her. "They said they heard noises (the night Lisa disappeared)," Bradley said. Two anonymous benefactors have offered a $100,000 reward for Lisa's safe return, according to Bill Stanton, a private investigator working with the family.
