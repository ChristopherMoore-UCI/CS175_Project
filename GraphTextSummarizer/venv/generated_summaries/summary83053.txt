Amid renewed violence in eastern Ukraine, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France planned a face-to-face meeting in Belarus on Wednesday. He reiterated that there is no military solution to the crisis with separatists in eastern Ukraine, and that borders should not be changed by force. Over the past day, shelling killed eight civilians in Ukraine's Donetsk region, a rebel official told reporters Sunday. So there is uncertainty about this meeting happening, but given the serious worsening of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the Germans feel it is worth a try. Western leaders and the Ukrainian government accuse Russia of providing weapons and training to the pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
