-- A man charged with stalking sports reporter Erin Andrews is now accused of making nude videotapes of her in one more city than previously thought, according to court documents filed Wednesday. But the information filed Wednesday alleges that Barrett also taped Andrews through an altered peephole in a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio, in February 2008. In addition, the complaint said that Barrett "traveled from Illinois to Victim Andrews' home state" in August 2008, but did not specify which state. Barrett waived his right to be indicted by a grand jury, Mrozek said, and authorities on Wednesday filed a criminal information against him in place of an indictment. Barrett stayed in the hotel room next door to Andrews, the information said.
