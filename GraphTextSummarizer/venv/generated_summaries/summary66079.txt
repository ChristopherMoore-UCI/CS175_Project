Reports of a possible explosives cache came to the U.S. State Department in June 2010, according to a State Department source. The secretary of the navy reported in June 2010 that four people had been detained for allegedly being in possession of 20 kilograms of explosives in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. -- News stories saying authorities thwarted a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Mexico are not true, the Mexican secretary of the navy said Tuesday. According to the stories published by the two Mexican media outlets, the finding was related to a plot by the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab to attack the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. The Mexican president's office and the Mexican Embassy in Washington told CNN they had no information regarding the alleged plot.
