-- One after the other, dozens of cars and trucks slammed into the back of a multicar crash in Massachusetts until about 70 vehicles had been wrecked and at least 35 people had been taken to hospitals Marsh said that as cars came over a rise, drivers saw the accidents and tried to brake but were caught up in the chain of collisions. A bus was brought in to help transport some of the injured to hospitals. Stephen Marsh told reporters. The accidents began before dawn on icy Highway 290, Marsh said, and didn't stop until the chaos stretched 500 yards.
