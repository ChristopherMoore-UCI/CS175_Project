Roll out the software update Apple has promised a software update earlier this month to "fix" the formula used to calculate signal bar strength display, which the company pointed to as the root of the iPhone antenna problem. Go into the technical details Once Apple acknowledges the problem, it needs to give up details, such as the science behind the antenna issue, why the company didn't catch it during testing, and different potential fixes. The antenna issue, while important and a problem that Apple should have found and addressed before the product's launch last month, doesn't rise to that level. The iPhone antenna issue has been replicated in countless YouTube videos and by multiple media organizations, including us. Don't keep trying to point to software as the problem, though: most people are aware that it's not a software bug causing the antenna issue and treating it as such is just demeaning and condescending to iPhone users everywhere.
