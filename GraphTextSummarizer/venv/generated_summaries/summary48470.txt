The practical effect: it would allow well-heeled donors to spread the wealth to give to more candidates and political groups. Regular PACs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties, while super PACs cannot. And political parties certainly will have more money to spend. Some political experts say a ruling in favor of increased, or even unlimited, aggregate individual donor contributions could put party committees and political action committees on a greater competitive track with the "super PACs." Its impact put corporations on the same free-speech footing as wealthy individuals, who have long enjoyed the ability to spend freely and independently on behalf of federal candidates.
