Clashes continued to rage on the sixth day of what appears to be a coordinated offensive by Syrian rebels to push a hard-line al Qaeda militia out of northern Syria. Militants from the rival al Nusra Front, which follows a hardline Islamist ideology inspired by al Qaeda, have joined in the battle against ISIS in recent days. The chaotic war within a war that erupted over the last week in northern Syria is further complicated by the fact that the anti-ISIS faction includes another militia tied to the al Qaeda terror network. Yilmaz said he could see and hear fighting across the border in the nearby Syrian town of Jarablus, which has been controlled for months by the al Qaeda-linked militant group called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Jarablus is one of many towns across a swath of opposition-controlled northern Syria where rebels have attacked ISIS positions in recent days.
