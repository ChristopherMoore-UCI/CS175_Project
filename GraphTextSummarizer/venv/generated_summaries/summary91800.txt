United States Customs and Border Protection officers conducting a routine inspection on Wednesday seized a cobra and other poisonous snakes in a bottle believed to be "snake wine. "The issue is that this species of snake is protected by the convention on international trade in endangered species. Customs officials in Miami seized what they believe is "snake wine," poisonous snakes bottled in alcohol. " Customs officials said the snakes, mixed in a glass container containing some form of alcohol, were inside an express mail package from Thailand. Officials said the entire snake is submerged in the alcohol, often with insects or other animals such as turtles.
