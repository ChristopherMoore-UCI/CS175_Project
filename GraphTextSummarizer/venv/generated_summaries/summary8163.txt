The coming snowfall could snap tree limbs and branches, bring down power lines and cause widespread outages, said CNN meteorologist Tom Sater. Much of the nation will feel the punch of cold weather, if not quite as hard, according to CNN meteorologists. The weather is the result of a "bomb cyclone" -- a swiftly and markedly intensifying storm -- that shifted the path of the jet stream and sent cold air rushing toward the United States, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. "I think we're all going to be feeling the bite," CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. In Eau Claire, Jason Stuttgen told CNN affiliate WQOW the snow's coming at the perfect time.
