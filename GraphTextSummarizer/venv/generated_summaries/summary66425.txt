UK spy chief Robert Hannigan has said ISIS and other extremist groups use such platforms as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to reach their target audience in a language they understand, Their methods include making use of popular hashtags for other stories in the news, such as Ebola or the World Cup, to disseminate their message, he said. Officials said that while these teens decided to travel "on their own," and were not forced into anything, this case reflects the larger phenomenon of American teens being lured to fight with ISIS through social media. U.S. officials said friends of the Colorado teens noticed them change from seemingly carefree westernized high-schoolers to devout Muslims who rejected old friends and the regular cares of girls their age. U.S. law enforcement views the case of three teenage Colorado girls who wanted to join ISIS as a good opportunity to study how the militant group recruits young people in the West, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN. The case has yielded a trove of evidence that shows how ISIS is using Westerners already among its fold to directly communicate with new recruits via social media, the officials said.
