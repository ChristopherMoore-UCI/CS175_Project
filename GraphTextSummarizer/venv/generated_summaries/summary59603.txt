"I am disappointed not to be playing in Montreal next week," Federer said in a tournament press release sent to CNN. -- Roger Federer, hampered by a back injury in recent weeks, pulled out of the Rogers Cup in Montreal with the U.S. Open just around the corner. Although no reason was given for his absence, Federer said after a surprise defeat to Daniel Brands in his native Switzerland last week that he had been having "serious problems" with the back and needed to take anti-inflammatory medication. Novak Djokovic, Murray's opponent in the Wimbledon final, is the top seed in Montreal. Rafael Nadal arrived in the Canadian city having not played since a first-round loss to Steve Darcis at Wimbledon.
