-- The House of Representatives approved $600 million in emergency funding Tuesday to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border. Senators passed a similar plan last week, but must vote again on the House measure that includes the language on border funding. A top aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that the chamber could be recalled from its August recess to take up the House-approved measure. Among other things, the bill provides for roughly 1,500 new law enforcement agents, new unmanned aerial vehicles, new forwarding operating bases and $14 million in new communications equipment. A Republican leadership source said Tuesday night that Republicans were likely to go along with passing the measure by unanimous consent.
