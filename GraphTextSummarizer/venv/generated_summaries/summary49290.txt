The victim and the boys charged are all from refugee families that have come to the United States from the war-torn West African nation of Liberia, police said. At a news conference about the case Wednesday, police did not release any information on the girl's condition, but officers called the case one of the worst they have investigated in many years. "This is a deeply disturbing case that has gripped our community," said Maricopa County attorney Andrew Thomas. And they're more concerned about that than the crime," said Weedor, who is co-founder of the CenterPoint International Foundation, which aids Liberian refugees in the United States and provides aid for those still in Liberia. In Liberia rape was not against the law until 2006, he said.
