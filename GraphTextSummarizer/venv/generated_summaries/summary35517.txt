Rahman and others were charged in a plot to bomb New York landmarks including the Lincoln Tunnel, George Washington Bridge and the FBI's New York office. The decimation of al Qaeda, the killing of bin Laden, the monitoring of the global financial network and international communications among terrorists, greater international sharing of information and public awareness make it nearly impossible to duplicate the scale and scope of the 9/11 plan. The United States has now received "specific, credible but unconfirmed" information that one or more vehicles containing explosives may be used for an attack in New York and/or Washington this weekend. These include the 1984 murder of Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg and the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. I offer a lesson from history to support my belief that smaller attacks will continue for decades.
