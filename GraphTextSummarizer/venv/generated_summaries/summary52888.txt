"I didn't know anything about cameras then, but my pictures were judged the best and I got the job," says Ramsay, who spent the war years honing her skills in portrait photography by taking pictures of soldiers and their girlfriends. "Other photographers would stand in the middle of their boats taking pictures of big yachts with plate cameras, so I developed my own style -- taking my pictures as close to the water as possible," recalls Ramsay. Even though I cleaned them after each session, they would quickly get stiff because of all the salt," says Ramsay, whose career has been immortalized in a new book by fellow photo-journalist and Brit Barry Pickthall. She kept immaculate records of her work and she remembers every photograph she's ever taken, which meant that she would immediately pick up on things if I didn't get it right," says Pickthall, a former yachting correspondent who now runs a photo agency that specializes in nautical photography.
