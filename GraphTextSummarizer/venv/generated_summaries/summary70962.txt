Every midshipman, male and female, knows what its like to tie on the gloves, Naval Academy boxing coach Jim McNally says. " With the introduction of high technology and specialization in athletics in recent years, McNally puts boxing and what his team does in very simple terms: "Boxing is as basic as it comes. One of the most famous matches took place in 1967 between Larry North, whom many know today as Oliver North of Iran-Contra fame, and Jim Webb, now a U.S. senator from Virginia and former secretary of the Navy under President Reagan. "Being the nature of the institution that we're developing warriors here," McNally said, "you get a lot of individuals that say, 'I want to go our for a sport that's a warrior-type sport that's going to help me be a warrior in my career in the Navy or the Marine Corps.' He's the future of Navy boxing."
