-- It has been said that health policy is too important to be left solely to doctors, because the determinants of health lie mainly outside the medical care system. My caricature of what passes for debate on macro-economic policy is that austerians believe that national debt has to be reduced in order to get economic growth. In fact, so close is the link between social and economic policy and health, that health can serve as an evaluator of policy, a kind of social accountant. One strategy is to deal with youth unemployment by making it a prime consideration for macro-economic policy. As a non-economist, my solution to the debate is to look not at which policy leads more quickly to economic growth, but at the effect of policy on the lives people are able to lead, and thus on their health.
