Savoie, a law student who already has a Ph.D. and a M.D., will spend 10 days in jail while Japanese prosecutors sort out the details of the case. They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan. "Japanese people think she's the victim here," Savoie said. A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. Watch why the case is complicated Â» Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order.
