Hassan Malik, 55, was arraigned Tuesday on one count of second-degree murder, according to Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. The New York Medical Examiner's office said Williams had suffered, among other injuries, blunt force trauma to her head and asphyxiation, the complaint said. Shortly after Williams' body was discovered, police released a surveillance video that showed a man dressed in a dark knit hat and leather jacket, pulling a suitcase that contained Williams' body near a stoop in East Harlem, New York. Malik said he was acting in self-defense, Vollero said. -- A man arrested in connection with the death of 28-year-old Betty Williams, whose body was found in a suitcase, has confessed to bludgeoning her with a frying pan and strangling her with an electrical cord, authorities said Tuesday.
