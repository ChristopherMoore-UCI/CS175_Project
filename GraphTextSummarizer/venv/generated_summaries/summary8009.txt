Last week, Florida prosecutors said they would not charge Zimmerman after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in November resulted in his arrest. The listing states the piece will be sent via expedited shipping from Sanford, Florida. George Zimmerman can now add "painter" to his resume after the former neighborhood watchman purportedly listed an original painting on eBay. Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., confirmed that George painted the piece. Photos were added to the auction, including one of a grinning, flannel-clad George Zimmerman holding the painting.
