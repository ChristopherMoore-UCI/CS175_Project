Coroner slams handling of Kendrick Johnson case According attorneys for Johnson's family, the former student confronted Johnson and told him "it ain't over" regarding a confrontation Johnson had with the former student's younger brother. Several members of Johnson's extended family and current Lowndes High School students were seen walking into the federal courthouse in Macon Wednesday. " Johnson's parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, believe the story about the shoe is a coverup and that their son was murdered. The sheriff's office interviewed about two dozen current and former Lowndes High School students who were on the school's wrestling team on January 10, 2013, the day Johnson disappeared. The former student would have been at a wrestling match in another city at the time Johnson is believed to have died, but lawyers say the bus did not leave Lowndes High School until after Johnson's death.
