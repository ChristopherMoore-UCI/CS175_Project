You'll see the same zombie police officer, zombie large guy and zombie girl in short-shorts over and over again. -- Over the course of more than 15 years, "Resident Evil" has established a rich history as one of the video game world's most storied franchises. Most of the opponents are not zombies. There aren't enough zombies and too many living-breathing enemies to truly feel like a worthy outing for this franchise. "Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City" ultimately comes off as a mundane, average shooter that abandons its heritage in the zombie/horror genre.
