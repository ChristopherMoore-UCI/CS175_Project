Juan Belman and Mizraim Belman got an unexpected response from President Barack Obama when they stood up and shouted while Obama was lamenting congressional inaction on immigration reform. Mizraim's older brother said Obama promised action on immigration reform. I promise," Obama said, even telling security personnel not to escort the two out. "He said he was going to act and keep his word," Juan Bellman, a junior at the University of Texas, told the paper. The brothers were nervous about interrupting Obama and were not sure if they would go through with their plan, the American-Statesman reported, but knew this was a unique opportunity.
