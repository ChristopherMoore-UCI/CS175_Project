"We have about two weeks of water left," Groesbeck Mayor Jackie Levingston said. Some 1,600 children -- many from outside the city limits in surrounding Limestone County -- draw on Groesbeck's water supply on school days. Groesbeck residents spent Monday waiting on the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife to approve an emergency three-mile pipeline to divert water off the Navasota River, using a public creek as a stop-gap to shorten the distance. "We lost more water to evaporation than we were using this summer," Levingston said in a telephone interview. The city also is contracting with a well driller out of Austin to search for ground water.
