Starbucks refuses to ban loaded guns from its coffee shops in the 43 states that allow people to openly carry loaded weapons. This alleged concern has not stopped other companies -- including Disney, California Pizza Kitchen, AMC Theaters, Toys R Us, and even Starbucks competitor Peet's Coffee & Tea -- from prohibiting guns in their stores in states where open carry is legal. But when it comes to responsible gun policy, Starbucks has lost its moral compass. Starbucks' refusal to ban guns from its stores has made it a nationwide venue for pro-gun rallies, where customers toting loaded weapons gather over coffee. We've started a petition asking Starbucks to ban guns from its stores.
