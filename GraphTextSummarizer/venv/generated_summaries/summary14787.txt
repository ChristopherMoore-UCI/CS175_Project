A long summer of pro-independence unrest was sparked in Indian administered Kashmir last year by the killing of an 18-year-old boy in police action in the capital, Srinagar. A protest erupted Saturday in a village in northern Indian-administered Kashmir after the killing of a man by the Indian army late Friday or early Saturday. "We deeply and sincerely express our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family on this incident," said Lt. Col. J.S. Brar, a Srinagar-based defense spokesman. The Indian army issued a statement Saturday morning regretting the man's death, but maintaining that "the troops had adhered to standard operating procedure (SOP) in the incident." The Indian army said the man was shot after he walked into an ambush it laid after getting specific information about movement of militants in the area.
