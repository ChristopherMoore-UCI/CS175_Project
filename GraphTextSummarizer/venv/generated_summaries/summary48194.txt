The affected products include Arrowhead Mills Peanut Butters, MaraNatha Almond Butters and Peanut Butters and specific private label nut butters sold under the Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Kroger and Safeway brands. The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that nSpired Natural Foods Inc. is voluntarily recalling several lots of peanut, almond and other nut butters on fears of salmonella contamination. A 2012 recall because of Salmonella Bredeney in peanut butter produced by Sunland Inc. resulted in 42 cases of illness and the eventual closure of the company after filing for bankruptcy. Salmonella was the top cause of foodborne illness, according to the CDC's 2012 report card on food poisoning. The products were sold in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Dominican Republic and online.
