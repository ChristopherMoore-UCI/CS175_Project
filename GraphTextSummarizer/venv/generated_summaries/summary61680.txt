"Ministers remain committed to bring closure and some peace to the families and loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370," the three countries said in a joint statement. If the searchers haven't found anything by the time they've covered the entire 60,000-square-kilometer priority zone, the search will stretch into a new equally vast area, government officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced Thursday. The people on board the  Boeing 777 came from various nations, but the majority were Chinese. Flight 370 vanished after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing. The underwater search area for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 looks set to double in size.
