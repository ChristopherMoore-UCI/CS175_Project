"The government has decided to impose a moratorium on the placement of informal Indonesian migrant workers to Saudi Arabia effective August 1, 2011, until an Indonesian-Saudi memorandum of understanding on the protection of migrant workers is signed and a bilateral joint task force is established," the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration said on its website. "There is a huge reformation internally and the demand for Indonesian workers in Saudi Arabia is very high," Maktub said. Indonesia will impose a moratorium on sending workers to Saudi Arabia, effective August 1, the country said late Wednesday. On Tuesday, authorities scrambled to save another Indonesian migrant worker from execution in Saudi Arabia. Anger has been brewing in recent years over allegations of abuse of Indonesian workers by employers, particularly toward domestic helpers.
