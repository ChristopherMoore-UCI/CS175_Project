"To make up this difference we'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop," So, in an effort to grow typically Mediterranean foods like olives and peppers, for instance, van Bergen says he'll need little more than rows of "snake walls" and "climate pylons." For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production. "Anything that reduces food miles and other carbon emissions linked to food production is normally a positive thing," said Dr Nicola Canon, lecturer in crop sciences at the UK's Royal Agricultural College. However, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth. "The cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from Moroccan to Indonesian, from Turkish to Chinese -- and we're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes," said Jago van Bergen, an award-winning architect and one of the brains behind the "Park Supermarket" -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming World Architecture Awards in November.
