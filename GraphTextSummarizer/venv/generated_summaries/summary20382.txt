Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Lou Robinson ordered Osbon to be transferred to an unnamed medical facility for federal prisoners so he could undergo a psychiatric evaluation as part of the process to see whether he was sane during the incident and whether he is competent to stand trial. According to an FBI affidavit, a JetBlue copilot became concerned about Osbon's bizarre behavior early in their March 27 flight from New York to Las Vegas. When Osbon tried to enter his code into the cockpit door, the co-pilot announced over the public address system an order to restrain Osbon. The court document says that Osbon "did knowingly and willingly interfere and attempt to interfere with the performance of the duties of a flight crew member and flight attendant." There is reason to believe Osbon "may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent" to understand the case against him and assist in his defense, the U.S. attorney's office said in a Texas court filing last week.
