-- An extra time goal from Brazilian midfielder Jadson ensured Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk won the last ever UEFA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Bundesliga side Werder Bremen in Istanbul. The victory means Mircea Lucescu's side become the first team from Ukraine to lift a major European trophy and gives eastern Europe a third UEFA Cup in five years after recent successes for Russian sides CSKA Moscow and Zenit St Petersburg. Jadson's strike from 15 yards out lacked pace, but Werder goalkeeper Tim Wiese failed to save the shot and it slipped through his grasp to trickle over the line. However, Adriano made amends for his earlier miss in the 24th-minute when he seized on a through-ball that had wrong-footed the Bremen defence and lifting a superb chip over the onrushing Wiese. Moments after his goal, Luiz Adriano found himself on the corner of the box again but lashed the ball over the bar, and his compatriot Willian then broke purposefully into the box, only to produce a tame finish straight at Wiese.
