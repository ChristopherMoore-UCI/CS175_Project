Earlier, French military sources said the French ambassador's residence in Abidjan came under attack by forces loyal to Gbagbo, but a Gbagbo spokesman said that was "impossible" because U.N. forces are surrounding all the ambassadors' residences. -- Forces loyal to Ivory Coast's former leader, Laurent Gbagbo, used a lull in fighting this week as a "trick" to reinforce their positions around the main city of Abidjan, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations said Friday. U.N. forces also offered to relocate the 35 journalists who were at the Novotel hotel in Abidjan, he said. There appeared to be a standoff, however, outside Abidjan's Golf Hotel, where Gbagbo's rival and the internationally recognized president, Alassane Ouattara, is staying under U.N. protection, Rhodes reported. Though Gbagbo's men said Tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the months-long fighting in Ivory Coast, they soon restarted shelling both the U.N. headquarters and the civilian population, Alain Le Roy told reporters at the United Nations.
