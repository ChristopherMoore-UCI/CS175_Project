-- As attackers target reporters and governments shut down television stations, Latin America ranks among the most dangerous regions for journalists, according to an Amnesty International report released Friday Nearly 400 journalists were threatened or attacked in the Americas in 2010, and at least 13 were killed by unidentified assailants, the human rights organization said in its annual report. Mexico is one of the worst offenders, said Javier Zuniga, a special adviser on human rights at Amnesty International. In a visit to Argentina last week, a delegation from the Inter American Press Association accused the South American country's government of cracking down on press freedom. "We believe the referendum questions are aimed at stifling voices that oppose your administration," CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon wrote in a letter to Correa. Ecuador's government also drew criticism from the organization last week as voters across the country headed to the polls for a referendum on proposals that included the creation of a council to regulate media content.
