New anti-austerity government worries markets European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré told CNN on Monday that Greece  would still have to pay its debt. Tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of Greece's European Union bailout. In return, the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank demanded tax hikes, a freeze on state pensions, bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries. Syriza's pledges to try to get some of Greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate -- even if they potentially jeopardize Greece's place in the eurozone. The election of a new anti-austerity government in Greece is raising questions about how the debt-laden state will satisfy its creditors and citizens weary of cost-cutting measures.
