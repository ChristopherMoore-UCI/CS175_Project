For decades the authorities have refused to admit to the existence of mass political prison camps," said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International Asia Pacific Director. -- Public executions, death by starvation and torture are common in North Korean political prisoner camps, according to testimony given to human rights group Amnesty International. The report cites testimony from NGOs and refugees that claimed camps covered areas as large as 200 square miles and contained mass graves, barracks, worksites and other prison facilities. " The North Korean government -- which has denied the existence of mass political prison camps -- has not publicly commented on the report's findings. "As North Korea seems to be moving towards a new leader in Kim Jong-un and a period of political instability, the big worry is that the prison camps appear to be growing in size."
