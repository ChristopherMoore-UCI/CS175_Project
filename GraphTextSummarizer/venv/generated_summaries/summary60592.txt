I knew that not a single drop of San Joaquin water made it to the bridge, which should be the end of the river. I finished that journey -- which mostly involved kayaking, but also a fair bit of walking, since the San Joaquin runs dry for about 40 miles -- on Friday beneath the Golden Gate Bridge here in San Francisco. Highways sound like rivers. We don't know rivers. I'd like to ask you to turn your gaze toward rivers, too.
