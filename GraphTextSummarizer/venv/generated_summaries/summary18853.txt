Albuquerque police have 'pattern' of excessive, deadly force, report says Former NYPD charged with hate crimes in anti-Semitic vandalism A tanning salon manager has filed a federal lawsuit against Chicago police, saying officers brutalized her and committed a hate crime during a raid at the business, then tried to cover up their alleged wrongdoings. Later, police went to a prosecutor, and a case was presented to a grand jury, with Klyzek being indicted for aggravated battery of a police officer, the lawsuit said. Klyzek said police falsified information in investigation reports and charged her with a crime, though the exact charge is not described in the lawsuit. The incident is being investigated by Chicago's Independent Police Review Authority, Chicago police public information officer Adam Collins said.
