Bakhit will serve as defense minister as well as prime minister in the new government, while Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh and Finance Minister Mohammad Abu Hammour kept their portfolios in the shakeup. While the king gave new prime minister Marouf al Bakhit orders to implement "genuine political reform," Bakhit's appointment was seen as an attempt to shore up support among Jordan's Bedouin tribes -- the bedrock of the monarchy. A journalist, Tareq Masarweh, joined the Cabinet as culture minister, while Taher Odwan, the editor of the Jordanian daily newspaper Arab Al Yawm, will take the post of communications minister. Bakhit is a former national security official who served a previous stint as prime minister, ending in 2007. His Cabinet includes members of several Jordanian political parties, opposition groups, the editor of a newspaper that is sometimes critical of the government and one person considered an independent Islamist.
