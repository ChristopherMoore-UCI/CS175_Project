"After years of these campaigns, we found out through survey that condom use is constantly increasing, especially in urban areas, the condom use can reach 70 percent or even up to 80 percent," said Hao Yang, Deputy Bureau Chief of the Chinese Health Ministry's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau. But the Chinese government is now conducting educational campaigns to inform higher risk groups, including sex workers, about how to prevent the transmission of HIV. "I think sex work is probably one of the most important factors for the potential of HIV spreading in Asia and also in China. "Society and communities have been able to curb the spread of HIV, also in sex work, and that is what we have to do," Schwartlander said. When HIV initially began to spread in China, infections were concentrated among people who injected drugs, Schwartlander said.
