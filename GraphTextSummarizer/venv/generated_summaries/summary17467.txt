Slithering into confined spaces, tackling tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans, the Snake-arm robot can "reach the unreachable" say its UK inventors, OC Robotics. Earlier this year the company demonstrated a 2.5 meter snake-arm fitted with swabbing, scooping and radiological probe tools to Sellafield, the UK's primary nuclear decommissioning company. The arms themselves are delivery mechanisms, Buckingham says, for a range of tools which can be fitted to the tip. Doctors and patients may also be beneficiaries in the future too as OC Robotics works on a snake-arm which could one day perform natural orifice surgery. Managing director Rob Buckingham and technical director Andrew Graham developed their first prototype in 2001 from their base in Bristol, England, and they've been perfecting the technology ever since.
