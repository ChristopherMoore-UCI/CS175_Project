By the early morning hours of Friday, Drake turned to his website to give more clarity on his rage against Rolling Stone, and to apologize to the Hoffman family and those who were offended by his comments. "I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The rapper has been picked apart online after he tweeted his feelings about his profile in Rolling Stone magazine. The magazine's cover features the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who was found dead at age 46 on February 2 from an apparent drug overdose. According to Drake's tweeted comments -- some of which he later deleted -- not only was he supposed to have the Rolling Stone cover, but the publication printed a quote that he called incorrect.
