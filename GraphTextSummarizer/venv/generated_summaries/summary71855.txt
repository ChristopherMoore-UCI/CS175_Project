While many older people suffer bodily deterioration, Singh said tests done when he was 94 showed his left leg had the bone density of a 35-year-old and his right leg that of a 25-year-old. "The first part of the run is when I am quite cheerful; my heart is singing a song and dancing seeing the different colors of life," Singh said. " Singh's fastest time is the five hours and 40 minutes he took to run the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon at the age of 92. " With his distinctive flowing grey beard and the traditional Sikh headgear that has earned him the nickname "the Turbaned Tornado," Singh has been a star entrant at marathons all over the world. As well as soothing his soul, running has also brought Singh unexpected fame -- he appeared in an Adidas advertising campaign along with soccer superstar David Beckham and boxing legend Muhammad Ali in 2004.
