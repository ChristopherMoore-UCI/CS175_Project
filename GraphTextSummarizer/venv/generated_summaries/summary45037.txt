Since losing my dad, I have become not only a two-time IronKids triathlon national champion but also an ambassador to the sport of triathlon. I feel my dad was meant to die so that Team Winter could be born and I could help change the face of prostate cancer awareness. I have helped raise close to $400,000 to fund prostate cancer research and have athletes around the world racing for my cause. While speaking at a 2009 Prostate Cancer Foundation event, I made a promise to more than 100 of the best prostate cancer researchers of the world: "I will make certain that, in my lifetime, I will get a blue ribbon out there to match every pink ribbon!" My dad's diagnosis of a rare, aggressive form of prostate cancer made me quickly realize how little awareness there was for his disease.
