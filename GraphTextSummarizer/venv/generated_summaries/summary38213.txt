The family of slain American hostage Steven Sotloff believes ISIS paid as much as $50,000 to rebels who alerted the militant group that the journalist had entered Syria, a spokesman told CNN. Up to $10 million reward A group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill Monday that would authorize up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in the Foley and Sotloff abductions and beheadings. But Barfi also criticized the release of information about an unsuccessful U.S. commando raid this summer that attempted to free Foley, Sotloff and others. "James Foley and Steven Sotloff nobly risked their lives in the pursuit of truth, and the United States will not stand idly by after two of its own were brutally murdered at the hands of fundamentally evil and freedom-hating extremists," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said in a statement. Sotloff appeared in the earlier decapitation video of James Foley, another American journalist who was beheaded by an ISIS militant.
