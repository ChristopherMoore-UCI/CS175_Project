South Africa last month launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front. -- South African icon Nelson Mandela was in good spirits on Christmas, even though he was in the hospital "He was happy to have visitors on this special day and is looking much better," said Zuma, who visited Mandela in a Pretoria hospital Tuesday. Mandela, the former South African president, has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted in his country. He was hospitalized for a lung infection on December 8; and on December 15, he had successful endoscopic surgery to have gallstones removed.
