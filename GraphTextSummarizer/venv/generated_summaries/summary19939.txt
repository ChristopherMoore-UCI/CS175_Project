That formula for carrying out terrorist attacks requires sophisticated intelligence efforts by international police services to uncover and is espoused by al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri, the ministry said. He is alleged to have planned "to commit terrorist actions against relevant personalities or other objectives in agreement with the doctrine of global jihad, as much in Spain as in other European countries. Echaabi is considered by police to have a profile similar to that of Mohammed Merah, the self-styled al Qaeda jihadist who authorities said killed seven people in Toulouse, France, in March 2012. The Moroccan suspect, Mohamed Echaabi, is considered a "lone wolf" who was planning targeted killings and other attacks in Spain and elsewhere in Europe, the ministry said. "Echaabi underwent a process of radicalization in which he acquired firm, extreme convictions that led him to leave Spain and travel to Gaza in 2011 with the goal of carrying out an action of suicidal character against Israeli interests," it said.
