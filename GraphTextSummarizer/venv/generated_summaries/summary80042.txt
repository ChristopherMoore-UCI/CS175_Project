In an attempt to raise awareness of disaster preparedness, the American College of Emergency Physicians has teamed up with casual games publisher and developer Legacy Interactive to create "Disaster Hero. In the game, players will take on the role of the titular Disaster Hero as he visits different families, helping them prepare for various disasters including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes. "This project to develop an educational program for children using a game platform will be a unique approach to teaching kids to have an active role in home disaster planning," ACEP President Dr. Angela Gardner said. "ACEP is pleased to partner with many other stakeholders representing teachers, schools, daycare centers and youth organizations in the development of this program. The game itself will consist of a mish-mash of genres, covering everything from time management and puzzles to quizzes and hidden object scenes.
