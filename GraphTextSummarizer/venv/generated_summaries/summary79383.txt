The Republican-led House might be a major obstacle to ENDA's success; House Speaker John Boehner has already announced his opposition. Collins said Monday that she hopes to get enough votes to spur the House to act. An exemption for religious organizations is included in the bill, but some want the religious protection extended to secular businesses, which ENDA proponents say would gut the entire bill. Instead of letting the far right trample him again, it's time for Speaker Boehner to stand with the majority of everyday Republican voters and support ENDA," Griffin said. Heads of major businesses have come out in support of the law, including Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, who wrote an op-ed Monday in the Wall Street Journal.
