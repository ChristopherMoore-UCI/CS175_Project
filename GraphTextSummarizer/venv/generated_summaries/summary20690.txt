In one study, people who were instructed to think about money before entering a cafe spent less time chatting with the other patrons and more time working. That's right: The number of hours we work has not changed much, but we spend less time now on home tasks, so we have a greater amount of time for leisure than in decades past. And lest you think that decreasing your time stress is a waste of, well, time, research shows that feelings of time affluence are a crucial contributor to our happiness. Our general feeling of time scarcity isn't just caused by shortening days. And as time becomes worth more money, we feel like we have less of it.
