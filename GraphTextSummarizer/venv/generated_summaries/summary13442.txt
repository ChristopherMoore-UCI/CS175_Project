But such policies could frustrate French Muslims, said Amer Sahar, a professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who studies Muslims in France. The now forbidden garments are not popular among the North African Muslims who make up much of France's Islamic population. Amnesty International had repeatedly urged France not to impose the ban, saying it violates European human rights law. As its Muslim population has risen over the past decade France has gone to great lengths to ensure accommodations for Muslims. "France is not a bad place for Muslims to live," he said, predicting that controversy over the law would pass if France continued its commitment to supporting the needs of Muslims to worship freely in the country.
