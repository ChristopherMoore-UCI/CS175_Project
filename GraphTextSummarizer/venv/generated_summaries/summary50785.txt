-- Four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal formally announced his retirement from basketball Friday, thanking fans and teammates for their support and saying he looks forward to earning his Ph.D. With 28,596 points, O'Neal is fifth on the all-time NBA scoring list and is second only to Michael Jordan on the all-time list of NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards. He told reporters he did not want the Celtics to have to wait to see whether he fully rebounded from surgery. O'Neal is completing his doctorate in human resource development at Barry University in Miami. O'Neal took the NBA scoring title in 1995 as he led the Magic to the NBA finals, but they were beaten by Houston.
