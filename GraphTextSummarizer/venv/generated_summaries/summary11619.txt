Both men starred in a recent Foot Locker commercial in which Tyson "returned" the ear, but he told Nichols that he is sincerely sorry. "It's a big joke now," Tyson told Rachel Nichols of the infamous 1997 boxing match in which he bit off a portion of Evander Holyfield's ear. Mike Tyson has been the fiercest fighter of his generation, done jail time, and even starred in a one-man show on Broadway. Nichols asked Tyson about the turning point in his career that was his cameo in the 2009 smash comedy film "The Hangover." "For a lot of people 'The Hangover' movie was a real turning point," said Nichols. Following what he described as a rough upbringing in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Tyson told Nichols he had been arrested more than 40 times by the time he was 12.
