Loud commercials have been a leading source of complaints to the FCC since its consumer call center began reporting top complaints in 2002. The FCC says it has granted two temporary waivers to the law: one to South Georgia Governmental Services Authority, a municipal cable system, because of financial hardship; and to WPFO in Waterville, Maine, which asked for a grant because it is relocating its facilities. Until now, the FCC says it didn't regulate the "loudness" of commercials mainly because it was difficult to craft rules. -- Say goodbye to one of the greatest irritants of modern life: television commercials that are MUCH LOUDER THAN THE SHOW YOU ARE WATCHING! The FCC will not monitor compliance, but instead will rely on consumer complaints to assist the commission to enforce the rule.
