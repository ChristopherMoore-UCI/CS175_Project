-- Victims of former Canadian junior hockey coach Graham James expressed anger Tuesday as he was sentenced to two years in prison for sexually abusing now-retired National Hockey League star Theo Fleury and another player, his cousin Todd Holt, when they were teenagers. "To sit in there and hear that Graham James was rehabilitated really drives me nuts and I think that was probably the most disturbing part of it all," said former NHL player Sheldon Kennedy who was also sexually abused by James. In evidence, the court heard that James lured players with money, gifts and trips to Disneyland, where he took advantage of them. Judge Catherine Carlson â€ªsaid she realized James' victims were multiple and that his behavior was predatory and orchestrated to make victims dependent on him. "He conned the judge with his 'poor me' and 'I regret' statements," he said, "and Graham James is laughing all the way back to the life he's always lived, knowing that justice for him is but a blip on the radar screen.
