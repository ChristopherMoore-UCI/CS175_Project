-- American teacher Ronnie Smith has been shot and killed in Benghazi, according to the Facebook page of the international school in Libya where he worked. Reports: People still missing after Libya weapons depot blast kills 20 U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones tweeted: "Libya's enemies will not succeed in driving away her friends" and "My heart goes out to the family of the American school teacher murdered today in Benghazi. Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city, is where militants attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission in September 2012, killing four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. I think every foreign teacher should leave until Libya is safe." Smith exemplified "respect, optimism, cooperation, team work," posted Noor Hewaidi. The United States blames one of the armed groups, Islamist militant group Ansar al-Sharia, for the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi.
