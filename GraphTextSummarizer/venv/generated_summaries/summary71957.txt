To run their campaigns, Democrats need many millions of dollars from Wall Street and corporate interests that would oppose policies that significantly reduce inequality. The existing campaign finance and lobbying system, which has greatly empowered corporate interests and wealthier Americans, makes it hard to actually fight for policies that reduce inequality. Oliver joked that income inequality had better watch out, since it was going to be "violently ameliorated" -- or, he explains, it would have been if Democrats had not "immediately backed down." No matter how many times Democrats bring up the issue, they just can't seem to commit to a fight on income inequality. If they don't change their ways, the Democratic fight on income inequality will remain a punch line on comedy shows and a rallying cry for Republicans who want to paint Democrats as too far left of center.
