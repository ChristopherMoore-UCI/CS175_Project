-- An Internet video from what its posters said was one of the anti-government demonstrations last weekend in Iran shows police vehicles driving into crowds of protesters and running over at least one. In the video -- shot Sunday, according to the posting on the Web site YouTube -- green-and-white police trucks rush into crowds of protesters in the capital, Tehran. Iranian security forces reportedly have been holding the bodies of protesters killed during the clashes. That video shows protesters transferring her body from a clinic near where she was reportedly killed to another hospital to keep her remains out of reach of security forces. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday the demonstrations were staged by "the Zionists and the Americans," according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.
