CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers said there was another threat from the volatile mix of hurricanes and oil: storm surge. " Oil in the Gulf coast isn't the only worry for hurricane forecasters this year: But other scientists say the storms could be stronger than usual because the black oil would heat the water faster and accelerate formation of hurricanes, which rely on warm waters for their development, Evans said. Scientists on Thursday said as much as 19,000 barrels of oil have been spewing every day from the BP well in the Gulf, making it the largest oil spill in U.S. history. "The problem is that this is a man-made experiment we wish we hadn't made," said Jenni Evans, a professor of meteorology at Penn State University.
