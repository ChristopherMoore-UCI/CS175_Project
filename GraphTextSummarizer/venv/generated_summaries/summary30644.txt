The pledges are for fiscal year 2010-2011, so the donors have until the middle of next year to get the funds to the Haiti recovery commission, Sedky said. Still, many governments and aid agencies have given money to Haiti through means other than the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. Last year, Haiti's growth reached almost 3 percent, the second-fastest rate in the Western Hemisphere. In March, the international community pledged $9.9 billion to Haiti's reconstruction, of which $5.3 billion is to be disbursed over the coming 18 months. Altogether, about $506 million had been disbursed to Haiti since the donors' conference in March, said Jehane Sedky of the U.N. Development Program.
