His phone was beeping nonstop for three days, with a stream of frenzied text messages and Instagram posts. It wasn't so secret about a week ago when I discovered his public profile on Instagram, where he was posting dramatic photos and soulful "Versagrams" (graphical text messages), for all the world to see. Yet, his Instagram avatar was boldly flirting with a girl, prolifically posting inside jokes about his crush and inviting commentary not only from his school friends, but also from a far-flung social network of kids from Connecticut to New Jersey who I am certain he's never met in person. The photos and messages that his fellow tween friends post on Instagram alternate between silly and provocative. Was my looking at text messages the same as reading a diary?
