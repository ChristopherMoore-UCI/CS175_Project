Whether Barroso is right, or as some former EU officials have declared, wrong, the roadmap for Scotland's independent state after a potential "yes" vote is so convoluted that some of the country's biggest businesses have already begun to draw up contingency plans. And for those pro-independence Scots who thought adopting the euro could be a solution, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso appears to have scotched those plans as well, asserting Scotland would have to go through the whole rigmarole of EU accession first and may find its path blocked by existing member states, fearful of their own separatist movements like Spain. After years of alleged shoddy stewardship of Scotland's oil and gas reserves by Britain's central government, pro-independence campaigners reckon the country would be more effective at managing its own resources, keeping profits in a windfall fund that could be used to top up the budget where necessary. Britain's chancellor recently ruled out allowing an independent Scotland into a shared monetary union. And an independent Scotland could affect the UK's entire defense strategy, opening up an unpredictable flank at its northern extremity in the very place where Britain currently houses its nuclear deterrent.
