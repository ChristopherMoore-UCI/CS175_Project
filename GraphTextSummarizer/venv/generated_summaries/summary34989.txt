-- Thanksgiving is a week away, but it's hard to focus on the annual feast with all the ads for Black Friday sales and the Christmas decorations that have popped up everywhere in the past few weeks. The department store is continuing its tradition of closing on Thanksgiving Day, even as retail giants like Macy's, Walmart and Toys R Us plan to open that evening and Kmart's doors will open at 6 on Thanksgiving morning. Others pointed out that some Nordstrom employees would still have to work on Thanksgiving to decorate the store and get ready for the Black Friday sales. You also won't see any Christmas decorations or hear any carols in Nordstrom stores until after Thanksgiving. Should stores close on Thanksgiving or do you like getting a head start on your shopping?
