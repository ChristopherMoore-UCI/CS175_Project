The news feed is the first, and sometimes only, page people see when they log on to the Facebook website or fire up a Facebook mobile app. "It's going to continue to erode the value of companies having Facebook pages and fans," said Forrester analyst Nate Elliott. " Ads will still be featured on the friends-only feeds, so companies and brands that want to reach people who switch to those views can by buying advertising from Facebook. The main page, which Facebook is calling the "front page" to go with its newspaper metaphor, is adding categories so people can look at a more narrow feed of specific types of content as an alternative to the all-in-one view. Those fans can switch to a more narrow feed of just their friends (or music content or photos) that doesn't include brand pages, potentially making it more difficult for companies to reach their followers.
