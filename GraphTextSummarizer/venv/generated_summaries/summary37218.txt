From a setback to an 'Athenaship' A firefighter in San Diego and a 10-time Ironman, Benincasa's own life is all about adventure. "Being an Athena, you're not just a survivor, you're an adventurer," Benincasa said. The organization helps women who have survived medical setbacks achieve an athletic goal, whether it is participating in a triathlon or scaling the Great Wall of China. "We give them a different label to put on themselves, and it's something they become on their way to the finish line." Women can apply for a grant to do any event they wish, or they can participate in one organized by Project Athena. "It's not about trying to get back what you were, it's about trying to be the best of what you're capable of today, this minute." Morgan, now 23, credits Project Athena with helping her get her life back.
