-- A former Peace Corps volunteer from Connecticut is charged with sexual abuse of several preschool children in South Africa last year. "Mr. Osmun is charged with a shocking breach of the power entrusted to him as a Peace Corps volunteer," said Assistant U.S.  Attorney General Lanny Breuer. The Peace Corps issued a statement saying it "was made aware of the allegations against the former volunteer after Osmun resigned from Peace Corps and departed South Africa. Jesse Osmun, 31, worked at an AIDS center in Greytown, South Africa, that provided education, food and other services to children between the ages of 3 and 15, a criminal complaint says. Osmun would face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted of the charge of traveling outside of the United States to engage in sexual conduct with a minor.
