James is at a treatment facility "to deal with personal issues" in a bid to save his marriage to Bullock, a spokeswoman for James said Wednesday. The video shows James confronting Rios, who is sitting in a vehicle park across the street from West Coast Choppers, a business owned by James, Haushalter said. James, a motorcycle designer and reality TV star, has been the target of controversy and publicity since his separation with actress Sandra Bullock soon after she won a best actress Oscar earlier this month. Celebrity photographer Ulises Rios also was cited for stalking James, Long Beach Police Sgt. Detectives with the city's violent crimes section met with the lawyer for Rios Thursday morning to obtain a copy of the video, attorney Mark Haushalter said.
