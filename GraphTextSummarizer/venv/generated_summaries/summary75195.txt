-- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to defuse tensions between China and Japan, a strategic U.S. partner, on Saturday, asking the two rival nations to return to negotiations over a group of Pacific islands under dispute.

"We have certainly encouraged both Japan and China to seek peaceful resolution of any disagreements that they have in this area or others.
