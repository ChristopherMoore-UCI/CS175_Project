In January 2012, the Global Partnership for Women and Girls was formed to promote the educational and economic advancement of Muslim women and girls. "This training effort is an important step in dispelling the myths of human rights in Islam and combating domestic violence." The philanthropy supports Muslim women and girls and their communities by investing in strategic and innovative nongovernmental organizations. "These imams then have to work with other imams and preach the issue of women rights during the Jumma Khutbas (Friday sermons) to the public attending the prayers, so by this way we could reach thousands of people both male and female," Afghani wrote in an e-mail. Director Jamila Afghani says the program is its own kind of revolution because religious leaders once known for oppressing women now use the words of the Quran to promote fairness for them.
