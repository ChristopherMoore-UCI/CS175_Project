For all the praise he's received, Bryan Cranston has come up empty for best actor the last two years, losing to Jeff Daniels ("The Newsroom") last year and Damian Lewis ("Homeland") in 2012. Even if "Breaking Bad" wins best drama, "Detective" might take other major categories. Though "Bad" still has a decided edge for best drama series -- the handicappers at Goldderby.com, for example, are unanimous in their support of the Bryan Cranston-led show -- the onrush of McConaughey love earlier this year, when the actor was hailed for his performances in "Mud," "The Wolf of Wall Street" and an Oscar-winning turn in "Dallas Buyers Club," may turn the tide in favor of "Detective." The 66th Primetime Emmy Awards will be handed out Monday night, and what was expected to be a coronation honoring the final season of AMC's "Breaking Bad" has emerged as something a little more competitive, thanks to HBO's "True Detective," the moody crime series starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. But last year "The Voice" took home the trophy, and the battle isn't getting any easier.
