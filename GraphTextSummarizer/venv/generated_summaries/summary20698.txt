Over the next two years, I would travel the country, taking B.I.G. to radio stations, lunches and promotional shows, introducing him to new audiences. At the time, hip-hop was not getting played on mainstream radio -- my job was to get B.I.G. there. While there, you can still feel the presence of B.I.G.'s lyrics: "...spread love, it's the Brooklyn way. It's vital to point out that B.I.G. ascended from Brooklyn, and every experience in his life contributed to his outputs. Following B.I.G.'s death at 24 on March 9, 1997, the man who proclaimed he was "Ready to Die" was mourned in Brooklyn as a funeral procession made its way through the streets of his youth.
