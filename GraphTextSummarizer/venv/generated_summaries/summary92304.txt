The "Africa Mercy," currently docked off the coast of  Benin, West Africa, also operates as a floating hospital with medical facilities including six state-of-the-art operating theaters, an ophthalmic unit, two CT scanners and 78 hospital beds onboard. Like any of the 450 volunteer crew members currently aboard the Africa Mercy, Herbert can be called on at any time of the day to give blood, as the ship has no facilities for storing blood products. The charity behind "Africa Mercy" was founded by Texas-based Don Stephens and his wife Deyon. "This young woman required a below-the-knee amputation, but was very weak so I was called in to give her blood as our blood groups matched," she told CNN. "This allows almost all our resources to go into state-of-the-art medical facilities," Smith told CNN.
