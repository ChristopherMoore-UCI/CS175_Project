The controversy marked the second major officiating mistake of the day at the World Cup after England midfielder Frank Lampard was denied a goal against Germany, even though his shot struck the bar and bounced some two feet over the line. Argentina doubled its lead when Gonzalo Higuain rounded goalkeeper Oscar Perez to score his fourth goal of the tournament. Manager Diego Maradona's men almost scored a fourth goal when Perez had to dive to his right in stoppage-time to tip Messi's shot over the bar. The Manchester City striker opened the scoring after 25 minutes in controversial fashion when television replays, which were relayed on the giant screens in the stadium, showed he was offside when he received the ball from Lionel Messi and headed into the net. -- Carlos Tevez scored twice as Argentina beat Mexico 3-1 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to set up a meeting with Germany in the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
