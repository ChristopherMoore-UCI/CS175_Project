The army says it has taken control to ensure law and order in a country split by deep political divisions, two weeks after the country's Constitutional Court removed caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from government. Niwatthamrong later issued a statement on the imposition of martial law: "With reference to the Royal Thai Army's declaration of the martial law to preserve order and bring back peacefulness to the country, the government wishes the same for national peace, and hopes that the martial law is imposed by way of peaceful means and equality with no violence and discrimination and under the legal state and the rule of law which is in accordance with the government's ongoing policy," he said. What does martial law look like in Thailand? Andrew Marshall, a journalist and author who focuses on Thailand, told CNN the military's decision to announce martial law at night indicated it was trying to do so "with minimal possible fuss." Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor, said the declaration of martial law in Thailand had broken the deadlock between warring parties, and the army was now in a position to mediate a possible resolution.
