Announcing the award, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said "multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play." Editor's note: Kiron K. Skinner is an associate professor of international relations at Carnegie Mellon University, directs the university's International Relations and Politics Program, and is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Furthermore, many international institutions are dependent upon the United States for their survival. The G-20 leaders also agreed to increase the voting power of developing countries in the World Bank by at least 3 percent and to shift the quota share in the International Monetary Fund from developed countries to countries in economic transition by at least 5 percent. The Committee thus joins a chorus of international forums that contend that multilateralism is the hallmark of the international system.
