Women with little income don't have these luxuries, which is where Planned Parenthood health centers come in. When Komen announced it was cutting Planned Parenthood funds, it failed to mention that it recently named Karen Handel senior vice-president for policy. This week a major financial supporter of breast cancer education and services, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, announced it was ending its funding to Planned Parenthood. Over the years, one Planned Parenthood clinic after another has been able to offer these women not only affordable contraception, but full exams that include screening for breast cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer of women. While mammograms and biopsies are referred out to other doctors at low or no costs, Planned Parenthood physicians oversee the cases.
