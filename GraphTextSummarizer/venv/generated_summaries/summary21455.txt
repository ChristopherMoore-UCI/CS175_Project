ET] Authorities in Piermont, New York, believe that they have recovered the body of Mark Lennon, the second victim of a boating accident involving a wedding party on the Hudson River, Sheriff Louis Falco told reporters Sunday. The search for Lennon, which proved fruitless Saturday, was to resume Sunday morning, but officials held out little hope he would be found alive. "We're always hopeful, but obviously, at this hour, it's less and less likely that this would be a rescue as opposed to a recovery," Van Cura told reporters. "We have probable cause to believe that he operated the boat while intoxicated," Van Cura said. John was arraigned at an area hospital on one count of first-degree vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault, Van Cura said.
