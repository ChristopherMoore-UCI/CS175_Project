His brother Joe, 24, called it a "unanimous decision." Jonas Brothers cancel tour amid 'deep rift' "It's over for now," Kevin Jonas, 25, told People magazine, which first reported the news. The three decided to go their separate ways after Nick Jonas, 21, spoke up during an October 3 meeting, according to the magazine. Joe has gone in a more adult direction with his music career, and both he and his brother Nick have released solo albums and expanded into acting. On October 17, their official Twitter account was deactivated, and Joe Jonas asked fans via his personal account on October 22 to "please hold while we get our s*** together."
