Watch video: Slave descendants uphold African roots What seems to be more certain is that Gullah/Geechee people have preserved the cultural heritage of their ancestors more than any other black Americans in the United States. They gather sweet grass to practice the ancient African art of basket making; they pay homage to their West African traditions by keeping alive the ring shout music folk tradition; they make a living by fishing shrimps and harvesting oysters, using handmade nets and casting them the way their ancestors did centuries ago. "We have the highest retention of African tradition in America," says Towne. The Gullah/Geechee people are direct descendants of West African slaves brought into the United States around the 1700s. "It is English modified under the influence of African languages," he says.
