For once, four-time winners Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic are not center stage, and tennis hunk Rafael Nadal has been muscled out in Melbourne. Kyrgios became the first wild card in a decade to reach the quarterfinals of the grass court grand slam, firing a career high 37 aces past the two-time Wimbledon champion and bamboozling him with an array of trick shots. A meteoric 2014 season then saw the Canberra big-hitter rise from world No.186 to Nadal's vanquisher at Wimbledon. The face of the fortnight belongs to homegrown hope Nick Kyrgios -- the highest ranked Australian on the men's tour. Those injuries might be another reason for Kyrgios' reluctance to get caught up in the hype ahead of the Australian Open, which began in Melbourne, Monday.
