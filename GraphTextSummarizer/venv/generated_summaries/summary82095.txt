The computer models used in weather forecasting do not actually predict snow. If temperatures are low enough to allow precipitation to fall as snow, then the forecasters need some way to convert the QPF to an equivalent snowfall. Forecasters often have to resort to methods they learned at college, involving dew points, temperature soundings from meteorological balloon ascents and real-time reports from weather stations to assess the impact of a snow storm. The liquid water to snow ratio can vary depending on whether the snow is "wet" or "dry." Under these circumstances, the rain to snow ratio can be considerably higher, with values of 1 to 20 not uncommon.
