Pappas and I were in the airport, drinking beer with our friends, when two Carabinieri in SWAT fatigues called our names and escorted Signore Pappas and Signore Leonard out of the airport terminal, through a gate to the tarmac and up the stairway that led to our plane. The exercise yard, with its concrete floor and chain-link walls, looked like it had been lifted from the projects in Detroit. I was handcuffed and taken to Carabinieri headquarters. -- I was in a year-abroad program in 1973, one of 240 American students attending Loyola University Rome Center. My father, Elmore Leonard, was waiting at the gate when I got off the plane in Detroit.
