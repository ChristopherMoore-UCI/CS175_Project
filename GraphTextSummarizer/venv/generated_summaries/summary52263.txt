-- Lionel Messia, Andres Iniesta and Cristiano Ronaldo have been shortlisted by UEFA for the 2011/12 best player in Europe award. Last season, Ronaldo led his Real Madrid side to their first La Liga title since 2008, beating Messi and Iniesta's Barcelona side into second. Lionel Messi won Uefa's inaugural best player in Europe award in 2011. Messi's 50 goal haul was the highest ever total, while Ronaldo narrowly missed out on becoming the first person to win the Golden Shoe award three times, finishing second with 46 goals. Andres Iniesta was recently crowned player of the tournament at Euro 2012, as Spain became the first side to defend the European Championship crown.
