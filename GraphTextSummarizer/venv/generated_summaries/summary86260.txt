More than 100 journalists -- as well as some of the club's players -- assembled at the Clermont stadium to meet the Portuguese who is hoping her appointment will inspire other female coaches. The football season has just finished in France and Clermont Foot finished 14th in Ligue 2 but Costa already has big plans for her first season in charge. "I know it's a big step," said Costa, who left her role as coach of the Iranian national women's team to accept the position with Clermont. "At first in France everybody thought that Clermont just wanted to create a buzz with the appointment. " Costa will find herself under extra external scrutiny too as the highest profile female coach of a male professional football team in Europe.
