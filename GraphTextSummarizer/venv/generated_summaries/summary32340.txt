" Tsonga will now face unheralded wildcard Jamie Ward in the semifinals after the British number two, ranked 216th in the world, reached his first-ever ATP Tour semfinal with a 6-2 6-7 6-2 win over Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. The extra day's rest could well prove crucial prior to Saturday's clash with third seed Roddick, who remains on course for a record fifth title on the London grass after crusing to a straight sets victory over seventh-seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco. He will now face third seed Gael Monfils, after the Frenchman beat Florian Mayer 6-4 6-4. Another German, Philipp Petzschner, also secured his place with a 6-3 6-7 6-3 victory over eighth seed Milos Raonic. Wimbledon champion Nadal, who flew straight to the grasscourt event on the back of winning a record-equalling sixth French Open title,  struggled for form throughout the week and was eventually sent tumbling 6-7 6-4 6-1 by fifth-seeded Tsonga.
