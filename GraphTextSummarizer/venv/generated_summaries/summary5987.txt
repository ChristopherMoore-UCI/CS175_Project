-- A day after Pedro Hernandez was charged in the killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz, prosecutors now face the task of corroborating his confession and piecing together a mystery that's confounded investigators for more than three decades. "He confessed that he killed a little boy," Norma Hernandez told the Times, saying that the suspect had moved to southern New Jersey shortly after Etan disappeared. At a recent news conference announcing Hernandez' arrest, Kelly said Hernandez had no prior contact with the boy, and that investigators have not uncovered any forensic evidence linking Hernandez to the disappearance of the Etan, whose body still has not been found. Former SoHo resident Roberto Monticello, who says he knew Hernandez at the time of Etan's disappearance, called the former stock clerk a "very strange guy." Missing child case 'awakened America' Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against Jose Antonio Ramos, a drifter and convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter.
