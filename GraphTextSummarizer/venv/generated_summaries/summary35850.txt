Lane said the Louisiana parish, along the Gulf Coast southeast of New Orleans, began flushing water lines with chlorine last week, a process that will continue for weeks until chlorine levels reach recommended levels. There is no danger of infection from drinking or cooking with contaminated water, the CDC said. Naegleria fowleri associated with disinfected public drinking water has caused deaths in only one other case in the United States, according to the CDC. Avoid swimming in fresh water when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm fresh water, most often in the Southeastern United States.
