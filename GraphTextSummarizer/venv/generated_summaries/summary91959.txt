Employers sometimes cite PTSD as a reason for not hiring veterans, because of public misunderstanding, former President George W. Bush said in February at the George W. Bush Library Military Service Initiative. Exposure therapy often helps the person with PTSD revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them, said Dr. Albert "Skip" Rizzo, a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating PTSD. A big challenge in helping veterans with PTSD is the amount of time that passes before a diagnosis, which can be three to four months, said Terry Lyles, a stress coach in Miami who has worked with PTSD patients and is a civilian contractor with the Department of Defense. The nonprofit think-tank RAND Corporation estimates a third of veterans likely have some type of traumatic brain injury, PTSD or depression, which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000. Most studies examining the rate of PTSD in service members put the rates at about 15% to 20%.
