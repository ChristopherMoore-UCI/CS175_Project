As more details emerge, assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill said authorities had previous contact with the two shooters in February, April and May --  all without incident. But McMahill told reporters Wednesday that a review of forensic evidence and autopsy results showed that police fatally wounded the gunman. At the time, officers interviewed the Millers as witnesses in a domestic violence case, McMahill said. On May 31, the Millers again provided statements to police officers about an alleged sexual assault of a neighbor. In that case, their meetings were without incident as well. "Because an individual may online espouse ideology that is anti-government or anti-police does not make them translate into a murderer," McMahill said.
