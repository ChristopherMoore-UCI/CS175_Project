The couple shares their success and strategy for weight loss by leading online classes for Weigh Down. Before getting married, a friend introduced Maggie to The Weigh Down Workshop, a faith-based weight loss program, which teaches people to conquer their addiction to food, as well as other substances and vices, by turning to God. "At the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003, I called Weigh Down and started taking the classes," says Maggie. Maggie's weight loss was more gradual. Maggie, on the other hand, tried to conceal her misery by making other people laugh.
