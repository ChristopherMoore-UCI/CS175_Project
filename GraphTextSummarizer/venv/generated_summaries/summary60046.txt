Chen will continue to make films in China and finds the country's recent transformation as significant as earlier periods of change during his lifetime. Like "Farewell My Concubine," Chen's latest film, "Forever Enthralled" ("Mei Lanfang" in Mandarin), once again delves into the world of Beijing opera, and it has proven to be a hit in China since its release in cinemas in December. Quite honestly, I wasn't very comfortable to do films that way," said Chen. Now 56 years old, Chen studied at the Beijing Film Academy, directing his first feature film "Yellow Earth" in 1984. Time will tell if today's China will be part of Chen's cinematic sweep in the future.
