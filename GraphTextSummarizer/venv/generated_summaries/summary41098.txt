In a brutal attack recorded on closed-circuit TV and by bystanders, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale hit soldier Lee Rigby with a car then hacked him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in May 2013. The judge also cited details of Adebolajo's police interview and witness testimony, including that he loved al Qaeda and that he had tried to cut off Rigby's head because it was the proper method under Allah. Summing up the case before the jury deliberated, Judge Nigel Sweeney reminded jurors of what happened in the 13 minutes between Rigby's body being dragged into the middle of a road near the Woolwich barracks and the arrival of police. The Islamic converts, through testimony or their lawyers' arguments in court, indicated they killed Rigby for Allah. -- Two men convicted of killing a British soldier on a London street last year were sentenced Wednesday, one to life in prison and the other to a minimum of 45 years.
