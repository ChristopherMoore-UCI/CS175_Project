"It Ain't Me, Babe" Written by: Bob Dylan Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. "Philadelphia Freedom" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. "Oh, Carol" Written by: Neil Sedaka Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with "Oh, Carol," a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song.
