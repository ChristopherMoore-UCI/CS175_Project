(EW.com) -- FX has given the greenlight to "The Bridge," a thriller starring Diane Kruger ("Inglorious Basterds") and Demian Bichir ("A Better Life") and from Meredith Stiehm, a "Homeland" writer known for penning some of the series' most acclaimed episodes. This news means that Stiehm will likely have to leave the Showtime hit for her new FX series. The 13-episode first season will go into production in April for a July premiere on FX.
