The U.S. military has been working with the government of Yemen for a while to fight al Qaeda terrorists. Happy new year! This was one of Yemen's efforts to hit back at al Qaeda. The U.S. military and the intelligence community are looking at everything they have got on al Qaeda in Yemen. One of the dead was an al Qaeda operative believed to have been behind the October 2000 attack on the Navy warship Cole in Yemen that killed 17 sailors.
