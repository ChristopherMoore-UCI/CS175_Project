From stay-at-home mom to lung cancer expert Through her own ingenuity, hard work, and determination, Karen Parles received Kennedy-quality care without his power or money. When the senator's daughter, Kara Kennedy, was told she had lung cancer in 2002, her father deployed a similar strategy, Clymer says. He says the third step is to contact experts in the field, as Kennedy and Parles did when they were stricken with cancer. --   In 1974, when Edward Kennedy Jr., developed an aggressive form of bone cancer that at the time few survived, his father, the late senator, wasted no time snapping into action. While you may not be able to summon medical experts from around the country to your kitchen table with the snap of your fingers, experts in patient empowerment say more and more people are carving out their own Kennedy-style health care.
