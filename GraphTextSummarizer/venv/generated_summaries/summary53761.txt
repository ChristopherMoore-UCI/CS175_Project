Standing among bales of crushed plastic bottles and piles of books waiting to be recycled, Lau says that one kilogram of waste paper would have gotten about 18 cents this time last year. But paper scavengers like Tam are making much less money today than last year. "Each month I might earn $100 or $200 or $300 Hong Kong dollars," Tam says. And Hong Kong waste recovery companies are feeling the pinch because 98% of Hong Kong's recovered paper goes to be recycled in China, says Lau. A Hong Kong government report released last month revealed that the city's wealth gap is the widest in the developed world.
