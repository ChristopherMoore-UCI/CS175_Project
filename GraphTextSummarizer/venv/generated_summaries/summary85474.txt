"Apple could be thinking a number of things, from gaming on iPads to a way to interact with Apple TV or the rumored TV set," said Carolina Milanesi, a tech analyst with Gartner Research. "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," the statement says. "Gesture certainly has a place in complementing touch and voice as a way to interact with different devices," she said. A statement released by Apple in response to queries resulted in the same "non-confirmation confirmation" it has released after past acquisitions. "Apple has done a series of acquisitions that we have not seen through as far as a practical implementation of the technology," Milanesi said.
