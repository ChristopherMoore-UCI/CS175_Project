In some places and cultures, condom use is often seen as a sign that a man has AIDS, and many women won't sleep with such men. While researchers call condoms one of the best ways to stop the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, getting people to use them is another story. The foundation wants to see something that will lead men and women outside of a committed relationship to stop and think twice before having unprotected sex. "Any advance or new design that gets people to use condoms would be a big plus," Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the world's leading AIDS researchers, said in an interview with CNN. Female condoms are even more difficult to use and women are often afraid to suggest using them.
