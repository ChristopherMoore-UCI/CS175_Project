-- Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Wednesday said a report on the Keystone XL pipeline was "pretty definitive" in its assessment that it would not affect climate change, an issue President Barack Obama says must be part of the discussion. The countering statements between Harper and Obama came the same day a Nebraska state judge voided Gov. Dave Heineman's approval of the Keystone XL pipeline route. The comments by the two leaders came at a news conference following a summit of the leaders of North America, which brought together Harper, Obama and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Toluca, Mexico. Obama reiterated his position that any impact on climate change caused by the pipeline must be considered. Lancaster County Judge Stephanie Stacy on Wednesday issued a ruling saying the decision on where the oil pipeline should be located needed to be made by the state's Public Service Commission.
