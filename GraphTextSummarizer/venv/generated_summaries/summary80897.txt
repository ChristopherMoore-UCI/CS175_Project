Spain's Nadal will be bidding for a record seventh French Open title this year and opens against Simone Bolelli while Djokovic also faces Italian opposition in Potito Starace. Federer must get past Germany's Tobias Kamke to earn a potentially tricky second round clash with Argentina's David Nalbandian. Defending champion Li Na of China, beaten by Sharapova in the Rome final last weekend, faces Romanian Sorana Cirstea in the first round and could meet 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova in the quarters. Top seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus has been paired with Italian Alberta Brianti in the first round as she looks to secure her second consecutive grand slam after her Australian triumph.
