Over 200,000 people attended Exit last year, dancing at all-night raves in the gorgeous surroundings of Petrovaradin Fortress, an 18th-century castle near the Danube River. It also may be the muddiest -- heavy rain in several years, most notably 1997, turned Glastonbury into a muddy bog. Bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding performed at this year's New Orleans Jazz Fest. This year's headliners include Franz Ferdinand, Blur, and Bruce Springsteen. Stay tuned for this year's lineup.
