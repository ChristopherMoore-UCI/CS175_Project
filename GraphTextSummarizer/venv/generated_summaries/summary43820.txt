" Protesters calling for Wade's ouster have clashed on the streets, with at least three people killed during demonstrations last weekend, an opposition leader said. Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade acknowledged Monday that he fell short of a majority in his country's weekend presidential vote and will have to face a runoff. "Wade built schools, roads and hospitals," said Ayo Johnson, an analyst on African affairs. But Wade successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office in 2000, before the term limit was put in place. But deadly demonstrations broke out after the country's highest court cleared Wade to seek a third term in January, and protesters demanded that Wade give up his bid for a new mandate.
