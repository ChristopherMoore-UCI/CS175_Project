This year, Lee finally gave permission for the novel to be published as an e-book and digital audio edition e-book, saying, "I am amazed and humbled that 'Mockingbird' has survived this long. Through the trial and their experiences in their hometown of Maycomb, Alabama, Scout and Jem learn about racism and acceptance in the 1930s Deep South. The story "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a coming-of-age story about two children in the South, Scout and Jem Finch. The town where the novel takes place is based on her hometown, and the fictional trial in "Mockingbird" closely parallels the 1931 Alabama "Scottsboro Boys" trial. Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" celebrates its 54th birthday today, and for the first time, it's available as an e-book.
