Encouraging this process by celebrating uncertainty is the raison d'etre of my work ... from the science of human and bee perception, to the art of translating images into music, to the design of a glass windmill for primary schools, to the creation of the "My School" educational program (a framework for teaching and architecture that directly supports creativity, community choice and compassion), even to giving a talk at TED. We are instead indivisible from nature, defined by the trial and error process of interaction, a process in which we can choose to become active agents (but too often choose not to). By providing relevant, tangible and accessible frameworks for others to take part in the process of discovery, I hope -- in a very modest way -- that my work will help foster a more empathetic view of nature and human nature. Like all our perceptions, we see illusions because the brain evolved not to see the retinal image, but to resolve the inherent "meaninglessness" of that image by continually redefining normality, a normality that is necessarily grounded in relationships, history and ecology. Thus, courage not confidence is at the heart of this process of actively redefining normality, which is the route to compassion and creativity.
