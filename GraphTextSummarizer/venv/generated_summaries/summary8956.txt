Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who chairs the Republican Governors Association, told CNN that Wisconsin voters were tired of continuous recall efforts by Democrats since the 2010 election that brought Walker to the governor's office. -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's survival in a recall election sparked by steps to weaken public unions could embolden fellow Republicans in other states to seek similar measures. "I think he can certainly give voice to a lot of the restlessness and resentments and that sort of thing that are stirring against some of the excesses in labor unions," Gergen said of Romney, "but what I hope he does not do is declare war on public employee unions. The Wisconsin recall effort was spurred by a Walker-backed Republican measure, signed into law in March 2011, to limit the collective bargaining rights of state worker unions. " Gergen warned Republicans, including certain presidential candidate Mitt Romney, to avoid overplaying the Wisconsin result by launching a broad attack on public unions.
