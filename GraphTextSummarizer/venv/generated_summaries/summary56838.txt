For instance, Ngbapo said rebel fighters attacked two towns last Saturday -- a few days before their leaders were set to join Bozize, as well as the presidents of Gabon, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea and the Republic of Congo, in Libreville. As the government scrambled to put down the rebellion, UNICEF representative Souleymane Diabate said "reliable sources" had told his U.N. agency "that children are newly being recruited" by rebel groups and pro-government militias. The apparent deal would appear to end violence that began last month, when the Seleka rebel coalition launched an offensive as they demanded President Francois Bozize step down after accusing him of reneging on a peace deal. These talks ended Friday with an agreement to form a "government of national unity" headed by Bozize, said Jules Gauthier Ngbapo, a spokesman for the Central African Republic's decentralization and territorial administration ministry. Armed groups were forcing people younger than 18 to fight, carry supplies and serve as sex slaves, the agency said last Friday.
