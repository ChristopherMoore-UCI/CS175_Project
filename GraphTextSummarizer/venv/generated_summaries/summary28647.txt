In a conference call on Sunday evening, eurozone finance ministry officials were still debating the terms of debt restructuring -- including whether to force more losses on private bondholders -- and how to bring down the size of the total bail-out. The IMF portion of the new package, which will be added to the remaining €10bn in IMF commitments from the first Greek bail-out, will be converted into a lending programme with a repayment period of up to 10 years rather than the five years under the current loan. Of that, €30bn is expected to come in a direct payment to bondholders in cash or bonds issued by the eurozone's rescue fund in exchange for writing off €100bn in Greek debt. The €170.5bn rescue package does not include €35bn that will be set aside temporarily to ensure Greek banks can fund themselves when Athens is ruled in "selective default" after the restructuring. The figures show the IMF will only contribute €13bn to the second bail-out, far less than the one-third lent in the Irish, Portuguese and first Greek bail-outs.
