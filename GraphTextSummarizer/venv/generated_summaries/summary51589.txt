David Wildstein resigned his position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December amid allegations that Christie appointees had ordered access lanes to the nation's biggest river crossing in Fort Lee closed last year to punish that town's mayor politically for not endorsing Christie for reelection. "Evidence exists ... tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated publicly in a two-hour press conference (on January 9)," Zegas said in a letter to the general counsel of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge and where Wildstein had worked for the governor. The U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey is also investigating the bridge scandal as well as allegations from the mayor of Hoboken that Christie administration officials last year conditioned Superstorm Sandy relief funds on her support for a redevelopment project backed by the governor. Days of lane closures The letter references the closures over a work week in September, but does not suggest that "evidence" contradicts anything Christie has said so far about his advisers at the time or any role they might have played in alleged political shenanigans. A former top appointee of Chris Christie says there is evidence contradicting what the New Jersey governor has said publicly about the notorious George Washington Bridge traffic lane closures that have roiled the Republican's administration, according to the man's lawyer.
