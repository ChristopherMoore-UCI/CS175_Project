Debts, drugs, messy bedroom highlighted in Jackson trial Autopsy reveals Jackson's secrets "Mr. Robson's claim is outrageous and pathetic," Jackson estate lawyer Howard Weitzman said in a prepared statement. " Mesereau said it was "suspicious timing" for the claim to be filed at the start of the trial of the Michael Jackson wrongful death case, in which Jackson's mother and children are suing concert promoter AEG Live. Wade Robson, now 30, denied in testimony at Jackson's child molestation trial in 2005 that he had been molested by the singer. Jackson was acquitted of child molestation charges in 2005, partly based on the testimony of Robson, his sister and his mother.
