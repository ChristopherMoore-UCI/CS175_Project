Gibson stays focused with the help of a coach, Ryan Blanck, CEO of offtrackonpurpose.com. In addition to the weight loss, Gibson no longer needs high blood pressure medicine. Gibson finds their sessions particularly effective. "He gives me positive encouragement and tough love. And from there on out, when they'd ask me to play, I'd say, 'Nope, I'm good.'" As he steadily gained weight, Gibson said he was lucky that the kids didn't bully him about it. "I loved fried chicken, so I decided I would eat six pieces instead of eight," Gibson said.
