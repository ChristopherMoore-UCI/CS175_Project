"Based on test results to date, there is no need for a recall of infant formula and parents may continue to use powdered infant formula, following the manufacturer's directions on the printed label," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said in a joint update. In the Missouri case, Cronobacter bacteria were found in an opened bottle of nursery water and prepared infant formula, but it was not clear how they became contaminated, the update said. After cases occurred in Missouri and Illinois, authorities looked for other cases, and found an Oklahoma case and the one in Florida. Tests on factory-sealed containers of powdered infant formula and nursery water with the same lot numbers turned up no Cronobacter bacteria, it said, adding, "There is currently no evidence to conclude that the infant formula or nursery water was contaminated during manufacturing or shipping." Formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition said the agencies' test results corroborated its own. "We're pleased with the FDA and CDC testing, which should reassure consumers, health care professionals and retailers everywhere about the safety and quality of our products," Tim Brown, senior vice president and general manager for North America, said in a statement.
