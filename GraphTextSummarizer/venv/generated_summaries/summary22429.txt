Even more complicated, in this case, two different subcategories of felony murder are alleged using child neglect crimes as the predicate felony. This is felony murder predicated on another felony, count 5, second degree child cruelty. The traditional felonies eligible for felony murder were intentional crimes: burglary, arson, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Count 2 is felony murder based upon count 4: intentional child neglect. That's why felony murder is a much more appealing and devastating weapon in the charging arsenal.
