The crowded population, primarily comprised of Tamil civilians, is subject to the continuing Sri Lankan government assaults. The Sri Lankan army launched an operation against Tamil rebels in the country's north early Monday, the military said, claiming to have rescued thousands of civilians trapped in a government safe zone. The U.S. State Department on Thursday called for a cease-fire between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tigers to allow civilians to escape the fighting. The British and French foreign ministers released a joint statement as well on Wednesday, saying that the Tamil Tigers are using Tamil civilians as human shields. The Sri Lankan army has relaunched its attacks on Tamil rebels in the country's north.
