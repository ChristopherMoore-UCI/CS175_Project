When Hurricane Fran hit North Carolina in 1996, half the 24 deaths there involved falling trees or limbs, according to information posted online by the Renaissance Computing Institute at East Carolina University. "Before hurricane season, assess your property to ensure that landscaping and trees do not become a wind hazard," the National Hurricane Center warns on its website. " Falling trees or limbs snapped off in high winds pose a particularly difficult threat to avoid. Certain trees and bushes are vulnerable to high winds and any dead tree near a home is a hazard. In North Carolina, three of the six known deaths were tree-related, while the lone death reported in Maryland involved a tree falling on a house and all four deaths in Virginia -- including Robinson's -- were caused by overturned trees. While the prospect of toppled trees and crashing limbs is easy to imagine, planning against such a threat is difficult.
