Tressler covered high society, general assignments, human interest stories, men's and women's fashion and other stories for the newspaper for two months, Tressler said at a Los Angeles news conference Thursday. Tressler said has already found a new writing job in Houston for a publication she declined to name. She insisted she has no plan to parlay the media attention into a job covering high society in Los Angeles. -- A part-time stripper fired from her full-time newspaper job covering Texas high society claims she's a victim of gender discrimination. "We have not seen the complaint and thus cannot comment," Chronicle spokeswoman Naomi Engel said Thursday.
