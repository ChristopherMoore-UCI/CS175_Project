Despite hitting theaters in a crowded May marketplace, the Universal film earned an estimated $120,019,000, the fourth-highest Memorial Day opening in history, for a per-theater average of $33,400. But the $100 million film's "B" CinemaScore and middling reviews indicate that word-of-mouth won't help subsequent weekend grosses. From here, it's hard to see Part III matching the $250+ million grosses of the first two films, though strong foreign sales should help Warner Bros. overcome the sting. The weekend's third wide release, "Epic," topped expectations with an estimated $42,600,000 for the four-day and a per-theater average of $10,974. Speaking of big-budget, male-skewing films: "The Hangover Part III" earned an estimated $51,215,000 over the four-day weekend, for a per-theater average of $14,406, and $63 million since Thursday.
