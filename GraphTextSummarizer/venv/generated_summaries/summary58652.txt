The Atlanta BeltLine is revitalizing a 35-kilometer (22-mile) loop of abandoned railway line, transforming the land and adjacent brownfield sites into attractive new public spaces. " With a growth in suburban sprawl in recent decades, Atlanta has acquired a reputation for unbearable traffic and poor public transportation. "Great cities are great places to live and they're really vibrant and diverse," Gravel said. "Green space is kind of the living room of the city and as more people move into the city it becomes more and more important to have spaces where people can go get out of their homes and apartments and enjoy the diversity and life of the city. But a project originally inspired by Gravel's 1999 graduate thesis is helping to change that perception, tapping into Atlanta's potential and steering it onto a more sustainable path for the 21st century.
