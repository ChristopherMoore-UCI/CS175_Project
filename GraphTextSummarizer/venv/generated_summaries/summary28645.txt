Members of a committee have until May 2013 to make a report or recommendation to the group's National Executive Board, said Boy Scouts spokesman Deron Smith. Smith acknowledged that members of the Scouts' 300 councils have varying opinions. But the issue is back in the headlines because of the resolution, a separate online petition and the formation of a group that wants Boy Scouts to end its "outdated" policy. "By embodying the values of the Scout Oath and Law, we believe we can restore the social relevancy of one of this country's great cultural institutions: the Boy Scouts of America," Scouts for Equality says. "Resolutions of this nature are not unique," Smith said on Thursday.
