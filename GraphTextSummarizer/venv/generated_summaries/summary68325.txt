Armando Torres, III was kidnapped, along with his father and uncle, by armed men in La Barranca, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on May 14, the FBI said. The State Department is aware of reports that a U.S. citizen had been kidnapped in Mexico, an agency official not authorized to speak for full attribution told CNN. The state prosecutor's office in Mexico's Tamaulipas state told CNN that neighbors said the apparent kidnapping could be tied to a land dispute involving the Marine's father. The FBI is turning to the public for any information about the apparent kidnapping in Mexico of a U.S. Marine reservist. Shortly after he arrived at the ranch, armed gunmen entered the ranch and took Torres, as well as his father, Armando Torres II, and his uncle, Salvador Torres, by force, the FBI said.
