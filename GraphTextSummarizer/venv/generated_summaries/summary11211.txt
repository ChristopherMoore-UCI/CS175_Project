The film, which had the highest domestic box office debut, brought in an estimated $103.2 million in domestic theaters its second weekend, setting another industry record, according to Disney. "It's a fantastic movie and an extraordinary franchise that will continue with more great stories and compelling characters for years to come. "The Avengers," a superhero smorgasbord featuring Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and The Hulk, is expected to top $1 billion worldwide on Sunday, its 19th day of release, said Walt Disney Studios. The success of "The Avengers" comes on the heels of Disney's epic flop "John Carter," which lost an estimated $200 million and cost the head of the company's studio unit his job. Before "The Avengers" burst on the scene, "The Hunger Games" from Lionsgate had been this year's box-office champ, taking in an estimated $155 million domestically in its first weekend.
