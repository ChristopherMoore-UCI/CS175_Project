In response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempt to link all resistance groups' aims to those of ISIS, Al Falistinya TV in Palestine aired a film clip that better reflects the way ISIS is viewed by most Muslims in the region. And in the West, it is everyday Muslims like me who hold our breaths waiting for the next raft of CIA and British intelligence "measures," which will target citizens based solely on the basis of our religion or ethnicity. Those headlines -- the ones that may reassure you -- about "deradicalization" and "crackdowns," mean that your quiet, non-drinking Muslim neighbors and I must now prepare for more phone spying, more friends receiving alarming visits from secret agents and more hassle at the airport. Yet Muslims -- whether involved in genuine armed resistance in Gaza or simply preparing for college in the Midwest -- are labeled as sharing the values of groups I can confidently say do not represent our faith, our many cultures, or much less our hopes and aspirations. That particular young man in Gaza would no more recognize the aims or behavior of the so-called "Islamic State," in beheading journalists and threatening the mass murder of other faiths, than your own kids or, for that matter, your average Muslim teenager in Los Angeles, London or Lille would.
