In the task of adjudicating just what is and isn't acceptable to say at a football game, leading English Premier League club Liverpool has issued a list of banned words to its employees in its efforts to rid football of discriminatory behavior. In September 2012 former England captain John Terry was banned for four matches and fined Â£220,000 for a racist slur aimed at Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. "It gives football fans the opportunity to report a racist incident if someone is causing a nuisance in their vicinity or trying to spoil their entertainment," former England and Tottenham Hotspur winger and Kick It Out trustee Garth Crooks told CNN. Meanwhile, English anti-racism organization Kick It Out, which this year marks 20 years of battling discrimination, has launched a smart phone app which allows fans to report incidents of racism at matches. The guidelines have has not been reportedly issued to Liverpool players because they receive separate instructions from the Football Association.
