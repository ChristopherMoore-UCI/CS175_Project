"Hamas is for the first time is saying civil state, democratic state, pluralistic state and this is a revolution in their thinking," said Dr. Mahdi. Regional changes may have given a new impetus to Hamas and Fatah on the reconciliation front, but as Dr. Ashrawi puts it, recent meetings between the two groups in Egypt show that while they are trying to work together, "like all political parties self interest comes into play." The continued building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, combined with moribund U.S.-backed peace talks, has resulted in Palestinian political strategy becoming about survival and dependence. "It's difficult to say whether Hamas and Fatah can work together but if we set up a system where pluralism and differences of opinion can be expressed peacefully, they should be able to work together," said Dr. Ashrawi. To that end, they have been following several tracks: the recent Jordanian-sponsored talks with Israel; reconciliation efforts sponsored by Egypt between the Palestinian political factions Hamas and Fatah; aid and reconstruction efforts by the Gulf states; and focusing on Iranian influence on Hamas.
