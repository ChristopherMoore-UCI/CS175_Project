Matthias Schepp, 43, also studied suicide techniques, poisons and ferry schedules before allegedly taking 6 year-old Alessia and Livia Schepp from their home St. Sulpice, near Lausanne in western Switzerland, on January 30, according to police in the Swiss canton of Vaud. " Swiss police searched the St. Sulpice home three times and investigated 60 other homes in the neighborhood, Vaud police said. -- The father of missing Swiss twins sent a letter to his wife saying he had killed them before committing suicide, police said Friday. In addition to the letters, police said searches of Schepp's computer revealed that he looked up information about firearms two days before allegedly taking the girls. Police have said Schepp took the girls following family problems, but police said they aren't aware of any evidence suggesting Schepp was having an affair.
