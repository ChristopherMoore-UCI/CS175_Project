But administration officials have cautioned that some Syrian rebel factions have ties to al Qaeda terrorists. "If, in fact, this was a deliberate use and attack by the Syrian government on its own people using chemical weapons, there may be another attack coming," Hagel said. If claims that Syria used chemical weapons this week are true, a speedy response will be needed to prevent another such attack, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday. The U.S. government is stepping up its involvement in the Syrian crisis after allegations of chemical weapons use -- with its top military official making plans to respond quickly, and its top diplomat reaching out to Syria's foreign minister and others in the wake of the report. The senior Defense Department official who spoke to CNN said options for direct military action would include targeting al-Assad's capability to deliver chemical weapons.
