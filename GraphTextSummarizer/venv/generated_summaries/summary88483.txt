-- More South African mine workers gathered Wednesday, signaling growing instability and labor woes in the nation's platinum industry days after police killed dozens of protesters. Officers used live ammunition when protesters defied their orders to stop attacking, said police Commissioner Riah Phiyega. Mine workers rallied at Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine, which is owned by local tribe Royal Bafokeng. Protesters moved toward police, forcing authorities to drive them back with tear gas and rubber bullets, officials said. She did not specify what the demands were, but she said workers have not made any threats to go on strike.
