-- Chelsea's sacking of Andre Villas-Boas came under fire Monday with former Blues boss Luis Felipe Scolari warning it will be "hell" for whoever succeeds the Portuguese at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea made a move to strengthen its coaching staff Monday after the departure of Villas-Boas by appointing former player Eddie Newton to assist interim manager Roberto Di Matteo. Ex-Brazil national team boss Scolari is one of six managers dismissed by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and, like himself, does not believe Villas-Boas was given enough time by the Russian billionaire. Chelsea players have also come out in support of their former manager with central defender David Luiz thanking the Portuguese. But Dutch legend Ruud Gullit, who managed Chelsea before Abramovich took control, told CNN that he disagreed with Scolari.
