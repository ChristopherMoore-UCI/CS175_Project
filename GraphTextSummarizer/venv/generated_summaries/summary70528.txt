Spanish leaders Barcelona travel to Mallorca on Sunday, while Real Madrid visit levante and second-placed city rivals Atletico host Getafe. In Spain, Malaga missed the chance to move above third-placed Real Madrid, losing 2-1 at home to Real Sociedad. Bayern Munich stayed seven points clear in the German Bundesliga following Saturday's 2-0 win at home to third-placed Eintracht Frankfurt. Denied a 50th successive league match undefeated, the Italian champions bounced back with a 4-0 romp against Nordsjaelland in European competition and on Saturday crushed Pescara 6-1 to move four points clear in Serie A. Inter Milan had closed the gap to one with that 3-1 win seven days ago, but the pressure is back on for Sunday's trip to mid-table Atalanta. Real Zaragoza beat Deportivo La Coruna 5-3, sealed by two late goals from Portugal forward Helder Postiga, to leave the visitors third from bottom.
