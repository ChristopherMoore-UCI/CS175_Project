All the major car companies are working on systems that would allow vehicles to talk to each other about road conditions, weather and traffic snarls. Meanwhile, Mercedes launched the second generation of its mbrace system, which connects drivers with the Web via customized apps that can be controlled by voice commands or on a dashboard touchscreen. The technology is still crude, and at least several years away from finding its way into Mercedes vehicles. Instead of focusing on preventing collisions, for example, a car could help diabetic drivers by employing wireless sensors to monitor their glucose levels, said Gary Strumolo, Ford manager of vehicle design and infotronics. Mercedes' messaging app will create a menu of logical missives based on your location and your car's speed -- "I'm stuck in traffic," or "I'm just north of Bakersfield" -- and display them on the screen.
