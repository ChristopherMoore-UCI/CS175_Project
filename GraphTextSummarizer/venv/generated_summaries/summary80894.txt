-- A California company has recalled more than 3,000 pounds of fresh ground beef patties and other packages of ground beef products that may be contaminated with the E. coli bacteria, the U.S. Agriculture Department said Saturday. The department's Food Safety and Inspection Service said it became aware of the problem "when contacted by another federal regulated establishment who believed they had received suspect product." E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and in severe cases, kidney failure. It was not clear Saturday whether anyone had been sickened by the recalled products. American Food Service of Pico Rivera recalled the products, which were produced on January 31, the USDA said in a press release.
