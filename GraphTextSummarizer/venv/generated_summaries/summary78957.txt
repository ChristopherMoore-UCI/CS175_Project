Of all those themes, the one that has achieved the widest audience is Paul's call for a return to money based on precious metals such as gold and silver. Back in the 1930s, governments accepted horrific suffering because they were terrified of the consequences of going off gold. When President Franklin Roosevelt told his budget director, Lewis Douglas, of his decision to quit gold, Douglas replied: "This is the end of Western civilization." Which means that the first thing any future gold-standard government would do in the event of recession would be to jettison gold. Under the weight of a series of terrible decisions, that recession collapsed into the worldwide Great Depression.
