They said he had a high alcohol content, an additional charge that if found guilty, would add up to 10 years to his sentence, according to Police Maj. Gen. Anuchai Lekbumrung. Thai police added a drunken driving charge against a Red Bull energy drink heir accused of ramming a police officer with his Ferrari and fleeing the scene, authorities said Friday. Authorities charged the drink creator's grandson with negligent death and hit-and-run after the crash. Police entered his mansion with a search warrant and found his Ferrari, which was wrecked on the front and had deployed air bags, authorities said. His father has attended evening services for the officer at the local temple, said Natthanan Klanpraert, the victim's sister-in-law.
