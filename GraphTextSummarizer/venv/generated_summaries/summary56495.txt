Madonna Constantine, professor of psychology and education at the university's Teachers College, was initially suspended after an independent 18-month investigation into allegations of plagiarism concluded that on several occasions she had published academic work without crediting others for content. Twenty-six pages of tables and spreadsheets submitted to CNN by Paul Giacomo, Constantine's attorney, contend that the passages in question can be traced to previous writings by Constantine. " "It is my opinion that this investigation, along with other incidents that have happened to me at Teachers College in recent months, point to a conspiracy and witch-hunt by certain current and former members of the Teachers College community," she said in a written statement. According to Giacomo, the former teacher at the school and two former students who alleged plagiarism had in fact plagiarized from Constantine. -- A Columbia University professor, who gained notoriety when a noose was found on the door of her office, has been fired after months of public and private allegations of plagiarism and racial targeting.
