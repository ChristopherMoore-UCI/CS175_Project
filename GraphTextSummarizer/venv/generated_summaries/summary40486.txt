-- Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry is taking an indefinite leave of absence, the NBA team's chief executive announced Friday, days after a report surfaced about controversial comments Ferry made about a free agent player. J. Michael Gearon Jr., a minority owner of the Hawks, wrote the letter to team owner Bruce Levenson shortly after the conference call to complain about Ferry's language. Then, Friday afternoon, he requested "an indefinite leave of absence, effective immediately," Hawks CEO Steve Koonin said in a statement. The email was found by an outside law firm brought in to review the Hawks franchise following Ferry's comments in June. As to Ferry, the commissioner told USA Today this week that he didn't believe the Hawks general manager should be fired for his June comments.
