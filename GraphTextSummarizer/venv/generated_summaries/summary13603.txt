-- The number of properties lacking running water in Northern Ireland has dwindled to fewer than 1,000, state-funded water company Northern Ireland Water said Sunday. Some 500 staffers have been working to restore water service to those without supply, and the company was contacting customers in the affected areas to keep them apprised of the situation, Northern Ireland Water said. Many customers have been without running water for nearly a week, and some said they have not had water supply for more than 10 days. About 45,000 properties may still have limited water supplies Sunday night, compared to 60,000 on Saturday night. Northern Ireland Water has drawn criticism from government officials, who held an emergency meeting on the situation last week.
