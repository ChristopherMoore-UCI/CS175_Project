"It could be said that 'Plastic Jesus' is becoming the Banksy of L.A." Now Armstrong has been immortalized in a piece of street art -- named "Are there any heroes anymore?" It is a stenciled image of fallen American hero Lance Armstrong. "Graffiti artists can face a $6,000 fine and imprisonment, and for multiple offenses it can lead to a federal court, which is very bad news," says the artist, who has never been caught when daubing his impressions on L.A.'s walls.
