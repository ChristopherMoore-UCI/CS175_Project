Welcome to the world of Patrick Chappatte -- a cartoonist whose knack for summing up major global events in a few simple brush strokes this week saw him become the first ever non-American to win the Overseas Press Club of America's international cartoonist award. Chappatte puts his own success down to the ability to "translate into a simple idea and a few brush strokes the gravity or the reality of things... to show things as they are. But while his day job is producing illustrations to match the headlines, Chappatte is one of a new breed of cartoonists who do their own reporting; taking their sketchbooks and pens on to the front line of news gathering. "Cartoons in their simplicity can help tell news stories and I think we will be using them more and more because they have a very special effect on people," he told CNN by phone from Geneva, shortly before flying to New York to accept his prize. Chappatte will be familiar to regular readers of the International Herald Tribune, the global version of the New York Times, which prints his works of satire, slapstick and political comment on a daily basis.
