The intensive protection zones will at least give his rangers the chance to establish what the general calls sanctuaries within a sanctuary. Kruger National Park, which is home to roughly 10,000 rhinos -- a quarter of the world's population -- shares a 350-kilometer border with impoverished Mozambique, making it a massive target for poachers. "Once a poacher is in the park, it's like a burglar in your home," said Jooste, who admitted that in a park the size of Israel, military-style patrols alone will never be enough to save Kruger's rhinos, and that much more needs to be done outside the park's boundaries. "Rhinos have recovered before." Slaughtered for a horn that for millennia has been its first line of defense, conservationists are now counting on the rhino's extreme adaptability to save it from extinction. "We were rangers, now we're at war," the park's head of anti-poaching, Major General Johan Jooste, told CNN.
