In areas close to wind turbines, "80 percent of the bats that we know about today are killed in that fashion." Kunz says that specifically, migrating bats seem to be more affected, mainly during their fall migration, which lasts from late summer to early autumn. The idea to build the turbine came to company president and CEO Brian Fairbank after years of struggling with the astronomical cost of making snow. In a time when many businesses are closing their doors, Fairbank said, "we're 12 percent ahead of our best year ever." The Zephyr wind turbine towers over Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort in Massachusetts. Studies show that wind turbines destroy the habitat that many animals live in.
