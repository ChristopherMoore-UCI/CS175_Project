Restaurant manager Naresh Gaonkar, who runs the Intialainen Ravintola Curry Palace across the street from the mall, told CNN there were police helicopters overhead and many police cars driving past with armed officers after the shootings. The Sello shopping center, one of Finland's largest, was busy with shoppers when the shootings began at 10:08 a.m. (3:08 a.m.) Shkupolli had lived in Finland "for some time," police said, but would not divulge his nationality. In September 2008, student Matti Juhani Saari, 22, killed 10 people before shooting himself in the head at Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences in Kauhajoki, Finland. "People saw a gunman, calm, walking out of the grocery store after shooting," said Mika Pettersson, editor-in-chief of Finnish news agency STT.
