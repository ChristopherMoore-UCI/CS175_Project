Since "Friends" ended in 2004, Kudrow has developed and appeared in several other shows, and become a producer and writer of her own projects, including "Web Therapy," in which she plays self-obsessed Internet therapist Fiona Wallace. The new episodes take place solely in online video Skype chats, and will feature a slew of new guest stars, including Steve Carell, Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal and Matt LeBlanc, as Fiona grapples with the ramifications of last season's finale.
