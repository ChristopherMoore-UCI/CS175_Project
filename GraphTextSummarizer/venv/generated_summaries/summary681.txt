Thirty-two teens escaped from the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center late Monday, Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson said. The teens left their dorms around 11 p.m. Monday and began running around a large yard at the facility, Johnson said. As of Tuesday, most had either turned themselves in or had been caught on nearby roads, Johnson said. It's not known whether the escape was planned or was a spontaneous action, Johnson said. -- Authorities near Nashville were still searching Tuesday for teenagers who escaped a detention center the night before.
