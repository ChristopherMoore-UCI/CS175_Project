Japan's health ministry ordered doctors to stop immunizing infants with the vaccines while authorities investigate Pfizer's Prevenar vaccine and Sanofi Pasteur's ActHIB vaccine -- commonly given to infants in the United States and other developed nations. The U.S. Food and Drug administration said it was aware of the suspensions in Japan, but "physicians assessing vaccine safety at the FDA and CDC have not detected new safety concerns" related to the vaccines. The World Health Organization has backed the inclusion of Prevenar in national childhood immunization programs, especially in developing nations where infant mortality remains high. We are conducting a thorough evaluation of these cases in cooperation with the relevant regulatory health authorities." Sanofi Pasteur said that the company expresses condolences to the families who had lost children, but also said that no causal relationship between the deaths and the ActHIB vaccine had been established. "Pfizer thoroughly reviews and continually monitors all of its medicines and vaccines, as safety is our top priority," Pfizer said in a statement.
