Pakistan halted NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan Thursday after officials blamed cross-border NATO helicopter fire for the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers. -- Attackers in Pakistan have hit another convoy carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan, killing one person, authorities said. Morrell also said the U.S. military is hopeful that the closed supply route from Pakistan to Afghanistan will be opened "as soon as possible," but the closure has not affected the ability to supply NATO troops. "The special squad is fully capable to cut off the route for NATO supplies by carrying attacks on the trucks," Tariq said. Azam Tariq, the Pakistani Taliban spokesman, said both the recent attacks on NATO supply efforts were carried out as revenge for drone strikes and NATO's attacks in Pakistan.
