Sunday's big match sees leaders Barcelona host closest rivals Atletico Madrid, while Real Madrid host second-bottom Catalan club Espanyol. Neither club nor country have lost when the 34-year-old has found the target in a period stretching back to the February 16 Europa League defeat by Atletico Madrid. Manuel Pellegrini's team, through to Thursday's last-16 draw of the European Champions League, took a 49th-minute lead through Argentine defender Martin Demichelis. Earlier, Udinese snatched a 1-1 draw at home to Palermo thanks to an 89th-minute equalizer from captain Antonio Di Natale. Champions Dortmund can reclaim third place by winning at Hoffenheim on Sunday, having lost it after Eintracht Frankfurt won 2-0 at Wolfsburg.
