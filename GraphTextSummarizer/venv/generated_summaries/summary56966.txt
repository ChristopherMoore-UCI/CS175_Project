On Monday, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey said that while Suleman applied for public aid, the mother of 14 children "allegedly failed to disclose that she was also getting checks for personal appearances and residuals from videos. Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman pleaded not guilty Friday to welfare fraud charges relating to allegations that she did not report money that she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. The criminal complaint, filed by Deputy District Attorney William Clark with the public assistance fraud division, said Suleman applied for public assistance in Lancaster, California, in January 2013. Suleman, 38, performed in adult videos and danced topless at a Florida strip club last year. " Suleman -- known in tabloids as "Octomom" -- was not arrested, but was ordered to appear before an Los Angeles County judge for her initial arraignment, the DA said Monday.
