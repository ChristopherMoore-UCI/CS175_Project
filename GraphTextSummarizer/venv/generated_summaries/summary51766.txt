"For infants who are not breast-fed, infant formula is the only safe, nutritious and recommended feeding option." Mountford is right, of course, about formula being the only widely available alternative to breast milk (there's donor milk too, though not enough to nourish all formula-fed babies). A press release about the campaign explains the relationship between formula and breast-feeding success: If the baby is not given anything but breast milk, especially in the first month after the baby is born, almost every mother will make enough milk for her baby. What the U.S. can learn from Indonesia about breast-feeding But the International Formula Council — which represents formula manufacturers and marketers — maintains that restricting access to formula isn't the key to boosting breast-feeding rates. Using baby formula during this time can decrease the production of milk, and consequently make the mother reliant on formula. When it goes into effect in September, nurses in participating hospitals will be instructed not to give formula to babies unless there's a medical reason to do so or unless moms specifically request it (they'll first have to listen to a mandatory speech about why breast is best).
