Games To consumers, all these features won't mean much if there aren't good games to play. Vita can help you find new connections with Near, a program that uses GPS to search your area for other nearby Vita devices. Sony is counting on some big franchises to help the Vita make a splash in the U.S. "Assassin's Creed," "Madden NFL," "Uncharted," "FIFA," "Little Big Planet" and "BioShock" are a few of the powerhouse series that are developing games for the Vita. PS Vita also raises the bar on mobile gaming by offering voice chat and text chat through the Party application. Yoshida said that while Vita does have a lot of input devices and functions, there were many others that didn't make it to the final design.
