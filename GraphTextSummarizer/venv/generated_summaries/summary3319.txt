Other notable Delts from around the country include actor Will Ferrell, journalist Roger Mudd, former NFL star John Elway, former R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck and Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear. Delta Tau Delta brothers on campus at Miami reacted with excitement at the news of Ryan's selection as Romney's No. 2. An economics professor named Richard Hart guided Ryan through the classics of conservative economic theory, and Ryan soon came to revere thinkers such as Ludwig von Mises, Ayn Rand, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. Ryan was also a Delt -- a member of Delta Tau Delta, one of many fraternities on a campus where Greek life reigns. Ryan is one of many Delta Tau Delta alumni who have entered politics, and the second vice presidential candidate to emerge from the fraternity nationally: Alben Barkley, a longtime senator from Kentucky, was vice president during Harry Truman's second term.
