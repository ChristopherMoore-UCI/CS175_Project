Liberals are thrilled by the redistributive thrust of the president's budget -- it would hit affluent Americans with a battery of new tax hikes, totaling $2 trillion over the next decade, and use the proceeds to finance substantial tax cuts for low and middle income families. Most economists believe that junking, or at least limiting, a host of special preferences and tax breaks would reduce economic distortions, promote more efficient use of capital, and generally make federal taxes fairer and simpler. President Obama also calls for a new 19% minimum tax on global profits, which would reduce the risk that U.S. companies would have to pay tax twice on those profits. Lawmakers can't launch fresh initiatives to tackle contemporary problems without either piling on new debt or reneging on old commitments (to spend more, or tax less). For most of U.S. history, politicians could spend or cut taxes confident in the knowledge that economic growth would make budget deficits temporary and create fiscal space for new initiatives.
