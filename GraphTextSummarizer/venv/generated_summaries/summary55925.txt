People outside the Silicon Valley micro-blogging company, such as Twitter account holders, reportedly were not affected in the incident. "The bottom line seems to be this: your Twitter accounts are safe, but there are a number of documents that Twitter would rather not have published publicly in other people's hands," he says. That account housed some of Twitter's private financial documents and notes, according to Twitter's official blog. "This was not a hack on the Twitter service, it was a personal attack followed by the theft of private company documents," Twitter co-founder Biz Stone writes on the company's official blog. Google's suite of online applications, which allows users to share and store calendars, spreadsheets and text documents, is not to blame for the hacking, Stone said in the post, adding that Twitter continues to use Google Apps.
