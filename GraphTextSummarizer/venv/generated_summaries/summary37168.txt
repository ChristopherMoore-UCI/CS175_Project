Remember the Town Hall meetings in the summer of 2009, which erupted in shouting matches between citizens and legislators over health care? If we want to move beyond political stalemate, we should strengthen these innovative forums for citizens to deliberate with each other and officials. Rather than seeing citizens as targets of a political campaign, officials governed with the diverse residents of their community to develop practical solutions that garnered broad support. The people who participate, many of whom regard typical public meetings like Ebola, say they actually enjoy talking politics with other citizens and officials, sometimes for the first time in their lives. Given what Florida accomplished, Gov. Rick Scott's ban on using the terms "climate change" in state policy discussions to avoid polarization looks smart, not smarmy.
