TSA finds cocaine in raw meat One gun wasn't enough for a Queens, New York, man who was arrested Wednesday at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after TSA officers found a stash of weapons in two checked bags. Police officers from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports, confiscated the gun. As November 25, TSA officers had already found 1,973 firearms in carry-on bags at checkpoints across the country, compared to 1,813 firearms for all of 2013. The traveler had a New York City concealed weapons permit, so he was allowed to rebook on a later flight to Palm Beach, a TSA official confirmed. The TSA has already seized more firearms this year than in all of 2013.
