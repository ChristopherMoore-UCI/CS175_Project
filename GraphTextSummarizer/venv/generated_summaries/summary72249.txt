Elsewhere on Saturday afternoon, champions Manchester City fell further behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race after being held 1-1 by relegation threatened Hull City. The goal looked like it would secure Hull City a vital three points, until England international James Milner scored a late, late equalizer deep into injury time. Whilst Manchester City will no doubt be happy to have at least salvaged a point, they will be less happy to have seen Chelsea pull seven points clear at the top of the table. Aston Villa had only scored eleven times this season in the league yet managed to pull level through Jores Okore before Branislav Ivanovic restored Chelsea's advantage, as well as tightening Mourniho's grip on another Premier League title. Hull took a shock lead at the Etihad Stadium, where Manchester City had been impenetrable until recently, when David Meyler fired home.
