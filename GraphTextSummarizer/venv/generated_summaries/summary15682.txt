Chelsea stunned titleholders Barcelona with a 1-0 victory in the first leg of their European Champions League semifinal on Wednesday Ivory Coast international Didier Drogba scored the only goal of the game late in first-half injury time at a rain-swept Stamford Bridge in west London thanks to a rare mistake by Barcelona's Lionel Messi. Despite Barcelona experiencing the rare feeling of being behind at halftime, it was Chelsea that grew more comfortable as the game progressed, snuffing out the Catalan club's attacks with increasing confidence. When you play Barcelona you have to do a lot of defending, just try and limit their threat and be clinical with your chances," Chelsea's interim coach Roberto Di Matteo told British network ITV. Yet deep in injury time Barcelona could have leveled the tie and score a crucial away goal, but substitute Pedro hit the post with his low curling shot and Sergio Busquets blazed the rebound over the bar. Yet the one statistic that counts is the score and for those that played in the last Chelsea-Barcelona Champions League semifinal in 2009 -- where Chelsea had five clear penalty claims turned down before an injury-time Andres Iniesta goal clinched their place in the final -- the victory was sweet revenge.
