Tuesday night unleashed a trio of new shows into competitive time slots: Fox's "Ben & Kate," CBS' "Vegas" and — probably the most buzzed-about of the bunch — Fox's "The Mindy Project." Based on total viewers, "Vegas" drew the biggest CBS fall drama premiere audience this time period since "Judging Amy" in 2002. The return of "Private Practice" (6.6 million, 1.9) was down 32 percent from last fall's Thursday premiere and down somewhat from Body of Proof in this slot last year — taking "Private Practice" off its "Grey's Anatomy" life support on Thursdays firmly hurt it. The return of "NCIS" (20.2 million viewers, 4.1) was the night's top-rated show and only down a smidgeon from last year, followed by a similar story for NCIS: Comedies sometimes grow from their premieres, while CBS' drama audience is like giant migrating herd that gradually shifts around the schedule as the viewers develop new habits.
