Kraft shares, which together with Mondelez, the global snacks group created in the split, switched their listing from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq, surged as much as 28.9 per cent to $58.54 in the first minute of trading seconds after Irene Rosenfeld, the company's former chief executive, rang the market's opening bell. "Trading in Kraft was affected by a broker error that impacted multiple stock exchanges," Nasdaq said. The move surprised some after glitches occurred during the opening minutes of trading for Facebook but Kraft said it was confident in Nasdaq and that it had been drawn to the exchange's liquidity and cost effectiveness. Nasdaq suffered its second high-profile embarrassment in six months when it was forced to cancel trades in Kraft Foods after a trading glitch caused the company's shares to soar nearly 30 per cent. Kraft said last June that both companies would be listed on the Nasdaq, dealing a blow to the NYSE.
