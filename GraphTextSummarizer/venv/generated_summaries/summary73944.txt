But the city never obtained clear property to the title until this year, after a lengthy court battle with developer Gary Lundgren, who owned part of the land on which the complex sits. Lundgren said he offered to give the city a 20-acre parcel to avoid further lawsuits, but city officials turned him down. Lundgren purchased 325 acres from the Nature Conservancy, but the city filed a lawsuit claiming ownership of land it believed it owned. -- The sports complex that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's supporters call her most visible legacy as mayor of her hometown left the town paying inflated prices for the land and huge legal bills, according to court records. Wasilla eventually agreed to pay Lundgren more than $800,000 for the land, along with Lundgren's legal fees and interest: another $700,000.
