A 2006 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that only 4 percent of households with less than $50,000 of income own stock and actually receive capital gains and/or corporate dividends. Only 11 percent of households with incomes under $100,000 receive capital gains and/or corporate dividends. However, more than 75 percent of all capital gains and dividend income goes to households with income over $200,000, which represents only 3 percent of all U.S. households. Some have argued that BP should pay dividends this year because there are plenty of individuals who count on those quarterly dividends. -- BP, which is responsible for the greatest oil spill in American history, has made the right call in deciding to suspend dividend payments this year.
