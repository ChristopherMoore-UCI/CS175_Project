"But we know what that [Western] reality looks like, there's a whole language that's been established about what we know and feel from real horses and real dirt and real trains, and they're hard movies. "[Verbinski] makes big movies and that's what audiences love and that's why summer movies become blockbusters, because you give them a lot of punch for their 10 or 12 bucks," Bruckheimer said. With Jerry Bruckheimer producing (as he's done with the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise, among several other top Hollywood titles), Verbinski has enlisted Armie Hammer and "Pirates" star Johnny Depp to help him reinvent and tell the origin story of the masked seeker of justice. -- As the director of "Pirates of the Caribbean" Nos. 1, 2 and 3, filmmaker Gore Verbinski is intimately familiar with the massive needs of a potential summer blockbuster. But by now, "big" is just what we expect from Verbinski, and especially when paired with Bruckheimer, and they're hoping "The Lone Ranger" will come across as an explosive, fresh take on a familiar story.
