Richman, also known for his other Travel Channel program, "Man v. Food," has been in a war of words on Instagram over a photo he posted that showed off his weight loss. Don't look for Adam Richman's new Travel Channel show "Man Finds Food" anytime soon. As Amber Sarah explains, the word "thinspiration" is commonly in pro-anorexia and pro-bulimia communities, and is usually found alongside "pictures of emaciated bodies, mantras like 'What's more important, that slice of pizza or a thigh gap?'

Food" went off the air in 2012, and when he spoke about his new physique on Instagram using the hashtag #thinspiration, it sparked a heated online sparring.
