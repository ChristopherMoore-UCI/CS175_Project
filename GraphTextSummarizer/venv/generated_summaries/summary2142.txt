Over the weekend, megachurch pastor Joel Osteen was the victim of an elaborate hoax that included a fake website, phony headlines and sham Twitter account, all maintaining he had renounced his faith. Twitter allows parody accounts, as long as the joke is clear. There are legal issues involved -- the presidential campaign was set up according to one set of guidelines, and Organizing for Action functions under another -- but there's a larger ethical point as well: Should we believe that tweets are actually coming from the person who owns the Twitter account? Of course, Twitter transparency comes at many levels. In 1992, the Computer Ethics Institute, a Washington-based public policy organization, actually released a "Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics," many of which lend themselves to Twitter users.
