Winnsboro Police Chief Lester Thomas said Tuesday afternoon that evidence found on a cigarette lighter and a bottle of charcoal lighter fluid showed "this was not an attack, but a self-inflicted incident." -- A Louisiana woman who said she had been set afire by white supremacists inflicted her injuries herself, police said Tuesday. "This has been a very disturbing case for everyone involved," Franklin Parish Sheriff Kevin Cobb said. Investigators released little else at a Tuesday afternoon news conference. Moffitt was in critical but stable condition at a Shreveport hospital Tuesday night, Franklin Parish Sheriff's Deputy Bettye McCoy said.
