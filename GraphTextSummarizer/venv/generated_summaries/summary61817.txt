His death comes at an awkward time for President Raul Castro's government: another prisoner died after going on a hunger strike earlier this month, and Pope Benedict is due to visit Cuba in the coming months. Cobas died of a heart attack on January 1 after authorities at the Boniato Prison, near Santiago, disregarded a doctor's recommendation that he be moved to a provincial hospital, according to Elizardo Sanchez, who heads the island's independent Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Wilmar Villar Mendoza, 31, died in a hospital in Santiago after his kidneys and other organs failed, said Yoani Sanchez , a prominent Cuban blogger and advocate of press freedom in the country. A Cuban court sentenced Villar Mendoza to four years in prison in November, Sanchez said, a sentence he said he felt was unjust. Villar Mendoza started his hunger strike following his sentencing, halting it briefly in December when the authorities said they would listen to his demand for his case to be reconsidered, Sanchez said.
