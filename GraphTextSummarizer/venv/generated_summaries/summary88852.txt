(As the actor recounted on DJ Whoo Kid's radio show, that era involved living in a van with a friend, smoking weed daily and listening to Dr. Dre's "2001" so much he can still rap "Forgot About Dre" lyric for lyric.) It was while working as a waiter that Pratt, who'd done a few plays and a little dinner theater, got his first break into Hollywood: Rae Dawn Chong happened to be dining at the restaurant where he worked, and a spontaneous chat led to a gig in his screen debut, "Cursed Part 3." According to the paper, Pratt didn't have any big plans after high school graduation, and he eventually found himself in Maui. As described in the New York Times, Pratt grew up in Lake Stevens, Washington, an athlete and the youngest of three who wasn't averse to performing in school assemblies. Obviously, Pratt's come a long way since "Cursed Part 3."
