A billionaire's foundation announced Thursday a one-off $1 million award to South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu for "his lifelong commitment to speaking truth to power." Last month, Tutu reiterated his calls that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former U.S. President George W. Bush should be "made to answer" at the International Criminal Court for initiating the 2003 Iraq War. The foundation, which promotes good governance in the continent, was established by Sudan-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim. Only a handful of leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, have won the good governance award since it was launched in 2007. The London-based foundation also awards an annual $5 million prize to a former African head of state who practices good governance.
