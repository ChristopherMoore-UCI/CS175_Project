-- A pair of second half goals from Lionel Messi gave Barcelona a 2-0 win over 10-man Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal in the Bernabeu Wednesday. Earlier, a melee in the tunnel at halftime had Barcelona reserve goalkeeper Jose Pinto shown a red card by German referee Wolfgang Stark. Mourinho's men had worked hard to cancel out Barcelona as they had to such good effect in beating them in the final of the Copa del Rey last week and the tactics worked well in the first half. And with four minutes remaining, Messi rounded off a fine night for Barcelona with a majestic second, weaving his way through the Real defense to beat Iker Casillas with ease. Why did it happen?" With Manchester United also leading 2-0 from their away leg against Schalke Tuesday, the stage looks set for a repeat of the 2009 Champions League final, won by Barcelona.
