"People living in areas of heavy fighting in western Libya are now in dire need of medical aid and other assistance." Late Monday night, the Gulf Cooperation Council said Libya had rejected its offer of humanitarian aid. -- As Libya entered its fourth week of bloody clashes Tuesday, there was little doubt that the situation had turned into all-out civil war. Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France, Britain, and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya, diplomatic sources at the United Nations said. With no clear end to the deadly clashes in sight, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli.
