"Journalists are too often the targets of potentially violent, overzealous viewers," said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The names of the anchors who appear on CNN's sister network were released by the Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff's department after the arrest of David Lee Simpson, 48. -- A New York man who investigators say was infatuated with convicted killer Jodi Arias threatened to kill HLN anchors Nancy Grace and Jane Velez-Mitchell Arias was convicted in May of first-degree murder for killing her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander. Simpson has waived extradition and will be taken to the Maricopa County Jail in Arizona this week, the statement said.
