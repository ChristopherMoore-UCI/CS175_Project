WaterAid has been providing access to sanitation alongside clean drinking water and hygiene promotion since the early 1980s. If we halve the proportion of people without access to sanitation, the economic return would be over $54 billion per year. Even when this goal is finally reached, one in four people will still not have access to safe sanitation. Every hour 70 women and girls will needlessly die from diseases directly linked to a lack of an adequate toilet and safe drinking water. Almost two billion people have gained access to sanitation since 1990.
