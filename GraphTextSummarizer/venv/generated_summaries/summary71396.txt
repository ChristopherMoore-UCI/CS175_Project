In several of our studies, for example, people lied less in e-mail than face to face. The Internet allows for this kind of identity deception because people can chose any identity they want. But the use of identity deception at scale, with thousands of people doing so in concert, is new. We can use computers to analyze the language in these records and find word patterns that reveal deception, like whether a hotel review was written by someone who actually stayed at the hotel or not (take a look at the end of the TED talk to see if you can tell which hotel review is fake). They allow us to use the technology as a sort of social buffer to avoid interaction when we're technically always available, while at the same time giving plausible excuses to maintain social relationships we care about.
