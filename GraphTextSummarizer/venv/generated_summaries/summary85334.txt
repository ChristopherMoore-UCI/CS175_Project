The proliferation of free Google e-mail accounts led to casual users switching to Google Docs, and eventually pushing their employers to switch to Google Apps. Microsoft is still taking Google's encroachment seriously and has even created a special "Google Compete" team to prevent corporate Office users from making the jump to Google Apps, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Google tools lack some of the features found in Microsoft Office, but to many users that simplicity is part of their appeal. In addition to preventing users from switching to other products, Microsoft must persuade them to upgrade from older versions of Office. "Organizations are still deploying Windows 7 and Office 2010, and because of the urgency in getting Windows XP out by April 2014 when support ends, both Office 2013 and Windows 8 will likely have to take a back seat for a while," said Silver.
