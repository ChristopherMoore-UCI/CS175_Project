The woman has since denied that Zimmerman threw a bottle or that she ever feared him, according to a statement Friday from Lake Mary police. " Also, in September 2014, Lake Mary police said that a man claimed Zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident saying "I will ... kill you," and "Do you know who I am?" "While it clear that the officers had probable cause to arrest Mr. Zimmerman, which was affirmed by the circuit court judge at initial appearances, the subsequent recantation by the (alleged) victim of her initial statement along with new documents provided by the victim and her attorney precludes my office from proceeding further," Archer said. State Attorney Phil Archer, whose jurisdiction includes Brevard and Seminole counties, announced Friday that his office won't file charges against Zimmerman, who first came to the world's attention for his arrest and eventual acquittal in the 2012 shooting death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin. "She also made it clear that she did not want to proceed with the case," said police, noting that Lake Mary police Chief Steve Bracknell "concurred with Archer's decision."
