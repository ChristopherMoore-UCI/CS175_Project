-- A New York state Supreme Court judge Friday granted a temporary restraining order against a requirement that all health care workers in the state get H1N1 flu vaccinations. It cited a 1990 court ruling that rejected health care workers' opposition to mandatory rubella vaccinations. The Public Employees Federation filed suit, and Judge Thomas McNamara on Friday granted the restraining order, which will be in effect at least until the State Supreme Court can review the case during a hearing scheduled for October 30. New York wants all health workers to get flu vaccines. It has 15,000 members who work in health care, approximately 5,000 of whom would be directly affected by the vaccination regulation.
