Janay Rice, wife of suspended NFL player Ray Rice, slammed the media Tuesday but stood by her husband. After Janay Rice collapses, Ray Rice appears to pull her out of the elevator and is met by hotel staff, according to the AP. In March, a grand jury indicted Ray Rice on a charge of third-degree aggravated assault, and a simple assault charge against Janay Rice was dropped. " The Baltimore Ravens released Ray Rice on Monday after a video surfaced showing him punching his then-fiancee and dragging her limp body out of an Atlantic City casino elevator. Ray Rice pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and applied to a program for first-time offenders that could clear him of charges in as little as one year.
