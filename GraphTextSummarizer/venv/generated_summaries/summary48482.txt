For the first time, prosecutors in the Boston Marathon bombing case confirmed that deceased suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was accused of participating in a gruesome 2011 triple homicide outside Boston. "In any event, the government has already disclosed to (Dzhokhar) Tsarnaev that, according to Todashev, Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in the Waltham triple homicide," the document states. But the detail was not confirmed until this week, when prosecutors in the case against Tamerlan Tsarnaev's brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, made reference to it in a court document filed Monday. A federal law enforcement official told CNN back in May that Tsarnaev's involvement in the killings was revealed in an interview between police and Ibragim Todashev, a Chechen known to him.
