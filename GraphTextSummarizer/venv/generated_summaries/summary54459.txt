Back after a 12-year layoff is William Orbit, who handles the most pained tracks (including "Gang Bang," which b*tch-slaps Ritchie's shoot-'em-up aesthetic with a nod to "Kill Bill"). Handling the big dance-floor tracks are Italian duo Benny and Alle Benassi, who put the empty boom of the club into songs like "Girl Gone Wild. Seven out of 16 songs address her split directly, and that's low-balling if you think the chick with "fake t*** and a nasty mood" in "Some Girls" could be the lingerie model who became Guy Ritchie's new baby mama. New in town is Martin Solveig, the French producer behind the cheerleader fantasy of "Give Me All Your Luvin'" who is forced to curb his love of Prince, in service of sounding like William Orbit. She also sings about new love (fits like a glove), and asks for someone to lick the frosting off her cake on "B-Day Song."
