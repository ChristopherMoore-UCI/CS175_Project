The elections in May mark the first time in Pakistan's history that one democratically elected government will give way to another. Elections are scheduled for May 11. Five people died and 22 were wounded by Sunday's explosion in Orakzai, said Dilawar Khan Bangish, police chief of the Kohat District. The Taliban said it targeted secular candidates, but many parties have been hit by the increasing violence. "We are not in favor of democracy, democracy is for Jews and Christians," he said in recent propaganda video.
