There are many issues Congress could address that would actually help America's middle-class families: making greater investments in education, easing the burden of student loan debt, and taking action to hold off the looming threat of climate change. On Wednesday, House Republicans took the unprecedented action of voting to sue the President for doing his job and taking action to stand up for the American people. But come November, Americans will have a chance to choose leaders who are looking out for them and focused on finding real solutions to real problems by casting their ballots for Democrats. If House Republicans were serious about addressing immigration reform, they could let us vote on the bipartisan Senate bill or fund President Obama's border request. And on one of our nation's most pressing issues, immigration reform, the GOP's insistence on adhering to rigid ideology, as well as putting their partisan stunts over real action that would help our country, is alarmingly apparent.
