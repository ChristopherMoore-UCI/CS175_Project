The win continued Gulbis' impressive 2010, which has seen him claim his first ever ATP Tour title at Delray Beach in February. There were no such problems for second seed and 2008 champion Novak Djokovic, who took under an hour to demolish Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-1 6-1. It was Federer's first opening round loss at the Foro Italico since losing to Andrea Gaudenzi in 2002 -- and the first time since the 2000 Monte Carlo Masters that the Swiss maestro had lost his first clay-court match of the season. -- World number one Roger Federer has crashed out in the second round of the clay-court Rome Masters event, losing in three sets to unseeded Latvian Ernests Gulbis. The top seed looked set to cruise through after taking the opening set, but Gulbis fought back in the next two sets and, despite wasting six previous match points, the world number 40 eventually went through 2-6 6-1 7-5 in a match littered with unforced errors.
