The 50-mile march is re-creating the 1921 March on Blair that led to a bloody battle between thousands of coal miners and coal company supporters. But this is coal country, where families and fortunes depend on coal jobs, and most people who live here believe the opposite of what Keeney says. -- We're at the peak of Blair Mountain in the middle of southern West Virginia. "I just don't want to see coal mining that destroys rivers, drives away the biodiversity of such a beautiful place and also drives away other jobs that could be in place of coal mining." "If you stand for preserving our cultural heritage instead of destroying it, you stand for Blair Mountain," Chuck Keeney said to his followers before he led marchers out of Marmet, West Virginia, last week.
