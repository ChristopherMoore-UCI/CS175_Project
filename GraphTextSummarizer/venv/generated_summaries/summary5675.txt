" Snow, sleet and rain are in the forecast from Monday night through Wednesday morning as temperatures plunge to the 30s. We're trying to be ready and prepared and react as quickly as possible," Gov. Nathan Deal told reporters Monday. A winter storm watch is in effect Monday through Wednesday morning for Atlanta and the watch stretches west to Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee and Little Rock, Arkansas. The governor and his staff huddled with emergency management, transportation, power company and health officials Monday morning. And Georgia Power's top emergency official said he'd already started calling in crews from other states to help fix downed power lines -- just in case.
