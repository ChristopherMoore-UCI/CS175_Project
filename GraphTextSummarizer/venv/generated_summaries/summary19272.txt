Marcum's purported post appeared Monday, and authorities arrested him a day later. Andrew Marcum, 21, jumped in and posted his two cents after authorities shared his picture on Facebook as a featured warrant of the week. In addition to sharing the suspect's name, the Facebook account is several years old and had other photos resembling Marcum, including one with a large tattoo spelling his last name on his back. Sheriff Richard K. Jones raised the stakes by moving their pleas to Twitter. Authorities took the man's post seriously enough to respond to it.
