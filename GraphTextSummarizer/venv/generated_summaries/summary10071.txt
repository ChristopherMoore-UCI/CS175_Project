The U.S. State Department, while not explicitly calling for Gulnaz's release, said Thursday that "Gulnaz's situation is one no woman should have to face" and called on prosecutors to uphold the law and Gulnaz's rights. A spokesman for the attorney general, Rahmatullah Naziri, told CNN last week that while the original sentence for adultery was reduced, she had failed to report her rape quickly enough and would have to serve further time in jail for that offense. The meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Kabul, was called in reaction to a petition with nearly 5,000 signatures and media inquiries about the case, said Karzai spokesman Aimal Faizi. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called a high-level judiciary meeting to discuss the case of a rape victim who was jailed because of the attack and has agreed to marry the rapist to get out of prison and legitimize her daughter, She is now raising her daughter in jail and has agreed to marry her attacker in order to be released and legitimize her daughter.
