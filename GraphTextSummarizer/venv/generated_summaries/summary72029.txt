Even though this case was dismissed in 2013, media outlets occasionally show stories of seniors who have large hospital bills related to "observation status," further perpetuating this myth. These are dedicated patient care areas, typically staffed with emergency physicians, that are designed to rapidly treat or diagnose a handful of conditions like pneumonia, asthma, and chest pain. Also, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed huge overlap in the initial ER complaints of people with "primary care treatable" (could have seen their doctor) conditions and those with truly emergent complaints. In fact, emergency nurses are frequently attacked, verbally and physically, by patients. Research has shown that most patients who come to the ER believe they have a life-threatening condition.
