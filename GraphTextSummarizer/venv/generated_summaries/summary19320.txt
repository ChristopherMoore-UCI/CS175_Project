What impact do you think the hand-eye coordination required in video games has helped drivers become better in real racing? I played "Super Mario Bros." I played any kind of racing game that existed, I played "Track and Field." I think given the fact that we're in a racing environment, racing games tend to be something that's obviously really common, so growing up I've played them and some people continue to play them How does this compare to seeing yourself in NASCAR games? I played a lot of games growing up, as any kid naturally would do.
