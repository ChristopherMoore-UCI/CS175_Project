More than half of the company's 5,800 workers during 2005 had invalid Social Security numbers, and the company ignored at least 13 letters from the Social Security Administration about questionable Social Security numbers. -- A company accused of encouraging hundreds to illegally enter the United States and then hiring them using fake Social Security numbers has agreed to pay the largest settlement ever in a workplace immigration bust, the Department of Justice said Friday. Federal officials also charged several managers, accusing them of using "as a business model the systematic violation of United States law." To date, nine IFCO managers and employees have pleaded guilty to criminal conduct, the Justice Department said. IFCO Systems North America, a pallet and crate company, will pay a $20.7 million settlement, which includes $18.1 million in fines and $2.6 million for overtime violations, the Department of Justice said. Relatives of people arrested in IFCO raids gather for a news conference in July 2006.
