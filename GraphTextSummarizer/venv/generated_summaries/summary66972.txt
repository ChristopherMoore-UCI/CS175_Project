-- A 39-year-old man in southern China died Saturday from what appears to be a contagious strain of avian flu, state media reported Saturday. Shenzhen borders Hong Kong, where more than 17,000 chickens were ordered culled on the same day that Chen was hospitalized. The man -- identified by Xinhua as a bus driver with the surname Chen -- was hospitalized in Shenzhen on December 21 as he battled a fever. That decision came after a chicken carcass tested positive for avian flu. As of mid-December, the World Health Organization calculated that 573 people had been infected -- and 336 had died -- after coming down with the H5N1 avian influenza virus since 2003.
