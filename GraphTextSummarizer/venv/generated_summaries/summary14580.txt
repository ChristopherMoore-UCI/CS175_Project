For Emmrich, who has won three men's doubles titles with a highest world ranking of 35th last year, the chance to play with her adds another dimension to touring life. "I thought, 'Uh-oh it's going to happen now, I can't believe it!' " recalls the Dutchwoman, younger sister of former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek. A former junior world No. 1 -- she won the U.S. Open girls' title in 2004 -- Krajicek is now ranked outside the top 200 after struggling with health problems in 2012-13, but was as high as 30th at the end of her teenage years. In a moment that Emmrich can only describe as "magic," Krajicek took his hand, hugged him and said yes -- to the cheers of joy ringing down from the stands. Krajicek says she had "no idea" how Emmrich and his few accomplices managed to surprise her.
