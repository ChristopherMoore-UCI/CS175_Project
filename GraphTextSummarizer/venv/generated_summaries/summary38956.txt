Klinsmann's first match will be a highly anticipated August 10 bout with Mexico, which thrashed the U.S. 4-2 in this year's Gold Cup final. Included are a 2-1 loss to Ghana in the second round of the 2010 World Cup, and blown 2-0 leads in the 2009 Confederations Cup final against Brazil and the Gold Cup final against Mexico in June. He also played for the West German national team that won the 1990 World Cup and the German squad that brought home 1996's European Championship. It's worth noting that Klinsmann coached American star Landon Donovan during a loan to Munich. Klinsmann told Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl last year that he believes Donovan "can play at the highest level" and thinks the 29-year-old midfielder could have excelled in Germany's Bundesliga had he been given more time.
