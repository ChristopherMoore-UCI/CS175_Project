Kontonis, who had earlier met new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, told Greek television that this weekend's games would be called off and that a meeting would be convened next Wednesday to see if progress had been made. Government acts Greek Super League president Giorgos Borovilos was summoned to a meeting Wednesday with Kontonis to discuss measures which could be put in place to tackle football violence. "We are at the beginning of the end... everyone must understand that soccer with violence, irrationality and savagery cannot continue any longer," said Deputy Sports Minister Stavros Kontonis, the Greek sports minister, told reporters. The players and officials of Super League leader Olympiakos were also pelted with various projectiles and flares amid ugly scenes. Following these incidents, the ruling Syriza Party has made its decision to impose a suspension, which will be the third team this season that Greek football has been halted.
