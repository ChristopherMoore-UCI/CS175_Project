In October, new police sketches were released of potential suspects in the case, and UK police appeared in a television appeal for information. -- Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal are looking at six more cases where a male intruder entered holiday villas where children were staying, police said Wednesday. When police appealed for information last month, they said witnesses described the intruder as being tanned with short, dark, unkempt hair. "These new cases are similar to a number of the originally identified (12 offenses) whereby a male intruder has gained access to holiday villas occupied by UK families in the Western Algarve," the force said. Madeleine's disappearance while on a family vacation in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz prompted headlines worldwide -- and remains a mystery.
