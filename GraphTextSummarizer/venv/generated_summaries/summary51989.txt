The office is bound to be a prime place for Olympics spoilers. You can probably divide your Facebook friends into "people who are likely to follow the Olympics" and "people who are not." Jobs give their workers Olympics days, right? What this means is that I have personally spoiled at least seven people's enjoyment of the Olympics by blabbing prematurely about who won what event. Switch to an older phone for the duration of the Olympics, preferably one that is decades old, is shaped like a brick and has a wan green display that can handle neither text messages nor the Internet.
