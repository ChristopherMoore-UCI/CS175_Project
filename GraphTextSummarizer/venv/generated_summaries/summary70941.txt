-- Another U.S. citizen has reportedly been detained by Pakistani authorities, according to a statement released Friday by the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. Relations between the United States and Pakistan were recently strained by the detention of Raymond Davis, an American accused of killing two Pakistani men. Davis appeared in a Pakistani court Friday, where he was given documents detailing the case against him. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat but later revealed that he is a CIA contractor. "We have seen press reports that an American citizen named Aaron Mark DeHaven has been detained by police in Peshawar," the statement noted.
