The social-networking company wants to be universally known by a new streamlined bird logo, replacing the scruffier bird that had symbolized Twitter since ... In rather flowery rhetoric, the post goes on to say, "Whether soaring high above the Earth to take in a broad view, or flocking with other birds to achieve a common purpose, a bird in flight is the ultimate representation of freedom, hope and limitless possibility." The company on Wednesday was urging developers to switch to the new logo -- although the Twitter icon in Apple's App Store was still showing the old bird. " In its post, Twitter says the new bird is "crafted purely from three sets of overlapping circles â€” similar to how your networks, interests and ideas connect and intersect with peers and friends." "Starting today you'll begin to notice a simplified Twitter bird," Twitter said in a blog post Wednesday.
