Researchers in North Carolina and Michigan have spent decades following kids who attend preschool and comparing them with control groups of kids who didn't. Kids who went to preschool in the mid-'60s were less likely to have been arrested several times by age 40, were more likely to have graduated from high school and were likely to earn more than non-pre-K kids studied. In 1972, Campbell's university began a project to track the success of a group of preschoolers and a similar control group of kids who were not given access to preschool. Yes, elite preschool admissions are perfectly absurd, but the benefits of preschool are seriously significant. " Perhaps the real impact of preschool is most visible in the lives of real people who attended decades ago and now are adults.
