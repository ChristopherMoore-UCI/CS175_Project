Most of the work being done in the shallow water off Louisiana now involves attempts to draw the remaining gas out of old wells or to shut down ones that are no longer profitable, said Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute in New Orleans. Workers on a production platform lost control of an aging gas well while trying to plug it on July 8, resulting in a leak of about 250 gallons of liquid natural gas. What remained Thursday was a small flame "fueled by residual gas at the top of the well," the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported. The accident happened when workers aboard the Hercules 265 hit an unexpected pocket of gas while preparing the well for production. Unlike the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010, which released millions of barrels of crude oil and gas at high pressures, this week's accident "is a much smaller blip on the horizon," he said.
