The city will continue to provide bottled water to residents at city hall until the water supply is restored. "Right now our water towers have no water in them at all," said Mayor Donald Kile. A combination of high water demand and old pipes caused major ruptures along waterlines and forced the city to resort to emergency procedures, Kile said. " In the meantime, Kile said the water supply could remain shut off for days while the towers refill. As temperatures soared to the triple-digits for the 37th consecutive day Sunday, city officials made an emergency decision to shut off the town's water supply.
