Asked if he was in love with Te'o, Tuiasosopo told host Phil McGraw: "I mean, yeah ... " Ludwig said it is possible that Tuiasosopo "actually did have a crush on Manti Te'o and was confused about his sexuality." "And the reason why he impersonated this woman was to see what it would feel like to be intimate with Manti Te'o, to be loved by Manti Te'o," she said. McGraw said his show had contacted private contractors for the FBI and the Secret Service, giving them a voice mail message that Tuiasosopo said he had left for Te'o. Last week, Te'o told talk show host Katie Couric that Tuiasosopo had called him the day the story broke to confess. " Finally, after learning that Te'o had Skyped with four women -- including two of his former girlfriends -- Tuiasosopo said he essentially killed off Lennay, having her die of leukemia.
