-- Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra is no longer in military custody, according to a highly placed source in the junta that took over Thailand in a coup d'etat last week. Those summoned include academics and one of Yingluck's chief opponents, "Yellow Shirt" movement leader Sondhi Limthongkul. On Saturday, a number of major TV stations were back on air, including MCOT, TPBS and NBT. The armed forces seized power in a coup Thursday after months of turmoil that paralyzed much of the government and caused deadly clashes in Bangkok.
