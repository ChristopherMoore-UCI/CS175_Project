Eric Holder's legacy Holder has discussed his plans to step down personally with the President on multiple occasions in recent months, and finalized those plans in an hour-long conversation with Obama at the White House residence over Labor Day weekend, an Obama administration official said. "In the months ahead I will leave the Department of Justice," Holder said at the White House, thanking President Barack Obama for the "greatest honor of my professional life." "I particularly appreciate how Attorney General Holder has restored the Civil Rights Division to its historical mission," Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said. Obama stood next to Holder in the White House State Dining Room, praising the first African-American to serve as attorney general and who made civil rights and equal rights central components to his tenure at Justice. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Thursday that he will resign after six years at the helm of the Justice Department.
