" Since AC Milan forward Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch in a friendly match in January following racist abuse, both FIFA and UEFA have faced criticism over their reactions to such incidents. He will be meeting Boateng at FIFA headquarters in Zurich this Friday to discuss the problem of racism in football. Last month, Inter was fined $65,500 by the Italian football authorities after its fans were found guilty of racially abusing former players Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari, who now play for rival AC Milan. In January, the president of football's world governing body FIFA insisted that a more hard-line approach should be taken in dealing with racism. Lazio had already been fined a total of $230,000 for racist abuse and other fan offenses during two group-stage matches with Tottenham and another against Slovenia's Maribor.
