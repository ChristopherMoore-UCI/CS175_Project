-- A second round of talks Thursday between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leaders were fruitless, but both parties decided to keep talking. Hundreds of protesters, who have been clashing with police in the capital, Kiev, since Sunday heard from boxer-turned-opposition-leader Vitaly Klitschko after the talks with Yanukovych. "He said no to his resignation and cabinet resignation." Ukrainian anti-government protesters observed a truce of several hours with police to give the negotiations room for success. Ukraine's national union of journalists called on the Interior Ministry on Wednesday to issue an order forbidding police from using violence against journalists. A separate Interior Ministry order allowing riot police to use firearms came into force Tuesday, according to the official Ukrainian legislation website.
