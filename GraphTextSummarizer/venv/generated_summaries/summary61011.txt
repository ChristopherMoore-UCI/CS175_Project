That warning comes from my friend Kevin Sabet, a former senior adviser on drug control policy under President Barack Obama. With a referendum on marijuana scheduled in 2014 in Alaska and action likely in coming years in California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon, half the states in the union may soon allow the sale of marijuana to almost anybody determined to buy it. At the end of August, the administration that Sabet served announced a retreat on marijuana policy. "Reefer Sanity" is the best explication I've seen of the errors on which the case for marijuana legalization has been built. It will allow the states of Washington and Colorado to proceed with the legal retailing of marijuana.
