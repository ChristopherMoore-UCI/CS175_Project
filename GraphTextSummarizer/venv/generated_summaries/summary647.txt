"Spirit Airlines empowers customers to save money on air travel by offering ultra low base fares with a range of optional services, allowing customers the freedom to choose only the extras they value," says Spirit Airlines. To the rescue of those of us sick of paying baggage fees comes Jaktogo, a company with an innovative way to pull one over on "the man" -- wearable luggage. Would you slap on a Jaktogo if it meant avoiding luggage fees? There are a few other "luggage jackets" on the market -- Stuffa Jacket, Rufus Roo, etc -- but Jaktogo appears to be the leader in capacity. Adios, luggage fees.
