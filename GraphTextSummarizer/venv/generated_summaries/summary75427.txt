Chepkurgor, now 39, first made his intentions known when all three Clintons visited East Africa in 2000. CNN's Fareed Zakaria, the session's moderator, commented that given the economic crisis at hand, Chepkurgor's dowry was "not a bad offer." He renewed it Thursday after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked about the proposal at a Nairobi town hall session. The audience laughed, but Clinton's comments were no joke to Chepkurgor, who described the younger Clinton as a "beautiful, disciplined and well-natured woman. In Kenya, a man proposes with dowry for the prospective bride, Chepkurgor explained.
