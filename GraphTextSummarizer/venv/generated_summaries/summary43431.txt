The brunt of the storm stretched from Oklahoma to eastern Tennessee and down to southern Mississippi on Friday afternoon, bringing snow, sleet, freezing drizzle or rain. By Friday afternoon the storm was either in or on its way to parts of Virginia, West Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas. Although the snow didn't appear to be sticking, it was expected to form ice in the evening on bridges and overpasses, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. He said rain was on tap for Atlanta, Georgia, but the precipitation was to move northeastward and evolve into snow by the time it reaches Virginia and West Virginia. -- A major winter storm with heavy snow and ice was heading from Texas and Oklahoma to points east, with 8 to 10 inches of snow possible in some locales, the National Weather Service said Friday.
