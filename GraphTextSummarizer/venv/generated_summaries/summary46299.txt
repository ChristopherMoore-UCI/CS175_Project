I'm not sure when the meaning of the word went from someone with the talent and life journey of Price to the cast of "The Real Housewives of (insert city here)," but I know its erosion epitomizes all that is wrong with pop culture today: I long for the day when phrases such as "good taste" or "well-mannered" are uttered, let alone displayed, by the people we refer to as divas today. True divas don't need to self-promote. Kanye West is "a creative genius," but the fact that he repeatedly needs to tell people that makes him more of an anti-diva. If being a talentless bad girl is what pays the bills, fine ... but we never used to refer to these train wrecks as "divas." If it sounds as if I'm blowing things out of proportion, consider this: There is a reality TV show called "R&B Divas" with a cast filled with one-hit wonders.
