"It is a thrill to be able to tell the story about cheetah conservation and to educate Dallas Zoo guests about this magnificent species," said Sean Green, vice president of Guest Experiences for the Dallas Zoo. "Winspear and Kamau will become important animal ambassadors for the Dallas Zoo, building appreciation and awareness about cheetahs to more than 900,000 visitors each year." Before their new adventure, a team from the zoo spent nearly two weeks in Virginia bonding with the cubs. Zoo officials believe the Labrador retriever will keep the cubs in line as they grow up away from the wilderness. -- The Dallas Zoo has two new cheetah cubs.
