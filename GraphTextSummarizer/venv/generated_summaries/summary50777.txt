Hargis is one of 14 troops injured during a night combat operation in the Zhari district of Kandahar province, Afghanistan, on October 6. While the photo continues to circulate around social media, Hargis is recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. Josh was immediately pushed through a series of surgeries and emerged hours later into an intensive care unit here at our base in Afghanistan. A military spokeswoman confirmed that Hargis was awarded the medal while hospitalized in Afghanistan. As the assault force reacted to the initial blast, they were struck by a series of explosions, killing four soldiers, including two Army Rangers.
