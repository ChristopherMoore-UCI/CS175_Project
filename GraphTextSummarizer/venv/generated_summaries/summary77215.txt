The two newcomers join a cast of high-profile voice actors that already includes Ben Kingsley as noble panther Bagheera, Lupita Nyong'o as mother wolf Raksha, Idris Elba as wicked tiger Shere Khan, and Scarlett Johansson as the hypnotic snake Kaa. This time around, Esposito will voice Akela, the leader of the wolf pack that adopts human child Mowgli (played in the film by 10-year-old first-time actor Neel Sethi). Walken is set to voice the ape monarch King Louie, a part sure to be as flamboyant as his upcoming turn in NBC's "Peter Pan Live."
