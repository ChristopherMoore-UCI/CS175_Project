A group called National Popular Vote also is lobbying state legislatures to adopt a system where all of a state's electoral votes would be pledged to the winner of the national popular vote -- an idea which, if adopted by states holding a majority of electoral votes, would ensure that the popular vote winner always became president. Under the Constitution, each state gets a number of electoral votes equal to its representation in Congress, including both representatives and senators. On the other side of the divide, Democrats argue that California shouldn't make such a change when the vast majority of other states still operate under a winner-take-all system. And the change won't go into effect in Maryland until it gains approval in enough states to ensure that the popular vote winner would take the White House. Opponents call the proposal an attempt to grab Democratic votes.
