Facebook will be switching profile pages, perhaps optionally at first, to a new format called "Facebook Timeline." And an even smaller percentage of Facebook users have discovered, like I did, that you can enable the new "Facebook Timeline" profile page right now so you're prepared for the launch. I'm so glad I did: Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made. Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebook's 90-minute announcement of the new profile pages last week. While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning, or what time you left for work, or where you had lunch, Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events, discards the irrelevant ones, finds the most emotive, the most visual, the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus.
