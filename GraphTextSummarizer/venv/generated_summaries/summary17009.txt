Racism became a major issue in the NFL last year after the Miami Dolphins suspended offensive lineman Richie Incognito for detrimental conduct following allegations of misconduct from teammate Jonathan Martin. " Last December, shortly after the Incognito story broke, Fritz Pollard called on NFL players to stop using the 'N-word'. Incognito's lawyer said the report is replete with errors, adding: "The truth....is that Jonathan Martin was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' Offensive line," said Attorney Mark Schamel, in a statement to CNN. An independent investigation found continuing threats and verbal and physical abuse, text messages, racial slurs and vulgar sexual comments made about Martin's mother and sister by Incognito and some of his Dolphins teammates. That's the proposal on the table when the NFL's Competitions Committee meets next week, as the body considers penalizing players for using abusive language during games.
