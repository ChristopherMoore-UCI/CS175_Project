City bounced back from Sunday's 3-2 home defeat to beat Newcastle 3-1 and keep the pressure on leading club Manchester United. "Northumbria Police has received a report of racist language having been used at the St James' Park stadium during the Newcastle United vs. Manchester City match today," the police said in a statement. Last weekend's Manchester derby was marred by a coin attack on United player Rio Ferdinand, a pitch invasion by a supporter and arrests of other fans for alleged racist abuse. It is the latest in a series of racism controversies going back more than a year, involving top players such as Chelsea's former England captain John Terry and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez. Struggling Sunderland rallied with a 72nd-minute goal from former United striker Frazier Campbell, but Alex Ferguson's team held on to guarantee they will be top of the table come Christmas -- and the title has gone to the team in that position for the past three seasons.
