-- Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose White House aspirations went into a nose dive last summer, clinched the Republican Party's presidential nomination Tuesday night with a sweep of GOP contests in four states. " Both Clinton, the New York senator and former first lady, and Obama, the first-term senator from Illinois, called McCain on Tuesday night, campaign officials said. He said McCain would need to make the case that "I'm going to grow this economy; Barack or Hillary, they're going to grow government." McCain had amassed 1,047 delegates before Tuesday, according to CNN estimates. Bush came back in South Carolina amid a divisive and bitter campaign that left McCain denouncing leaders of the party's religious conservative wing as "agents of intolerance," and Bush went on to win the presidency. Obama told McCain he looks forward to running against him in the fall, campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said.
