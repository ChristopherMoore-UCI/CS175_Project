Israel has never published a list of banned items, but it has refused to allow into Gaza books, paper, blankets and reconstruction materials. -- The deaths of several people Monday during a raid by Israeli soldiers on a flotilla bringing aid to Palestinians in Gaza has once again brought worldwide attention on Israel's blockade of the area. Audrey Bomse, legal adviser to the Free Gaza Movement, told CNN the group did not believe the Israelis would let the cargo into Gaza, and that the cargo also included reconstruction aid which Israel does not allow into Gaza. Israel says it allows enough humanitarian aid -- including food and medicines -- into Gaza for the people who live there and that the blockade is designed to stop Hamas from building or acquiring arms. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said Israeli civilians were plagued a year ago by rockets and missiles fired from Gaza that originated in places like Iran and Syria.
