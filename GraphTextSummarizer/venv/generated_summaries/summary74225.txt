Pork dishes are relatively hard to find across the mostly Muslim Indonesian archipelago, but Bali's famed suckling pig makes any roaming traveler's wait worthwhile. "The skin is served crispy and the meat is always tender -- they also offer a special that is served with rice and spicy soup which is delicious." Lawar Lawar is a crunch-tender mix of vegetables, grated coconut meat and minced meat mixed with various heady herbs and spices, and often fresh blood -- every village has its own version. While Bali Asli occasionally makes the chicken version, a good spot to sample the succulent duck dish is at German chef Heinz van Holzen's long-running Bumbu Bali (Jalan Pratama, Tanjung Benoa). Chef Penny Williams from Bali Asli (Jalan Raya Gelumpang, Gelumpang, Amlapura) explains that the duck is first rubbed with tamarind puree and salt to purify any "ducky" aromas and tenderize the meat. "This place is always packed," Meyrick says, adding that the variety of dishes accompanying the lawar are excellent.
