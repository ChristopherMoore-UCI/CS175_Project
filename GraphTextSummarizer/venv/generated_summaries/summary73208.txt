Initial results from a CDC and Food and Drug Administration investigation found that jalape単o peppers appeared to be a major carrier of the bacteria, as were serrano peppers, Tauxe said. The FDA said the contaminated jalape単o and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, were no longer in circulation and said Thursday that it was lifting its advice to avoid eating raw jalape単o and serrano peppers grown, harvested or packed in Mexico. "The number of reported cases has been dropping since early July," and the number has appeared to return to around the typical number of salmonella cases expected during this time of year, said Dr. Robert Tauxe, the deputy director of the CDC Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases. Contaminated jalape単o and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, are no longer in circulation, the FDA said. They found contaminated serrano peppers and irrigation systems at another farm in that same region.
