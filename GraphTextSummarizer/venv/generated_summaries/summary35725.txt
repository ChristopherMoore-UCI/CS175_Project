-- The goal of "BioShock Infinite," creative director Ken Levine said, was to have "moved the ball down the field" in terms of how video games can be vehicles for telling engrossing, expansive stories. In previous games, this was an either/or venture, so it is nice to be able to mix and match your attacks to whatever you choose. The first was during a tense situation early in the game where Elizabeth is trying to understand what's going on and why people were fighting over her. The nice addition for combat is making vigors and weapons dual-wieldable. Of course, Elizabeth is key to the Prophet's plan to bring judgment on the sinners below, so Booker's time in Columbia is not going to be an easy one.
