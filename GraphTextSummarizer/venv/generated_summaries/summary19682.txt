Petra Kvitova made a convincing start to her bid for back-to-back grand slams with the loss of just one game in seeing off Kristina Mladenovic of France Tuesday at Flushing Meadows. But 20th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova made an early exit to Marina Erakovic of New Zealand on the 10th anniversary of the Russian's 2004 triumph at Flushing Meadows. The Wimbledon champion has come into the U.S. Open after a morale boosting victory in the preceding New Haven tournament and again looked impressive. Former world number one Ana Ivanovic, seeded eighth, opened her campaign with a 6-3 6-0 win over American Alison Riske. The Serbian has won three titles in 2014 and beat top ranked Serena Williams in the fourth round of the Australian Open on the way to the last eight, her career transformed last year after a form slump.
