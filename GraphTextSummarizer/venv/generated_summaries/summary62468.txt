Rosberg had raised hopes he could take pole ahead of Hamilton by being fastest in third practice and then in the opening two sessions of final qualifying. With his 35th career pole, Hamilton relegated Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg to second on the grid as he bids for his fourth straight win of the season. It left him 15th on the grid, while teammate Daniel Ricciardo of Australia again impressed by claiming third spot, although over a second slower on his lap than Hamilton. " Jenson Button for McLaren, Felipe Massa in the second Williams and Nico Hulkenberg for Sauber, who narrowly missed out on final qualifying, round out the top 10. Victory in Sunday's race would see Hamilton leapfrog Rosberg in the world title standings and would be his first at the Circuit of Catalunya.
