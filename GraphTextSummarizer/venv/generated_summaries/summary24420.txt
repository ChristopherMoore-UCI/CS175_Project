Rory McIlroy was in a brutally reflective mood in the words he chose to describe his opening round in the British Open The world no.2 carded an eight-over-par round of 79 as the world's golfing giants made their first forays on Scotland's testing Muirfield course. McIlroy lost his top ranking to Tiger Woods in March and the Northern Ireland golfer is still searching for his first win in 2013, having only chosen to enter seven tournaments before the Open. U.S Open winner Justin Rose finished on four over par after carding a 75 which included just a single birdie on the 17th hole. McIlroy faced questions about his dubious form on the eve of the Open with suggestions his high-profile relationships with Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki was a distraction. The 24-year-old's slump in form has also been linked to his switch to Nike equipment this year in a deal reported to be worth $250m. McIlroy struggled to the turn at Muirfield in one over before two painful double-bogeys and four bogeys on the back nine left him searching for answers.
