So I started haunting secondhand book shops and picking up the Parker novels and just completely fell in love with them. But Stark was a pseudonym of legendary author Donald Westlake, who continued writing about Parker's criminal exploits in more than two dozen books until his death in 2008. More recently, Parker has found new life in a series of imaginative and stylish graphic novels from Eisner Award-winning artist and writer Darwyn Cooke. At that time the Parker novels were out of print, but I happened to see the Lee Marvin film "Point Blank," which is one of my favorite movies, and realized later that it came from the Parker books. In re-imagining Parker -- starting with "The Hunter" in 2009, followed by "The Outfit" and now "The Score" -- Cooke has stayed incredibly faithful to Westlake's original novels.
