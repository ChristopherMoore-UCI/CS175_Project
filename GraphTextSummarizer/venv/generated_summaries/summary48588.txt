Home security cameras could be disabled by someone who wanted to break in, or they could be turned into remote surveillance devices. Computers and phones are still popular targets, but increasingly so are cars, home security systems, TVs and even oil refineries. That was the message at this year's Black Hat and DefCon computer security conferences, which took place last week in Las Vegas. Smart home security devices have the potential to cause the most damage if hacked, and two separate demonstrations showed how to break in by opening "smart" front-door locks. Computers and phones act as tracking devices and leak information constantly, according to O'Connor.
