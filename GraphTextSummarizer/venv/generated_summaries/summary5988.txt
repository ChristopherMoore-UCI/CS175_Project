Rodriguez follows World Cup winner Toni Kroos to the Bernabeu -- the Germany midfielder was bought for a reported $34 million from Bayern Munich last week. Rodriguez even caught the attention of NBA star and avid football fan LeBron James. After beating Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final last season, Real Madrid will want to ensure it keeps up its trophy-winning ways. Former Monaco chief executive and technical director Tor-Kristian Karlsen, who has regularly scouted players from Latin America, says Rodriguez is right up there with the world's best. Rodriguez joined Monaco last year for a fee of $60.8 million and scored 10 goals in 38 appearances as the French club finished runner-up to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1.
