President Bashir Al-Assad's forces killed 17-year old Ali while he was driving his motorbike during the first day of the battle for Al Bab last month. Dozens of YouTube videos show citizens of Al Bab gathering in the thousands, organizing themselves in mass prayers for those who have died. About 120 people from Al Bab -- a city in the north of Syria not far from Aleppo -- have been killed since the beginning of the conflict. Now the airstrikes are not only killing people originally from Al Bab, but also those displaced by violence in Homs and Hama who are seeking refuge in the city.
