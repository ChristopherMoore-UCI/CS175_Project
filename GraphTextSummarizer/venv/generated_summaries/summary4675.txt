Police arrested 17-year-old Sami Ullah in Karachi after receiving a complaint from the local board of education, said Karachi police official Qudrat Shah Lodhi. -- Police have arrested a Pakistani teenager accused of writing insulting comments about Muslim prophet Mohammed in a school exam, a senior police official said. Ullah -- the latest Pakistani to be accused of blasphemy -- is a Muslim, according to police. It's not clear why it took months for the board of education's complaint against Ullah to reach police. Ullah has apologized for his comments and begged the court for leniency, police said.
