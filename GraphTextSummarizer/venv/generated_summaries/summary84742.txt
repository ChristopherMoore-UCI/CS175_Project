Monday was the highest-grossing online shopping day in U.S. history, with spending reaching $1.25 billion, according to market research firm comScore. However, online spending on Cyber Monday still outpaced Black Friday by a healthy margin, the research says. Analysts have begun providing their final tallies for Cyber Monday sales, which found that people piled more in their virtual shopping carts than ever before. With a 26% jump over last year, the day after Thanksgiving saw the highest increase in spending compared to 2010 than any other period in November, according to comScore. Online shopping for the month of November has hit $15 billion, a 15% increase compared to last year, comScore says.
