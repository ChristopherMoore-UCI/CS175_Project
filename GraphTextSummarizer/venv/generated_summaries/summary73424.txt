U.N. peacekeeper force commander General Martin Luther Agwai I wasn't too worried yet, we'd made it to Darfur and we'd be with U.N. peacekeepers, UNAMID and for the most part out of the way of government officials. Rebels with a taste for cash turning to banditry when money handouts dried up. For example, rebels recruit in aid camps. We felt for General Agwai.
