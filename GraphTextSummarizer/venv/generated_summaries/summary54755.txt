But the decision was made to transfer it to Japan -- along with several other such large pumps, from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation. "I use the pump every day at the river site, but they're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day," said Jerry Ashmore, the owner of Ashmore Concrete Contractors that supplies concrete for the Savannah River facility. Ashmore didn't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to Japan, though he understood its first mission will be to pump water into the stricken facility's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material. The big pump, one of a handful of such trucks built by the the German company Putzmeister, appears to be tailor-made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment. Eventually, nuclear waste is to be disposed of here.
