On the day that Japan bumped up the seriousness of its nuclear accident from a Level 5 to a Level 7 priority, on par with the Chernobyl disaster, a Senate committee heard from U.S. environmental officials, scientists and NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko. "As we've seen in Japan, nuclear events tend to develop over a long period of time," said Jaczko. "All of the data that we have seen, which we continue to make public and available on our website, indicates that while radiation levels are slightly elevated in some places, they are significantly below problematic levels." "It is not yet, however, what we believe to be stable: namely that given additional events or other circumstances ... there would not be the potential for significant additional problems at the reactors." Thus, Jaczko said, the focus is "on these efforts to transition from static to stable to ensure (the) long-term ... ability to cool the reactors and to provide cooling for the spent fuel pools. " California Sen. Barbara Boxer's state has a number of nuclear plants in areas with high seismic activity near millions of people.
