In response to the question, "Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people," just 19% of millennials say most people can be trusted, compared with 31% of Generation Xers, 37% of the silent generation and 40% of boomers. However, since non-whites make up a bigger portion of the millennials than in older generations, their overwhelming preference for a more activist government will sway future elections even more than recent ones. A quality of millennials that leaps out from the survey is their deep mistrust of other people. White millennials disapprove by almost the same margin. By a margin of 52% to 39%, white millennials prefer a smaller government that offers fewer services to a bigger government that offers more.
