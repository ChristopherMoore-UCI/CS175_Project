"Their refusal to redefine marriage for all states is a major setback for those seeking to redefine natural marriage," said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. At the same time, the high court declined to make a sweeping statement on the broader issue of same-sex marriage rights nationwide, rejecting California's same-sex marriage ban but leaving intact laws banning such marriages in 35 other states. Opponents of same-sex marriage saw both peril and promise in the rulings, expressing dismay in the court's decision on the Defense of Marriage Act but taking some comfort in the decision not to dismantle same-sex marriage bans nationwide. In addition to restoring same-sex marriage in California, the decisions will eventually allow same-sex couples in states where they're legally allowed to marry to apply for retirement, survivor and other benefits as married couples. But, he told CNN's iReport, "As soon as I read some of the news articles describing the decision, it sucked for us and for the majority of same-sex couples living in states with state marriage bans."
