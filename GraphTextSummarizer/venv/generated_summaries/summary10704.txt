Relatives in New Jersey had received alarming texts from Ciancia before the shootings and raised concerns with local police, who had asked Los Angeles police to check on his welfare. -- A federal grand jury on Tuesday charged Paul Ciancia with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a Transportation Security Administration officer at Los Angeles International Airport. Three charges based on the killing of Hernandez -- first-degree murder, violence at an international airport that resulted in death and using a firearm to murder and cause death -- carry possible sentences of life in federal prison or the death penalty. Police missed Ciancia by "a matter of minutes" on the day of the shooting, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN. Investigators say Ciancia, 23, killed TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounded two other agents and a passenger in what appeared to be an orchestrated assault on members of the federal agency responsible for airport security.
