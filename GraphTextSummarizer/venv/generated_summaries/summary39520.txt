It's a testament to the fans and their dedication for Doctor Who," said Soumya Sriraman, EVP Home Entertainment and Licensing, BBC Worldwide North America. On limited Saturday screenings, the show racked up $204,000 in the U.S. box office and $2.9 million at the UK box office. In fact, the BBC's cult favorite show was the No. 2 movie in America on Monday, behind only The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. "It's incredible that Doctor Who has made history once again, setting record numbers across the board on BBC America, in social media, and now in theaters. And don't forget: This screening was two days after the episode had already premiered on BBC America, so most fans had already seen it.
