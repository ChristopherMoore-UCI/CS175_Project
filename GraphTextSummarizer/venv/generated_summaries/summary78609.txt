Despite her worries about leaving her friends, Leslie said "I'm ready" to face the future as the series signed off (along with a tribute to late producer Harris Wittels). Donna started a foundation after checking off everything on her bucket list; Craig found love with Ron's barber; Jean-Ralphio went on the run after faking his death; April and Andy had kids; Tom wrote a popular book about all his failures; Gary was mayor of Pawnee for decades before dying on his 100th birthday; Ron was put in charge of his own national park. There was also plenty of discussion on social media about #WafflesAcrossAmerica, as the show frequently had characters gathered at JJ's Diner, where they would enjoy the breakfast staple. Another flash-forward showed that Leslie served two terms as governor (and Gary's funeral implied that either she or Ben became president). The show's finale was widely praised on social media and may someday rank as one of the best finales of all time.
