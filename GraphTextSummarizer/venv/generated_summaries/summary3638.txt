"A nuclear-armed Iran is dangerous to world peace, is dangerous to our region, is dangerous to Israel. Herzog, in a speech almost immediately after Netanyahu's address to Congress, promised to work with the United States and European powers, not against, to ensure the safety of Israel. As leader of Israel, I will never accept a nuclear-armed Iran. Before the election, the issue of a nuclear Iran garnered international headlines as it further aggravated tense relations between the White House and Netanyahu. Herzog believes it is his destiny to be the next prime minister of Israel.
