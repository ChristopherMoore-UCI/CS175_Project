-- A medical marijuana advocate turned write-in candidate for Rhode Island governor has garnered instant social media attention by smoking what she says is pot in a campaign video. 'I like weed, and I'm a good person' Both Obama and Clinton have now said states should be able to carry forward with medical marijuana, as Armstrong says she uses. Ballot initiatives in Colorado and Washington state paved the way for legalization there for adults over 21. But her media stunt comes with a more serious political message about pot legalization. Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico and Libertarian 2012 presidential candidate, has long been an advocate for pot legalization.
