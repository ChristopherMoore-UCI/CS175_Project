"I am very, very happy," said Manuel Luis Ferreira, attorney for Wright, 68, who was found in Portugal in September after more than 40 years in hiding. "They made the right decision and this is correct," he told CNN affiliate RTP Portugal. In conjunction with the Department of Justice, we will review the court's decision and consult with Portuguese authorities to determine a path forward that results in Mr. Wright's return to the United States." Wright escaped from prison in 1970 while serving a 15- to 30-year sentence for murder after he and another man shot and killed a World War II veteran in a 1962 gas station robbery in Farmingdale, New Jersey. "George Wright is a convicted murderer guilty of an extremely serious crime which falls squarely within the terms of our bilateral extradition treaty with Portugal," the department said in a statement.
