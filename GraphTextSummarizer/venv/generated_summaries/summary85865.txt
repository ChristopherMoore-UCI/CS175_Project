"The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the Governments of the United States of America and Cuba to establish diplomatic relations, with the aim of overcoming, in the interest of the citizens of both countries, the difficulties which have marked their recent history," the Vatican Secretary of State wrote in a statement Wednesday. Relations between the Vatican and Cuba, strained during the 49-year rule of communist dictator Fidel Castro, have improved since Raul Castro replaced his sickly brother as the island nation's president. Francis Rooney, the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See from 2005 to 2008, said that top Catholic officials, including current Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, regularly lobbied American envoys to relax the economic embargo on Cuba. Pope Francis -- the Catholic Church's first Latin American pontiff -- celebrated his birthday Wednesday with a major geopolitical wish granted: The end of a half-century of frozen relations between the United States and Cuba. In addition, the Holy See's former ambassador to Cuba, Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu, is now a high-level diplomat at the Vatican.
