A bomb exploded outside Greece's parliament building in central Athens on Saturday evening, a blast near a national landmark that unnerved the country. Authorities closed off part of the boulevards in front of parliament and on the eastern side of the building before an explosive device detonated inside an installation for garbage disposal. There were no casualties in the blast, and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told reporters that Greeks would not be intimidated by such acts. Police were alerted immediately after the Eleftherotypia newspaper received a call saying a bomb was placed in an open area outside of parliament. Later, a caller phoned a police emergency line and said one bomb was placed outside of parliament and another inside the Hotel Grande Bretagne near parliament.
