The family home is in Louchats, a village of fewer than 1,000 residents about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Bordeaux, in the Landes forest, in southwestern France. Police found the bodies of five infants in a home near Bordeaux, France, according to news reports. The mother, 35, was hospitalized at Pellegrin Hospital in Bordeaux for gynecological and psychiatric examinations, the French television channel BFMTV reported. The country's worst case of infanticide was in 2010 when a mother in the village of Villers-au-Tertre in northwestern France was found to have killed eight of her babies. Officials with the Bordeaux prosecutor's office were scheduled to hold a press conference Friday afternoon.
