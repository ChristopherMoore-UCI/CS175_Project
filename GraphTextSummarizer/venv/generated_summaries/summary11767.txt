Argentina, which was beaten by West Germany 1-0 at the 1990 World Cup, rallied briefly but failed to find an equalizer. The nation which had ripped Brazil's dreams to shreds in the semifinals, won its fourth World Cup after a tense 1-0 victory over Argentina Sunday. Few could begrudge Germany this success -- it has been the team of the 2014 World Cup. Having seen Argentina contrive to miss two wonderful opportunities, perhaps those in German shirts believed this would be their night. Germany, having scored seven in its previous game against Brazil, began to wake from its slumber and only a fine save from Romero prevented Kroos' fierce drive from nestling in the corner.
