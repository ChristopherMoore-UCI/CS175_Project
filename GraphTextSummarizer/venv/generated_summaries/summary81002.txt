The Israeli air force conducted a strike in Lebanon between Beirut and Sidon on Friday, a day after rockets struck northern Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces said Friday. The IDF described the launch of rockets targeting Israel as a "terrorist aggression originating from Lebanese territory." The Israeli attack comes in response to an attack Thursday in which four rockets were fired from southern Lebanon at northern Israel, with two of them landing in populated areas, the Israel Defense Forces said. There were no casualties in the Israeli strike, which stirred memories of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group. Popular Front official Abu Imad Ramez Mustafa confirmed the Israeli raid, adding that "the raid targeted the valley and did not target PFLP sites.
