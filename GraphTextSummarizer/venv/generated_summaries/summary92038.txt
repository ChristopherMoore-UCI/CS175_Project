Ni Dhulchaointigh, a design student at the Royal College of Art in London at the time, had been messing around in the workshop, trying out new combinations of materials when she started mixing silicone adhesive and wood-waste into small balls. It was only as she began using bits of the material around her home to repair things that she had what she calls her "eureka moment" and came to realize its real usefulness and application. so I started using the leftovers around my house just to fix little things, I modified a kitchen knife that was really uncomfortable. Thousands of people have posted comments and pictures on Twitter, YouTube and other websites showing how they have put the material to good use. "I thought, that's random," says Ni Dhulchaointigh, who admits many other designers might have then left it at that.
