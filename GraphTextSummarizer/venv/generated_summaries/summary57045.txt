Cuban officials have said they want to negotiate Gross' case with representatives of the United States in conjunction with the fates of three Cuban intelligence operatives serving lengthy sentences in U.S. prisons. -- When Alan Gross reaches his 65th birthday next month, he will tell himself that it will be the last one he spends in a Cuban prison cell, Gross' attorney said Wednesday. But U.S. officials have called that effort blackmail and said the cases are separate matters because Gross was not working as a spy in Cuba. But Cuban authorities say Gross was part of a plot to create "a Cuban spring" and destabilize the island's single-party communist government. "He was arrested, he was convicted, he was sentenced to 15 years in confinement, and to date, our government has done virtually nothing to obtain his release." Earlier this month, Gross embarked on a nine-day hunger strike after reports surfaced that after his arrest, USAID had tried to create "a Cuban Twitter" using cellphone text messaging services on the island.
