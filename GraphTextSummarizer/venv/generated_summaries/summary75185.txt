Most flu patients should not go to an emergency room, said Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Patients with normal flu symptoms should get a lot of rest and take painkillers to help with muscle aches, Zich said. It won't help to take Tamiflu or Relenza as a preventative, because they are designed to treat symptoms, Zich said. That would include people younger than 2 or older than 64; those with chronic diseases; patients with suppressed immune systems; and people of Native American or Alaskan Native heritage, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If a patient is short of breath or can't keep fluids down because of nausea, these are signs of a problem that needs immediate attention, Zich said.
