The top three Republican leaders in the House released a statement saying they were prepared to remove the contentious payroll issue from a bill that would also extend unemployment benefits and prevent a fee cut to Medicare doctors -- known as the "doc fix" -- in order to "protect small businesses and our economy from the consequences of Washington Democrats' political games." "Unfortunately, to date, Democrats have refused virtually every spending cut proposed -- insisting on job-threatening tax hikes on small businesses and job creators -- and with respect to the need for an extension of the payroll tax cut, time is running short," said the statement from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-California. In a sharp turnaround, House Republican leaders Monday dropped a key demand that the cost of extending the payroll tax cut be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. In the past, House GOP leaders have often struggled to get rank-and-file conservative members to go along with their decisions on spending issues -- particularly when related to negotiations with Democrats. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney insisted Monday there was time for Congress to work out a comprehensive agreement that would extend both the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance. Those talks would also include potential cost offsets for the payroll tax cut extension, even if it has already passed, the GOP leaders said in their statement.
