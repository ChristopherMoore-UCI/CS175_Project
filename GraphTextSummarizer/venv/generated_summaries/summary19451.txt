Chinese authorities have stepped up security measures in Xinjiang following several recent attacks in the region, which has been the scene of ethnic strife between the indigenous Uyghurs, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim population, and Han Chinese. -- Nine terror suspects were killed and another was captured in the volatile northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang on Friday, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing police. Waves of Han Chinese have flocked to the resource-rich region, fueling tensions with the Uyghurs, who regard themselves as culturally and ethnically closer the people of nations bordering western China, such as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. On Monday, a gang wielding knives and axes killed and injured dozens of people in southern Xinjiang, Xinhua reported. Xinjiang is now home to more than 8 million Han Chinese, up from 220,000 in 1949, and 10 million Uyghurs.
