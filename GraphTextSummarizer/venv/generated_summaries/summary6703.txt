In 2007, Manchester United fans were injured after violence in two separate incidents with Roma fans when the teams met in Rome. -- A fan of English football club Arsenal has been injured after the bus he and other supporters were traveling in was ambushed before the sides' Champions League clash in Rome, Wednesday night. Roma fans nearby set about attacking the bus, the spokesman said. A spokesman from the British Embassy in Rome told CNN the fan was understood to have suffered wounds to the leg -- but it was unsure if he had been stabbed or injured by broken glass. The booklet warned supporters to stay clear of areas that were known gathering points of Roma's "Ultra" fans -- a group known for creating conflict with rival supporters.
