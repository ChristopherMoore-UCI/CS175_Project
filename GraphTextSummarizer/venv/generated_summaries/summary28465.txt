"Michael would want us to continue on," Jackson said, after he unveiled an exhibit of his brother's wax statues at Madame Tussauds in Hollywood. It featured wax figures depicting him as a child performing with the Jackson 5, as the "Smooth Criminal" from around 1987 and the "This Is It" Michael Jackson of his last year. -- Michael Jackson's brothers are working on a reunion tour to perform their old Jackson 5 songs, Jermaine Jackson said Monday.
