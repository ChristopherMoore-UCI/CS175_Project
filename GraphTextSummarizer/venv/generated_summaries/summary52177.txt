Arment has said, in his optimistic view, that the recent developments at Apple could introduce more people to the concept of article inboxes, and when they want more powerful features, maybe they'll buy Instapaper. So to attract new users, Readability began offering its news-inbox service for free starting Tuesday evening. However, Ziade sees Apple's moves as competition, but he said Apple leaves an opening for other apps to flourish because the Safari tools won't work on every platform. The app should be available in Apple's App Store, also for free, as early as this week, and people will be able to subscribe through the app, Readability co-founder Richard Ziade said in a phone interview. Readability is in one of several services, which also includes Instapaper and the venture-capital-backed Read It Later, for bookmarking a lengthy article to revisit when in a more leisurely setting.
