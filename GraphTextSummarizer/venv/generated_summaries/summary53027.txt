As they acquired more land, they entered the ranks of the highest nobility and a series of deaths and inheritances saw the German-born Prince William I  found the House of Orange Nassau in the mid 16th century. In 1795 the last Dutch stadtholder, Prince Willem V, was forced to flee to England when the French invaded. The area remained part of the French Republic, and later Napoleonic Empire, until 1815, when Prince Willem V's son established the Netherlands, becoming King Willem I. Queen Beatrix, now 71, married the German diplomat Claus von Amsberg, a source of protests at the time as he had served in the German Wehrmacht during World War II, in 1966 and they had three sons: Willem-Alexander (born 1967), Friso (born 1968) and Constantijn (born 1969). Queen Beatrix has indicated that she won't be abdicating in the near future, as she wants Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and his wife, Princess Maxima, to spend time with their family.
