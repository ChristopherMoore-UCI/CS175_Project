-- Two new Pokémon games, "Pokémon X" and "Pokémon Y," have taken the gaming world by storm, selling more than 4 million units globally in their first two days of availability, and tracking to become the fastest-selling games of all time for the handheld Nintendo 3DS. Ishihara said in late December that a new cloud service called Pokémon Bank would let players move their creatures back and forth between games -- a service fans have been asking for for many years. But the president of the Pokémon Company said the new games stay true to their roots of bringing people together to play while offering a new blueprint for the universe of pocket monsters. "From the beginning, communication between players has been the primary goal for the Pokémon brand," Tsunekazu Ishihara told CNN. The technical abilities of the 3DS let players see their favorite moves and interactions in new ways, as well as play with other gamers around the world. Recognizing that its place in video game history is assured, Ishihara said new technology allows designers to do things with Pokemon they couldn't do in previous titles.
