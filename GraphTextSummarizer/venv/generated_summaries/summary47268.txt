In less than 24 hours, President Obama, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden and every campaign staffer from David Axelrod to the lowliest intern was disavowing Rosen's statement. Just then, Democrat strategist Hilary Rosen said in an interview that Ann Romney "has never worked a day in her life." Fehrnstrom took umbrage with recent anti-Ann Romney comments made by comedian and Obama donor Bill Maher. Later in the week, Mitt Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom and President Obama adviser David Axelrod got into a Twitter duel, or maybe we should just call it tweet-for-tat. It took minutes for GOP operatives to denounce the "War on Mommies" and spring into action pinning Rosen's words on Obama's.
