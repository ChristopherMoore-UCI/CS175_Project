Back came captain John Terry, a defensive stalwart in Mourinho's first Chelsea reign but a peripheral figure last season, along with John Obi Mikel -- a defensive midfielder that the Blues worked so hard to steal from under the nose of Manchester United back in 2006. With last week's 2-1 Champions League defeat at home to Swiss side Basel echoing the draw with Rosenborg that marked the end of his first Chelsea tenure in 2007, Mourinho has a lot of hard work to return to the glory days of his successive EPL crowns in his first two seasons at the club. Everton built on the win over Chelsea by coming from behind to win 3-2 at West Ham, scoring twice after home midfielder Mark Noble was sent off to be the EPL's only unbeaten team with two wins and three draws Noble had put West Ham 2-1 ahead with a penalty, but received a second booking with eight minutes to play -- which allowed England defender Leighton Baines to fire in a second superb free-kick. And those two combined to seal a 2-0 victory that ended a run of four games without a win, which had contributed to Chelsea's worst start to an EPL campaign since Russian owner Roman Abramovich took over in 2003. That relieved the pressure on Mourinho, indeed putting his team top of the table on goal difference ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby and other games involving top-four hopefuls Arsenal and Tottenham.
