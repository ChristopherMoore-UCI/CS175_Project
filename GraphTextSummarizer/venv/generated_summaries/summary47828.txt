While PS4 is being touted as the perfect machine for social media lovers -- offering games that players can share easily with friends -- Xbox One is said to be ideal for those after a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games, movies, music and applications quickly and seamlessly. "Xbox were wise to backtrack on their initial idea that you wouldn't be able to easily resell secondhand games or pass old games onto friends more than once," says "With no monopoly, gamers get better deals on games and hardware after the initial round of console launches are out of the way. "It showed a lack of understanding of the importance of selling on games for younger gamers, but also showed Microsoft's maturity in knowing when to backtrack if mistakes have been made." "These are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between Xbox and PlayStation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere," says David Hutchinson, chief video games writer for The Times of London.
