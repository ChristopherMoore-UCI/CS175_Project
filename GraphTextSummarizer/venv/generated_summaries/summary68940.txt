The arrests came the same day that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned of a "heightened level of terror chatter" following the Martin Place siege in Sydney, in which two people, along with hostage-taker Man Haron Monis, were killed. Two Sydney men have been charged with terror offenses, with one accused of possessing documents designed to facilitate a terror attack on Australian soil. Following his arrest, footage appeared in Australian media of Khalid, dressed in a jacket bearing the ISIS flag, storming off the set of an Australian current affairs show in August in which guests had been discussing local support for Islamic extremism. The arrests were made as part of Operation Appleby, an ongoing investigation into Islamist extremists, which led to sweeping pre-dawn counter-terror raids in Sydney in September. A person can be subject to a control order if it substantially helps prevent a terrorist attack, or the person has trained with a listed terrorist organization or been convicted of terror offenses, according to the Australian Attorney General Department.
