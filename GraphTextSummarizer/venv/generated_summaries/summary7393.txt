After high-profile child rape cases, politicians worldwide tend to pledge a crackdown and harsher punishments for sex offenders, involving chemical castration, said Don Grubin, professor of forensic psychiatry at Newcastle University. In South Korea, the abduction and rape of a 7-year-old girl last week outraged the public and prompted  President Lee Myung-Bak to consider various measures including chemical castration to combat child sex crimes, according to local media. While sex offenders may not be the most sympathetic group, critics say forced chemical castration violates human rights. This year, the same committee asked Germany to stop offering sex offenders the option of surgical castration. " Physical castration has also been used for sex offenders.
