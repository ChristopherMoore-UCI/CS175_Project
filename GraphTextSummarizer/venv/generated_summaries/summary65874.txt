"(It) brings the best of online and new technologies to the physical world," says Steve Yankovich, vice president of innovation and new ventures at eBay, who have recently partnered with retail experience firm Westfield Labs to launch a series of digital storefronts at the Westfield San Francisco Center. This season sees the advent of 'digital storefronts', giant touchscreen store windows where customers can browse through a retailer's items with a single swipe. "The Digital Storefronts in Westfield San Francisco Centre are a great alternative to empty spaces in the mall. New York design outfit Kate Spade also recently collaborated with the online retailer, to connect their digital storefront to an option similar to eBay's same day delivery service, eBay Now, which delivers items in about an hour from the time of purchase. The opportunity is for brands to expand their footprint by offering vertical shopping experiences.
