There's an important distinction to be made here, however: Animals might be capable of original works, but mere works of nature cannot qualify. The bottom line is that monkeys may create works of art, but those works cannot qualify for copyright protection. So, can humans acquire rights in works created by animals? Slater asked the site to take down the photo, but Wikipedia asserts the photo is uncopyrightable because animals can't own copyrights. One view would be that (a) if animals are your property, and (b) they create property, then (c) the property of your property is also your property.
