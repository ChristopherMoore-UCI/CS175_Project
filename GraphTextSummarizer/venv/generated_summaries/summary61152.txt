Jussi Jaaskelainen saved striker Cole's weak 33rd-minute spot-kick before defender Upson headed into his own net three minutes after halftime, then Sweden striker Johan Elmander netted twice either side of Mark Noble's penalty consolation for West Ham (79). The midfielder set up Walcott's hat-trick goal on 58 and Morocco striker Chamakh made up for a series of misses as he scored his first for Arsenal to seal the romp with eight minutes left. Ben Foster denied Morten Gamst Pedersen five minutes after halftime following Nikola Zigic's foul on Christopher Samba, then French midfielder Nzonzi headed in a corner. Blackpool had thrashed Wigan 4-0 away in the small club's historic first Premier League outing, but were outclassed to end a difficult week following the resignation of chairman Karl Oyston amid reports he may be made bankrupt. English Premier League preview Andrei Arshavin scored the resulting penalty, Walcott made it 3-0 six minutes before halftime and Abou Diaby scored the fourth four minutes after the break.
