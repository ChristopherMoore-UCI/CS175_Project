-- NASA will launch Space Shuttle Endeavour on February 7, which will be the first of five launches this year before the shuttle fleet is retired. NASA plans to retire its space shuttles Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis later this year. Space Shuttle Discovery will be transferred to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. This portion will provide more room for crew members. Endeavour will blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a 13-day mission to the international space station.
