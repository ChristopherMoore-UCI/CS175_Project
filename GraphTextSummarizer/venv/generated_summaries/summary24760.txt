The British Airways Boeing 777-200 made the New York-London route in five hours, 16 minutes last Wednesday, and reached ground speeds of up to 1200 km/h (745 mph), riding a powerful jet stream of up to 322 km/h (200 mph) tailwinds. 'Like surfing' Former BA pilot Alastair Rosenschein told the British press that riding the jet stream was "just like surfing." Several other flights heading east over the Atlantic also benefited from the weather, but it was flight BA114 that made headlines with the record time. Not even close Only the now-retired Concorde, which was operated by BA and Air France until it was decommissioned in 2003, bested Flight 114's New York-London time -- a BA Concorde made that trip in 1996 in just under two hours, 53 minutes. For European passengers traveling westwards, however, the jet stream will mean longer-than-average flight times as planes need to battle powerful headwinds.
