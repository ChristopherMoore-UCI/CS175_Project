The GOP suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation advanced by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice in television appearances -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film that was produced in the United States. "We will supplement this response if we identify additional responsive documents," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement disclosing that the agency had replied to the subpoena. The Oversight panel has not been satisfied with explanations so far about how the Obama administration arrived at "talking points" initially drafted by the CIA that were developed to explain events around the attack last September 11 that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The Oversight subpoena sought documents and communications from 10 current and former State Department officials that refer or relate to the "talking points. The agency sent the House Oversight Committee 97 pages of documents, but said many had already been shared with the panel chaired by California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa and released publicly.
