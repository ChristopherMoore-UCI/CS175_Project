When I'm not writing quick columns to go with CNN Photos posts, I run a project at CNN called Change the List, which tries to raise awareness about bottom-of-the-list places. The piece ran with a visual essay on CNN Photos about the illegal dog meat trade in Southeast Asia, which is just awful to look at. The implication: Eating pig, another highly intelligent animal, is just like eating dog. -- On Wednesday, I wrote a not-at-all controversial column on this website titled, "The argument for eating dog." The crux of the argument was this: If we think dog shouldn't be eaten -- like, ever, regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat, and if and why we don't feel the same way about them.
