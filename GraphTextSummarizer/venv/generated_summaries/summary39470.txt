Controllers found Tuesday that Kepler had gone into a "safe mode" and one of the reaction wheels needed to orient the spacecraft would not spin, Associate NASA Administrator John Grunsfeld told reporters. Even if controllers are unable to return it to service, NASA said the mission has produced enough data to keep scientists busy for up to two years. The probe was built with four reaction wheels and needs three of them -- one for each axis -- to aim its telescope precisely at a distant star, deputy project manager Charlie Sobeck said. The Kepler mission has identified 132 planets beyond our solar system since its launch in 2009, leading scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them. He said it was "reasonable to suspect" the failure of the reaction wheel was the cause, but scientists hadn't confirmed that.
