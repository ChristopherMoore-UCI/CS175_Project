30 day sentence for teacher who raped his 14-year-old student Shortly after Jamie posted the video on YouTube, she sent the link to her former teacher. "I am 28 years old and have been waiting years to get up enough courage to report a teacher for sexually abusing me for years," Jamie's caption on her YouTube video states. Now, more than a decade after middle school, Jamie said she feels greater control in her life. A woman who says a female teacher from middle school sexually abused her for years decided to confront the teacher -- and post video of the exchange on YouTube. "The reason why I wanted to do this was to expose her for what she really was and to protect other kids, because she shouldn't be around anyone's kids," Jamie told reporters Monday.
