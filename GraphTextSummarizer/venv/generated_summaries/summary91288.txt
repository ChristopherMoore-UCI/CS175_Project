Students were then taken by bus to a nearby church where they were reunited with their families, Robinson said. The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Karl Halverson Pierson, shot one student before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life, Sheriff Grayson Robinson told reporters. The shooting began after the student walked into Arapahoe High School in Centennial with the intention of confronting a specific faculty member, Robinson said. Pierson walked into Arapahoe High School carrying a shotgun and made no attempt to hide it, Robinson said. As part of the investigation, authorities also will be looking at school surveillance video, the sheriff said.
