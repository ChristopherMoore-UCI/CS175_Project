Common said he hopes more rappers abandon vacuous materialistic ideals and the glorification of vices plaguing American communities -- "and if whatever MC doesn't, I will," he warned. Nine months ago, Common told CNN he believed Obama's presidency would change the attitudes of many hip-hop artists. However, he skirted questions about recent outbursts by rapper Kanye West and tennis star Serena Williams. On Saturday, Common said he is already seeing signs that Obama is making a mark on a musical genre often vilified because of its focus on drugs, violence and the degradation of women.
