-- Actress Felicia "Snoop" Pearson, who once dealt drugs in Baltimore before a chance encounter got her a role on HBO's "The Wire," was arrested overnight during a series of raids in her hometown, police said Thursday. The U.S. Attorney's Office said 24 people face drug charges at the federal level, and 40 more face similar charges at the state level, including Pearson. It targeted 79 people; 63 were arrested in the raids, according to CNN Baltimore affiliate WBAL. In her 2007 memoir, "Grace After Midnight," Pearson -- now 30 -- wrote of being born to a drug-addicted mother and then selling drugs herself. "It's named 'Public Enemies' because a lot of the main targets are violent repeat offenders," said Carl Kotowski of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Baltimore.
