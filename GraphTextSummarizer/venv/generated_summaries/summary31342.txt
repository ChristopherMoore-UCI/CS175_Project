Sartiau's mother is alive and willing to testify, the lawyer, Pararols, told CNN by phone from his office in a town north of Barcelona. Spain's former King Juan Carlos, 77, will face a paternity lawsuit -- by a Belgian woman alleging that he's her father -- before the nation's Supreme Court, a 12-judge panel ruled Wednesday. Sartiau alleges that her mother and the married Juan Carlos had a relationship in late 1965, and she was born, as a result, in August 1966, said her attorney, Jaume Pararols. Juan Carlos abdicated in June in favor of his son, King Felipe VI, who was born in 1968. Juan Carlos no longer has immunity from prosecution, but he has protection that permits cases against him to be heard only by the Supreme Court, which is Spain's second highest, after the Constitutional Court.
