About four hours later, police got word that a man wearing camouflage clothing had been spotted near the center of the southern Finnish town of Hyvinkaa, Leppälä told MTV3. The suspect is a local man, Leppälä said, and a gun and other materials are now in the hands of police. An 18-year-old man was arrested early Saturday in Finland over a shooting spree that left two people dead and eight wounded, police told CNN's Finnish affiliate MTV3. Regional chief inspector Timo Leppälä told the channel the police were alerted to a shooting incident in front of a restaurant on Uusimaa Street shortly before 2 a.m. local time. Regional chief inspector Markku Tuominen told MTV3: "It is possible that there are more people involved in the case."
