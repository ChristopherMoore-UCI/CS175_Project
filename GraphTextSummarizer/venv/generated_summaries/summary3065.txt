In the men's final, Russia's Dmitry Tursunov beat Croatian fourth seed Ivan Dodig 6-3 6-2 to claim his first title since Eastbourne last year. The French world No. 9, beaten by Venus Williams in the final that year, defied an potentially worrying leg injury in cool, windy conditions to beat Czech fifth seed Petra Kvitova 6-1 4-6 7-5. In the men's final, Italy's Andreas Seppi earned his first ATP Tour title as Serbian third seed Janko Tipsarevic retired hurt in fading light while trailing 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 3-5. At the Dutch warm-up event in 'S-Hertogenbosch, Italian seventh seed Roberta Vinci claimed her fifth WTA Tour title and first on grass by beating former world No. 4 Jelena Dokic, 6-7 (7-9) 6-3 7-5 in Saturday's final. Venus, a five-time Wimbledon champion, reached the quarterfinals in her first tournament since retiring hurt with a hip injury at January's Australian Open.
