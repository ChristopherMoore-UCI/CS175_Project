A coalition of non-governmental organizations has been working on the case against Sperisen, said Trial, a Swiss non-governmental organization that aims to combat impunity. Sperisen cannot be extradited to Guatemala because he holds Swiss nationality, the judicial authority said. "Details provided by the Guatemalan authorities at the end of 2011 and recent developments in the case raise important suspicions about the suspect's involvement in various extrajudicial executions committed while he was director of Guatemala's national police from July 2004 to March 2007," it said. Erwin Sperisen, 42, who was detained Friday afternoon, holds dual Swiss and Guatemalan nationality and lives in Geneva, the judicial authority said in a statement. Trial said the coalition of NGOs involved "welcomes the steps taken by the Swiss prosecuting authorities."
