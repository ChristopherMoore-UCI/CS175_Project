U.S. airstrikes helped Kurdish and Iraqi forces take control of Mosul Dam on Monday, fighting back ISIS militants who had seized the dam, President Obama told reporters. Now that the dam is cleared of ISIS militants, Iraqi forces are moving to grow their area of control, the Pentagon said. The brutal attacks of ISIS militants as they took control of towns and villages in northern Iraq forced hundreds of thousands of  people to flee. Taking the fight to ISIS U.S. airstrikes may not be enough to do the job of ridding Iraq of ISIS forces, said retired  Col. Cedric Leighton, a former Air Force intelligence officer. "ISIS tells people to pay or convert," said one Christian man who fled ISIS forces.
