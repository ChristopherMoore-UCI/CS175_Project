To make matters worse, after handcuffing him, police paraded him to the front of our house in full view of neighbors and passersby, and at least three other armed, uniformed officers surrounded him and me. The plainclothes Evanston, Illinois, officer and his partner did not identify themselves as police. To be sure, police officers have a tough and dangerous job and are vulnerable to injury at a moment's notice. However, it is clear more training of Evanston dispatchers and police officers is needed. Even though he produced identification to prove he lived in the house, he was ultimately arrested for disorderly conduct after he angrily accused officers of racial profiling.
