Fed up with how little was happening to put shelters in schools, the mother and former school worker decided she's going to run for the state House of Representatives as a Republican. Her argument seems to fit the definition of reasonable: Students are required to attend school; therefore, schools should be required to ensure they are safe from violent storms. Christopher Legg, a 9-year-old who loved football and was known to tackle people with a bear hug and a smile, huddled on top of a classmate as a tornado barreled through their elementary school here in central Oklahoma one year ago this week. When we met on Sunday afternoon, Legg arrived on crutches and was wearing the same leopard-print blouse she wore the day the tornado tore through central Oklahoma, taking her son's life and those of 23 others. She'd lived through another killer tornado that hit central Oklahoma in 1999.
