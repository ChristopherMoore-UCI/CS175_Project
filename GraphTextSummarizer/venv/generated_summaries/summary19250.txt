He's the first substitute in U.S. soccer history to score in a World Cup match. When JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann, a household name in German soccer, took over as U.S. coach, he went shopping for quality talent made in Germany -- with a U.S. passport. Then, he rushed to the airport to make his first U.S. national team match. Brooks is not the only German national soccer league player to make the jump across the Atlantic to kick for the U.S. national team. If you hadn't heard his name before, you certainly have now: John Brooks is the 21-year-old who came in as a substitute into the USA vs Ghana game Monday, and scored a header to keep America's hope alive in the World Cup in Brazil.
