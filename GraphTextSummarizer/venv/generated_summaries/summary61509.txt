Airbus says the Beluga's flight hours per aircraft have doubled since it first went into service and will do so again by 2017, from 5,000 to 10,000 flight hours, due to the production start of the A350 XWB in 2012 and the production ramp-up on other Airbus programs. Worse was the fact that Airbus was relying on a couple of old aircraft from its chief rival, Boeing, to handle the bulk of its logistics chain. Since the Beluga's maiden flight on September 13, 1994, Airbus has multiplied aircraft deliveries by nearly five. With aircraft order books at a historic maximum, however, Airbus can't afford to bet its vital logistics operation chain on the readiness of five aging aircraft. The next generation Beluga should also make it possible for Airbus to double its number of cargo flights to 120 per week.
