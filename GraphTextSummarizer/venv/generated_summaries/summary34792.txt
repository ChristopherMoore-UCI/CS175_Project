"On November 1, 2012, officials at the (Veterans Affairs Western New York Healthcare System) reported that while conducting pharmacy inspection rounds on the inpatient units, they discovered that insulin pens intended for individual patient use were found in the supply drawer of the medication carts without a patient label on them," said the memo, obtained by CNN through the office of U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-New York. -- Hundreds of veterans may have been exposed to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV because of medical oversights that allowed insulin pens to be used on more than one patient at a Veterans Administration hospital in Buffalo, New York, according to a memo from the Department of Veterans Affairs to Congress. "Unfortunately, since the day that new technology was introduced at the VA, they did not have a protocol in place that let the nurses know they were not supposed to use the cartridge on more than one patient," Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Collins told CNN affiliate WGRZ. "Beyond the fact that the error occurred at all, most concerning was the length of time it took the Buffalo VA to catch the error -- over two years, as well as the three-month delay in informing patients who may have been exposed," Higgins, whose district includes the city of Buffalo, wrote in a letter to the VA on Monday. "(The health system) determined that all veterans who were prescribed the insulin pen during an inpatient stay from October 19, 2010, to November 1, 2012, should be notified." The veterans' health care system has found that 716 patients may have been affected during this time period, Jim Blue, regional director of the VA's Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs, told CNN.
