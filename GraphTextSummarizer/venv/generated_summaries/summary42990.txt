-- Most have likely heard the broad outlines of the events that led to former Vice President Dick Cheney's heart transplant: Five heart attacks, open heart surgery and a battery-operated heart pump. He suffered subsequent heart attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2010. That heart pump stayed in his body for 20 months until he got a heart transplant at age 71. He had a Left Ventricular Assist Device, or LVAD, implanted to help his heart pump. He made plans for his burial with his family, and then had a heart pump placed.
