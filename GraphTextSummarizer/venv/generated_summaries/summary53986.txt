-- A fire at a fuel storage facility that burned for three days and forced hundreds of  Puerto Rico residents from their homes has been extinguished, fire officials said Sunday evening. "We're not finding levels that would be of concern," EPA spokeswoman Bonnie Bellow said. The company has had violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the main law in the United States that deals with the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, according to EPA spokeswoman Bellow. Puerto Rico will receive 3.6 million gallons of regular gasoline, more than 1 million gallons of premium gasoline and more than 1 million gallons of diesel fuel to help make up for what may have been lost, Fortuno said. The FBI is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire, Special Agent Harry Rodriguez said Friday.
