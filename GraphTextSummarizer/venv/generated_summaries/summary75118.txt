This week, a resolution from the African Union in Egypt called for negotiations between Tsvangirai and Mugabe, and some European Union officials have called for a coalition government in Zimbabwe with Tsvangirai as its leader. But Tsvangirai this week said the "conditions prevailing in Zimbabwe ... are not conducive" to negotiations with Mugabe. Several Western nations denounced the violence and declared Mugabe's runoff victory illegitimate. That left Mugabe as the only runoff candidate, allowing him to claim re-election. Mugabe has been Zimbabwe's only leader since its independence from Britain in 1980, when it was called Rhodesia.
