On Saturday, the ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, was detained and faces possible charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board, authorities said. Schettino has denied abandoning ship, saying he and his crew were the last to leave the Concordia. " Crew members were hard to find in the confusion, and little to no information was available about what to do or what was happening, passengers have said. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard, passengers said; remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee. " Lifeboats on the ship's higher side became stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the screams and cries of children, said passenger Laurie Willits.
