Report: Penn State leaders disregarded victims, 'empowered' Sandusky Key passages from Penn State internal review report Opinion: Joe Paterno was a coward CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report The 267-page review -- led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh -- implicated ousted university president Graham Spanier, fired head coach Joe Paterno and ex-administrators Gary Schultz and Tim Curley, whose attorneys blasted the findings, calling the report a "lopsided document" that lacked access to critical witnesses. And while Paterno earned an almost cult-like following among Penn State fans during his 61 years of coaching, vestiges of his legacy have gradually disappeared after Freeh's report determined that Paterno could have done more to stop the attacks and may not have told the grand jury all that he knew. More storms looming for Penn State in wake of Freeh report Oral arguments for pretrial motions against Curley and Schultz are scheduled for the morning of August 16 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. -- It's still not clear what the future holds for Nittany Lions football after a child sex abuse scandal implicated top Penn State officials and placed a former assistant coach behind bars.
