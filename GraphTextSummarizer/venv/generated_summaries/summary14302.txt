"CNN International is committed to green coverage," said Katherine Green, senior vice president of CNN International. On Earth Day, Wednesday April 22, CNN International's special coverage, "Going Green," will showcase the network's extensive global resources with an array of reports and live coverage of Earth Day events around the world. Building upon the success of the Green Week franchise, CNN International expands its environmental coverage this year with special Earth Day reports on April 22, and plans additional specials in July and October and a series of comprehensive reports around the Copenhagen Climate Conference in December. From the CEO of an up-and-coming green company to a climate change skeptic, these programs will speak to a variety of people to offer viewers many perspectives on green topics. On Saturday, April 25 at 1300 BST and Sunday, April 26 at 0100 and 1900 BST, a special programme, 'Your Green World', will focus on the current state of green initiatives around the planet.
