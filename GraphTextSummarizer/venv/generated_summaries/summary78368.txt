-- Best-selling author and director Sebastian Junger says experiencing the existence of U.S. troops' experience in Afghanistan was like being "on Mars." Junger documented the reality of an Army platoon as its soldiers lived, fought and died at one of the most dangerous postings in the U.S. military, a 15-man outpost called Restrepo in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley. While "Restrepo" is not a political film, Junger does believe NATO troops are making progress in Afghanistan, with violence in the country at a 30-year-low. "Sixteen thousand Afghan civilians have died because of NATO combat operations in Afghanistan since 2001 -- a horrifying number, but it pales comparison to the civilian deaths in the '90s. It's the focus of Junger's new feature-length documentary, also named "Restrepo." Junger said that after a few weeks at their base in Italy, the platoon's members just wanted to get back to Restrepo.
