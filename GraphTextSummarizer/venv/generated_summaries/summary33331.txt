-- The government of Alberta, Canada, will provide $1 billion in funding for recovery and reconstruction after the province's devastating floods, Premier Alison Redford said Monday. The South Saskatchewan River flowing through Medicine Hat, in southeastern Alberta, crested Monday but was still overflowing its banks, Schoepp said. New flooding was occurring Monday in Drumheller, known as the dinosaur capital of the world for the dinosaur bones and fossils found there, and at the Siksika Indian reserve, east of Calgary, Schoepp said. That makes it difficult to assess the extent of the damage in High River, though it's safe to say the town is in a "critical situation" with extensive damage, said Katrina Bluetchen, a spokeswoman for the Alberta government. In High River, about 40 miles south of Calgary, the flooding has now stopped, but some water is simply not receding, said Constable Janice Schoepp of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
