According to news sources, El-Zawy's group was responsible for the kidnapping of Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan last October. News from Libyan news agency LANA on Sunday said that five diplomats and an embassy worker were abducted. LANA quotes an official source Sunday saying that two diplomats and the embassy staffer were released and arrived at their residence in Tripoli in good health. A spokesman for the Libyan Foreign Ministry, Said Al-Aswad, earlier told the Egyptian MENA news agency that the motive behind the kidnapping was unknown and that Libyan authorities were investigating. Earlier this week, a South Korean trade official was rescued after being taken from his car in Tripoli last Sunday.
