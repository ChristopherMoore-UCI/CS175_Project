In the past year, dozens of oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan have been attacked in Pakistan. -- Sixteen people -- including five children -- died when an oil tanker carrying fuel for NATO exploded Saturday morning in Khyber Agency, a district in Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan, a government official said. Militants in the region have frequently targeted Pakistani security forces and supply trucks headed for Afghanistan in an effort to undermine U.S. and NATO efforts there. Khan said in another incident on Friday evening, nine oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO caught fire after a planted bomb was also detonated by a remote control at Torkham, at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The tankers are often operated by contracted Pakistani firms hired by NATO, using Pakistani equipment and drivers.
