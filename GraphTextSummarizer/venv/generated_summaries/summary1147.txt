Firefighters around the country are instructed on how to respond to violent scenarios -- wait for police to secure the scene so that the firefighters can do their jobs saving lives and property -- but that instruction presumes the firefighter has already noticed something amiss, Stittleburg said. In the last 10 years or so, however, firefighters are increasingly being cross-training to become certified police officers assigned to SWAT teams, Stittleburg said. " "It really does need to go to a new level -- these conversations where I'm asking my police chief (to) help me with what we need to understand going into a situation that could turn as bad as Gwinnett County and New York," said Schwartz, who's also chief of the Arlington County, Virginia, Fire Department. In an era of high body-count mass shootings since Colorado's Columbine High School massacre in 1999, police departments are demanding their SWAT teams include a firefighter with emergency medical service skills, Stittleburg said. Jim Schwartz, chairman of the terrorism and homeland security committee of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, said fire departments must communicate more with their police partners on how to handle scenarios such as the ones in Georgia and New York.
