On Tuesday afternoon, weather-related flight delays were reported at airports including Philadelphia International, O'Hare, Newark International, LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International. If you're flying into or out of Los Angeles International, Chicago's O'Hare International or Orlando International, brace yourself for lots of company. No matter where you start your journey, flight attendants say, it's a week when they see lots of extra-grumpy passengers worried about flight delays and cancellations. You probably know the drill: packed airports, crowded flights and lots of out-of-state license plates on the road. Unlike last year, when the "National Opt-Out Day" movement against airport body scanners threatened to snarl security lines across the country, air travelers are not facing the prospect of protest-induced delays.
