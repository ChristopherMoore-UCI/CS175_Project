" Dister said Amrani did not to his knowledge take drugs and had not been charged with drugs use. "Because Amrani was convicted of rape in 2003, police obviously regarded him as a person of interest," Dister said. Amrani had previously served time in prison for rape and drug trafficking offenses, his lawyer said. It is not yet clear how Amrani, who Reynders said was a Brussels-born Belgian citizen of Moroccan descent, obtained the pistol, semi-automatic rifle and three grenades he used in the attack. Authorities will conduct an autopsy in part to see whether Amrani was under the influence of drugs during the attack, said a senior Belgian security source who has been briefed on the investigation but did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
