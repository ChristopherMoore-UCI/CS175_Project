Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov, who oversaw the pontiff's visit to Israel, said Tamimi's words planted "seeds of division" between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as between Jews, Muslims and Christians. Earlier in the day, Pope Benedict gave a speech at the residence of Israeli President Shimon Peres, urging Israelis and Palestinians to find a "just resolution" to their long-running conflict Monday as he arrived in Israel. After Pope Benedict XVI, speaking to religious leaders during an interfaith discussion in Jerusalem, called for mutual understanding and cooperation in the tumultuous region, Taysir Tamimi, chief of Muslim Sharia courts in the West Bank and Gaza, commandeered the microphone and began to criticize Israel in Arabic. The pope said anti-Semitism is "totally unacceptable" and pointedly rejected Holocaust denial as he visited Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial. Palestinian officials set up an alternative press center, arguing that the Jerusalem Municipal Building, the site of the official one, was linked to Israel's policy of demolishing Palestinian homes built without permission in East Jerusalem.
