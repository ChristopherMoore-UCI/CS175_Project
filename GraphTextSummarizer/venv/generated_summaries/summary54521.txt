He said that the last four years of leadership from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker prove that Republicans aren't reformers. By pressing a message centered on raising the minimum wage and strengthening the middle class, those campaigning for Democratic governors and candidates feel like they are in better position to make gains in 2014 than congressional Democrats, where it is looking more likely the Democrats will continue to be a minority in the House. But those same Republicans now have to defend their wins -- Republican governors are left to defend 22 governorships in November compared to only 14 for Democrats. In a Tuesday statement, Jon Thompson, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, said, "While Democrat governors continue to raise taxes, increase spending, and waste hardworking taxpayers' money on failed Obamacare exchanges in their states, Republican governors are cutting taxes, lowering spending, balancing budgets, reforming education and driving the American Comeback." Five races are "tilting" in favor of Democrats - Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island - and another five are "tilting" in favor of Republicans - Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, South Carolina and Wisconsin.
