"The fact that there were five bears was an abnormality and this serves as a reminder that anything can happen and we need to be aware of our surroundings," said Lt. Joseph Schlosser, operational unit watchstander for the Coast Guard 17th District. -- Coast Guard rescuers airlifted a hunter from a remote Alaskan island after he was mauled by a group of bears. The injured hunter was flown to Kodiak Municipal Airport and then handed over to emergency medical services, the Coast Guard said. He told the Coast Guard that the injured man needed immediate medical assistance. The bears attacked the 65-year-old man and his hunting party, who were carrying a deer that they had shot on Sally Island, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
