The world No. 3 is departing Andrew "Chubby" Chandler's International Sports Management, which looks after second-ranked Lee Westwood, Masters winner Charl Schwartzel and British Open champion Darren Clarke. He will link up with fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open champion, at Dublin-based sports agency Horizon as he rejoins the PGA Tour next year. Sweden's Alexander Noren matched that score to be second on 10-under 132, two strokes clear of England's first-round leader Ross McGowan (70), Scotland's Gary Orr (67) and Australia's Marcus Fraser (64). The 22-year-old announced on Friday that he is leaving the manager who helped turn him into potentially the next Tiger Woods, as he seeks to push himself to a new level. McIlroy joined ISM after being the best-finishing amateur at the 2007 British Open, and the company wished him future success.
