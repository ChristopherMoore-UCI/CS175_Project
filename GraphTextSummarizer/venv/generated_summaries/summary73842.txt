-- Lawyers for two jailed members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot have asked for the women to be allowed to do community service instead of serving the remainder of their prison sentence, state media said Friday. The community service could include working for a charity or the media, official news agency Itar-Tass cited attorney Irina Khrunova as saying. The two women, who have been in prison since March 2012, are due for release in March, state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. Yekaterina Samutsevich, the third member of the band, was sentenced at the same time as the others but was freed from prison in October after her defense presented new evidence. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina were sentenced to two years in prison for hooliganism after a trial in August 2012.
