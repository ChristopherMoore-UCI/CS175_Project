Once home to composers including Beethoven, Mozart, and Johann Strauss, and to artists Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, as well as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, Vienna has been at the forefront of major cultural movements for centuries. The Hotel Altstadt is located in the arty Spittelberg district, just behind the MuseumsQuartier and features an impressive contemporary art and design collection; Das Tyrol, a cozy former monastery with a small spa, features art works by young Viennese artists; the Konig von Ungarn has the benefit of being in the same complex of 300-year-old buildings as Mozart's one-time living quarters; and the Hilton Vienna Danube has views over the river. Vienna's turn-of-the-century painters owed much to the new theories about the mind coming from Sigmund Freud, and no trip to Vienna would be complete without visiting the Sigmund Freud Museum, where the founder of psychoanalysis lived until he was forced to flee in 1938. For lovers of classical music, Vienna is a must-visit, as it was in the eighteenth century, when it attracted the young Mozart. But that doesn't mean it's stuck in the past; Vienna has a youthful side, too, and is visited yearly by backpackers as much as mainline culture aficionados -- something Richard Linklater celebrated in his 1995 film "Before Sunrise," which charted two strangers falling in love in the course of one day, with Vienna as the romantic backdrop.
