Veggie variety: A foodie's nirvana, Portland restaurants offer outstanding farm-to-table dining options, and I personally reveled in the volume of vegetarian fare on Portland menus. Farmers Market: Be sure to check out the amazing Portland Farmers Market at Portland State University. Portland has dedicated bus lanes in the clean downtown area, which stays immaculate partially as a function of the "waste cans" that not only accommodate trash, but recyclable disposables. And since no dining experience would be complete without liquid pleasures, it's worth mentioning that many restaurants employ top mixologists to hand-craft cocktails with seasonal fresh ingredients and house-infused spirits. Speaking of restaurants, to talk about Portland and not mention the food would be a travesty.
