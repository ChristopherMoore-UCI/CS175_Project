Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder was already in Paris for security meetings -- and even recorded interviews with several U.S. Sunday morning programs -- but he didn't attend the march. And Jake Tapper, host of CNN's "The Lead," said American leaders were conspicuously absent from historic Paris rally, perhaps the most important public demonstrations in Europe in the last generation. " More than 40 world leaders, including the British, German and Israeli heads of state and Russia's foreign minister, joined at least 1.5 million people on the Paris streets Sunday for a unity march that became France's biggest-ever public demonstration. The White House noted that it was represented in Paris on Sunday -- and has offered support to France in recent days. France is the United States' "deepest ideological ally," he said, and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member, or the President, standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders.
