"We can see how the ad could be viewed differently today than when it first aired." Danielle Ramos, who lives in New York City, was one of the people who tweeted Walmart about the ad. Those three words have become a rallying cry for protesters nationwide following the July 17 death of Garner in a videotaped incident in New York City. The ad features an African-American father and daughter sitting on a couch, discussing the perks of a Walmart family mobile plan. -- Walmart is editing a commercial after viewers complained its use of the line "I can't breathe" brings to mind the case of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a police officer after yelling those words. A grand jury said Wednesday it will not indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, sending outraged protesters rallying against the decision.
