In a press conference later Monday, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Everett Gillison said city officials received complaints last November about the conditions in the main property involved in the blaze. He stressed the duty of building owners, in this case and others, to abide by city code to ensure their properties are safe and secure. At Mayor Michael Nutter's urging, the city plans to contact District Attorney Seth Williams to determine if the owner's failure to maintain the building was "risking a catastrophe and whether this amounts to criminal negligence," according to Gillison. Responding firefighters issued four additional alarms as the flames burned out of control for two hours and embers set surrounding buildings ablaze. The collapse occurred about 5:50 a.m. as the five were inside a furniture store, said Deputy Fire Commissioner Ernest Hargett Jr. Four of the firefighters were trapped inside, he said, but the fifth was able to get free.
