-- Danish police made around 250 arrests in Copenhagen Wednesday morning as an organized demonstration against the U.N. climate talks converged on the Bella Center ahead of crucial negotiations at the COP15 summit. While the protests were going on outside, inside it was being announced that Danish minister Connie Hedegaard had resigned as president of the U.N. climate change summit. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told nations Tuesday that they had the chance to "change the course of our history" if they worked together to limit carbon emissions that are blamed for increasing global temperatures. CJA say they are holding a "People's Assembly" to counter the "false solutions and elitism of the U.N. climate talks." Developing countries object to restrictions that they fear would keep them from following the same path to prosperity taken by the United States and other industrialized nations.
