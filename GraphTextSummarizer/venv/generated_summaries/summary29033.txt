"We're sure that the Carters, like many unsuspecting tourists, would be horrified to learn that baby elephants and tigers propped up for photo ops are typically torn away from their mothers, violently beaten by trainers, and deprived of everything natural and important to them," PETA Foundation deputy general counsel Delcianna Winders said in a statement to CNN. The photo shows Beyonce petting the baby tiger while it's being bottle fed at the Phuket FantaSea theme park, with hubby Jay Z and Blue Ivy looking on. They are also crammed into tiny cages or chained to the floor for long periods." Beyonce and Jay Z aren't the first to be blasted for posing with a tiger. Beyonce had quite the play-date set for her daughter Blue Ivy -- a baby tiger, during their trip to Thailand. A recent New York State bill bans people from posing for photos while hugging, patting or touching tigers.
