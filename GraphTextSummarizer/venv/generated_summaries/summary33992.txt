They are on Gchat constantly and can use it to talk to teachers or other students in and out of school. New Tech High School, founded in 1997, is the oldest member of the New Tech Network, a national nonprofit organization that schools hire to implement project-based learning and embed the use of technology with teachers and students. The school encourages students to bring in their own computers and to embrace tools like Gchat and YouTube in school and as part of their lessons. In addition to the group work that mimics companies (students can fire someone on a team if they aren't pulling their weight), seniors at the school wrap up their final year with a required project: a Web page they build themselves with their rÃ©sumÃ©s, letters of recommendation and links to work they've done at school. The decision to trust students online and even encourage them to build up a public presence is the opposite of what's happening these days in many schools, where strict social-media policies, Internet filters and constantly evolving rules are meant to rein kids in.
