Jesus Humberto Canales, an El Salvadoran national who goes by the nickname "Chuey," is in the Los Angeles County Jail following his arrest in Mexico on Thursday, said Jeff Leslie, a sheriff's department homicide detective. Mexican authorities expelled Canales from that country and he was flown back to the United States, where LASD partners Leslie and Lloyd took custody of Canales at Los Angeles International Airport. In the days immediately following Preciado's killing, Canales fled to Pomona, California, before going to Las Cruces, New Mexico, Leslie said. Marshals arrested Canales Thursday in a small town outside of Jalisco, Mexico, Leslie said. "After 5Â½ years it was a really satisfying feeling to put him into the back of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department radio car," Leslie said.
