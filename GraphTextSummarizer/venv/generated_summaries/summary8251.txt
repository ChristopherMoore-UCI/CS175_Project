According to court papers seen by CNN, prosecutors say the Barcelona player and his father Jorge Horacio are suspected of filing fraudulent tax returns between 2006-2009. He has a yearly salary from Barcelona of just over $20 million plus around $21 million in endorsements from several lucrative sponsors including Adidas and PepsiCo, putting him 10th on Forbes' list. According to the papers filed by the prosecutor, Raquel Amado in Gava, the seaside resort close to Barcelona where Messi lives, it is alleged that they tried to avoid paying taxes in Spain by selling the player's image rights through overseas companies. Messi, who arrived at Barcelona as a 13-year-old in 2000, has won six Primera Liga titles, three Champions League crowns and scored an unparalleled 86 goals for club and country in 2012. "We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities," read a statement in Spanish and English.
