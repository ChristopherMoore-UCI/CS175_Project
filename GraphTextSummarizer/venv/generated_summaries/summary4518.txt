"It is shocking that a children's author would contribute to the trauma these kids endure -- both physical and emotional trauma from the sexual abuse itself, and psychological trauma from knowing that images of that abuse are circulating on the Internet," U.S. Attorney Dwight Holton said in a statement. Those collectors were prosecuted, but charges against Bath for allegedly transporting, distributing and receiving child pornography were dropped as part of a plea agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. -- A federal judge sentenced children's author K.P. Bath to six years in prison Thursday for possessing child pornography. Investigators found a large collection of pornographic photographs and video clips in the Portland, Oregon, home of the author of "The Secret of Castle Cant" and "Escape from Castle Cant," according to a statement federal prosecutors released Thursday. Prosecutors also allege that an investigation revealed that Bath had traded images of child pornography with at least two different collectors in Washington and Ohio.
