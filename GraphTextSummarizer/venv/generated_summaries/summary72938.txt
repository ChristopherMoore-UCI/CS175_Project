For season 7, which will launch in the fall, the coaching lineup will be Levine and Shelton along with new mentors Gwen Stefani and Pharrell Williams. One of NBC's most popular shows, "The Voice" regularly updates its roster of celebrity talent. And the Fleetwood Mac songstress is no stranger to the show; back in Season 1, she sang a duet of "Landslide" with eventual winner Javier Colon. After starting off with Christina Aguilera, Blake Shelton, Cee Lo Green and Levine as its quad of mentors, recent seasons have also featured Usher and Shakira in those spinning red chairs. The job of the coaches is to build teams of singers with the hope of picking the "Voice" that will win it all; the job of an adviser like Nicks is to help out during rehearsals and offer expertise to the competitors.
