The Pentagon's most important contribution lies not in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, however, but in making sure U.S. armed forces are ready for the consequences of global climate change for defense infrastructure and military missions. A recent report by a group of retired high-ranking military officers called climate change a "threat multiplier," meaning that although climate change itself may not directly harm U.S. national security, it can worsen or ignite other threats. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said last year that "the effects of climate change ... are far-reaching and unpredictable, demanding our attention and strategic thinking." Military leaders deserve the plaudits they've received for taking action on climate change. It will be a shame if that language becomes law, because the GAO has it right: Climate change is a threat to the nation's security and prosperity.
