Last weekend, the ensemble relationship comedy "Think Like a Man" opened to an astonishing $33.6 million, exceeding practically everyone's expectations, including those of one of the film's standout stars, actor-comedian Kevin Hart. For "Think Like a Man," Hart notes that, combined, the entire cast boasts well over 20 million Twitter followers. "All the attention it got, it became 'Kevin Hart from "Think Like a Man"...' -- not just 'Kevin Hart.'
