The crew members who allege Phillips ignored warnings about Somali pirate attacks have created a Facebook page, "Alabama Shipmates." Perry said he sailed on the Alabama after the pirate incident and retrieved e-mail warnings -- seven in all -- that urged the Alabama and other ships in the area to stay clear of the Somali coast and sail 600 miles away if necessary to avoid pirate attacks. Everywhere I speak, I say what a great job they did." As for the widely repeated notion that he gave himself up to the Somali pirates in exchange for the safety of his crew, Captain Phillips told CNN "the media got everything wrong." "I didn't give myself up," he said. Each e-mail was based on information from British and U.S. naval authorities and urged the Alabama to stay clear of the shipping lanes where Phillips was heading. Another crew member, Abu Tahir Mohammed Reza -- who goes by the initials "ATM" -- told CNN that he was on the Alabama's bridge when the Somali pirates began their attack.
