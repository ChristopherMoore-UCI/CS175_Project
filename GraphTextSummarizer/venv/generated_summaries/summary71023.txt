The men accused of raping al-Obeidy have filed counter-charges for slander, Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Tuesday. If Gadhafi were to face Ahmed now, she would slap him, she told CNN Tuesday. They believe that Gadhafi's regime is trying to discredit her as a woman who has been raped and -- as some people in conservative Muslim societies believe -- therefore dishonored. He refused to take further questions on the issue, repeatedly stating that Libyan society is "very conservative." Cameras captured the drama as al-Obeidy, sobbing and screaming, wanted the world to know the brutality of Gadhafi's regime.
