Social media have done to cable TV news what cable news, in its day, did to the afternoon editions of big-city papers: shouldered aside its slower and less adaptable predecessor. Generic news moves too fast for cable. The alert was quickly confirmed by multiple news sources on my Twitter feed: TV networks, newspapers, wire services. What cable news does do, unrivaled, is broadcast images of events to a large global audience. Cable news is inescapably a niche market.
