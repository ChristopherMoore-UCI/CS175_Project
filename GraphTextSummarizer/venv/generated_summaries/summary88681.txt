Car sickness is a real possibility on winding country roads and things can prove messy unless you're prepared. What to carry in the car Apart from your driving license, car documents, insurance papers and reflective safety vest, which you're legally obliged to carry, it's worth having some coins for parking meters. Many city centers are off-limits to unauthorized traffic and if you slip into a ZTL (zona a traffico limitato -- reduced traffic zone) you risk being caught on camera and fined. City driving also involves dealing with one-way systems, scooters appearing out of nowhere and narrow streets better suited to horse-drawn chariots than modern cars. Lane hopping and late braking are the norm and it's not uncommon to see cars tailgating at 130km/h.
