In the other incident, missiles hit a vehicle in Pakistan's North Waziristan -- another tribal area that borders Afghanistan -- killing four militants, including a commander, according to Pakistani intelligence sources. -- Two suspected U.S. drone strikes in in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region have killed at least eight militants, Pakistani officials said Saturday. One strike targeted a hideout in eastern Afghanistan, near Pakistan's Khyber Agency, which is part of Pakistan's loosely governed tribal areas, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The tribal areas in northwestern Pakistan have long been a base for anti-government militants, including those with the Islamist Haqqani movement. The sources didn't say which group or groups the militants represented.
