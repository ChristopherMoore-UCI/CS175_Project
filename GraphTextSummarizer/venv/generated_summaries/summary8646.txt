Given Baengyeong Island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement was feared, but South Korean officials have played down that scenario. North Korea's official media has yet to mention the incident, according to Yonhap, but accused the United States and South Korea of conducting a maritime drill for the purpose of invading North Korea. South Korean divers were struggling to gain access to stern of the ship, where most of the missing crew members are believed to be, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Tuesday. "Military tension is intensifying on the Korean Peninsula due to the brazen moves by the U.S. and its war-mongering puppets to provoke a war," North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said, as reported by Yonhap. Yonhap has quoted military officials as saying that the explosion tore a hole in the rear of the ship, shutting off the engine.
