Plans are also in the works to drain water from the No. 2 and No. 3 reactors. " Fresh water was being pumped Saturday at reactors 1, 2 and 3. Efforts also continue at the No. 4, 5 and 6 reactors -- each of which has less pronounced concerns because the units were on scheduled outages when the quake struck. The presence of highly radioactive water in buildings at reactors Nos. 1, 2 and 3 has halted some efforts to curb the release of further emissions. That replaced the seawater that had previously been used, with the aim of fresh water being simultaneously to cool down nuclear fuel and also flush out accumulating salt that might hinder the reactors' existing cooling systems.
