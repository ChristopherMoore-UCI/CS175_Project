"People used to eat turtle eggs, but only in [their] family," said Gagne. In these projects, eggs from the wild are allowed to hatch in a fenced-off location, before the hatchlings are introduced to the ocean, in order to improve their chances of survival. The species gets its name from its ridged, dotted carapace which, unlike other sea turtles, has the texture of hard rubber. The organization also works to educate the public about turtle conservation. But despite its wide spread across the world's oceans, leatherback populations have plummeted in recent decades.
