The onetime contender for the French presidency has denied investigators' accusations that he organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes. Investigators alleged that the sex parties, in locations such as Belgium, New York and Washington, stemmed from a prostitution ring, organized from the Hotel Carlton in Lille. But the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved. Strauss-Kahn appeared to get a boost earlier this week when the Lille prosecutor told the court that the defendant should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence. The Lille prosecutor's office in late 2013 asked for Strauss-Kahn's case to be dismissed, citing a lack of evidence.
