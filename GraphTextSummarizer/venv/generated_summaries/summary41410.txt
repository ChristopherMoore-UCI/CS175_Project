Jim Harbaugh, coach of the San Francisco 49ers, was so concerned by the cold that he had asked Kaepernick, a Wisconsin native and childhood Packers fan, three times to wear more weather appropriate gear. The temperature at the Green Bay Packers' Lambeau Field in Wisconsin was measured at four degrees Fahrenheit, with wind chill causing the mercury to dip as low as minus 14 during the visit of the San Francisco 49ers. The Packers' 1967 meeting with the Dallas Cowboys, dubbed the "Ice Bowl" was played despite the temperature dropping as low as minus 14 -- with the wind making it feel like minus 48 -- securing its title as the coldest game in NFL history. One player who persisted with short sleeves was 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who masterminded his team's 23-20 victory. American football players and fans alike braved bone-chilling conditions in Green Bay Sunday during one of the coldest games in National Football League (NFL) history.
