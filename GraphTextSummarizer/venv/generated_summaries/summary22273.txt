-- Newly elected Egyptian ministers held their first parliamentary session this week, almost a year to the day after the start of historic protests in the capital led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. "Being in the square, just feeling that energy, was one of the greatest experiences of my life," said Ashraf Khalil, an Egyptian-American journalist who was standing among the protesters when news broke February 11 that Mubarak had decided to resign. Mubarak, meanwhile, is on trial in Egypt, accused of corruption and ordering the deaths of protesters. "You heard anger boiling up about the police from every corner of Egyptian life, but it was hushed because there was such intense fear," Khalil said.
