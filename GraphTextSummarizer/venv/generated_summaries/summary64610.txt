In light of what has been a long and tumultuous political season, here are my strongest arguments for Mitt Romney, Rep. Paul Ryan, and fellow conservatives to explain to their fellow Americans why President Barack Obama does not deserve a second term. Opinion: Obama on world stage -- more hope than change? With Democrats in control of Congress, Obama then spent the next two years of his political capital on health care reform. He left our ally Poland out to dry by canceling the missile defense system in Europe, but was heard on an open mic assuring Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he will have "more flexibility" after the election to deal with missile defense. Foreign policy: Obama ascended to the presidency promising a new era of American foreign policy.
