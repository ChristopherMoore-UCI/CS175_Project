As a developer of the agency's Advanced Space Life Support Systems, which monitors the safety for all off-planet habitation pursuits, Chamberland soon became a lead proponent of research on an idea being floated by NASA at the time: using the sea as a testbed for space exploration. An aquanaut and Mission Commander on seven NASA underwater missions,  Chamberland has also pursued landmark research in bioengineering and  become a prolific writer of science books and sci-fi novels. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Dennis Chamberland doesn't just want to live underwater: he wants anyone to join him. But it was his work for NASA that resulted in his harvesting of the first agricultural crop in a manned habitat on the sea floor, and led to his designing and construction of the Scott Carpenter Space Analog Station, a two man undersea habitat off Key Largo. The little permanent submarine has been visited by a range of curious futurist  explorers, including James Cameron and TV producer Rod Roddenberry, Jr. See the rest of The Aquatic Life of Dennis Chamberland at VBS.TV Chamberland's next goal, he explains in this episode of Motherboard:  colonizing the sea.
