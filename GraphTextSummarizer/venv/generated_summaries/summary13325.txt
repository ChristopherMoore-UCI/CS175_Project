"Museums have to offer services like restaurants and boutiques, it's completely normal," Jean-Michel Raingeard, President of the Federation of French Friends of Museums told CNN. Le Parisien, a daily newspaper described the difference between McDonald's and the Louvre by comparing Ronald McDonald, the restaurant's clown character, to Venus de Milo, the famous ancient Greek statue of Aphrodite, which is on display at the Louvre. "There are already many other restaurants in the mall, so we will only be one of the many restaurants that offer visitors their products." says a spokeswoman for McDonald's in France. McDonald's' plans seem to have caused more media attention abroad than in France, but for some French outlets, the idea of combining fast food and ancient art is stomach churning. Should a museum be a museum or an amusement park?" asks Jean Michel Raingeard, who is also the European vice president for The World Federation of Friends of Museums.
