Sevilla attempts to hang on to their lead weren't helped when Medel was shown a red card by referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahozâ€Ž for an apparent head butt on Fabregas in the 72nd minute. Winger Piotr Trochowski put the home side in front firing home in the 26th minute before Spanish striker Negredo doubled the lead in the 48th minute -- executing a delightful chip over the onrushing Victor Valdes after being played in by Gary Medel. Real Madrid, who have just seven points from their opening five matches, play Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday. An Amaya own-goal in the 72nd minute sealed victory but Isco added a fourth two minutes later to round off a resounding win. Osvaldo converted a penalty to pull one back for the visitors with 19 minutes remaining, but an injury-time goal from Sebastian Giovinco rounded off a comfortable evening for the league leaders as they edged three points clear of Napoli, who travel to Sampdoria on Sunday.
