A former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, he blogs at Dorf on Law. Thus, Obama's statement that he would look for Supreme Court nominees with empathy for their fellow human beings must be understood in context. Michael Dorf says judges have a big leg up in dealing with complex Supreme Court issues. Editor's note: Michael C. Dorf is Robert S. Stevens Professor of Law at Cornell Law School and co-author (with Laurence Tribe) of "On Reading the Constitution," and the author of "No Litmus Test: Law Versus Politics in the 21st Century." It is not difficult to see why political experience would be very valuable for a Supreme Court justice.
