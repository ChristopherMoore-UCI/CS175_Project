Fake meat can be especially helpful for people in the early stages of transitioning away from meat -- especially during the holidays. Gardein, another popular maker of meat alternatives, uses wheat and pea proteins as well as ancient grains that include quinoa and kamut, Patalsky said in a 2010 blog post. She points to ingredients in the Gardein turkey substitute she's eating this season: "Water, soy protein isolate, vital wheat gluten, expeller pressed canola oil, organic ancient grain flour (kamut, amaranth, millet, quinoa), natural flavors (from plant sources), modified vegetable gum, yeast extract, potato starch, sea salt, organic cane sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, pea protein, carrot fiber, beetroot fiber, extractives of paprika and turmeric. And I found the answer in plant meats," she said. So many vegan companies now make plant meats with very high-quality ingredients, resulting in a minimally processed product that's actually nutritious."
