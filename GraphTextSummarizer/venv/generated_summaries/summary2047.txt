Unlike Livermore's explicit position on cheap labor, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina said that HP offshores work because the American educational system doesn't develop good math skills in its students. A few years ago, HP executive Ann Livermore made it plain: "A basic business tenet is that things go to the areas where there is the best cost of production." HP workers, including those being discarded, are among the best in the business, and were whizzes in math when they were in school. To her credit, HP's current CEO, Meg Whitman, conceded that layoffs "adversely impact people's lives." Engineers are exempt employees, hence no overtime pay, and HP will accrue a net reduction in labor costs.
