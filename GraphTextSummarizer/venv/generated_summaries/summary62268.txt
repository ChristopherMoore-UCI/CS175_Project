In fact, it is not just Democratic voters who are emboldened by Warren's fight for working families; her ideas ring true in red states and blue states, in rural parts of America and in big cities like Boston and Chicago. Millions of Americans are ready to tackle climate change, solve our student debt crisis and ensure women get equal pay for equal work. In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of Americans have joined a growing chorus urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president. Here is why: Even Democrats who support other candidates acknowledge that big banks and other special interests have rigged the game in Washington. Still, even if all of the naysayers are somehow on to something, the folks supporting "Run Warren Run" -- MoveOn.org, Democracy for America, and the Working Families Party -- and "Ready for Warren" have it right.
