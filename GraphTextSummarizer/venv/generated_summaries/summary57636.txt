-- Watching the Olympics, which kick off in earnest Friday with the opening ceremony in London, is more fun when you know the stories behind the Games. Low-tech suits: We tend to think of the Olympics becoming higher-tech over time, but new technologies of course bring controversy and questions about how much help athletes should receive from space-age materials and equipment. "This design cuts the need for the spikes on athletes' running shoes to penetrate the running surface." Prosthetics: Called "Blade Runner" and "the fastest man with no legs," South African Oscar Pistorius will be the first person to compete in the able-bodied Olympics using prosthetic legs. In a YouTube video about new photo tech, Getty says it will shoot some of the Olympics in 3-D. Souped-up sound: If you like to believe in the Tooth Fairy, don't read the next sentence: Much of the sound you hear on TV during the Olympics isn't real -- well, at least in the sense that some of it wasn't recorded during the event being shown. Jump-kick sensors: Taekwondo has been at risk for being eliminated from the Olympics, but technology that registers the strength and accuracy of kicks may save the sport.
