A Washington Post story from last December said administration "officials quietly directed immigration officers to bypass backlogged immigration courts and time-consuming deportation hearings whenever possible" in order to break the record for fiscal year 2010. A record number of people were deported from the United States last year, federal officials announced Tuesday. "There certainly has been a tremendous uptick in state activity in the realm of immigration enforcement" in recent years, said Greg Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. " Producing new deportation records -- however slim the margin -- appears to be a priority for the Obama White House. Nearly 400,000 individuals were removed from the country in fiscal year 2011, which ended September 30, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
