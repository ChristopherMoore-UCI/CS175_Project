Meet the man behind the government shutdown DIVIDED GOP What we know: The GOP is almost two parties these days -- call them standard Republicans and tea party Republicans. Republican divisions force delay in Boehner's debt strategy What we don't know: How united will Republicans stay as the government shutdown lingers, as government workers go without paychecks and as the spotlight focuses on a Congress that can't govern or members that can't even agree to talk to one another. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called the strategy as "just another wacky idea by tea party Republicans." The survey taken before the shutdown said most Americans would blame congressional Republicans: Sixty-nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party's elected officials were acting like "spoiled children." President Barack Obama chimed in Tuesday, calling the Republicans "reckless" and saying they're holding the nation hostage to defund Obamacare.
