Liverpool briefly threatened when Torres fired over the bar from an acute angle and Chelsea suffered a blow when captain John Terry received a yellow card for a late challenge on Reina, meaning he will be suspended for the second leg at Stamford Bridge next week. With Barcelona thrashing Bayern Munich 4-0 in Wednesday's other match, a Chelsea v Barcelona semifinal looks assured unless Liverpool manage an unlikely win next week. Fellow-Ivorian Salomon Kalou slipped the ball into his path but Drogba's shot was kept out by goalkeeper Pepe Reina. From then on, Chelsea were in cruise control and a dispirited Liverpool could have fallen further behind had Malouda and Salomon Kalou converted last chances for the visitors. The second half saw much of the same with Liverpool on the back-foot as Chelsea pressed forward and they nearly added a second in the 51st minute when Frank Lampard's pass put Drogba clear again.
