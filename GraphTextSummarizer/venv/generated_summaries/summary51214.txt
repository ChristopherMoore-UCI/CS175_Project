No details have been made public, but the Bowles-Simpson commission's report in December included reforms of entitlements including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid while also calling for revenue increases through tax reform and spending cuts, including in the military budget. Republicans will not move forward on a measure to raise the country's debt ceiling unless "it is accompanied by serious reforms that immediately reduce federal spending and end the culture of debt in Washington," House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said this week. While the issues are not necessarily linked, congressional Republicans are demanding significant fiscal reforms, such as a balanced budget amendment and mandatory spending caps, in exchange for their necessary support to raise the debt limit. Repeating past calls for ending subsidies for oil companies and restoring higher tax rates for the highest-income Americans, Obama defended what he called his balanced approach to deficit reduction and depicted the Republican stance as favoring the well-to-do. Obama and Democrats want to separate the debt ceiling and fiscal reform issues to avoid spooking markets and trade partners, arguing that such a vital issue should be free of any possible political drag.
