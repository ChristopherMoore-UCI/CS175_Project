Singapore is eager to attract wealthy investors like Saverin, and offers plenty of tax incentives and even permanent residency for big investors. According to Singapore- based "Wealth-X" which gathers information on "ultra high net worth individuals," Saverin's estimated tax savings are "at least $39 million as a result of renouncing U.S. citizenship." Saverin's spokesman denies the move was done for tax reasons. Whatever drew him to Singapore, Saverin can find lots of ultra-rich company here. So depending on the size of his actual stake in Facebook, Saverin stands to realize substantial tax savings on any stock sales. It was also recently revealed that Saverin, who was born in Brazil, gave up his U.S. citizenship a few months ago and became a permanent Singapore resident.
