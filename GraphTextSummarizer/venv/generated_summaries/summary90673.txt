In fact, Americans spend so much time in their cars, the "out-gassing" of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from new car interiors and new car seat parts like the steering wheel, dashboard, seats and carpets are a big concern as these are known contributors to acute and long-term health problems. Unfortunately, with the auto industry slowdown on the minds of car execs and politicians, combating indoor air pollution in new cars is not getting much play. Using portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) technology, The Ecology Center tests almost 300 new cars and car seats for toxic chemicals like bromine, chlorine, lead and heavy metals. Toluene can affect the nervous system, causing weakness, confusion, fatigue, vision and hearing loss, nausea and memory loss. To reduce indoor air pollution in all of its vehicles, Gates noted Chrysler has been evaluating passenger compartment air quality regularly and "consistently screens materials and products, including new products, for their effects on air quality." "Chrysler is just plain ignorant of the science," retorted The Ecology Center's Gearhart.
