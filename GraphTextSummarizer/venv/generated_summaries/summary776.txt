Cheating on a proficiency exam involving intercontinental missile launch officers at the Global Strike Command at Malmstrom Air Force base in Montana apparently was carried out around last August and September by text and appears to be the largest incident of its kind, the Pentagon said. "This is absolutely unacceptable behavior and it is completely contrary to our core values in the Air Force and as everybody here knows,  the No. 1 core value for us is integrity," Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told reporters. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh indicated there are enough officers on hand to securely maintain the nuclear missiles in Montana. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel "was deeply troubled" to learn of the allegations and "he strongly supports the aggressive steps the Air Force is taking in response to them,"  Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement. All those disciplined in the investigation are no longer certified to conduct nuclear operations.
