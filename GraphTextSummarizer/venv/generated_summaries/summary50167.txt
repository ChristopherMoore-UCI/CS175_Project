As one regent member walked out, students lining his path shouted, "Shame on you, shame on you." Protesting students said the hike will hurt working and middle-class students who benefit from state-funded education. About 26 percent of the $20 billion spent each year by the system comes from the state's general fund coupled with tuition and fees paid by students, according to a summary on the regent's Web site. At UC Berkeley on Friday morning, students occupied the second floor of Wheeler Hall, UC Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said. The second hike kicks in next fall, raising tuition to $10,302, said university spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka.
