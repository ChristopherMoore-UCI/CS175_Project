-- Federal authorities are investigating threatening letters allegedly containing deadly ricin in Spokane, Washington, the FBI said Thursday. In an apparently unrelated case, ricin-tainted letters sent to President Obama and others touched off high anxieties in Washington and elsewhere last month. The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are trying to find the source of the two letters, intercepted Tuesday during a screening procedure at a postal facility in Spokane, FBI spokeswoman Ayn Sandalo Dietrich said. Postal Service management told employees they weren't at risk from handling the letters because the suspected substance was not in a form that could be inhaled or readily ingested, the union said. One letter was addressed to the Spokane Post Office and the other to a federal judge in Spokane, the union said.
