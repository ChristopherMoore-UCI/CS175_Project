The Centers for Disease Control will test samples to confirm the illness and determine from which strain the people were sickened, said CDC spokeswoman Candice Burns Hoffman. Cholera is a "nationally notifiable" disease, she said, and samples from all suspected U.S. cases are sent to the CDC for lab testing and confirmation. None of the three adults had to be hospitalized, said Erin Hughes, spokeswoman for New York City's health department. The Dominican Republic is investigating the outbreak at the wedding, Hoffman said. "It's not uncommon for cholera outbreaks, like the one that has moved rapidly through Haiti, to spread to other countries," Hoffman said.
