It left him in a tie for second with England's Danny Willett and Richie Ramsay of Scotland at eight-under, two shots adrift of defending champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden, who followed a first round 68 with a fine 66. A first round 66 had left him in the joint lead with playing partner Shane Lowry of Ireland. But the Northern Irishman, who has already wrapped up the Race to Dubai, failed with the putt to encapsulate a day of missed opportunities. This also included England's Justin Rose, who carded a six-under 66, but like McIlroy could only make par on the final hole after finding the water with his opening drive. McIlroy could even afford a wry smile -- "a fat, low, duck-hook runner that was not intentional," was his verdict after the round -- before normal impeccable service was resumed.
