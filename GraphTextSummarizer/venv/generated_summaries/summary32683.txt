Tunisia defeated their rivals in the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations final -- and they once again had bragging rights thanks to goals in either half from Khaled Korbi and Youssef Msakni. And Tunisia doubled their lead 15 minutes from time when substitute Msakni evaded two challenges to score his first goal for his country. The 40,000 capacity stadium also hosted the second group C encounter, with Tunisia beating north African neighbors Morocco 2-1. And they doubled that advantage on the stroke of half-time when Nguema nodded in from close range after Aubameyang's own header was only parried by the goalkeeper. However, just four minutes later, Morocco were finally undone when Korbi's dipping free-kick evaded the defensive wall and went in off the upright.
