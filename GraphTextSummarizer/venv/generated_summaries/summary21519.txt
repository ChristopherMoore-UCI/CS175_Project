Scalia said 39 states allow juveniles to receive life without parole for certain murder offenses. There are about 2,500 prisoners serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles, at least 79 of whom are 14 years or younger, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, which is representing the two men before the high court. Then, five years later, the justices said juveniles found guilty of non-homicides could not receive life without parole. All children are encumbered with the same barriers that this court has found to be constitutionally relevant before imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty," said Stevenson, who is based in Montgomery, Alabama. "You would say that a person of 17 years and 11 months, who commits the worst possible string of offenses -- and demonstrates great maturity -- still cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole?" asked Alito, sounding skeptical.
