-- A U.S. Foreign Service officer has been charged in a visa fraud conspiracy in which Vietnamese citizens paid between $20,000 and $70,000 per visa, according to court documents Michael Todd Sestak, 41, appeared in federal court in Washington Tuesday and will remain in jail pending further court proceedings. Sestak was visa chief at the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City and allegedly started to approve visas for a fee beginning in March 2012. Sestak allegedly received several million dollars in bribes for approving visas he knew were based on fraudulent information. They also encouraged people to enter the United States on tourist visas, overstay the visas and remain in the U.S., according to prosecutors. Sestak allegedly worked with co-conspirators who advertised visas for people who were unable to get them on their own or had been turned down.
