-- A rifle-wielding white supremacist entered Washington's Holocaust museum on Wednesday afternoon, fatally shooting a security guard before being wounded himself by return fire from other guards, authorities said. "I am shocked and saddened by today's shooting at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum," said President Obama, who just days earlier had spoken emotionally about the Holocaust when he visited Buchenwald, a former Nazi concentration camp with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel. Stephen Tyrone Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, later "died heroically in the line of duty," said Sara Bloomfield, museum director. Witnesses: 'Panic' inside museum Â» She said the museum was closed for the remainder of the day and would remain closed Thursday in honor of Johns. " A place that stimulates visitors to confront hatred and promotes peace and human dignity, the Holocaust museum on Wednesday became the scene of everything that was opposite.
