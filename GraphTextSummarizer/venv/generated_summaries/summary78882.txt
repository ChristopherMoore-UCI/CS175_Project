In fact, the rate of female homeless vets is increasing in the United States, according to the federal government and groups that advocate for homeless people. -- When Iraq war veteran Angela Peacock is in the shower, she sometimes closes her eyes and can't help reliving the day in Baghdad in 2003 that pushed her closer to the edge. The Senate is considering legislation to provide care and services for homeless veterans with children. Experts say that Peacock's profile is similar to that of many female veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Funds totaling $75 million from the VA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2008 made vouchers available for 10,000 units of permanent housing for homeless vets in all 50 states.
