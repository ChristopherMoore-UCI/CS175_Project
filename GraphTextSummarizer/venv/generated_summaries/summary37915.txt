Gandolfini was never less than powerful, director Geoffrey Fletcher said Thursday. A day later he received a check in the mail for the same amount of money for "The Sopranos," Gandolfini told Fletcher. Imagine James Gandolfini as a man weary of the world -- resigned to the fact that his remaining days will be filled with regret and longing. Gandolfini shared a personal story, which Fletcher said he feels compelled to share because he believes it says so much about the actor's character. Gandolfini told Fletcher he gave his friend the money.
