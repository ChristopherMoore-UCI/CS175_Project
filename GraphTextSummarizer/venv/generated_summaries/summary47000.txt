South Africa last month launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front. In a statement on his website, President Jacob Zuma said that Mandela is responding well to treatment. -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela will remain in a Pretoria hospital through Christmas, the government said on Monday. Mandela has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa. He was hospitalized for a lung infection on December 8; and on December 15, he had successful endoscopic surgery to have gallstones removed.
