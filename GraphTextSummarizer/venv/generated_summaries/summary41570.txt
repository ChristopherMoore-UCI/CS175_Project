Sen. Hagel promised he would provide senators access to all available information about his record and Sen. Kirk remains hopeful Sen. Hagel will keep his word," according to the statement. Two former senators, who left office in the same year as Hagel, also have archives housed at public universities which are not open to the public or researchers yet. "The University of Nebraska flatly denied a direct request from our office that they provide access to the archives to Senate staff and journalists," a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk (R- IL), said in an e-mailed response to CNN. The archives of Sen. Pete Domenici and Sen. Ted Stevens are kept by the library at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, respectively. Official documents, correspondence and other papers from the period of time Chuck Hagel held his U.S. Senate seat are closed to public viewing by the archives entrusted to hold them.
