In a ritual that would terrify most mothers, Indian villagers have cheered as screaming babies were dropped from a 50-foot temple tower. "The state has to interfere," said Sanal Edamaruku, founder and president of Rationalist International and the Indian Rationalist Association. For 500 years, worshippers at a Muslim shrine in western India have continued the tradition -- a rite considered to bring good health and good luck to the children. Parents who want their infants to participate in the event first take a vow at the Baba Sheikh Umar Saheb Dargah, or temple. Â» It also takes place elsewhere in the country, mostly in smaller villages, on special occasions.
