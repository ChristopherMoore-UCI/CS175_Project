It's oil-soaked dirt, but in a world that is constantly scraping the bottom of the fossil fuel barrel, tar sand is oil enough to warrant a mad frenzy to extract. We thought that since you were feeling absolutely dejected watching BP's underwater gusher spoiling the ecology and economy of the Gulf of Mexico, well, we would try to cheer you up by reminding you how the otherwise environmentally conscious Canadians are degrading their own natural splendor and national soul with oil spillage and seepage on purpose. Bitumen -- A.K.A. tar sand -- is barely oil. Traditionally, the only way to get oil from the dirt has been to cook it. The Alberta tar sands must be the dirtiest "last chapter" of our century-long fascination with oil.
