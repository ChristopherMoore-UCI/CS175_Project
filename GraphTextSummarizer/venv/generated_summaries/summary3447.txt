While social media was gossiping about Obama shaking hands with Castro, Obama chastised leaders who would praise Mandela's racial reconciliation yet oppose the most modest reforms to end economic injustice and inequality. Obama also hit the hypocrisy in all of us, but especially in world leaders (including himself, he said) who would praise Mandela but then not walk the walk that Mandela walked. Respect for Mandela and his family required Obama to be polite. Obama's words made me proud as an American and as a person; they resurrected Mandela's spirit. As Obama reminded us, "There is a word in South Africa -- ubuntu -- that describes [Mandela's] greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us."
