The new policy, which was intended to ensure public health while maintaining effective criminal investigations, was implemented after the department collaborated with public health officials, community-based advocates and other city officials, according to Police Commissioner William Bratton. Condoms will still be confiscated and invoiced by police in other prostitution-related arrests, such as promoting prostitution and sex trafficking, according to the release. The new policy will allow condoms to be held with other personal property that is returned when individuals have been released from custody on cases of prostitution and loitering for the purpose of prostitution, according to Det. "This policy opens the door for individuals in prostitution to stop risking their health for fear of carrying condoms," Sonia Ossorio, president of the Nation Organization for Women, said in the department's press release. A 2010 report by the New York City Department of Health, which was released by Human Rights Watch, found that 57% of sex workers surveyed had had condoms taken away by a police officer.
