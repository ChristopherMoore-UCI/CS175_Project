The Eiffel Tower isn't the most popular place for pictures in Paris, nor is the Empire State Building the top photo destination in New York. More photos are tagged of the Guggenheim Museum and the Tweed Courthouse than the Empire State Building in New York City, according to the poll. At least, that's the case among users of Google's geolocation-oriented photo-sharing website, Panoramio, according to Sightsmap.com, which has ranked 15,000 cities and their attractions according to photos tagged. New York (Guggenheim Museum) 2. New York tops the list as the most photographed -- or the highest Panoramio-penetrated -- city in the world.
