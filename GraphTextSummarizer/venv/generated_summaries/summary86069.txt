Edmonton police were in the process of filing Canada-wide warrants for three counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder against Travis Brandon Baumgartner of Edmonton, said Bob Hassel, superintendent of the Edmonton Police criminal investigations division. Investigators were trying to find Baumgartner because he "is believed to be one of several armoured company employees that attended the U of A around midnight" on Friday "to make a delivery," Edmonton police said in a written statement. Earlier in the day, Canadian authorities said they were searching for Baumgartner as a "person of interest" in the shooting at the university in Edmonton early Friday. Baumgartner is an employee of the security firm G4S, company spokeswoman Fiona Walters told CNN. -- Canadian authorities were preparing Friday to file warrants for murder against a 21-year-old security firm employee in the robbery of an armored vehicle at the University of Alberta that left three other security employees dead and a fourth critically injured, police said.
