A January 25 report by the Valdosta-Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited "no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body. When his son, Kendrick, was found with his body headfirst in a rolled-up gym mat at Lowndes County High School in south Georgia, authorities offered their take on what happened: The 17-year-old had been reaching for his sneaker when he got caught up in it, then suffocated to death. The Johnson family says one way to find out is through a coroner's inquest, a process in which a panel -- after reviewing evidence and testimony -- decides on a cause of death. "Just to know that we're fighting for Kendrick is what gets me up in the morning," his mother, Jacquelyn Johnson, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night. Jacquelyn Johnson says the family is committed to keeping Kendrick's spirit alive.
