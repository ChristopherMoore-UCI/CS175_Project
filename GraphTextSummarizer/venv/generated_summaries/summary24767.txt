Along with winning the "World's Ugliest Dog" contest in 2012 and being declared "Great Britain's Ugliest Dog" by a national newspaper in 2005, Mugly works as a therapy dog in a local hospital and attends a ton of charity events. He helps raise money for small dog rescues in the United Kingdom -- like the one where Nicholson found him. Bev Nicholson is the owner of Mugly and five other dogs. At first glance, Mugly -- a 10-year-old Chinese crested dog -- is a rather unappealing and unfortunate-looking animal. And that is exactly what photographer Bego Anton wants to portray through her pictures of Mugly.
