-- American investigators reviewing a hard drive belonging to the captain of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have found that there were deletions of information even closer to the final flight than first indicated by Malaysian officials, U.S. law enforcement officials tell CNN. U.S. investigators have compiled profiles of the two pilots, based on interviews with friends, neighbors and family members conducted by Malaysian investigators, and on a search of their online activities, U.S. officials say. The type of software used for flight simulation takes up a lot of room in hard drives and investigators believe that could be one reason for deletion of files. It's not clear why Malaysian officials cited the February 3 date and if they knew of the other deletions. They don't know if there was any tampering but it is a worry because Malaysian officials didn't appear to secure evidence immediately.
