-- Ireland's economic problems were expected to dominate Wednesday's regular meeting of European Union economic and finance ministers in Brussels, Belgium. Ireland is forecast to run a deficit of 11.9 percent of its GDP in 2010, and overall, the country is grappling with a running tab of debt that will total 98.5 percent of its entire economy this year, Cowen said. External support to bail out Ireland is one option being considered, but the country must make a request for that to happen -- and Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said so far, he hasn't done so. Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said Wednesday the ministers were "ready to do something which is necessary" to help Ireland. Britain's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, said Wednesday the the country will do what is in its own national interests as regards Ireland.
