Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak On Tuesday, Disney said five Disney employees had been diagnosed with measles, three of whom have fully recovered. When asked for a response, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, "We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated." Forty-two of the state's 59 measles cases since December can be linked to initial exposure at Disneyland and the adjacent Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California Department of Public Health officials said. After Orange County health officials notified Disneyland of the measles cases on January 7, "we immediately began to communicate to our cast to raise awareness," the theme park's chief medical officer, Dr. Pamela Hymel, said in a statement. A woman in her 50s who visited Disneyland in mid-December came down with measles but has since recovered, the Maricopa County Department of Public Health said in a statement Thursday. Last year there was a large outbreak of 380 cases in an Ohio religious community that doesn't usually vaccinate, said Dr. Mark Papania, medical epidemiologist with the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases.
