On Tuesday, Francis Bacon's "Three Studies of Lucian Freud" sold for $142.4 million after six minutes of bidding in the room and on the phone at Christie's in New York, the most expensive piece of art ever auctioned, according to auction house spokeswoman Elizabeth Van Bergen. "'Silver Car Crash' is the most important work of contemporary art we have ever had the privilege to offer, and its exceptional result is a testament to that fact," said Tobias Meyer, worldwide head of contemporary art at Sotheby's and the evening's auctioneer. -- A famously macabre painting by Andy Warhol sold for $105.4 million Wednesday, a record for the famed pop artist and the second-most expensive piece of art ever auctioned, according to Sotheby's auction house. "Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)" was one of several Warhol pieces in the Sotheby's auction Wednesday. The large painting, which measures 8 feet by 13 feet, is one of only four works of that size in the series and the only one remaining in a private collection, according to Sotheby's.
