Landlines and other forms of communication are not as efficient, so Gathungu and millions of others in emerging nations rely on mobile phones. An estimated 17 million Kenyans use mobile phones. Kenya's biggest mobile phone company, Safaricom Ltd., launched the nation's first solar-charged phone this month. After the Solar Guru is in circulation in India, Samsung said, it plans to launch similar phones in other Asian markets, Europe and Latin America. Only about 1.3 million of Kenya's 37 million people are connected to the national electrical grid, said Migwi Theuri, a spokesman for Kenya Power and Lighting Co.
