-- Former Ajax and Tottenham manager Martin Jol has taken over as coach at English Premier League club Fulham. "I know that he will dedicate himself to helping us move forward, and is with us for the long term, to help us build and progress." Meanwhile, Portuguese club Benfica have issued a statement denying that Spanish giants Real Madrid have agreed a deal to sign Fabio Coentrao. " Fulham qualified for next season's Europa League thanks to their standing in UEFA's Fair Play table, and start their qualifying campaign for the tournament on June 30. The London-based club, who reached the final of UEFA's Europa League in 2009 under Roy Hodgson, moved quickly to replace Mark Hughes, who left the club earlier this month. Despite coming so soon after the end of the 2010-11 season Jol, who also had a spell with German club Hamburg, insists he is pleased to be in the competition.
