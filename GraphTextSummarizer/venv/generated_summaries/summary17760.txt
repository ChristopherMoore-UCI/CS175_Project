Louis "Louie" Corbett, 12, who is rapidly losing his eyesight due to retinitis pigmentosa, was in the house to fulfill his final seeing wish: watch his beloved Boston Celtics play a game. " Casey makes the 24-hour-plus trek from his Auckland home to his office in downtown Boston every six weeks. The fact that Casey's company is based in Boston -- the very place Louie was headed -- had nothing to do with why he got involved. When Grousbeck learned that the Corbetts would be coming to Boston for their game on March 5, she realized she would be unable to give Louie her seats because she had given them away. " While Grousbeck made sure Louie and his family had great seats -- practically on the Celtics bench -- she says the real show was the Perkins chorus singing the national anthem.
