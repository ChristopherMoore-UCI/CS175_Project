When the search started, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported that the military became suspicious after Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian. On Friday, the Swedish Armed Forces announced that its investigation confirmed that a submarine was indeed in Swedish waters. Russia denied that it had any vessel in Swedish waters. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven gave a warning to whoever the intruder may have been. A foreign submarine recently trespassed in Swedish territory, officials there said Friday, but they couldn't say what country the vessel belonged to.
