Jarrett Bellini explores South Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The Cape of Good Hope is the southwestern-most point of the African continent, and it's an absolute thing of beauty. But as I was sitting there with a few other hostel folks who, apparently, also found it completely fit to begin ruining their day before nine, a Dutch kid came into the room and offhandedly mentioned that he and two Dutch girls had a car and were driving out to the Cape of Good Hope. Normally, one would simply decline and go about attempting to have a relatively human-like existence on planet Earth. Next thing I know, a glass of tequila is slammed in front of me with a bit of sage bartender advice, "Might as well."
