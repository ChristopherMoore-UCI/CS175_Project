In a response filed Thursday with the Yellowstone County Court, attorney Jay Lansing joined prosecutors in saying that the new hearing would be "without legal authority." The case drew widespread attention when District Judge G. Todd Baugh imposed the 30-day sentence on Stacey Dean Rambold and made controversial comments about the victim, saying she "seemed older than her chronological age. Such a hearing, however, would "create confusion and uncertainty for all parties left to interpret and execute the sentence of Mr. Rambold," Lansing argued. Also Thursday, prosecutors filed an emergency petition with the Montana Supreme Court, asking it to stop the scheduled hearing. "Further, the September 6 hearing, if permitted to be conducted, will undermine the State's appeal and otherwise frustrate the just and orderly administration of ordinary appeal processes," the petition read.
