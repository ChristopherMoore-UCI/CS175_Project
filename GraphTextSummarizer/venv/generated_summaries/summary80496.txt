What we know about storms, sea-level rise and barrier island response can be applied to redevelopment of the New Jersey coast. In fact, these islands owe their very existence to storms and the long-term rise in sea level of the past several thousand years. Taking the dynamic nature of these barrier islands into account as we rebuild after major storms can help reduce the vulnerability of the local infrastructure to the inevitable next big storm. We can either try to thwart the natural response -- requiring increasing investment in construction and maintenance of storm protection structures -- or adapt by relocating farther away from the beachfront and upward as the barrier islands move. Beaches and dunes are the first line defense from ocean waves and storm surge, protecting the island's interior.
