But Pato's fellow Brazilian Ronaldinho set up Inzaghi for a simple headed goal after a clever piece of play and fine cross. Napoli, who are still chasing a Champions League place, had chances to reclaim the lead and home keeper Abbiati had to show his mettle either side of the break. but it was Napoli who went ahead after 13 minutes through Hugo Canpagnaro before Filippo Inzaghi headed the equalizer 13 minutes later. Milan also had opportunities in an entertaining game and Inzaghi and Mancini were denied by fine saves by Morgan De Sanctis. Sampdoria later completed a miserable week for Juventus with a 1-0 home win in the battle for the final Champions League spot. Third-placed Roma are three points adrift but meet Inter next Saturday in a decisive clash.
