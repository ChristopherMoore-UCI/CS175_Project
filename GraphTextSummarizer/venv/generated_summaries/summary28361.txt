We are ready with protocols in place, in particular for adequate screening with the travel history of new patients, providing health care providers with personal protective equipment and ongoing training in its appropriate use, and ensuring rigorous environmental cleaning practices for all patient care areas. Many of the centers that have been set up for dealing with Ebola patients there now use a buddy system to help ensure that everyone puts on and takes off personal protective equipment in the safest way possible, and we are going to be implementing that policy here. SARS also reminded us that many infections may be spread and acquired by patients, visitors and staff in health care settings. We regularly engage our health care providers on the critical importance of knowing how to appropriately put on and remove personal protective equipment. One cannot just rely on the barriers like personal protective equipment.
