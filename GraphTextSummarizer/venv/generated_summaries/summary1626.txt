Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn denied knowing that prostitutes were involved in sex parties he joined, as he took the stand Tuesday for the first time in his high-profile trial on pimping charges. In the years since his New York arrest, Strauss Kahn has spent much of his time trying to clear his name. Taubman says he does not believe Strauss Kahn can or will ever be directly involved in politics or policy making again. 'I don't think I have any kind of problem with women,' Strauss-Kahn says CNN's Jim Bittermann reported from Paris and Sandrine Amiel from Lille, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. The trial of Strauss-Kahn, who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011, opened in the northern French city of Lille a week ago.
