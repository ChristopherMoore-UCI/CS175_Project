Nikkei reports that Toyota hopes to develop a vehicle powered entirely by solar panels. Most agree that there just isn't enough space on a production car to get full power from solar panels. Toyota is the largest automaker to incorporate solar power into a mass-produced car. Eric Leonhardt, director of the Vehicle Research Institute at Western Washington University, said that even if solar cells worked far better than they do today, they wouldn't generate enough power for driving substantial distances. "Solar panels really need a lot of area," he said.
