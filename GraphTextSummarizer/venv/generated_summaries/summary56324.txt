Love is patient, love is kind. When I'm frustrated with my son, or a friend or even myself, I try to think about the characteristics of love described in I Corinthians before reacting. And it's no accident that "patient" is the first word Corinthians uses to describe love -- it's first because it is most important. It may seem weird to think in those terms because many well-meaning Christians also like to use that last phrase to justify oppressing gay people at the polls. But at the very core of the debate over marriage equality is that scripture's concept of love.
