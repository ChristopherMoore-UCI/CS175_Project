" Reporters Without Borders' secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, is due to fly to Athens on Wednesday to meet with ERT employees. They also urged union members to join ERT staff in their demonstration outside the broadcasting headquarters Wednesday. Most of those taking part in the peaceful protest outside ERT's Athens headquarters were employees, but others were ordinary Greeks who turned out in a show of support. The General Confederation of Greek Workers and the Civil Servants Confederation called for a general strike and rally in central Athens on Thursday in support of the ERT journalists. ERT's TV channels and radio services were pulled off the air overnight, although some employees have continued to broadcast via the Internet.
