City doubled their lead six minutes before half-time when defender Micah Richards made a superb run into the Blackburn area -- and was in the right place to fire home when Benjani's shot bounced back off  a post. Benjani also played a part in the third goal, cutting the ball back for Tevez to fire home his second early in the second half. Having blown one chance of a hat-trick, Tevez did not miss a second time when he was set up in stoppage time to score his 11th goal in nine matches. Mancini then watched his side concede for the first time since takling over from Mark Hughes four matches ago when Morten Gamst Pedersen capitalized on a errors by Vincent Kompany and Shay Given to curl home a fine shot. Benjani pounced on the loose ball and Tevez was in the right place to turn home the Zimbabwean's shot with his hip. The result means City jump above Tottenham into the final Champions League place, seven points behind leaders Chelsea.
