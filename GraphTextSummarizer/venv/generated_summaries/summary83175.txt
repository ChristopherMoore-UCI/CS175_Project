-- Lined up next to Pittsburgh police officers protecting a downtown office building Thursday morning were officers who traveled a little farther to get to work. Officers from departments in several cities, including Cleveland, Ohio; Miami Metro Dade, Florida; Baltimore, Maryland; and Chicago, Illinois, were sworn in as part of the massive security effort, but Tucson wins the prize for the greatest distance traveled. Police officers from Tucson, Arizona, left, talk with a Pittsburgh officer Thursday outside the G-20 summit. "There's a standardization in training," Tucson Lt. Paul Sayre said. They were asked to assist by Pittsburgh officials as part of a Department of Homeland Security rapid response team.
