She won best supporting actress for her role in "Tootsie" in 1982 and best leading actress for "Blue Sky" in 1994. Lange, who turns 60 next month, suffered bruised ribs, a broken collarbone and a small cut on her forehead, spokeswoman Leslee Dart said Wednesday. Lange began her movie career in 1976 playing King Kong's love interest in the 1976 version of "King Kong" but later was nominated for six Oscars -- two of which she won. Actress Jessica Lange took a tumble in her Minnesota vacation cabin Tuesday, but a publicist said her injuries were not serious. "She will be completely fine and expects to be released from the hospital imminently," Dart said.
