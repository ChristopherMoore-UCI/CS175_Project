According to a fact sheet presented by Alabama House Republicans, the   bill requires law enforcement officers "to attempt to determine the   immigration status of a person who they suspect is an unauthorized   alien of this country." -- Several prominent civil rights groups filed a class action lawsuit Friday challenging Alabama's new anti-illegal immigration law, the latest such legal effort aimed at similar bills passed in various states. Republican state Rep. John Merrill told CNN in June that the legislation is "good for Alabama" because it will  reduce illegal immigration to the state and "provide equal opportunities for all people who want to come to Alabama legally." " Suzanne Webb, a spokeswoman for Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, said by e-mail Friday afternoon that her office had yet to get a copy of the complaint, and thus had no comment on the specifics. That group allied with several other groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, National  Immigration Law Center, Asian Law Caucus and  Hispanic Interest  Coalition of Alabama.
