A psychiatrist for the defense also testified that Ragusa has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Her attorney, Robert Herce, asked the judge to sentence her to probation with time served, saying she has spent more time behind bars than other people who have faced similar charges. Tharpe also sentenced Ragusa to 15 years of sex offender probation following her prison time. Ragusa, 31, pleaded guilty in April to three counts of lewd and lascivious battery in a March 2008 case involving a 14-year-old boy, and two counts of having unlawful sex with a minor in an April 2008 case involving a 16-year-old student. "It's ... one of those things you have to take to the grave," Ragusa says on the tape, explaining that sex crimes involving minors have no statute of limitations.
