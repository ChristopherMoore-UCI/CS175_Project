The Greenfield police statement said arranged marriages between young girls and older men "have become a local problem." In exchange, Galindo was to pay Martinez $16,000 and provide him with 160 cases of beer, 100 cases of soda, 50 cases of Gatorade, two cases of wine, and six cases of meat, Greenfield Police Chief Joe Grebmeier told CNN. Marcelino de Jesus Martinez, 36, of Greenfield, California, was arrested Monday and booked into the Monterey County Jail, Greenfield police said in a statement. The girl was reported as a runaway juvenile on December 18, Grebmeier said, and police took a missing-persons report and put out a flier. Martinez was arrested Sunday after undergoing additional questioning by police, Grebmeier said.
