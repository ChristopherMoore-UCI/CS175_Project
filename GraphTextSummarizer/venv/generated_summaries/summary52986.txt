In the wake of family's revelations about the hard drive, Singapore police on Friday asked the FBI for assistance pertaining to evidence on U.S. soil. Singapore police have been investigating Todd's death as a suicide by hanging. Rick Todd, an airline pilot whose wife told him of his son's death right after he flew a long flight, said: "I just, just screamed in the airport." Shane Todd worked for the Institute of Microelectronics in Singapore from December 2010 until his resignation last May 2, the government research institute said. After his death, Todd's parents found that his hard drive contained a proposal between the Singapore outfit and a prominent Chinese telecom firm, Huawei, to build a powerful amplifier using gallium nitride technology. Bruises also indicated that Shane Todd was trying to squeeze his hands under the wire, the family said.
