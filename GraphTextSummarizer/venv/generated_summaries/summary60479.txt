" Before we leave him Kunstmann tells us that the UX have several more projects in mind but, unsurprisingly perhaps, he declines to elaborate saying future plans have to be kept under wraps. Paris has two main underground attractions -- one being a vast catacomb which holds the remains of more than six million people, the other being a network of tunnels and quarries that stretch nearly 321 kilometres under the city. Our program was looking as all aspects of underground life in Paris and in the process of researching it we also came across another extraordinary group who put the subterranean spaces to new uses. At the official catacombs visitors who are prepared to walk down the 139 steps and along endless tunnels are met by truly extraordinary sights as well as a fascinating slice of 18th-century life in Paris. Much later, at the same time as wanting to learn more about all this public space, to have a geographic and practical knowledge - that is by getting hold of maps and keys to use the tunnels - we realized this really was the ideal location for numerous projects.
