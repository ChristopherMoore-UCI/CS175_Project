The infamous meat dress Lady Gaga was grilled for wearing at the MTV Video Music Awards last year will be unveiled Thursday as the main course in a sizzling new display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. "It was then placed in a vat of chemicals and, while still pliable, was put on a body form and allowed to dry." To keep the dress from looking like a large collection of beef jerky, it was painted to look like fresh meat. Gaga, who was campaigning at the time in support of repelling "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," told Ellen DeGeneres that the dress represents equality, saying "Equality is the prime rib of America. It will join the "Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power" exhibit at the hall in Cleveland, Ohio. The dress, once made of juicy cuts of raw Argentinean beef, was treated and preserved by a taxidermist over a number of weeks.
