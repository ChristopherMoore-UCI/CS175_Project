Beckham signed for the Qatari-owned club Thursday to much fanfare, but having not played a competitive match since the end of the Major League Soccer season two months ago needs time to acquire full fitness. In other European football action Friday, Roma saw their hopes of European qualification dented with a 4-2 home loss to Cagliari, while Werder Bremen beat Hannover 2-0 in a mid-table clash in Germany. Beckham, who has promised to donate his salary to local children's charities, revealed he had offers from several other clubs, including some in the English Premier League. The Argentina star had been on target in PSG's 3-1 French Cup win over the same opponents last week and the result never looked being any different despite Toulouse's home advantage. The home side's Cheikh M'Bengue was sent off for a second yellow card just before the break and further strikes from Mamadou Sakhou and Gregory van der Weil put the three points beyond doubt for the table toppers.
