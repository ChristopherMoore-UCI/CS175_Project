"For every decade of life, if you look at a population ... cancer rates go up the older you are," said Dr. Otis Brawley, the chief medical and scientific officer and executive vice president of the American Cancer Society. A deep scientific analysis of available medical data through 2010 showed a 20% increase in the rate of cancer cases for 9/11 rescue and recovery workers when compared to the general population, according to Mount Sinai. Some reports suggest the number of cancer cases in this group has doubled since last year. That much is clear, according to the U.S. government, which set up a special World Trade Center Health Program.
