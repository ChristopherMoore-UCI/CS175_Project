There is some good news: The number of federally qualified health centers that provide dental care have increased, and 41 of 50 states have state oral health plans. Some states' Medicaid programs cover adult dental care. Truett's organization published the report "State of Decay: Are older Americans coming of age without oral health care?" which shows that baby boomers -- who have, for the most part, kept their natural teeth -- could be facing some serious oral health problems over the next decade. Dental care for adults, however, is not included, and experts say we've got a potential oral health care crisis coming. However, of the 17 states that received a "poor" grade for dental care, the majority are led by Republican governors who have refused or are leaning against expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
