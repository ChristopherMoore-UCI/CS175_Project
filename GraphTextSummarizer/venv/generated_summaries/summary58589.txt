"The unavailability of pertinent counseling center records during more than two years of investigation and review has created needless uncertainty and understandable speculation that has compounded the suffering of the survivors, families and the Virginia Tech community as a whole," the university said in a statement. "The family has consistently favored and urged disclosure of their son's and brother's records in the interest of advancing the investigation into the tragic events of April 16, 2007, as well as ensuring that the families of the victims have as much information as possible," said family attorney Bernard DiMuro in a letter to Mike Melis, Virginia assistant attorney general. "As we know, Cho never called or returned to the Cook Counseling Center, and more than a year elapsed between the time he was evaluated by counseling center professionals and the tragic events of April 2007. In each of the three evaluations at the Cook Counseling Center, Cho "explicitly denied any intent to hurt himself or others and there was no evidence to the contrary," Virginia Tech said in its statement. He was sent to the facility on a temporary detention order, the records indicate, after a female student filed a complaint with university police that Cho had been instant-messaging her and left a message on her dry erase board.
