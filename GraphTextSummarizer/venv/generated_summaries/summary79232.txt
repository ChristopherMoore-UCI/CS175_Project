If people with other psychiatric illnesses had a propensity to violence, then discontinuing drug use "could make them irritable, and that could be one trigger," said Stotland, who has accepted speaking fees from the drug industry, but not in recent years. Prozac, which has been available in the United States for more than 20 years, is one of a class of drugs called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.

A spokesman for Prozac drug maker Eli Lilly and Co. said the cause of the killing spree may remain elusive. -- The revelation from Steven Kazmierczak's girlfriend that he had stopped taking an antidepressant a few weeks before his rampage at Northern Illinois University has reopened debate about whether the drug can cause violent behavior.
