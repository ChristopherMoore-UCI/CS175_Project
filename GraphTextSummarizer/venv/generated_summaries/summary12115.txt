Dudley released a statement Thursday noting "several inconsistencies" in the NTSB report and claiming the cause of the crash was due to an unanticipated "loss of tail rotor effectiveness." However, the NTSB report cited a post-accident interview in which the front-seat passenger said Dudley did not ask for anyone's weight nor did he execute any paperwork, or perform any calculations before takeoff. The final report from the NTSB is expected to be released within the next few months and it will officially state the probable cause of the crash, according to Keith Holloway, public affairs officer of the agency. The pilot Paul Dudley, 56, reported that he had calculated the total load at takeoff to be 1,131 pounds. It was reported at the time of the crash that the flight was to take friends visiting from abroad on a sightseeing flight around New York City.
