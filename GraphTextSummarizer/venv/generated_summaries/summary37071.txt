-- Only hours after she was freed from prison Wednesday, Pussy Riot member Yekaterina Samutsevich vowed to continue the kind of political protest act that led to her imprisonment this summer for "hooliganism" alongside two fellow band members. The Russian punk band members were sentenced in August for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February. She said the band's cathedral protest had been intended as a criticism of the support given by senior members of the Russian Orthodox Church for a third presidential term for Putin. But in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Samutsevich said the punk rock band still has work to do in opposing Putin. Meanwhile, her "negative" attitude toward Putin and what she calls his "mega authoritarian project" remains unchanged, Samutsevich said.
