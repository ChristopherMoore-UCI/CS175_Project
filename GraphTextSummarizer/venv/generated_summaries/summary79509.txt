" Their work focuses on tiny bubbles inside cells called vesicles, which move hormones and other molecules within cells and sometimes outside them, such as when insulin is released into the bloodstream. Rothman, a professor at Yale University, detailed how protein machinery allows vesicles in cells to fuse with their targets to permit the transfer of molecular cargo. In 2012, the medical Nobel Prize was awarded to Sir John B. Gurdon of England and Shinya Yamanaka of Japan for work on reprogramming cells. Schekman, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, was honored for discovering a set of genes required for the "vesicle traffic." Sudhof, a professor at Stanford University, showed how vesicles are instructed precisely when to release molecules. Disruptions of this delivery system contribute to diabetes, neurological diseases and immunological disorders.
