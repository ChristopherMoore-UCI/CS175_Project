Appeal for both sides Democrats like a $1 billion increase in Head Start funding for early childhood education from its recent low point after forced budget cuts last year. Compromise on the fiscal year 2014 spending bill is a break from years of congressional funding fights that included a government shutdown last October. It calls for 1% increases in the paychecks of federal workers and military personnel, the first raises in three years for most agency workers. The Senate is expected to also pass the so-called "omnibus" bill and send it to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. Current funding under a continuing resolution that extended spending at previous levels expires on Wednesday, and Congress passed a further three-day extension to give the Senate time to vote on the compromise 2014 bill later this week.
