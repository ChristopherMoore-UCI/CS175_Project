-- This might sound a bit nutty, but U.S. researchers are using robot squirrels to learn more about how real ones interact with their main predator, rattlesnakes. "Robosquirrel" joins a growing list of robot creatures created by UC Davis which include a robot lizard -- used to study display behavior in anole lizards in the Puerto Rican jungle. "Snakes will rarely strike a flagging adult squirrel, and if they do they almost always miss," said Rulon Clark, assistant professor of biology at San Diego State University. Research by the late Donald Owings, professor of psychology at UC Davis, observed that rather than scamper off squirrels would approach a snake "head-first in an elongated posture, making flagging movements with their tails." In some cases snakes will leave the area after an encounter.
