On July 14, 2008, 25-year old Luis Ramirez, a father of two, died after being brutally beaten by a group of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, high school football players who yelled racial epithets throughout the beating. Gladys Lim√≥n says justice wasn't done in the trial of two charged in the death of Luis Ramirez. In fact, it is quite encouraging that people of all backgrounds from throughout the country, including the Shenandoah area, have expressed their own outrage at the verdicts and have joined the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund's call for justice for Ramirez. The Department of Justice has initiated an investigation, and we urge it to move forward with federal civil rights charges to provide justice for the death of Ramirez and for our national interest. Indeed, after the verdicts were read, the disregard for the taking of Ramirez's life was again pronounced by the jubilant cheers and applause from the defendants' families and friends that were more fitting for a football game victory than an acquittal from serious criminal charges in the brutal beating and death of another human being.
