Bans and other restrictions on plastic bags are in place in several countries. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, says plastic bags are the second-most-common form of litter, behind cigarette butts. -- Mexico City's thousands of stores went green Wednesday, as amended ordinances on solid waste now outlaw businesses from giving out thin plastic bags that are not biodegradable. Los Angeles is set to impose a ban if the state of California does not enact a statewide 25-cent fee per bag by July. Mexico City stores, such as this supermarket, can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags.
