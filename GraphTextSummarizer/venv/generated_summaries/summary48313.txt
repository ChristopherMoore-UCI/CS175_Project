But according to applications for search warrants unsealed Friday, a confidential informant told police in the days after the death that Atwater had told her he and Lovette entered Carson's home through an open door and forced Carson to accompany them in her car. A partial shoeprint was found on a bank receipt Carson's Toyota Highlander, documenting a withdrawal made from her account by Atwater and Lovette, court documents said. " The witness told police that Atwater said the two got about $1,400 from Carson's account. The informant said she talked with Atwater after a picture was displayed on television showing someone attempting to use Carson's ATM card at a convenience store two days after Carson's body was found. But Orange County, North Carolina, District Attorney Jim Woodall said Friday that the collection and testing done on Carson's body was routine and that authorities do not believe she was sexually assaulted.
