The U.S. military in Japan has charged a Marine with rape and other violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in the alleged sexual assault of 14-year old girl in Okinawa. Tyrone Luther Hadnott, 38, has been charged with the rape of a child under 16, abusive sexual contact with a child, making a false official statement, adultery and kidnapping, the Marines said Friday. The incident also led to tight restrictions, for a time, for American troops and their families at the U.S. base on Okinawa. The rape accusation against Hadnott stirred memories of a brutal rape more than a decade ago and triggered outrage across Japan. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa.
