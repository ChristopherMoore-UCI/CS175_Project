Singh has come under intense attack from opposition lawmakers after a government audit reported the treasury lost up to $31 billion from below-price sale of second-generation wireless spectrum in 2008. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh launched the mobile number portability (MNP) service, a facility that he said would cost a subscriber as less as Rs. 19 or 41 cents. "More of our countrymen have been touched by this revolution than by any other program, product or service in the history of our nation and that too at a pace unprecedented in the world at large," Singh said. Raja, a member of a key regional ally of Singh's Congress party, denies the charges. Today, a number of private players are locked in stiff price wars as they jostle for a pie in what is now billed as the world's fastest-growing telecom market.
