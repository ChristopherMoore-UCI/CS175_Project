On Thursday, snow continued to fall in eastern New Mexico and El Paso, where several road closures and school closures were announced. New Mexico State Police tweeted several road closures and crashes due to "whiteout conditions." Notably, Interstate 10 westbound was closed in Las Cruces, where up to 5 inches of snow was recorded by midday. El Paso, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico, accustomed to only a wintry dusting, were seeing more than their usual share of the white stuff. New Mexico resident Danielle Rodeheaver posted photos on Twitter saying, "I was told when I moved to Las Cruces it's rare that it snows and now I have a snow day. Forecasters are predicting between 1 to 4 inches, with amounts of up to 7 inches in the Guadalupe and Davis mountains in west Texas through Friday morning.
