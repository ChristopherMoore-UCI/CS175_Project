He said he would like to see House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, bring up a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate and put it to a vote, something Boehner has refused to do citing a variety of concerns with the bill. He wants President Barack Obama to hold off using his executive authority to order major immigration changes, which the President is set to announce Thursday. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is breaking with many in his party by urging the White House to give Congress more time to reach an immigration reform agreement. Manchin's concerns are in contrast to the views of many congressional Democrats who are sighing relief that the President has decided finally to go around the gridlocked Congress to help millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. That would be a solution to the problem." Asked whether he would prefer the President not do it by executive authority, he replied, "I would prefer that Congress act, yes."
