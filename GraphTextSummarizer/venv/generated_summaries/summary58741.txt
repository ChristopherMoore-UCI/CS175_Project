Abu Ghaith's defense attorney Stanley Cohen said the defense team has worked as quickly as possible since last summer to secure Mohammed's testimony, but stalling and administrative roadblocks by the Department of Defense made their efforts futile. Abu Ghaith was captured last year after years of being among a group of alleged al Qaeda operatives sheltered in Iran. Mohammed, the admitted mastermind of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, issued a rambling defense of Abu Gaith, who is on trial in New York. In a motion to the court over the weekend, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith's defense team said Mohammed can provide evidence that their client had no knowledge of planned terror attacks and asked that portions of an unsworn, written statement by Mohammed be allowed before the jury even if his testimony was not. Kaplan also noted that the attorneys were offered the opportunity last month to conduct an in-person interview with Mohammed at Guantanamo Bay, but for some reason changed their minds and submitted written questions only.
