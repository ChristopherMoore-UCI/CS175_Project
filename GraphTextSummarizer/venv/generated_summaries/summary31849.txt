"We will show to the world that egress from high altitude is survivable." The main difference is that Baumgartner will start from a standstill, whereas astronauts in a craft like the space shuttle are traveling at orbital speeds close to 18,000 mph when their re-entry begins. " Baumgartner, whose attempt is being financed by energy drink maker Red Bull, has enlisted Kittinger as a consultant. "This is what we want to find out: What happens to the human body when it breaks the speed of sound," Baumgartner said. His attempt will take him to an altitude where the atmosphere ends and space begins -- where blood boils at body temperature, and the air temperature could be as low as minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit. A potential benefit from the mission, he said, would be demonstrating that it is possible to return from space without a spacecraft.
