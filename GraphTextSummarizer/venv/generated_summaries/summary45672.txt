" Democrats keep control of Senate Others are hopeful that more women in Congress will change the discussion of policies affecting women and families. But she said she hopes the Senate will be more reflective of America and the "life experience" of women. "A lot of research has shown that more women in leadership leads to better outcomes for the community," said Tiffany Dufu, president of The White House Project, which trains women for leadership. Women in the 112th Congress made up 17% of both the Senate and the House, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. "This is a big day for gay women in America, and really, for all communities who aren't the typical straight, white, wealthy men elected to Congress," she said.
