"Norman Bridwell's books about Clifford, childhood's most loveable dog, could only have been written by a gentle man with a great sense of humor," said Scholastic Chairman and CEO Dick Robinson. Clifford's friend, Emily Elizabeth, takes her name from one of Bridwell's children. Norman Bridwell, the creator of "Clifford the Big Red Dog," has died, according to his publisher, Scholastic. "Norman personified the values that we as parents and educators hope to communicate to our children -- kindness, compassion, helpfulness, gratitude -- through the Clifford stories which have been loved for more than 50 years. The original Clifford story was about a runty pup who grows into a gigantic dog thanks to Emily Elizabeth's care.
