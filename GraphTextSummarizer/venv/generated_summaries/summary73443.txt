The Web site of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi reported that Mousavi's nephew, Seyed Ali Mousavi, was killed in the demonstrations around noon local time Sunday by a gunshot to the heart. Sunday also is a week to the day since the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Police, wary of the potential that Ashura gatherings could present, were out in full force Sunday to quell disruptions but did not stop demonstrators holding widespread protests. Press TV, meanwhile, late Sunday quoted unnamed police officials as identifying one of the dead as "Seyyed Ali Mousavi. Earlier Saturday, scores of security forces on motorcycles charged protesters on sidewalks whenever they started chanting anti-government slogans, witnesses said.
