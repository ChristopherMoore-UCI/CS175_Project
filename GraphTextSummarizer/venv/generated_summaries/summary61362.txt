Citing a recent New York Times story, FlightView reports: "Many airports, including Denver, Las Vegas and San Francisco, are actually choosing customer satisfaction over ancillary revenue opportunities -- by providing airport visitors with free Wi-Fi access." Once you manage to get on the airport Wi-Fi, access is often spotty and slow. Speaking of cell phones, airports are huge facilities that, I've found, often have cell phone "dead zones" -- even for major carriers like Verizon. And beyond that, airports are missing opportunities to offer vital mobile services that could vastly improve travelers' experiences while they're in transit. I'm surprised that wireless carriers don't seem to be making a concerted effort to ensure good data network coverage at airports, especially at airports with lousy, unreliable, or paid Wi-Fi access. Many airports force travelers to sit through a video commercial or other ads before they will let you access the Internet.
