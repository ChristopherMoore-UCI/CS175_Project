Starting Tuesday, Iran's military will hold five days of air defense drills to assess the effectiveness of its missile defense and weapons systems, Miqani said, according to state-run Press TV. Gen. Ahmad Miqani, commander of the Khatam ol-Anbia Air Defense Base, said Sunday that Iran is working on a radar system to detect low-altitude objects as far as 3,000 km (1,864 miles) away, according to Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency. Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi said earlier this year that Iran's radar systems can now detect any air-borne target, the Fars report said. Besides the new and upgraded radar, all of which will be produced domestically, Iran is also making progress in updating its missile defense systems, according to the Fars report. These announcements come a month after the national defense ministry said Iran had successfully expanded the range of its mid-range Mersad missile defense system.
