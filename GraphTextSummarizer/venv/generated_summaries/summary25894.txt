The German Bundesliga leaders almost leveled the aggregate score when Olic's shot was smothered by United goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar. Nani and Darren Fletcher both went close for United before Van der Sar produced a fine reflex save to keep out Ribery's effort. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, United raced into a 3-0 lead, but goals from Ivica Olic and Arjen Robben saw Bayern progress on the away goals rule as the tie finished 4-4 on aggregate. Bayern were given a lifeline before half-time when Croatian striker Olic shrugged off Michael Carrick and fired past Van der Sar from a narrow angle. United manager Alex Ferguson sprung a surprise before kick-off by naming Wayne Rooney in his starting line-up just eight days after the England striker twisted his ankle during the first leg.
