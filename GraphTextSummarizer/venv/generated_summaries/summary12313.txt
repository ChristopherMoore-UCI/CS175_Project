" Snabe said SAP -- one of the biggest makers of business software in the world -- is well-placed despite the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone. Co-chief executive Jim Hagemann Snabe told CNN he did not expect Greece to exit the common currency -- a scenario which has been dubbed the "Grexit." German software maker SAP's boss says the company is not preparing for a "Grexit" because it expects the crisis-hit eurozone to hold itself together. He said: "I see there is a strong political will to solve the situation around the euro." Greece is a "special situation," Snabe said. However, Snabe added, "no company is immune to the eurozone crisis."
