In Libya, statements about adopting Sharia, or Islamic law, raise concerns about the future. So when Libya's National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil announces that any law contradicting Islamic principles of Sharia are ineffective, it doesn't mean that Libyans will have hands cut off for stealing or women will be forced to cover up head to toe, Moosa said. Part of the problem, he said, is that after three decades of hostage taking, terror threats and attacks by Islamic groups, Western nations now associate Islam with unsavory actions and the word Islamic has taken on a negative connotation. The key is for Western nations to exercise patience, said Akbar Ahmed, a professor of Islamic studies at American University. In the ideal, Islam promises that these rulers must have these virtues." Moosa said he would not be surprised if some time down the line, discordant voices rise up in Tunisia to advocate for what they view as genuine Sharia.
