While the team's work invites immediate comparison with Jurassic Park, where DNA was extracted from amber fossils, Grass says that prehistoric insects encased in amber are a poor source of prehistoric DNA. "The time limit with DNA in fossils is about 700,000 years but people speculate about finding one-million-year storage of genomic material in fossil bones," he said. As with fossils, keeping the DNA cool, dry and encased -- in this case, with microscopic spheres of glass - could keep the information contained in its strands intact for thousands of years. The project, he said, wanted to find ways of combining the possibility of the large storage density in DNA with the stability of the DNA found in fossils. Science is now looking to nature, however, to find the best way to store data in a way that will make it last for millions of years.
