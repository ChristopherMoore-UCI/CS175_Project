Her memorable quotes Hollywood recalls screen legend Lauren Bacall With passing of Bacall, all of Madonna's 'Vogue' icons have died Three weeks into filming Bogart made his move, popping into Bacall's trailer, surprising her with a kiss and then asking for her number, according to Vanity Fair, which spoke to Bacall at length in 2011. Shortly after his divorce from Methot, a 45-year-old Bogart wed Bacall, then 20, at Malabar Farm in Ohio in May 1945. "I fairly often have thought how lucky I was," Bacall told Vanity Fair. The pair first met on the set of 1944's "To Have and Have Not," which was also Bacall's screen debut.
