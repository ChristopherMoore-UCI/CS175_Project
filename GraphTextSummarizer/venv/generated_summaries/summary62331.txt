BA management submitted a formal offer to the union Thursday, Unite said, but added that the offer fails to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery. Unite said union members will be able to vote on BA's offer on the first day of the planned strikes, and if they vote to approve it, the strikes will be canceled. Unite has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut, changes that it has said will damage customer service and the BA brand. "In addition, Unite's plans would cut crew pay and allowances," BA said. The industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions, which BA says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds ($91 million) a year.
