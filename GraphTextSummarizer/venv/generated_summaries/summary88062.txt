One protester, shot last month in the leg and arm by Syrian security forces, was being treated at a hospital in Turkey. "They are attacking the village of Sirmaniya with tanks," opposition activist Ali Hassan said in a phone call to CNN earlier in the day, referring to a village less than 10 kilometers southwest of Jisr Al-Shugur.

Ali Hassan denied Syrian government accusations that the protesters were armed. -- Syrian security forces and helicopters sprayed automatic weapons fire into a crowd of thousands of protesters demonstrating Friday after prayers in the northern town of Maaret al-Nouman, witnesses said.
