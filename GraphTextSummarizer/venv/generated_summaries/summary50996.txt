Disney officials say theme parks, the Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club and off-property resorts have seen some people with decades of experience laid off during the restructuring. Cornett said she does not believe Disney's layoffs will have a significant effect to the area's overall economy, since currently 107,000 people are unemployed in Central Florida. He added that Disney is downsizing just like many other U.S. businesses. Orlando area hotels have been hit hard, too, with fewer tourist and business travelers. Martin said the White House is partly to blame for the dropoff in business meetings.
