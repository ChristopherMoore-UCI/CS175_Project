Among the photographs, which are on file at the Library of Congress, were shots of signs in small towns and large. Words on signs, to young eyes just becoming accustomed to deciphering them, represent official positions. The South is certainly abundantly represented in those photos: a "Colored Waiting Room" sign at the bus station in Durham, North Carolina, a "Colored" sign at one entrance of a movie theater in Belzoni, Mississippi, a "Colored" designation on a sign by a drinking fountain on the lawn of the county courthouse in Halifax, North Carolina, a "White Waiting Room" sign at the bus terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. Such signs, though, well into the 20th century, were an accepted part of the American scene. As a boy growing up in the 1950s, on a vacation trip to Florida with my parents, I saw the signs in neighborhood after neighborhood.
