-- As Republican candidates attack one another on the campaign trail, Republican outside spending groups are taking aim at President Barack Obama over failed energy company Solyndra. " The Obama campaign ad continues, "Independent watchdogs call this president's record on ethics unprecedented" and "President Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and strengthen America's energy economy." Steven Law, CEO and president of American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, explained that voters who are still impressionable include independents, "soft" Democrats and Republicans who voted for Obama in 2008 but now "feel a deep sense of disappointment." Law said his research shows while this group of voters believes the president is "not up to the job," they're still "looking for signs of success" and "want to validate their decision" to vote for him. Since the fall, two Republican outside spending groups have collectively spent $9.4 million on four ads attacking Obama for his administration's $535 million loan to Solyndra. Both parties view Obama's ethical standards and his personal likability among his greatest strengths with voters, and deep-pocketed GOP groups want to change that image.
