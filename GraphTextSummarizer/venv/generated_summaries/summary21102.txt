and so this moment, for me and my team, is a good one," Paulinho told the official Tour de France website. The peloton never threatened to go with the pair and rolled in at their leisure, with Paulinho becoming the first Portuguese stage winner since Acacio Da Silva in 1989. Portugal's Sergio Paulinho won stage 10 to hand Lance Armstrong's RadioShack team their first victory in the Tour de France. The top ten riders in the general classification standings were unchanged meaning race leader Andy Schleck made sure he retained the yellow jersey for another day. Paulinho, who won a silver medal at the 2004 Olympics in the road race, was part of a six-man break and only a determined sprint prevented Kiryienka picking up Belarus' first ever Tour win.
