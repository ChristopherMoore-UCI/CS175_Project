" In June 2009, Davis supporters delivered petitions bearing about 60,000 signatures to Chatham County, Georgia, District Attorney Larry Chisolm, calling for a new trial. "Mr. Davis vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence. ... Davis filed an "original writ of habeas corpus," which allowed him to bypass lower federal courts and make his appeal directly to the high court. Other evidence that Mr. Davis brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors," the court found. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens ordered a federal judge in August 2009 to "receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at trial clearly establishes petitioner's innocence."
