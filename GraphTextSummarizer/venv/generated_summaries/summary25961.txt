One man was plucked from the water by a passing fishing boat but 11 others are missing, according to Hong Kong police. The MOL Motivator was leaving for Yantian in China's southern Guangdong Province from Hong Kong, according to local media reports. The rescued man, a 46-year-old Chinese national, is being treated at a Hong Kong hospital, where his condition is stable. A major search and rescue operation is underway after two cargo ships collided off the coast of Hong Kong early Monday. The Guangdong Maritime Rescue Coordination Center is coordinating the search effort, though a helicopter and a number of rescue vessels from Hong Kong are part of the operation.
