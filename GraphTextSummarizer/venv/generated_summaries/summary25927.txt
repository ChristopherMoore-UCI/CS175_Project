On one side, Anderson Cooper joins a long troupe of people like Ellen DeGeneres, Elton John, Liberace and on back down the line, for which the Great Announcement has got to be seen as made, perhaps, for the sea whelks and the Easter Island statues who don't get CNN at home and don't notice sexuality and its cues. It isn't the face of Anderson Cooper and it isn't even the face of Jesus (who also has great hair). News: Anderson Cooper says he's gay, happy and proud Incidentally, so, too, has being a Roman Catholic in this dark season of Catholic instability, hysteria and political game-playing. On the other side, honesty still takes courage, and one of the things that a bright cunning professional with good hair does when he or she comes out is to encourage other gay or lesbian people with good hair to let it down, too. What I like better than Cooper's admission, or the good reasons he summarizes for making such an admission, is his insistence that even under these circumstances he has a right to a private life, and he intends to invoke those rights.
