I'm not sure Varsha understands what a dance studio is and it's hard to discover her thoughts on many things. Varsha trains for at least two hours every day but says she still has time for other games. She's an adorably cute 5-year-old girl from southern India, small, pretty with big brown eyes. Vinod says what Varsha has done in 3Â½ years takes most people eight years to learn. Unlike her friends, Varsha's gift has given her the chance to see London.
