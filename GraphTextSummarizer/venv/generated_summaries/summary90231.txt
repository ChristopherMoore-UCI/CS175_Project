Mandela was hospitalized early Saturday after the state of his health deteriorated in the last few days, according to spokesman Mac Maharaj. "I think the concern, the anxiety shown by people throughout the world and South Africa is perfectly understandable," Maharaj said. Last year, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front, a testament to his iconic status. "Everything is being done to ensure that he is comfortable and that he is getting better." Maharaj said that the anti-apartheid icon is breathing on his own. "It's easy to serve oneself, own interests, but serving the interests of others, making their lives better changes the quality of all humanity."
