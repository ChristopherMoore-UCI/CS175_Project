Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, vowed not to give up, despite polls showing her well behind Mitch McConnell, the man in line to become the next Senate majority leader. And they also know they have a tough map of Senate seats to defend in 2016 â€” a presidential election year in which Democratic turnout is likely to be higher. Mitt Romney, who two years ago lost the presidency to Obama, travels to Alaska to give GOP Senate candidate Dan Sullivan a last minute boost. The GOP would use Senate control to make him a lame duck during his last two years in power. Likely candidates on both sides are hitting the Senate battlegrounds â€” and boosting their own prospects in 2016.
