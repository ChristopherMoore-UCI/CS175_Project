-- Singer Kelly Osbourne, the daughter of rocker Ozzy Osbourne, checked herself into "a medical facility to address some personal issues," her London publicist confirmed Friday. "Kelly Osbourne has voluntarily entered a medical facility to address some personal issues," spokeswoman Caroline Barrett said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. Their revelation came in an appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live" in May 2004. "We just had to take evasive action very quickly, because the amount of pills that was found in her bag was astounding," Ozzy Osbourne told Larry King. "Her family stands by and supports her." Osbourne was jailed in London in January on a charge of assaulting a British newspaper gossip columnist at a London nightclub last summer.
