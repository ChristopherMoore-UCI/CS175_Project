The top issue, rather, was the percentage of Tel Aviv streets named for women. A veritable firestorm is engulfing the Middle East, and Israel's Tel Aviv is just a short commute from its flash points. Turns out that women's studies scholars and feminist activists have examined Tel Aviv street names and discovered that the overwhelming majority of them are named for men. But on the streets of Tel Aviv, quite possibly the most threatened city on Earth, the cafes and cultural centers are packed, the food is superb and people are arguing why more of those streets are not named for women. Or one can drive east from Tel Aviv and in eight hours reach Iraq, where an estimated thousand people are being killed each month by suicide bombers.
