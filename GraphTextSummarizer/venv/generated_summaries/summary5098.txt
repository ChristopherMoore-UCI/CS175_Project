Shops on the site are selling imitations of the so-called "New Chinese Suits" worn by U.S. President Barack Obama and other leaders at this week's APEC banquet dinner in Beijing. And it's not all about the male leaders -- the longer Chinese button down jackets and traditional long dresses emblazoned with floral embroidery worn by female leaders and the spouses of their male counterparts are also for sale. "They look like shrouds," posted one user, referring to traditional Chinese burial outfits for the dead. As for sales, by noon local time on Friday, only seven orders for the "New Chinese suits" had been successfully placed on Taobao -- no one had ordered the top end $800 suit. Some Weibo users -- a popular Chinese micro-blogging network similar to Twitter -- don't quite see what the designers were going for.
