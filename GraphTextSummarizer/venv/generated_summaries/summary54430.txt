A marine products dealer in Japan plunked down a record $6,125 (Â¥650,000) Friday for a black Densuke watermelon -- grown only on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. As for the buyer, he said he wanted to support local agriculture, according to an official with a local cooperative. The nearly 18-pound (8 kg) watermelon was one of 68 sold as part of the season's initial harvest this year and is one of only a few thousand available each year. The one that sold Friday had dark green skin -- nearly black -- making it look more like a bowling ball than a fruit. Premium melons regularly go for eye-popping amounts there.
