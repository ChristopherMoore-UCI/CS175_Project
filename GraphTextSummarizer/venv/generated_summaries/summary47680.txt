Editor's note: Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, the first openly gay man elected to the House as a freshman, is one of the subjects of the CNN.com series "Freshman Year," in which Polis and new Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, provide firsthand reports of political life. Fortunately, the rapid pace of social progress has made it easier to break barriers than ever before, and although Congress is still far from representative of the population as a whole, the 111th Congress has record numbers of gay members, members of ethnic minorities and women. We never saw ourselves or our relationship as anything different from those of other members of Congress, and while notable, the gender of my spouse has little to do with the overall experience of the congressional life and our "freshman year." Marlon Reis, left, and Rep. Jared Polis talk. Years later, I read of the difficulty he faced as the first African-American major league baseball player -- people sliding in with their spikes up, pitchers beaning him, teammates shunning him.
