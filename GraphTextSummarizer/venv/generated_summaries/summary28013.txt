-- The image of the empty factory has haunted American presidential campaigns for decades, but President Barack Obama tried to flip the picture Thursday night. "I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers, goods that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America," Obama said as he accepted the Democratic nomination for a second term. The sector employed 15.6 million in January 2002, according to BLS statistics, down from about 19.5 million in 1979. And as with other statistics cited during the three-day Democratic convention, it's not quite the whole picture. The facts: American manufacturing jobs peaked in the late 1970s, according to figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
