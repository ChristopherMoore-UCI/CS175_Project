The heavyweight clash before a capacity crowd at the Veltins Arena was expected to be a testing encounter for Jupp Heynckes team, but two goals just short of the hour mark from Tony Kroos and Thomas Mueller eased their passage. Mainz also secured their first win of the season as they beat Augsburg 2-0, while in other matches Fortuna Duesseldorf and Freiburg were goalless and Felix Magath's Wolfsburg drew 1-1 with promoted Greuther Fuerth. German international pair Kroos and Mueller looked dangerous throughout and it was their combination that led to the 55th minute opener. Mueller played in Kroos to beat Lars Unnerstall with a low shot and three minutes later he was also on the score sheet with a fine individual goal. It left Bayern on a maximum 12 points after four games, heading Eintracht Frankfurt, 2-1 winners at Nuremberg Friday, on goal difference.
