To decide if you need to download all three seasons of "Veronica Mars" before getting on a cross-country United flight, check to see whether the new in-flight mobile streaming service is offered by looking at the list of amenities for your flight. On computers, the streaming works with Windows computers running Windows XP and Windows 7. The airline announced the new entertainment system in February and will roll it out on U.S. flights starting in April. United Airlines is adding an option for watching TV during flights that lets passengers stream content directly to their laptop, iPhone, iPad or iPod touch for free. Passengers can watch the movies and shows only while in the air, but United plans on making it work from "gate-to-gate" to reflect recent changes in mobile device policies.
