The captain is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard. Critics have also questioned whether Schettino waited too long to give the order to abandon ship. Giampedroni was the ship's purser, the officer in charge of passenger accommodations and food service. He said he survived by sipping at a soft drink that he caught as it floated by, since the contents had not been contaminated with salt water. Giampedroni told CNN that he was hurt when he was heading back to the muster stations where passengers assembled to leave the ship.
