In announcing his bid for the presidency, Gen. Aliyu Gusau will compete against President Goodluck Jonathan, who appointed Gusau to his national security post earlier this year to help quell religious clashes in the city of Jos. Under Nigerian "zoning" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. -- Nigeria's national security adviser has resigned from his post in order to run in the 2011 presidential election, he told CNN on Sunday. Yar'Adua was elected in 2007 and his southern replacement threatened to halt the north's turn at holding power. However, Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission indicated in a communique Sunday that it could extend the timeline for the election.
