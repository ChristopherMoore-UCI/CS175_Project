Over 20,000 Syrian refugees have moved into Za'atari camp already, and the pace of new arrivals to the camp has more than doubled, with more than 14,000 arriving in the past week alone. Humanitarian aid organizations and UN agencies have been working around the clock to accommodate the sudden increase in new arrivals of refugees, while also working to improve the conditions. -- I've spent the past week working in the Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan, about six miles from the Syrian border. It is not just a discomfort, but it has become a health issue and camp doctors report that they are seeing many cases of respiratory problems, especially in infants and small children, due to the dust. Jordan has inadequate fresh water supplies for its own population, and the refugee community is putting increased demands on an already short supply.
