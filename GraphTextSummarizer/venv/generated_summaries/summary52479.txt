At the beginning of Monday's show, host Chris Harrison offered some kind words about Hill, who was an adventurer who documented his goal of visiting every country in 1,200 days on his website, The Global Odyssey. Harrison, who in addition to hosting the show also serves as one of the producers, talked to Salon about the difficulty in dealing with Hill's death on the reality show. During the show, Hill gifted Dorfman with dolls from Peru -- the first country he had visited outside of the North American continent. Eric Hill, 31, died in April from injuries suffered in a paragliding accident after filming the show. "Eric passed away shortly after concluding his filming on this show," Harrison said.
