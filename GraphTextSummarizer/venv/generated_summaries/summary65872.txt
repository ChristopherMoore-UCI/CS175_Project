Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Obama on Thursday, Pe単a Nieto emphasized the importance of reducing violence, and also the importance of Mexico's relationship with the United States extending beyond the drug war. Before Obama's arrival, a spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border detailed changes in how Mexico cooperates with the United States. Pe単a Nieto said his government remains committed to fighting organized crime, but that the United States and Mexico must "cooperate on the basis of mutual respect, to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in Mexico. "We want to place particular emphasis on the potential in the economic relationship between Mexico and the United States." To achieve that goal, Pe単a Nieto said, the presidents agreed to create a new high-level group to discuss economic and trade relations between the two nations. But even as Obama and Pe単a Nieto pushed to shift the tone more toward trade and economics, security issues loomed large over Thursday's meeting.
