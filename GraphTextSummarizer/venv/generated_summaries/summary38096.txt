A Metro-North train of seven cars derailed while traveling from Poughkeepsie, New York, to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. More needs to be done immediately to improve safety, said Federal Railroad Administration chief Joseph Szabo in a letter to the head of New York's transportation authority after the derailment. The review, which comes after a 60-day safety assessment by the U.S. Department of Transportation's rail agency, said  the focus on punctuality "has had a detrimental effect on safety, adversely affecting the inspection and maintenance of track and negatively impacting train operations. "Currently, no single department or office, including the Safety Department, proactively advocates for safety" at the railroad, and there is no effort to identify or take accountability for safety concerns "The emphasis on on-time performance, combined with the increased volume of train activity, appears to have led managers and supervisors to allow inspections, maintenance and employee training to lapse," the federal inquiry concluded.
