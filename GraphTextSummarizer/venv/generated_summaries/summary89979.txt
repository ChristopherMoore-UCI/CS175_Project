She and a team of food technicians are working hard to improve the quality and the taste of combat food. Â» Troops enjoy mixing and matching MRE items, creating their own culinary recipes. To give troops something to eat on the go, the team at Natick came up with the First Strike Ration, or FSR -- pocket sandwiches and snack food that can be eaten throughout the day. While MREs provide food when there's no way to make it to the mess hall, they are no substitutes for what troops crave. And while they haven't been able to give servicemen and women everything they desire, troops are eating a variety of foods far more appetizing than the canned C-rations of World War II, Korea and Vietnam.
