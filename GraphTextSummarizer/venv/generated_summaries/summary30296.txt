"The difference in internet use between Hispanics and whites is driven in part by the fact that Hispanics tend to have less education and lower incomes than whites," study author Gretchen Livingston wrote. Latinos also lag behind African-Americans in home broadband access but have similar rates of internet and cell phone use, the study found. In sum, what the report found was that "Hispanics and whites who have similar socioeconomic characteristics have similar usage patterns for these technologies." As for broadband use at home, the gap between Hispanics and whites is significant, the study says. Household income is also strongly associated with internet use, the study says.
