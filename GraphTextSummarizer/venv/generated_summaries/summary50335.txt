Along with comments on-site, Chinneck says he regularly receives emails, tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations. Though he tries to avoid the usual traps -- internet comment sections, namely -- Chinneck still receives his share of negative criticism too. When I meet with Chinneck at his psychiatric ward-turned-apartment in Hackney (seriously), Take My Lighting, But Don't Steal my Thunder -- the polystyrene building floating above Covent Garden -- has just been taken down after its three-week run. In South London, a life-size wax house is melting. These are the most recent irreverent installations from Alex Chinneck, the British artist making a name for himself with site-specific works that appeal to the imagination and beg for a photo-op.
