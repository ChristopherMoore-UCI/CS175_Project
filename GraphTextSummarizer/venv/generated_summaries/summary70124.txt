The inquiry, which began in July, will examine how the British Foreign Office "monitors" the Joint Declaration signed between the UK and China 30 years ago when the countries agreed the transfer of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule. The committee had planned to travel to Hong Kong in late December to assess "British diplomatic work" in the Chinese territory, amid increasingly heated scenes between pro-democracy campaigners and police. " "China said many times to Britain it resolutely opposed the so-called delegation of the British parliament's foreign affairs committee going to Hong Kong for a so-called investigation and asked they cancel the visit." "If certain British MPs are bent on doing this, that's what is meant by overt confrontation and this is not beneficial for Sino-British ties," she added. British Prime Minister David Cameron was reported to have expressed concern on Monday about China's refusal to allow a Foreign Affairs Committee entry to Hong Kong. He said China's Deputy Ambassador to the UK Ni Jian had told him: "Hong Kong came back to China 17 years ago, it is a Chinese territory and we oppose any interference in its internal affairs.
