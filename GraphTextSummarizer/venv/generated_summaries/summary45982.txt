LaBeouf ran into trouble with the law in New York last week when, police said, he lit a cigarette in a Broadway theater. "Contrary to previous erroneous reports, Shia LaBeouf has not checked into a rehabilitation facility but he is voluntarily receiving treatment for alcohol addiction." LaBeouf, a former child actor, had his first mug shot taken in 2007 when he was 21 and refused to leave a drugstore after a security guard said he was intoxicated. The "I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE" actor of "Transformers" fame, Shia LaBeouf, is not going into rehab, but he is getting treatment for alcohol addiction, according to a statement by his representatives. Witnesses said LaBeouf yelled at the actors on stage during a performance of "Cabaret." Earlier this year he appeared at the Berlin Film Festival with a paper bag over his head that proclaimed in black marker, "I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE," a phrase he also tweeted daily for weeks.
