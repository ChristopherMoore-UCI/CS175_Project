Tests in Hong Kong last week showed eggs exported by a Chinese company are contaminated with excessive levels of melamine. Poultry products, including eggs, may be contaminated with melamine through animal food. The state-run Nanfang Daily published an investigative story saying that adding melamine into animal feed has become an "open secret." The report said adding melamine into feed started in the aquatic farming industry five years ago, as a way of faking higher protein levels. They are shocked and scared by the news headlines: some food produced in China is tainted with melamine.
