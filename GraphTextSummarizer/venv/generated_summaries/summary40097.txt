-- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is denying allegations of "abusive behavior" and "volcanic eruptions of foul temper" ahead of the publication of a new book by a top British political journalist. The Cabinet Office, a part of the civil service, issued a strongly-worded denial that Sir Gus O'Donnell had looked into Brown's behavior or warned him about it. He's demanding of himself, he's demanding of people around him," Mandelson said on the BBC's "Andrew Marr Show" on Sunday. "These malicious allegations are totally without foundation," Brown's official spokesman said in a statement Saturday. Before the publication of the excerpts from the book, there were rumors it would allege that Brown had hit staffers, which he denied Saturday.
