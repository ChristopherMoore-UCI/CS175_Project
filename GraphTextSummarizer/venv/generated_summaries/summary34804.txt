"In just a few years the Obama administration has put in place some of the most important public health protections since the passage of the Clean Air Act, achieved historic fuel economy standards that will save billions of barrels of oil and over a trillion dollars for families, while also expanding the clean energy economy, creating jobs, keeping America competitive, and putting our country on track to double renewable energy generation from sources like wind and solar in the president's first term," Clark wrote. An onshore pipeline would be less likely to be interrupted by hurricanes than oil delivered by oil tankers or from offshore oil rigs, Prescott said. On a cloudy day last month Hight, a former member of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, took a huge career risk and joined more than 1,200 protesters who were demanding that President Obama deny a building permit for Keystone XL, a planned oil pipeline that would stretch from Alberta, Canada, to Texas. Many other Obama supporters have found themselves critical of the president's environmental policies. Gene Karpinski of the League of Conservation Voters -- which endorsed Obama in 2008 -- said the administration was "caving" to industry and the president's decision was a choice to "punt." Former Obama campaign staffer Elijah Zarlin, who also was arrested at the protest at the White House, said the president is "missing an opportunity to lead this country in a better direction."
