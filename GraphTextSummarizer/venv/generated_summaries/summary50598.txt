-- Jessica Ennis is set to cash in after winning heptathlon gold for Olympic hosts Great Britain, but fame and fortune are not the motivation for the poster girl of London 2012. " Ennis came up just 45 points shy of the magical 7,000 mark for the seven events, which was the fifth best tally in heptathlon history. Ennis set the capacity crowd in the Olympic Stadium alight last Saturday as she powered to victory in the heptathlon's final event over 800 meters to set the seal on a dominant performance. Many have rushed to congratulate her, but so far nothing official from British Prime Minister David Cameron. She is reminded that President Barack Obama is regularly on the line to successful American athletes.
