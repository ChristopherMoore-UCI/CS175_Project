-- Dr. Paul Nassif couldn't tell if his friend Charlie Sheen was drunk last Thursday when the actor made the phone call that eventually led to a hospital visit and the latest controversy about Sheen's rehab. Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. Nassif's wife, Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, appears on "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Nassif couldn't determine whether Sheen was drunk or high. Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation.
