The shows have notable auspices on board — Shōgun is from producers Michael De Luca (The Social Network) and Nigel Williams (Elizabeth I); The Run of His Life: The People vs. O.J. Simpson, which chronicles Simpson's 1995 murder trial, is from Nina Jacobson (The Hunger Games) and Brad Simpson (World War Z). -- Fox just announced two very different long-form projects in development based on best-selling books: James Clavell's classic novel "Shōgun" and legal journalist Jeffrey Toobin's "The Run of His Life: The People vs. O.J. Simpson" are both in the works for "event series" treatment. Set in the 17th Century, the story is told from the perspective of British hero John Blackthorne, a sailor who rises from outsider to samurai, while being used as a pawn in Japanese leader Toranaga's struggle to reach the top of the ruling chain, or Shōgun. Everybody remembers where they were when O.J. Simpson, riding in a white Bronco, led the police on a low-speed chase all over Los Angeles. More notoriously, Fox scheduled a two-part interview with Simpson in 2006 as part of the promotional tour for his planned quasi-confessional book If I Did It.
