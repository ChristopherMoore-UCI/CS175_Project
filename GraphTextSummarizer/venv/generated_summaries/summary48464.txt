Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. -- At least 30 people were killed and 42 injured Sunday when a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest attacked a mosque south of Baghdad, according to police and health officials. In a separate incident Sunday, at least 12 people were killed in an attack on the security headquarters of the regional Kurdish government in Erbil. Kurdish security forces opened fire, and the vehicle exploded. Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
