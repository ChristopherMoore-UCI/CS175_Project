-- Thousands of strange sea creatures are washing ashore on California beaches, puzzling tourists and thrilling scientists quick to explain the phenomenon. "The scientific name is Velella velella," said David Bader, director of education at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California. On Thursday, photos turned up on Twitter from Hollywood and Silver Strand beaches in Oxnard. "Out at sea, they look like bubbles on the surface of the ocean until you get up on them," said Julie Bursek of NOAA's Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. They first started showing up in Washington and Oregon, and by mid-July reached San Francisco.
