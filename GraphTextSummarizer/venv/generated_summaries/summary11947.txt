The airline said passenger revenue fell during the period, although yields improved "driven by a change in mix especially within cabin." The airline said its operating loss had shrunk to 72 million pounds ($112 million) compared with the same quarter last year, as it reined in costs and increased passenger and cargo yields. The airline's chief executive, Willie Walsh, cited strikes by BA cabin crews and closures from the Icelandic volcano as reasons for the loss. Looking ahead, the airline said it was maintaining its forecast to break even in the full year, despite bleak predictions from some analysts about a return to recession. "While some economic experts are flagging the risk of a 'double-dip' recession, the steady recovery continues and, on that basis, we continue to target to break even at a profit before tax level for the full year as we move forward on our strategic objectives and continue to build on our excellent customer service," Walsh said.
