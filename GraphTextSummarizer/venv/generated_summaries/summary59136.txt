T+L: America's most romantic cities One new category in this year's survey may have also boosted chemistry: a charming accent, something T+L readers found lacking with the folks of Phoenix and Seattle, who also ranked among the less attractive. Charleston Proof that voters are a little fickle: this South Carolina city was No. 1 for attractive locals in 2010, but fell to No. 7 last year. They're also trying that catch-more-flies-with-honey strategy: their niceness factor went up by three positions since last year. Music City jumped up seven places in the attractiveness category since last year, even if it lost its grip on the top spot in the survey for music. New results are in from the annual America's Favorite Cities survey, in which readers rate 35 metropolitan areas for qualities such as people-watching, walkable streets, and hot music scenes.
