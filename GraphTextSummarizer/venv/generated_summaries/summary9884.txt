Eyewitnesses told CNN affiliate KSDK that loud noises from circus goers had spooked the elephants, and they fled. The damaged cars belong to circus employees or Shriners -- whom the circus website describes as men in "funny red hats, who drive little yellow cars, dress like clowns." One handler trying to corral the elephants wanted to tempt them with treats, circus goer Allie Tunncliff told KSDK. The trunked trio -- all circus stars in St. Louis, Missouri -- found a way out of their enclosure Saturday and went for a stroll. The elephants didn't get any significant dents or scratches, but after their ordeal, the circus gave them a break for Saturday's night's performance, Burkholder said.
