Malta joined the EU in 2004; it is a member of the Schengen borderless travel area, and has a visa waiver agreement with the United States -- all perks that would come with Maltese citizenship for foreigners. But faced with rising criticism both in Malta and other European Union countries, the Maltese government has temporarily halted the law's implementation and will review its requirements. The European Union said it could not interfere with citizenship decisions made by individual EU countries. Maltese citizenship already allows a holder to travel to 163 countries across the globe without a visa. Several European Union countries offer residence permits that include free movement within the Schengen area, in exchange for high fees and the requirement to invest in the country, like Britain's Tier 1 investor scheme for non-EU citizens with Â£1 million ($1.6 million) or more of private funds available for investment in the UK.
