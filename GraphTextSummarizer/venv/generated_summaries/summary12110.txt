"The Stomp" remains one of the most controversial plays in NCAA history -- when Duke's Christian Laettner lifted his foot and stepped on Kentucky's Aminu Timberlake during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, the 1992 NCAA East Regional Final. If Kentucky fans needed more reason to hate Laettner, those words might've been it. Laettner should've been kicked out; he should never have been in the game to hit that miraculous shot; Kentucky should've advanced to the Final Four. But that game will never quite sit well with Kentucky players and fans. Pitino told his players that although they lost on the court, his players had done something much bigger: They'd put Kentucky basketball back on the map.
