The news is the latest chapter in a saga that began Christmas Eve after the Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy got stuck in 10 feet of ice. " Turney has said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy. Ice cold, cha cha cha!
