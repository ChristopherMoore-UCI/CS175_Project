O.J. Simpson went on trial for the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman 20 years ago, in what would become a wall-to-wall televised proceeding. Brown also recounted an incident at the Simpson residence in which an allegedly enraged O.J. Simpson threw Nicole against a wall, destroyed some items from the house and threw both sisters out. On the first day of the Simpson trial, and as defense attorney Johnnie Cochran prepared to delivered his opening statement, a camera in the courtroom captured the face of a juror. After Brown completed her emotional testimony, defense attorney Robert Shapiro countered with a completely different image of Simpson as a warm family man, pointing to video of Simpson showing affection with the Brown family just hours before the slayings. Denise Brown testifies Nicole Brown Simpson's older sister, Denise Brown, testified that her sister was an abused wife.
