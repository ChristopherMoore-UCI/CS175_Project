"No more competition," she had said as she climbed out of the canoe after becoming the first woman in Olympic history to win gold 20 years apart and the fifth competitor to collect winner's medals at five separate Games. But she missed the 1984 Games -- at a time when she was a world champion at singles, pairs and fours -- as East Germany joined the Soviet Union in boycotting Los Angeles. "The number of medals is simply not that important to me," she said after Sydney. It was a different story in Sydney, however, after Fischer had entered the record books with victories in the 500 meters pairs and the 500 meters fours. Two more medals in Atlanta in 1996 (a gold in the fours and a silver in the pairs) set Fischer up for her record-breaking efforts in Sydney.
