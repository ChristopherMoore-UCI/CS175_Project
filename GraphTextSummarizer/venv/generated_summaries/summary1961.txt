-- A Connecticut State Police dive team was searching a lake in Bristol, Connecticut, Monday for an item linked to the case of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who is charged with murder in Massachusetts, a law enforcement source told CNN. Surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. Authorities have accused Hernandez, a 23-year-old former New England Patriots player, of orchestrating the shooting death of Lloyd, the 27-year-old boyfriend of Hernandez's fiancÃ©e's sister. Authorities have said Hernandez and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in the early morning of June 17. The lake is about a mile from his uncle's Bristol home, which police have searched several times while investigating last month's shooting death of Odin Lloyd.
