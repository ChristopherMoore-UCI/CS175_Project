"The arrest of Mr. Bishop is just the first step in what is going to be a long process and we are actively continuing the investigation to determine the roles of all those involved in this case," U.S. Attorney Florence Nakakuni said. Court documents do not accuse the woman of spying, but an affidavit notes that Bishop met her at a conference in Hawaii where she may have been attempting to target individuals with access to classified information.
