The Embassy of the Republic of Yemen in Washington responded to the GCC initiative on Monday in a statement which  said Saleh has agreed to transfer powers in accordance with the Yemeni Constitution, which means he will not step down from power until his term ends in 2013. One day after the Gulf Cooperation Council released a statement urging Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, thousands of protestors returned to the streets Monday for marches and opposition leaders are vowing not to back down. "President Saleh has publicly expressed his willingness to engage in a peaceful transition of power; the timing and form of this transition should be identified through negotiation and begin soon. "The opposition wants everything and President Saleh is still the most powerful person in the country," GCC's Ganadi said. The Joint Meeting Parties bloc, Yemen's largest opposition group, said the GCC initiative "does not clearly state that Saleh must step down and only focuses on Saleh's transferring power."
