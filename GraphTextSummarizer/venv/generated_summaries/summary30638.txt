" U.S. officials have been considering action against the Central Bank of Iran but became concerned that a full sanction could have a negative effect on the world economy because of the potential impact on oil prices. U.S. officials have said the administration has been reluctant to cut off the bank out of concern it could drive up oil prices and hurt the U.S. economy. U.S. diplomatic sources told CNN Saturday that the goal of the new measures is to bar foreign companies from doing business with Iran's petrochemical industry by threatening to ban them from U.S. markets. The United States will name Iran, as well as its Central Bank, as a "primary money laundering concern" Monday, but will not place sanctions directly on the bank, a senior Treasury Department official said. The United Kingdom also announced Monday it will impose fresh sanctions against Iran, cutting all financial ties with the country over concerns about its nuclear program.
