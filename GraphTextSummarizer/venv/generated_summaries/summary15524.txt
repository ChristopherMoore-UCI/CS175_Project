Local officials were accused of "economic crimes"-- bribery, profiteering and corrupt behavior in public office, involving public funds and property. Xie Caiping "was convicted of organizing and leading a criminal organization, running gambling dens, illegal imprisonment, harboring people taking illegal narcotics and giving bribes to officials," the Xinhua news agency reported. But the economic boom has also led to the resurgence of local gangs engaged in human and drug trafficking, illegal gambling, prostitution, extortion and protection rackets. Investigations led to many city officials, including police officers. China's goal was to build Chongqing into a modern megacity that would serve as the new economic engine in central China.
