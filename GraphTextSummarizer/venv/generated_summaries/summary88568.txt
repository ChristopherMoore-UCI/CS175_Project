-- Former French national coach Raymond Domenech is suing the French Football Federation (FFF) for unfair dismissal, demanding 2.9 million euros after his sacked in the wake of France's disastrous World Cup campaign. He told AFP: "We can't forget Domenech is the only coach to have qualified France for three consecutive major international tournaments (two World Cups and one European Championships). " Domenech lost his job after France failed to qualify from the group stages in South Africa, amid player unrest that saw his squad boycott a training session. Domenech was fired by the FFF in September for "serious error" and -- under French law -- a person dismissed under such circumstances has no right to severance pay, although they can dispute the charge before an employment tribunal. Stained by the accusations of serious error means that 17 years of his career has been erased by the stroke of a pen."
