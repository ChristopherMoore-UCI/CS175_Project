Wen made her runway debut in Milan, Italy, in 2008, followed quickly by Paris, France, and New York fashion weeks where she walked in such shows as Anna Sui, Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Chlo√© and Lanvin. -- Four years ago Liu Wen entered a modeling contest in China to win a computer to use for school. The past few seasons of fashion shows have featured Asian models on almost every high-end runway. At 5-foot-10, Wen said she towered over her classmates in China. Wen thinks she may try her hand at acting when she has gotten over the modeling bug, but she said she would be just as happy returning to China to be a teacher like she originally planned.
