"This litigation has established that the editorial teams had a wealth of evidence substantiating that following his divorce from Ms. Holmes, Mr. Cruise was absent from his daughter for long periods of time, that seeing her was not his first priority and that she was emotionally struggling as a result of her father's extended absences," Bauer Publishing said. -- Tom Cruise is defending his relationship with daughter Suri, denying that she felt "abandoned" last summer when he was divorcing her mother, actress Katie Holmes. Â  "Mr. Cruise does not challenge the accuracy of any of the underlying facts that informed the opinions expressed by the editorial teams at In Touch and Life & Style. "Mr. Cruise has repeatedly promoted himself as being a devoted father who made his family his top priority. " The publisher's court filing said that Cruise "did not dispute that he had not visited Suri for over two months, despite previously assuring his daughter that he would be spending a lot of time with her after his divorce."
