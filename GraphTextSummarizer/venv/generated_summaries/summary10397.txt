Of course, Greene added, Britney's team probably wouldn't let her on live TV if she couldn't handle it. "Britney off the cuff doesn't exist," said Phil Gallo, Billboard's senior correspondent for film and TV. Referencing the way Lady Gaga uses Twitter to stay connected to her fans, which she often calls her "little monsters," Greene said, "(Gaga) is part of their daily life, while Britney is not. Fans want to relate to their favorite artists on a personal level, said Andy Greene, an associate editor at Rolling Stone. Though Spears has used social platforms to share pictures of her two sons and announce her engagement to former manager Jason Trawick, she's come off as a sort of "Stepford" pop star of late, Greene said.
