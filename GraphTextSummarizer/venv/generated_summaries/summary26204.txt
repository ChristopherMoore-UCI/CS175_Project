Amiri told the United States of his plans to return to Iran, and he was scheduled to travel Monday but was unable to make the appropriate travel arrangements in time, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. "I am Shahram Amiri, the son of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who with God's help succeeded in running away from the U.S. security agents in the state of Virginia. Last month, two videos surfaced on the internet of a man claiming to be Amiri in which he said he had escaped from U.S. agents and was hiding in Virginia. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Amiri is in the United States "of his own free will" and is "free to go" back to Iran. The Pakistani diplomatic sources said no one in Iran was aware of Amiri's whereabouts until his arrival at the embassy.
