Workers discovered the body around 5 a.m. and notified track security, who called police, said police spokesman Robert Biven. Perez worked for veteran horse trainer Cecil Borel, who is the brother of three-time Derby winning jockey Calvin Borel. "Those folks are devastated," said Churchill Downs spokesman John Asher. Perez had been working for Borel since 2008, and was found at Barn No. 8, which was not where he normally worked, Asher said. There are no suspects at this time, Louisville Police Lt. Barry Wilkerson said Monday, noting that police are investigating several altercations that occurred at the track.
