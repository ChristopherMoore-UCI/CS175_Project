According to Harvey's arrest warrant affidavit, here's how the operation worked: -- Harvey used his security clearance to help provide guns to a passenger named Mark Quentin Henry after Henry cleared security. Baggage handlers and other airport employees don't have to go through a concourse screening as passengers do, creating a "backdoor method" for airport employees to smuggle materials, she said. "We have an egregious breach of security" at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport because airport employees "are not required to go through screening," said Thompson. In November, Mr. Henry brought this gun on a Delta commercial airliner to New York." Transfer in men's restroom? -- Henry, the former employee, allegedly brought the firearms in his carry-on luggage on at least five flights from Atlanta to New York between May 1 and December 10.
