For example, revealing how Angela Merkel is targeted by surveillance operations might better inform public debate on surveillance but it might also allow Kim Jong-Un to better evade American surveillance. The uncertainties surrounding covert activities may lead us to think that we can prevent secrecy from being used to conceal wrongdoing by being careful about whom we appoint to exercise and oversee secrecy. Recent headlines make clear that the American public is troubled by government secrecy. So to answer the question we started out with, the public's approach to government secrecy ought to be a measured one. But a government employee's motives -- and a reporter's incentives -- do matter when they disclose secret information concerning activities whose alleged illegality and immorality is doubtful.
