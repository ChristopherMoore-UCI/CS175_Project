Just shy of her 10th birthday, Clinton knew then that history was being made and even more, "that the future was being born," she told CNN before leaving this week on a nine-day, six-stop African trip with her father, former President Bill Clinton. Clinton and her father also visited South Africa last year as part of a similar African swing to visit foundation sites there and in Mozambique, Rwanda and Uganda. -- Chelsea Clinton can trace her African awakening to February 11, 1990, when she sat on the kitchen counter of the governor's mansion in Arkansas and watched with her parents as Nelson Mandela walked out of prison in South Africa. The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is involved in myriad projects in Africa intended to help historically disadvantaged people get a chance to realize their human potential on a continent known mostly for squalor and conflict. Given the nation's troubled history, with the 1994 genocide still resonant as a symbol of African upheaval and misery, the coffee plant represents "the next chapter in what's been really exciting to watch unfold in Rwanda," Clinton said.
