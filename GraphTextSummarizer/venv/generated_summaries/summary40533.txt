When CNN asked him why he came to Hollywood during the Academy Awards weekend, he delivered a combination Chamber of Commerce and re-election campaign speech. Toronto's mayor was walking down Hollywood Boulevard checking out Canadians with stars on the Walk of Fame when a CNN camera crew covering the Oscars spotted him. He flew into Los Angeles Saturday night, greeted at LAX airport by TV host Jimmy Kimmel dressed as a chauffeur. Mayor Rob Ford's surprise appearance in Hollywood may be the biggest thing from Toronto since Justin Bieber. "CNN checking in, I'm busy telling people what a great destination #Toronto is for the movie & tourist industries," he tweeted after the interview, including a photo of him talking to CNN.
