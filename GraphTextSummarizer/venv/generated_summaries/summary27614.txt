In 1971, the United States and Cuba signed an agreement in which each government agreed to prosecute hijackers or return them to the other country. Perhaps the most famous is black activist Assata Shakur, who was convicted for killing a police officer in New Jersey in 1973 but escaped from prison in 1979 and ended up in Cuba. In 1984, he smuggled a firearm aboard a commercial flight and forced the crew to fly to Havana, Cuba. William Potts smuggled a firearm aboard a flight, hijacked the plane and forced the crew to fly to Cuba. But few know how this eccentric American ended up in Cuba.
