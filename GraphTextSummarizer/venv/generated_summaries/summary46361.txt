We as good men have to break out of the man box, stand up and speak out to end violence against women and girls. We as good men have to teach our sons and other young men how to truly respect and promote equality for women. As good men, we must begin to acknowledge and own our responsibility to be part of the solution to ending violence against women and girls. There is a minority of men who perpetuate a tremendous amount of violence against women. We as good men have to envision the world we want to see for our daughters and other girls -- and in that world how would we want to see our sons and other men acting and behaving.
