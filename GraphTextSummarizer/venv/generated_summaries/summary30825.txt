My recommendation is that Ecuador seek $1.25 billion per year in compensation for the first four years of the Initiative and thereafter, the value of the carbon dioxide avoided. Similarly, "sink" is a more precise term than "atmosphere" for describing the destination of carbon dioxide. Synthesizing the physics with the economics, I wrote "The Economics of the Yasun√≠ Initiative: Climate Change as if Thermodynamics Mattered". If the short history of the carbon market is any guide, the payments would be somewhere between $300 million and $900 million per year. Below the biosphere lie the oil fields Isphingo, Tambococha and Tiputini, abbreviated to ITT.
