While he said he hasn't seen violence between inmates or on the part of prison staff during his visits, Nikkel said it is widely reported. Drugs are as easily available inside prison as on the streets, Nikkel added. "But Honduras has been notorious for the violence of the system against inmates, and part of that is due to the inadequate training of prison officers but also because they are subjected to the same overcrowding, which in these conditions is very difficult at the best of times. "The government must also take urgent steps to ensure that crucial lessons are learned and prison conditions are improved, so that such a tragedy does not occur again," said Esther Major, Central America Researcher at Amnesty. Hours after a fatal fire swept through a prison in the central Honduran city of Comayagua, killing more than 300 people, an ugly picture is emerging of the harsh state of prisons in the country.
