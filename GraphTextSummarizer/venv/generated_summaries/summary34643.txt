"People come to watch ... because it's college sports, with college athletes," he said. He and other athletes are suing for the opportunity for future athletes to be paid for the use of their names, images and likenesses when they play sports on television. -- If college athletes were to start being paid, many schools would leave Division I sports, NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday. "If the rules were changed to permit student athletes to be paid for (names, images and likenesses), would that change what college sports is all about? He said the use of athletes' names, images and likenesses is "one of the most debated topics in NCAA history." One of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson, displayed picture after picture of athletes with corporate logos and asked, "Putting athletes in front of logos, that's all fine under NCAA rules?" "It's not something I'm personally comfortable with," Emmert responded.
