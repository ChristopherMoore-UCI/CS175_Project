It's occupied 24 hours a day, and by the grace of God we were able to dodge quite a few bullets here," Chief Art Acevedo told reporters. According to Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio division, McQuilliams had mentioned to some people that he was upset because he couldn't find a job and because, in his view, immigrants were able to get more services than he was. Larry McQuilliams, 49, was killed outside police headquarters Friday, after opening fire at a federal courthouse and a Mexican consulate, which he also seemingly tried to set ablaze. Inside the book was a handwritten note that discussed McQuilliams' rank as a "priest in the fight against anti-God" people, Acevedo said. The majority of the locations were either government buildings, including the ones that he attacked, or financial institutions, Acevedo said.
