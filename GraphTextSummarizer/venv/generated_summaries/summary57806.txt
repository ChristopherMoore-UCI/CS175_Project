Chris Fields of the Oklahoma City Fire Department, who had been on the scene for just 20 minutes when police officer John Avery found 1-year-old Baylee Almon in the rubble and handed her to Fields. Eighteen years later, Fields watched some of the coverage from Boston at his fire station in Oklahoma City and says the images struck a familiar cord. Fields reflects that healing in the wake of a terror attack like Oklahoma City or Boston takes a lot of time. Other fellow Oklahomans that I knew felt the same way, including journalist Clytie Bunyan, who was in the post office across the street from the Murrah building when the bomb detonated. April 19, 1995, began as a calm, clear day in my hometown of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
