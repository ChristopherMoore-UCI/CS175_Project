A 10-minute period of respite ensued before the home side was awarded a penalty for hand ball, with referee Andre Marriner mistakenly showing a red card to Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who had tipped Eden Hazard's shot around the post. Gunners' fans have already seen their team taken apart by top-four opposition this season with Liverpool winning 5-1 at Anfield last month and Manchester City dominant in a 6-3 goal-fest at the Etihad Stadium last December. Manchester City kept in touch with Chelsea as they battered relegation-threatened Fulham 5-0 at the Etihad. But the loss to local London rivals Chelsea will be the most difficult to stomach with the margin of defeat equaling Wenger's worst loss -- 8-2 by Manchester United in 2011 -- at the club. Manchester United backed up a promising Champions League win in midweek with a 2-0 win at West Ham United.
