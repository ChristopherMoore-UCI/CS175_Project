John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) thrive on Twitter because they do their own tweeting, unlike politicians who leave Twitter duty to staff members -- it's a personal medium and authenticity is the most important quality. NASCAR driver tweets from car, gains 100,000 followers To be sure, Keslowski's band is but a fraction of the ones behind early Twitter adopters Chad Ochocinco of the New England Patriots and Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic -- but his number is now four times larger than the Twitter following of one of baseball's biggest names, New York Yankee star Mariano Rivera (@MarianoRivera). Mere stardom does not build a social media presence; it takes regular tweets that are good enough to inspire followers to spread them further via re-tweets to their own networks. Compared to nationally known politicians, many of whom are in the news every day, Keselowski's "instant" following is bigger than Rick Santorum's (147,000), closing in on Mitt Romney's 351,000, double Sen. Marco Rubio's (73,000) and double the size of the Democratic senator who is perhaps most talented at Twitter's use, Claire McCaskill (64,300).
