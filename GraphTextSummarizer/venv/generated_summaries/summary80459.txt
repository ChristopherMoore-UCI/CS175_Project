John M. Russell, according to Maj. Gen. David Perkins, the military spokesman who briefed reporters in Baghdad, Iraq, on Tuesday. Russell has been charged with five counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault after the shooting at Camp Liberty, near Baghdad's international airport, Perkins added. His father, Wilburn Russell, also of Sherman, said Russell had e-mailed his wife saying he believed unidentified officers were trying to run him out of the military. Russell is from the 54th Engineering Battalion, based out of Bamberg, Germany -- a unit attached to Multi-National Division South but based at Camp Victory in Baghdad. Russell had recently been referred to counseling by his commander because of unspecified words and actions, Perkins said.
