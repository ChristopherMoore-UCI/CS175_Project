While Hallmark isn't making Hoodie-Hoo Day cards yet, this year it started making Star Wars Day e-cards. "I just started doing it on a lark," admits Roy, who used to flip through Chase's Calendar of Events -- an annual reference guide to holidays around the world -- to get ideas for the morning radio show he hosted out of Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Ultimately, though, the true test of a holiday's validity is if it gets its own greeting card. While Hallmark denies creating holidays, the company says it employs a team of 600 to research events worth celebrating. In case you missed it, last week we had Take Your Houseplant for a Walk Day and next week (August 7) we can all look forward to National Underwear Day and Particularly Preposterous Packaging Day.
