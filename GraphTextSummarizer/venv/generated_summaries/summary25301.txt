The families of two men who were gunned down in Boston in 2012 have filed wrongful death lawsuits against former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez, according to court documents. The prosecutor's office of Suffolk County has not identified any suspects in this case, according to Jack Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley. Meanwhile, Hernandez has been moved to a more restrictive jail unit while a fight with another inmate is investigated, Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told CNN Thursday. The warrant was used to search a bag of clothes with Hernandez's name on it and a Toyota 4Runner linked to him that, according to court documents, was seen at the scene of the crime by witnesses the night of the killings. The loss of Abreu and Furtado should matter and there is no reason to wait, said attorney William T. Kennedy.
