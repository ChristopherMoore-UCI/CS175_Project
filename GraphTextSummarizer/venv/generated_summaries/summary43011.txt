Despite being a man down, Japan rallied and won the match in the 80th minute when Honda coverted another penalty, given after Ali Dyab had brought down substitute striker Shinji Okazaki. The result means Saudi Arabia become the first team to bow out of the competition and puts Jordan level on points with Japan at the top of the group. However, Syria levelled in controversial fashion with 14 minutes remaining, when Firas Al Khatib netted from the penalty spot after goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima had fouled Sanharib Malki -- despite the player being flagged offside. Captain Makoto Hasebe opened the scoring for the three-time champions in the 35th minute, finding the corner of the net with a well-placed strike after some superb individual play from Keisuke Honda. Japan only need to draw with Saudi Arabia in their final match to qualify for the next stage, while whoever wins the match between Jordan and Syria will join them, although Jordan also just need a point from that fixture.
