But he warned that risks from such outbreaks were far from over, saying: "There will be other Ebola outbreaks and there will be other epidemics, not least influenza." Barclay instead thinks one way forward could be therapeutics that tackle the symptoms of disease, meaning where diseases have similar symptoms -- such as Ebola and Marburg virus disease -- there could be a drug against the symptoms of all of them to reduce further spread of infections. With MERS now climbing to the top as the infection on people's minds, its worth knowing that whilst we may not be quite ready to prevent disease outbreaks, we are, at least, more ready than ever before.
