-- Over the years, it seems that just about every format imaginable has been used for debates between presidential candidates. Yet, 52 years after the first televised presidential debate, there still often seems something stilted and dry about some of them (but not all: witness last week's high-energy vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan). This might be a good approximation of that -- presidential candidates unplugged, on their own, with no escape hatch. Or -- let's be candid -- it might turn out to be an utter flop, like the announcerless National Football League telecast that took place in 1980, when NBC Sports, as an experiment, put on a regular-season game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins with no announcers or commentators -- just the sights and sounds of the action. The debate would still be 90 minutes in prime evening time.
