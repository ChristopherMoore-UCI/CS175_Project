"When people start interacting with the children, misconceptions about street life fall away." I am asked to meet the guide from Salaam Baalak Trust at 10 a.m. Salaam means hello and baalak means child. I was curious to see how tour operators presented Indian poverty, especially to foreigners. Later, I discovered that slum tours in India are often organized and can cost money. That seems like a noble cause, but then I got to thinking about the idea of poverty tours in general -- how it might feel to be a slum-dweller coming face to face with a wealthy visitor gawking at me as though I were an animal in a zoo. "This is unlike other poverty tours," says Poonam Sharma, coordinator of the tours.
