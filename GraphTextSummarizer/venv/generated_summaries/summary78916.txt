John-Arne Rottingen, from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said this program is happening at the request of Guinean authorities and called the participation of residents there "vital" to its success. The trial, using vaccines developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, will be administered in Basse Guinee, a region that has had the highest number of Ebola cases in Guinea. There are new Ebola cases every day, including 132 in the last week of February (which is up from 99 reported the previous week). But the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive. After months racing not only to treat Ebola but to find ways to prevent it, health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign Saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease.
