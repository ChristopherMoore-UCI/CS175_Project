With the growth has come a backlash against Chinese tourist in some sectors of the travel industry, particularly Hong Kong. In a matter of just a decade or so, Chinese tourists have gone from being relatively rare outside of Asia to becoming the most important market in global tourism, surpassing American and German travelers in 2012 as the world's top international spenders, with a record $102 billion shelled out on the road. Xinhua reported on Thursday that Wang made the remarks during a State Council teleconference on the implementation of the country's new Tourism Law.
