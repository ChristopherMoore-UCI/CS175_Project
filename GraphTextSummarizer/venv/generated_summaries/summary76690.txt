Diaz enjoyed Everglades so much that she continued to work as a seasonal ranger for seven years, living in places such as Kings Canyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park and Katmai National Park. A canoe glides through South Florida's endless maze of freshwater ways and emerges from a thicket of sawgrass into the saltwater of Florida Bay. It could be a foot (difference) but that means a different habitat -- tropical, hardwood hammock, cypress domes -- all the way down to the salty waters of Florida Bay." Favorite less-traveled spot: Snake Bight in Florida Bay. Shane works as a park ranger in nearby Biscayne National Park and the couple now has an 18-month-old daughter, Sierra Harrington. In the meantime, she married Shane Harrington, the man she met at Florida Keys, on December 6, 2008 -- the 61st anniversary of the Everglades' dedication.
