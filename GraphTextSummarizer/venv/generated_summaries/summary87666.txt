Sanaa is Yemen's capital, but Houthi rebels have controlled the city for months. Houthis then pressured Hadi to step down last month after he refused to agree to certain political demands. Four Gulf countries now have opened embassies in Aden, Yemen, where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi fled after being deposed. The Saudi ambassador to Yemen said Friday: "The security situation is calm in Aden and it's very difficult for us to resume our embassy operations in Sanaa. Jamal Benomar, the U.N. envoy to Yemen, visited  Hadi in Aden on Wednesday and said in a statement that Hadi is still the constitutional president of Yemen.
