Members of Congress who want generational fairness and balanced budgets won't get there by whacking the elderly with Social Security cuts or higher park pass prices. Raising the lifetime park pass for seniors is not offered up to lower park admission prices for young people. President Obama has proposed replacing the regular consumer price index, or CPI, to adjust Social Security benefits with the chained CPI -- often called the cat food CPI because the index assumes that when the price of human food rises, seniors can substitute cheaper food to get the same nutrition. With the U.S. economy growing at a sluggish pace, older Americans who are nearing retirement face more uncertainty. The various proposals floating around to cut Social Security are scary enough for older Americans.
