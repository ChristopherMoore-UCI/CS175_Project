-- New York City police didn't violate New Jersey state laws when they carried out surveillance programs of Muslim-owned business, mosques and university student groups, according to a Thursday statement from the New Jersey attorney general's office. New York police spokesman Paul Browne said their Newark counterparts were "briefed before and afterwards, and a Newark liaison officer accompanied NYPD personnel when they were in Newark." New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also defended the extent of police surveillance against critics who have suggested that authorities went too far. " A 60-page report obtained by The Associated Press showed NYPD maps of Newark, New Jersey, and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques. After the report was made public, Newark Mayor Corey Booker called for an investigation.
