According to County Commissioner David Baisden, Crum was born and raised in Mingo County. But folks in Mingo County are about to get a whole lot closer to Crum, who was appointed sheriff Thursday by the county's commissioners. -- Many people in Mingo County, West Virginia, likely know Rosie Crum the way that Frances Crawford does. "They have been a pillar in the community and done everything that they felt was the right thing to do, and we feel this is the right thing for us to do," Baisden said about Crum's appointment. Justin Marcum, an assistant prosecutor in Mingo County, said having Crum step into her husband's shoes should help in the healing process.
