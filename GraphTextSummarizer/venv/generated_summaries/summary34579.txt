Bookings are now being taken for London Lodge, an historic gateway that forms a grand entrance to Highclere's extensive grounds in the countryside west of London. Built around 1840, the "unique and luxurious" accommodation for two has, according to the estate, been restored over the past two years by the current Earl of Carnarvon and his wife (although they may have had help). There are no servants quarters, so guests shouldn't expect white-gloved flunkeys delivering their morning newspaper. And, since it's unlikely to available during filming, there's little chance of being witheringly insulted by the acid-tongued Dowager Duchess of Grantham. Highclere Castle, the posh British mansion that doubles as Downton in the long-running UK television series, is opening up rooms to paying guests.
