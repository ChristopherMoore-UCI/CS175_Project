Blood was found in the Howard home of Tina Herrmann, 32, and her children Sarah Maynard, 13, and Kody Maynard, 10, Knox County Sheriff David Barber said Friday. "There's a lot of anxiety," about the four people's fate," said Pastor Todd Miller of Amity-Apple Valley Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, about five miles from Howard. "Detectives are interviewing family members, friends and acquaintances," Barber told CNN affiliate WBNS on Saturday. Herrmann's truck was discovered Thursday night near Kenyon College in Gambier, he said. Barber said Herrmann's live-in boyfriend, Greg Borders, will be interviewed.
