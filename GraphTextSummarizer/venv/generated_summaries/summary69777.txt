CNN sent reporter Alina Machado and producer John Murgatroyd on Thursday to Zoo Atlanta for a behind-the-scenes peek at the twin panda brothers (the only surviving panda twins in the U.S.). Rules for the panda nursery: Before entering the "secure bio zone," Machado and Murgatroyd were required to change into yellow gowns and put on booties over their shoes. Machado and Murgatroyd got to watch as veterinarians weighed and measured Cub "A," took his temperature and listened to his heart. Usually one panda is cared for by zoo staff while the other is with mom. They'll be known as Cubs "A" and "B" until a naming ceremony 100 days after their birth, in keeping with Chinese tradition.
