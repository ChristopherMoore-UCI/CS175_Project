Lebanon on edge after anti-Syrian intel official killed by Beirut car bomb The attack -- in broad daylight, at one of the capital's busiest intersections -- was just the kind of thing the intelligence official worked so diligently to prevent. In his position with Lebanon's Internal Security Forces, al-Hassan tackled one of the nation's bloodiest and politically volatile attacks, which occurred on February 14, 2005, in Beirut's fashionable seaside Corniche district. He was an icon among many fellow Sunni Muslims, including those aligned with the opposition led by Saad Hariri, for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in Lebanon. Al-Hassan spearheaded several other investigations into a series of killings that targeted major anti-Syrian political figures. A U.N. tribunal went on to indict four Hezbollah members, and left the door open for more to be charged, though that group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, blamed Israel for Hariri's death.
