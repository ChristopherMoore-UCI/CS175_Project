-- Unprecedented demonstrations sweeping the Middle East and North Africa spread Wednesday to Libya, where police clashed with anti-government protesters in the coastal city of Benghazi, an independent source told CNN. Activist Abdul Rahman Barman said three anti-government protesters were injured when government supporters attacked them after the demonstration. New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof said security forces have backed off after "a concerted deliberate effort to use a truly stunning amount of force. Anti-government sentiment has also manifested itself on the streets of Algeria, Jordan, Syria and Yemen. A massive pearl sits at the apex of a circle of inward-sweeping arches, and Wednesday, Bahrainis camped out at its base and painted anti-government slogans.
