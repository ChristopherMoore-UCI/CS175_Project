On Sunday, Woods' victory was complimented by wins for Hunter Mahan, Nick Watney, Jim Furyk, David Toms and Steve Stricker -- with Furyk the only player to finish unbeaten in his five matches. Woods claimed a comfortable four and three success over Australian Aaron Baddeley in their singles match to send the United States past the required 17 1/2 points total needed for victory. In response to critics who believe the Americans fail to bond together in golfing team events, Furyk told the official PGA Tour website: "This stuff about how we aren't close and how we can't come together as a group, it's just not accurate. The American side held a healthy four-point lead going into the 12 singles matches, and those were eventually split 6-6 to ensure a 19-15 win for the visiting side -- their seventh success in nine Presidents Cup events so far. We needed to get our point so we went out there and played really well -- putting a lot of heat on Badds (Baddeley).
