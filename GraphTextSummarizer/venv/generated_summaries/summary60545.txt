Mehserle waived extradition, and police officers were transporting him back to California on Wednesday. Referring to Mehserle's arrest, BART said, "This comes after the BART Police Department conducted a thorough investigation that involved nine detectives, which BART Police turned over to District Attorney Thomas Orloff on Monday, January 12." "As this case moves forward through the justice system and all the circumstances of that chaotic night become clear, I fully expect Mr. Mehserle to be cleared of the charges against him," Miller said. Hundreds of people took to the streets of Oakland, California Wednesday night to protest the shooting. "The murder charge was the appropriate charge given the state of the evidence." Hundreds of people in Oakland, California, continued to express their outrage about the shooting by taking to the streets in a protest at City Hall Wednesday night.
