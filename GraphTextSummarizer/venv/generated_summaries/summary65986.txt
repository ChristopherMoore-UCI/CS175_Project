Reade said: "The Chinese art market has been strong for the last two years and is getting stronger and now some of the big global players are coming on board as well." Of the 59 works offered by Christie's at the New York auction, 56 were sold including more than a dozen for record prices for their respective artists. The 1961 painting, described by auction house Christie's as arguably the most important work by the Russian-Amerian artist to ever appear at auction, sold for almost $87 million Tuesday. "People feel comfortable buying prime works by world-class artists." Of the top 10 works sold, eight buyers were listed as "anonymous," while two were attributed to private buyers from Europe and the U.S. Jon Reade, the managing director of Art Futures Group in Hong Kong, says there's a good chance the money flowing into the Christie's New York auction room Tuesday came from Asian investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Feverish bidding also produced the highest price for a collection sold at auction, for 13 works from the Pincus Collection, described by Christie's as the "most important and comprehensive ensemble of Abstract Expressionism ever to come to auction." A 2011 report by auction sales analysts Artprice said that sales that year "confirmed China's domination of the art market, with the economic health of Asian collectors generating higher price levels than anywhere else in the world."
