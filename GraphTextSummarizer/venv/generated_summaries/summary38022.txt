Simpson's romantic life also became fodder for the media after former boyfriend John Mayer told Playboy magazine that having sex with her was like being exposed to "sexual napalm. Cameras follow Simpson -- accompanied by friends Ken Paves, a celebrity hairstylist, and CaCee Cobb -- as she tries a flesh-eating fish pedicure in Japan and a detoxifying drink made from cow urine in India. The constant chatter about her dress size was part of the inspiration for Simpson's VH1 show, "The Price of Beauty," in which she visits seven countries to learn the lengths that women go to for beauty. " "I couldn't read the John Mayer article," Simpson said. All jokes aside, Simpson said she did feel betrayed by her ex-boyfriend, whom she dated on and off for two years, and has yet to accept his apology.
