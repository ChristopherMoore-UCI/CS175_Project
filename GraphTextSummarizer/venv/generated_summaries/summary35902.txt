On October 22, McKevitt, a veteran, was working his shift as a forklift operator at Polaris Industries' plant in Milford, Iowa. According to a legal decision filed by an administrative judge with Iowa Workforce Development, McKevitt was involved in "misconduct." "At that point I realized no one was going to hear my part of the story," said McKevitt, who filed an appeal with Iowa Workforce Development, including a 17-page letter detailing his side of the story. I was going to the restroom and the vending machine was next to it," McKevitt told CNN by phone from his brother's home in Spirit Lake, Iowa. The document, the result of an unemployment claim appeal filed by McKevitt, contains a statement from a Polaris representative saying that McKevitt "was observed by a supervisor lifting a candy machine about one to two feet off the ground with a forklift and then dropping the machine to the ground, which he repeated fix or six times." "When confronted," it reads, "he had gotten about three candy bars out of the machine, and he claimed he had only shaken the machine to get out the candy bars that he had paid for that had not dropped on their own.
