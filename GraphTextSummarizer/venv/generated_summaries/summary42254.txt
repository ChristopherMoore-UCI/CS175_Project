-- Nepal has banned women under the age of 30 from working in Persian Gulf nations amid increasing concerns over abuse and exploitation. Human Rights Watch, which has documented abuse of Asian women workers in Middle Eastern nations, says Nepal's age limit policy does not go far enough to address the gravity of the problem. "The government is right to be concerned about abuse against migrant women, but the correct response is not to stop them from going, but to ensure they can migrate with guarantees for their safety," Varia said. Nepal had imposed a complete ban on women working in the Gulf states after the suicide of a domestic worker, but lifted those restrictions in 2010. "We are not happy with the decision," said Gurung, who heads Pourakhi, a Nepalese agency that promotes the welfare of women migrant workers.
