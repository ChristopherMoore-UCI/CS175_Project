"He shouldn't be receiving any benefits, especially benefits related to Penn State," said Jennifer Storm, an advocate who has been working with Sandusky's victims. -- Convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky could get his pension back, if Pennsylvania's pension board agrees with a recommendation to resume the almost $5,000-per-month checks that he used to get. The arbitrator wrote in his opinion that Pennsylvania law did not allow for someone to lose a pension for Sandusky's crimes until 2004, long after Sandusky's 1999 retirement from the university. A state arbitrator made the recommendation Friday after Sandusky appealed a ruling that he lost the right to his pension -- from working as an assistant football coach at Penn State University -- when he was convicted in 2012 of sexually assaulting 10 young boys. It has no legal bearing that Sandusky was convicted of molesting several of the boys while he was employed by Penn State, and on the campus where he worked.
