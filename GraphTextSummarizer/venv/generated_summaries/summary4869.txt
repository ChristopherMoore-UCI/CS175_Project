Sen. Ted Cruz apologized Tuesday to Republican senators for disrupting their schedules last weekend when he unexpectedly forced the chamber to be in session after Senate leaders had agreed to send everyone home. "It was a sincere effort to apologize to those he may have put out," said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, about the apology, which was delivered behind closed doors at the weekly Republican policy lunch in the Capitol. The schedule change also helped Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid move about two dozen nominations, some controversial, who otherwise might not have been confirmed before the end of the session. "I think it's always appropriate to apologize for unnecessarily causing other people a distress or concern or requiring a change of plan that was completely unexpected," Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, said. "I am pleased the Sen. Cruz apologized," said Sen Susan Collins, R-Maine.
