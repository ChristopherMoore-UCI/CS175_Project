To replicate some of this success, Obama will need to figure out how to inspire a nation that is frustrated by the gridlock of Washington and the laggard state of the economy and worried about instability overseas. Although Wilson had run on a campaign to keep America out of world war, he was aware that such intervention was inevitable. This would undercut the ability of Republicans to define his policies for him, as has been the case for much of his first term, and motivate supporters who have often felt that Obama remained too much of a mystery. When a president-elect first steps onto the national stage, he still enjoys a certain degree of innocence and hope. Roosevelt gave a rousing performance that outlined the fundamental vision which shaped the wide array of policies he had put forward in his first term.
