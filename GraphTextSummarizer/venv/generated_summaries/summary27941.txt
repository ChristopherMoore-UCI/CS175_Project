Revere was responsible for overlaying the State House dome with copper. The box-shaped capsule was placed in the State House cornerstone in 1795 by Revere, the metalsmith, engraver and Revolutionary War hero; Adams, the brewer and governor of Massachusetts; and William Scollay, a local developer, when construction began. The large number of copper coins inside might have helped protect the artifacts, she said, since copper helps block the growth of fungus. Among the stash Hatchfield removed from the 1795 time capsule: Five folded newspapers, a Massachusetts commonwealth seal, a title page from Massachusetts colony records and at least 24 coins. Another set of coins included a pine tree shilling from 1652 and a copper medal showing George Washington.
