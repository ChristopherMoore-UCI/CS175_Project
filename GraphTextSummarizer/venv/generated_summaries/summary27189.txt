The total yardage for the Masters at Augusta ran to 7,435, June's U.S. Open at the Merion Golf Club was 6,996 while the next major, the USPGA, is to be played on the Oak Hill course runs a total of 7,134 yards. Previously thought of as short by modern par-five standards, the tee has been moved back almost 50 yards thanks to a land swap with the neighboring Renaissance Golf Club. Els returns to Muirfield as the defending Open champion after another emotional win at Royal Lytham last year. It is the 16th time that Muirfield has hosted the Open and the first since South African Ernie Els triumphed 11 years ago following a dramatic four-man play-off that went to sudden death on the fifth extra hole. This year new tees have been added on seven of the holes at Muirfield to match the prowess of the game's big-hitters and extend the overall playing distance for the 142nd British Open.
