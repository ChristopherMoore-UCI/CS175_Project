Military leaders have said they have no desire to "stay in power" and have asked political parties to send ideas on what to do next by Sunday, the spokesman said. This group says the acting president and the prime minister signed the deal and also accuses the African Union -- whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola -- of supporting intervention by Angolan forces. A number of Angolan troops are in the country to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was "deeply concerned" about the safety of residents. Guinea-Bissau is a member of the group, which also includes Portugal, Angola, Mozambique and Brazil.
