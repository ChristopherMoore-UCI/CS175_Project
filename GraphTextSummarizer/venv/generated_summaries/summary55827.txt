They also recommend areas to be protected outside of nature reserves and that post-earthquake relocation of affected towns takes panda habitat into consideration. "This kind of isolation increases their risk of extinction in the wild, due in part to a higher likelihood of inbreeding." Xu and his colleagues proposed a plan to encourage pandas to move between patches using specially protected corridors. Of the remaining habitat, the researchers found that large habitat areas had been fragmented into smaller, disconnected patches, which Xu says can be just as harmful as habitat destruction. "It is vital to the survival of this species that measures are taken to protect panda habitat outside nature reserves," said "It is probable that habitat fragmentation has separated the giant panda population inhabiting this region, which could be as low as 35 individuals," said Xu.
