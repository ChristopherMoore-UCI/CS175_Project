At a time when many countries are attacking the rights of the most vulnerable sectors of society, Venezuela is providing ever greater protection for low-income senior citizens and single-parent families with younger children or disabled dependents. Venezuela will continue on its path of social progress and empowering ordinary citizens. This progress has been achieved by using Venezuela's vast oil revenues to transform the lives of ordinary people. This shows that social progress in Venezuela has been consolidated and that there is a desire to further expand this progress. The reality is that ever since President Hugo Chavez was first elected, Venezuela has defied these negative predictions and brought unprecedented social progress to the country over the last 14 years.
