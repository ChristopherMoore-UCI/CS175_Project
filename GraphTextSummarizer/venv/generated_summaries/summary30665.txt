At least two people were killed Saturday afternoon as the same line of storms destroyed structures elsewhere in northern Georgia. A large hole could be seen in the 14th floor of a high-rise dorm at Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta. Earlier, Georgia Power spokesman John Sell said more than 40 power poles were broken by Friday night's tornado. Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin and Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue declared states of emergency. Police in Atlanta were urging people to stay away from downtown, fearing shattered glass and hanging metal would continue to fall from buildings as new storms rolled through.
