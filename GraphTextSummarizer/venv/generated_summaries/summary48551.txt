Journalists face heavy intimidation in Sri Lanka, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which has called the island nation a "highly restrictive and dangerous nation for the press." -- A few days ago, strangers appeared at the door of a Sri Lankan investigative journalist when he wasn't home, asking questions about him. In recent weeks, the Leader ran articles critical of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Navi Pillay, said Sri Lankan authorities should immediately give Shaukatally protection. Last year, citing national security, the government blocked a freedom of information bill, further denying journalists and citizens access to documents.
