New York State is poised to allow 20 hospitals to distribute medical marijuana, Gov. Andrew Cuomo formally announced Wednesday. "We will establish a program allowing up to 20 hospitals to prescribe medical marijuana, and we will monitor the program to evaluate the effectiveness and the feasibility of a medical marijuana system," Cuomo added, without elaborating. "Research suggests that medical marijuana can help manage pain and treatment of cancer and other serious illnesses," Cuomo said in the annual State of State speech in Albany. Medical marijuana advocates briefed on Cuomo's plan earlier this week said an executive action would allow certain hospitals to dispense the drug to certain patients. State Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, a Democrat from Manhattan and a leading proponent of comprehensive legislation for medical marijuana, said he learned about the executive action in a conversation Saturday with members of the governor's staff.
