Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure," he said. -- President Barack Obama addressed Congress shortly after 9 p.m.  Tuesday, but a casual viewer might have believed it was actually morning in America. " When he took office in 1981, Reagan said, "Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." Obama's response came Tuesday night: "I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves, that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity." "Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not, and a way that Bill Clinton did not," Obama argued at the start of last year's Democratic primaries. "Morning in America" was the theme of Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, and it was front and center in Obama's most critical event since Inauguration Day.
