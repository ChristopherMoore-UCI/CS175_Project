That may have explained why she was at an anti-government demonstration in Tehran on Saturday afternoon. Much about her remains unclear, but here is what CNN has learned from at least one source: The second of three children, Neda lived with her parents in a middle-class neighborhood east of Tehran. "And I think anyone who sees it knows there's something fundamentally unjust about it." Since Saturday, the Iranian government has sought to minimize the impact of her death, but one of her friends on Tuesday described her to CNN in an attempt to inject life and context into what has been -- for much of the rest of the world -- just a few seconds of powerful, if grainy, video. The young woman who last weekend emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government embraced life in many ways, but there was little about her that would have led her friends to predict she would become a martyr, one of them told CNN. The two are near where protesters were chanting in opposition to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose calls for an end to anti-government demonstrations have sparked defiance across the nation.
