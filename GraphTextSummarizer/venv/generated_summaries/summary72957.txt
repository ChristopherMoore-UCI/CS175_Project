And Tuesday evening, after rebel fighters who have battled Gadhafi's forces for six months punched into the compound, it was wreathed in smoke. A bombed-out building remains as a monument to a 1986 U.S. airstrike that killed one of Gadhafi's daughters, along with a statue of a Libyan fist crushing an American jet. The sprawling complex houses modern government offices, the Bedouin tent in which Gadhafi received visitors and stands of palm trees. Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, told CNN that at least one of the older buildings on the site was built atop a bunker four stories underground. But he said it was unlikely that Gadhafi had been in the complex before it was overrun Tuesday, since it had been targeted by repeated NATO airstrikes during the last few months of fighting.
