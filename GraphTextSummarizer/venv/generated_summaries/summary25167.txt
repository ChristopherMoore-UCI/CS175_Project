The child-run household I met after the genocide When I was assigned to Rwanda 18 years later, my first thought was the genocide -- this is probably true for most people. For anyone who has spent time in Africa, it's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles, drivers and passengers alike, both in Kigali and in the countryside. In my mind, Rwanda was going to be this country that was still on the brink of economic disaster. The lessons from Rwanda still echoing in my head, I was compelled to say "yes" to a country being torn apart by intercommunal fighting, just as Rwanda had been. -- When I first arrived in Rwanda's capital in 2012, I deliberately did not visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial.
