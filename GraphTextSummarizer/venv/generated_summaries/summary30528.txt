"We created more space, increased the amount of pedestrian space by about 70 percent, we have removed all of the pedestrian guard railing, we have created a much better environment for pedestrians. Westminster City Council believes the $7.6 million investment is worth it, saying the diagonal crossing not only reduces pedestrian travel time but also safety and that it has transformed what was once a haven for pickpockets into a much safer environment because pedestrians now have more personal space. Martin Low, director of transportation for Westminster City Council told CNN: "It has really been a phenomenal change from pedestrian hell to pedestrian heaven and what it has done is actually make retailers worldwide want to think about coming to the West End. That is until Westminster City Council, inspired by Tokyo's famous Shibuya crossing, decided that a similar crossing could solve their Oxford Circus congestion, and make the lives of tens of thousands of pedestrians just a little more pleasant. " Jacqui Ames, a secretary on a day trip to London from Bexhill, East Sussex, agrees: "It is much better, there isn't so much congestion and I got across the road without getting pushed and shoved." Steven, a security guard in one of the retail stores on Oxford Circus said: "It works really well, I use it every day and it is it quicker and safer than it was before.
