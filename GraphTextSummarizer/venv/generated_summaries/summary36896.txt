It's been a turbulent start to 2015 for leading Spanish club Barcelona as it sacked director of football Andoni Zubizarreta, while Carles Puyol decided to step down from his assistant sporting director role. A former captain of the club, who won three Champions League crowns and six La Liga titles, Puyol was appointed assistant sporting director soon after retiring as a player in May. I learned a lot, I am very grateful and, now, I want to try other things from another perspective and in other places," Puyol wrote. "The FC Barcelona President Josep Maria Bartomeu has decided to terminate as of today the contract of the Club's Director of Football, Andoni Zubizarreta," an official Barcelona statement read. " Zubizaretta wasn't the only leading figure at Barcelona to leave the club Monday after Puyol confirmed on his Facebook page that he would also be departing.
