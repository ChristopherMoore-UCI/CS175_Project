More schools around the country are adopting acceptance policies in support of transgender children and children who don't conform to gender norms. High School in Randle, Washington, asked students to dress up as their favorite celebrities for Spirit Week, Mason Mudge and Chandler Krueger did just that. The next day, many of their classmates skipped American Pride Day and instead came to school dressed as the opposite sex in protest of what had happened. Mudge came as Miss America. Superintendent Chuck Wyborney told KING5 News that things should have been handled differently with Krueger and Mudge.
