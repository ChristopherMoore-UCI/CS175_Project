Lafreniere said police found evidence suggesting he had fled Canada. "We believe he filmed himself," said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. Canadian police believe Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, has fled the country, prompting Interpol, the global police agency, to add his name to its most wanted list. The foot and hand belong to the same victim, Lafreniere said, and police believe the torso does as well. Lafreniere said police were aware of the animal allegations.
