Ryan's budget shows "the Republican Party is sticking to its principles of fiscal responsibility," said Ron Bonjean, a veteran GOP strategist for several congressional leaders and partner at the communications firm Singer Bonjean Strategies. It is the same type of message House Budget Committee chairman and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan echoed earlier in the week. White House charm offensive does not extend to Ryan budget White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, essentially accused Ryan of misreading last November's election in releasing a spending plan on Tuesday that seeks to unravel much of the Obama domestic agenda. That soul-searching is unfolding as party leadership braces itself for the next round of contentious budget battles and takes tentative steps toward working with a president whose very name is still a rallying cry for many in the base. Conservative positions â€” like those championed by Ryan on issues like trimming entitlement spending as a way of cutting the deficit -- are lost in messaging that reminds voters too much of a failed presidential platform.
