The zoo's other female polar bear had recently eaten her two offspring, and the zoo was worried that Flocke's mother would do the same. Zookeepers bottle-fed Flocke and kept her warm with blankets and heatlamps. The zoo's latest pictures of Flocke, from early last week, show her frolicking in her enclosure and paddling in a pool of shallow water. Â» Sweet pictures of the young bear being cuddled by her keepers or sleeping with her tongue sticking out boosted Flocke's popularity, and she quickly eclipsed Knut, the polar bear at the Berlin Zoo. The first chance to see Flocke up close was Tuesday, when the zoo held a media event with about 50 members of the public.
