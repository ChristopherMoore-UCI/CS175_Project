We look to Twitter for special care in handling content fairly not only because free speech needs sites with lots of people, but also because Twitter has begun to play a unique and remarkable role in the ecosystem of news so important to informing us as citizens. In one sense, Twitter is just a distribution system for news, most of which has first appeared on a professional news site. YouTube's community guidelines go beyond saying that you can't post "bad stuff" that's against the law, "like animal abuse, drug abuse, under-age drinking and smoking, or bomb making." And yet, it feels different for sites the size of Twitter and YouTube than for a little pet photos site. That makes sites like Twitter and YouTube especially important to our society.
