"She just didn't like snakes, I guess," Liberty-Eylau Fire Chief David Wesslehoft told CNN on Friday, in something of an understatment. "Could you hurry up, please?" A brick home the woman had recently purchased to move into was a complete loss, said Bowie County Sheriff's Deputy Randall Baggett. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report. The woman said she poured gasoline on the snake, which apparently was then set afire by her son, according to Wesslehoft. But for a Texas homeowner, an impromptu anti-snake solution -- set that repulsive reptile on fire -- came back to bite.
