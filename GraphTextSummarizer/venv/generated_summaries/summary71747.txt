"I think an awful lot of men have a visceral connection with their daughters which is unlike any connection they've ever had with anybody," says Joe Kelly, a father to twin daughters and author of the book "Dads and Daughters." " But for dads with daughters who are falling in love for the first time, it might be anything but a blast. They'd had this really special, close relationship between dad and daughter then all of a sudden she takes the off-ramp from that relationship." "In a certain way dads really do feel jilted, bereft even," says neuropsychiatrist Dr. Louann Brizendine. " Brizendine likes to reassure forlorn dads that their daughters' transformation isn't designed for the sole purpose of making their fathers miserable.
