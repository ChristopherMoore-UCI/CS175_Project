Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. By the time of their release, "detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment," he said.
