" The world's number one and two players, English duo Luke Donald and Lee Westwood, finished with opening round scores of 68 and 67 respectively. American Nick Watney is third on five-under and nine players are a shot back on four-under, including Denmark's Thomas Bjorn and American Stewart Cink. Playing his first tournament for nearly three months after an injury lay-off, Woods finished day one in Ohio at two-under-par, six behind leader Adam Scott, of Australia. With three birdies and just one bogey Woods looked in good touch in his first competitive action since he dropped out of The Players Championship back in May. Scott is one shot ahead of compatriot Jason Day, who finished the day on seven-under after a bogey-free 63.
