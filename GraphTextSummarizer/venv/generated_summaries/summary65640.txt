This Friday, Hader will be seen prominently in the raunchy summer comedy "The To Do List" opposite Aubrey Plaza, Rachel Bilson, Donald Glover and Scott Porter. Last week, the Emmy nominations came out, and it was the first time a male "Saturday Night Live" cast member has been nominated twice for "Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series." -- Comedian/actor Bill Hader has departed "Saturday Night Live" after eight seasons, but it's not like he's strapped for work. I thought if I stopped moving, it would sink in that I have to go on live television tonight. Martin Short, when he comes by ("Saturday Night Live"), he's still the funniest human being on the planet.
