Many mothers of special needs children want to appear as "supermoms," being able to balance all of their appointments and challenges and emotions, Castellano said. Most of the time, the caller agrees to engage in ongoing peer support, Castellano said. Having experienced the stress of having a child with developmental delays, she wanted to provide a way for other mothers to have caregiving support. Mom2Mom now has about 20 mothers on staff, all of whom have children with some sort of special need, including medical illness and mental health problems. Because it's a state-funded program, Mom2Mom's activities are aimed at New Jersey residents, but no one is turned away; peer support counselors will research resources to try to find connections for the callers in their own states.
