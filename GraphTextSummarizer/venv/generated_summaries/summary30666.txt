He reiterated an assertion he first made last week that his opponents have been given hallucinogens by al Qaeda operatives, and he said he felt betrayed by the United States, which had lifted its sanctions on the country after Gadhafi agreed to give up his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in 2003. -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared Monday either to not know that demonstrators in cities throughout Libya are calling for an end to his rule or not accept it, according to excerpts from the interview, which a U.S. official described as "delusional. " ABC's Christiane Amanpour, in a posting on the network's website, said Gadhafi arrived for the interview in a small convoy of sedans accompanied by little security. No, no." Asked why his people had captured and were holding the nation's second-largest city, Benghazi, Gadhafi said it was al Qaeda, not the Libyan people, who had done so. "Gadhafi said he wanted to speak to the press to get the truth out, and he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story," Amanpour wrote.
