Brewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement: "I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family," Jeremy Jarvis said. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a "bad decision." Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she "can't focus on that. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. " Valerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times.
