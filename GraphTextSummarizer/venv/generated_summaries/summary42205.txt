"That's crazy to think two young boys are dead, and no one knows anything about it," neighbor Michael Hatley told CNN affiliate WSAZ. Police identified the boys as Austin Wiseman and Blake Campbell. The boys, ages 9 and 12, were found in in Jackson, Ohio, about 75 miles south of Columbus. Police did not elaborate on how the boys were killed but said they were not looking for any other people in connection with the shooting. -- Police in Ohio said Wednesday they are investigating the deaths of two brothers found shot inside their grandparents' home earlier in the day.
