Dutch midfielder Mark van Bommel joined Serie A leaders AC Milan on Tuesday after Bayern Munich agreed to release the 33-year-old from his contract. Former Netherlands captain Van Bommel made 122 Bundesliga appearances for Bayern and also led his country to the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, where they lost 1-0 to Spain. The former Barcelona player's contract at the German champions was due to expire in June, but Bayern have allowed their captain to make the switch to Milan with immediate effect. "I leave FC Bayern with a heavy heart," Van Bommel said. On the basis of his service to the club, we have granted Mark's request." Van Bommel, who has signed a contract with Milan until the end of June, will head to the San Siro with the Rossoneri four-points clear at the top of Italy's Serie A after Sunday's 2-0 win over Cesena.
