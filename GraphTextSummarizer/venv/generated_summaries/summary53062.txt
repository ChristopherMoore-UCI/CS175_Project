Unbeknownst to him, Athar was stepping into one of the year's biggest news stories: the U.S. military operation that killed notorious terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. In an era when mobile-phone owners walk around with a video camera in their pocket at all times and tools like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube make broadcasting the results quick and simple, people like Athar can turn into journalists without even knowing it, Myers said. " Athar's tweets may have been the first public account of the nighttime raid by the now-famous SEAL Team Six that killed bin Laden at his secret compound. In the days that followed his soon-famous tweets, Athar got a look at the inner workings of parts of more mainstream journalism, and wasn't always impressed. In posts sometimes sprinkled with humor ("Go away helicopter - before I take out my giant swatter"), Athar's tweets evolved that night from his observations to messaging with a handful of other Pakistanis in Abbottabad and elsewhere to get to the bottom of things.
