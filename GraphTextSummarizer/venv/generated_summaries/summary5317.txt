Painted on the rock face behind the tiny waterfall are a pair of faded eland, the largest antelope in Africa. The artists used the blood and fat of the eland as well as whitened clay, bird droppings and charcoal as pigments. Higher up the mountain, hidden in a giant overhang at its very crest, is a remarkable fresco of hunters, antelope and mythic figures, known as therianthropes, which are part-human, part-animal beings. Raphael has been coming here for years, and is now studying rock art through university, but the beauty of this ancient gift left behind by lost generations has not faded for him. The tiny cave behind the waterfall is only one of thousands of such hidden, secret shelters in the Drakensberg-Ukahlamba Mountains of South Africa.
