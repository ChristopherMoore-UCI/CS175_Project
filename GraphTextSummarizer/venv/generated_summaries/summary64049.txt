The Pistorius family, which hired a "reputation management" firm to help with media relations, issued a statement Monday saying, "Oscar and the rest of the Pistorius family distances itself" from Henke Pistorius' comments. "Henke's interview with the newspaper was unapproved by our media liaison team," family spokesman Arnold Pistorius, Henke's brother, said. The family, in a statement released Tuesday, sought to distance itself from Henke Pistorius, Oscar's father, who said that some of the guns are for protection from crime -- protection he said the African National Congress government is not providing. Beeld, an Afrikaans language newspaper, has reported the Pistorius family owns 55 weapons -- between his father, grandfather and two uncles -- not counting Oscar's six guns. "The comment doesn't represent the views of Oscar or the rest of the Pistorius family."
