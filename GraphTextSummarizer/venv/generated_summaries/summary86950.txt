Oral arguments scheduled for that day have been rescheduled for Thursday at 10 a.m. Chief Justice John Roberts makes the ultimate call on whether to close and has consulted senior court staff. Public sessions were to open as scheduled for two important hourlong oral arguments, according to court officials. Later Monday, the court canceled its public session for Tuesday "due to weather conditions related to Hurricane Sandy," it said. Justice David Souter insisted on driving himself and was slightly late to the day's oral arguments, while Justice John Paul Stevens was stuck in Florida and never made it to work that day. The late Chief Justice William Rehnquist was known for ordering the court's 300-plus staff to work during snowstorms and other bad weather that paralyzed the rest of the city.
