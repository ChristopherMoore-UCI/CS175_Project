"They said they thought it was going to be an easy target," said police spokesman Capt. Wilson was standing at the counter across from employees at the GameStop store when two brothers, Carlton Hipps and Ramone Williams,  walked in carrying guns, police said. Wilson confronted them, and a firefight broke out, police said. Williams and Hipps had not seen the police car outside, where Wilson's partner Damien Stevenson sat. Both brothers have been charged with Wilson's murder and with attempted murder on Stevenson.
