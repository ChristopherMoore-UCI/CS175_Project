The double constructors' champions let former Red Bull driver David Coulthard take the title-winning RB7 for a rip-roaring tear through the Lincoln Tunnel at speeds of up to 190 miles per hour, before heading over to Liberty State Park, with the famous statue looking on across the Hudson River. -- Formula One isn't due to touch down in New Jersey until the inaugural Grand Prix of America next year, but it didn't stop the Red Bull team from heading over early to unleash a car on some well-known landmarks. It was Red Bull's second visit this year, after double world champion Sebastian Vettel tested out the New Jersey race circuit. In a bid to further endear the team to potential new fans stateside, Coulthard revved the engine to perform a Red Bull rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner." Red Bull, bidding for a third consecutive team crown, top the constructors' championship.
