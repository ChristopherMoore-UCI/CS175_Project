A Davis Cup final already steeped in intrigue soared to another level Saturday and now the question is: Can Roger Federer and Switzerland recover against France in front of a potential record crowd this weekend? Making the transition from one surface to another is difficult -- the home team chose clay for the Davis Cup final and has practiced on it for weeks -- although at least a long flight wasn't needed for the Swiss to get to northern France. Federer and Wawrinka were sure things to play singles for Switzerland if deemed fit, with France holding more options. The majority of the at least 27,000 expected to be in attendance per day -- the largest tennis crowd for a professional match remains the 27,200 who turned up to watch Spain defeat the U.S. in the 2004 final in Seville -- probably wouldn't mind if Federer is sub-par since it would give France a massive advantage. At least on the relationship front, though, things appear to be better between Federer and Wawrinka ahead of the affair at the Stade Pierre Mauroy, the home of Lille in football's Ligue 1.
