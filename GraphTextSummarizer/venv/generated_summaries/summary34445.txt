"Right now, many Latinos are unable to manage the costs for preventative care," Troncoso said, "and will often develop secondary conditions that can be even more serious because they could not manage their chronic conditions with proper treatment." Once the Affordable Care Act goes into effect on January 1, it should ease the stress for many Hispanics who have lower-paying jobs that don't offer health insurance. While the Affordable Care Act may leave something to be desired from physicians, Dieppa hopes that with widespread access to health care, Latinos around the country will better educate themselves about their health and heed the warnings of their doctors. Experts say these health disparities can be attributed to many causes, but chief among them is a lack of access to quality health care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates 1 out of every 3 Hispanics doesn't have health insurance. But the debilitating disease disproportionately affects Hispanics, almost double those of non-Latino whites, according to the American Diabetes Association.
