Woods has won the tournament -- which helps raise money for Tiger Woods Foundation programs -- four times. Cellphone pictures of the accident from CNN affiliate WFTV Nordegren rode in the ambulance with Woods, who was treated at Health Central Hospital before he was released Friday, Montes said Saturday. Montes said both rear passenger windows of the SUV -- which was towed from the scene -- were shattered and there was damage to the left and right of its front end, resulting in $5,000 to $8,000 in estimated damages. Troopers had also tried to speak to Woods on Friday as part of a routine car accident investigation, but his wife said he was sleeping, Montes said. Though they didn't interview Woods on Saturday, the troopers entered the luxury complex and started part of their investigation into the incident, Montes said.
