Cobane, a 15-year veteran, and Woollum, a veteran of more than 10 years, have been placed on administrative reassignment while investigations are under way, according to Seattle police. The second officer was identified this week as Mary Lynne Woollum, Seattle police said. The preliminary inquiry comes a day after the NAACP sent a letter to the King County prosecuting attorney's office requesting Seattle police Detective Shandy Cobane be charged with malicious harassment, a hate crime. The FBI in Seattle, Washington, is looking into allegations of civil rights violations in the case of a police officer caught on video kicking a Latino detainee, an agent said Wednesday. "We give officers guns, batons and badges with the hope that they will not violate our public trust, with the hope that they will enforce the law, provide public safety and honor the Constitution," James Bible, president of the Seattle chapter of the NAACP, said Tuesday in denouncing the police officers' actions.
