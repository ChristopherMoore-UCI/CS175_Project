Jesse Jackson Jr. detailed to a Chicago newspaper her husband's "collapse" and his last two months getting treated for gastrointestinal and mental health issues, saying he's still "very depressed" though showing some progress. "What I can tell you is my husband has his good days and bad days, and they are increasing his depression medication to therapeutic levels," Sandi Jackson told the paper. With Sandi Jackson at the family's other home in Chicago, the congressman's father and brother Yusef took him to a Washington hospital in early June.
