The university terminated Zinkhan on Sunday, President Michael Adams told reporters on Monday. Authorities do not believe Zinkhan is still on campus or in the city of Athens, University Police Chief Jimmy Williams said Monday. Clarence Holeman identified the victims as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63. After the shooting, Zinkhan left the scene with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. University police were assisting Athens-Clarke County police in their investigation, officials said Monday.
