-- With the first of its flights touching down in earthquake-devastated Haiti late Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. began deploying military planes, ships and ground troops to the Caribbean nation. The group includes a unit of U.S. Air Force Special Operations Forces that departed Hurlburt Field in Florida on Wednesday afternoon. The Marines will deploy aboard a large deck amphibious ship, which would give the military more helicopters to work with in Haiti. Southern Command has ordered a unit of about 2,000 Marines to head to Haiti. One of two planes carrying a 30-person assessment team arrived at Port-au-Prince airport about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.
