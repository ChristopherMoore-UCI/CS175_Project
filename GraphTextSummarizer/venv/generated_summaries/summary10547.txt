On the weekend of baseball Hall of Fame inductions in Cooperstown, New York, he often held autograph sessions at a nearby bookstore, rankling the Hall of Famers who played before Rose. When contacted, a spokesman for Selig said, "The commissioner stands by his comments to reporters he made during [last month's] Hall of Fame weekend, as judge and jury on this." Selig said then, "I would remind you that Pete Rose admitted to gambling on baseball and agreed to a lifetime ban." As long as Pete Rose is banned from baseball, he will be banned from any Hall of Fame ballot. No matter if it's a third-base coach or an all-star, Hall of Fame-type player," said Faye Vincent, who was MLB deputy commissioner at the time baseball investigated Rose for betting on his team. Giamatti's successor, Vincent, said Rose prevented himself from ever getting considered for a possible return to baseball.
