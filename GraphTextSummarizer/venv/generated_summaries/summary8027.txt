Together with Jetstar, feng shui master Tong will pick two lucky singles who have the best matching feng shui, as well as personality traits and descriptions of their ideal date overseas. A personalized feng shui report is generated indicating compatible zodiac signs, best inflight seats, travel destination and activities. The airline has teamed with feng shui master, David Tong, to launch a campaign called Love is in the Zodiac Pair. These people should sit in row nine, 19 or 29 and travel to Jakarta, says Jetstar's feng shui guide. A few weeks shy of the world's annual days of horror for singles -- namely Valentine's Day and Lunar New Year, when concerned relatives and friends shamelessly judge your (lack of) relationship -- Australia-based low-cost airline Jetstar Airways is offering an escape and a chance to find love at the same time.
