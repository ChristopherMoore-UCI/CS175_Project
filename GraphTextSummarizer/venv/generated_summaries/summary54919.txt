Three bodies were found on Sunday after two houses in Mitake, a tiny community in western Japan's Yamaguchi prefecture, were gutted by a "suspicious" fire, Yamaguchi police spokesman Katsumi Harada told CNN on Wednesday. He was barefoot, wearing only his underwear when he was discovered, police spokesman Kazutaka Umemoto told CNN. An autopsy revealed that all five victims were killed by injuries to the head, prompting police to set up a task force to investigate a possible serial killer, Harada said. According to the authorities, the poem translated as: "Setting on fire, smoke gives delight, to country fellows." The case attracted significant media attention after a note, apparently written in the form of a "haiku" poem -- a short form of Japanese verse -- was left hanging in the window of the fugitive man's home.
