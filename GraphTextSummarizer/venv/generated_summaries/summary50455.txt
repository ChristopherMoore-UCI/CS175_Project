Cruz has agreed to be the keynote speaker next week at the Duval County GOP Lincoln Day Dinner in Jacksonville, Florida -- home territory of GOP prospects Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Jeb Bush is an obvious winner now that Mitt Romney has bowed out of the 2016 GOP race: As long as Jeb Bush has a prominent place in the GOP field, the Democrats think -- Julie Pace of The Associated Press tells us -- those notes might still come in handy. "After Jeb Bush makes his speeches, you sometimes get notes from Democrats saying: 'Oh, look how similar this is to things Mitt Romney said.' "They're going to try to have as many of the candidates on stage as they can, maybe with an anchor asking them questions, then maybe have their board members asking the questions, have people from the audience asking them questions," he said.
