Although the number of kidney donors has grown since 1998, the wait list has doubled as the incidence of diabetes, a leading cause of kidney disease, rises to crisis levels. "Kidneys from living donors last, on average, 25 years while kidneys from cadavers last an average of 10 years, because kidneys from living donors are usually in better shape,'' said Dr. Jonathan Lazare, a urologist with the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. They launched the Flood Sisters Kidney Foundation of America at www.floodsisters.org, which has about 20 members, to bring potential living kidney donors together with people who need them. About three-quarters of kidney transplants are between family members, and the rest are among friends and acquaintances, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a not-for-profit organization that manages the nation's transplant system. "An important argument supporting the solicitation of donors through advertising is that many such altruistic unrelated donors would never have given their organs without being moved by the personal stories of the patients on the Web," Prager said.
