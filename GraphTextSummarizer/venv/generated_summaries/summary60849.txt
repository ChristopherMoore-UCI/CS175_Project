The health ministry said levels of radioactive iodine three times greater than the regulated standard were found in drinking water in a village near the Fukushima plant and asked residents not to drink from the tap, Kyodo News reported Sunday. The Japanese government has banned the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture, where the Fukushima Daiichi plant is located, and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards, the country's Health Ministry reported. Very small amounts -- far below the level of concern -- of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water in Tokyo and most prefectures near the Fukushima plant. It was unclear whether the cooling system in reactor No. 2 was working after power was restored Sunday. But officials said they were monitoring reactor No. 3 to determine whether to release gas to reduce mounting pressure in the containment vessel -- the steel and concrete shell that insulates radioactive material inside.
