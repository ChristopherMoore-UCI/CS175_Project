In a column posted on the Los Angeles Times Web site Tuesday night, Laura Ling and Euna Lee also said they were seized by North Korean soldiers on Chinese soil. " But they provided information about the day of their arrest and reporting on North Korean defections to China and the human trafficking industry that supports them. The women said they were in that region of North Korea "to raise awareness about the harsh reality facing these North Korean defectors who, because of their illegal status in China, live in terror of being sent back to their homeland." Freed U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee said they spent less than a minute on North Korean soil. " "We didn't spend more than a minute on North Korean soil before turning back, but it is a minute we deeply regret," they said.
