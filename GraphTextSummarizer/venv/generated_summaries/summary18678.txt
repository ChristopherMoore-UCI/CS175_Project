"It could be that more people die in female-named hurricanes simply because more people died in hurricanes on average before they started getting male names," Lazo said. He notes that all hurricanes had female names until 1979 -- meaning the study included 29 years without male hurricane names. For decades, all hurricanes were given female names in part because hurricanes were unpredictable, the study said, citing the "Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons and Cyclones." As expected, more people would flee their homes if Hurricane Christopher came barreling toward them compared to an impending Hurricane Christina. In one experiment, participants predicted the intensity of 10 hurricanes -- five with female names and five with male names.
