U.N.: World can 'thrive' as population reaches 7 billion Using data from a range of sources, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the World Meteorological Organization, the images depict a sprawl of air traffic routes, the underwater cables that carry the internet, road and rail networks, pipelines, shipping lanes and electricity transmission lines. To show some of the impacts of this vast human upheaval, Canadian anthropologist Felix Pharand has created a series of visualizations mapping the presence of technology onto a selection of satellite images showing the Earth from space. "These images are illustrations of how far we have come at transforming our home planet," said Pharand, who is founder-director of Globaia -- an environmental education organization based in Quebec. My goal is to foster global awareness of these issues by changing people's worldviews," said Pharand. "It shows a human-dominated planet where wilderness areas are shrinking and where the habitats of other species are decreasing in size," he added.
