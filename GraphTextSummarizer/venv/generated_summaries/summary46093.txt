Chechen security agents have killed a top al Qaeda militant believed to responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in Russia's Northern Caucasus region, officials announced Friday. The fight has exacted a heavy toll in the North Caucasus region where Chechnya is located, and has now spread to other regions of Russia. " Russia's National Anti-Terrorist Committee said Mohanned was"directly involved in virtually every suicide terrorist attack committed in the Russian Federation over the past few years," according to intelligence information gained from captured Chechen rebels. In addition, Chechen rebels held 700 audience-members hostage in a Moscow theater in 2002. A Chechen rebel leader took the responsibility for the deadly bombings that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow in March 2010.
