-- Soldiers and rescue workers on Friday pulled stranded people out of deluged swathes of southern China inundated by 11 days of heavy rain, state media said. Officials said the repairs will run through next week, though storms could hamper the effort, Xinhua said. Eleven days of heavy rains in China caused the flooding, according to Xinhua. Two dikes on the eastern Fu River in Jiangxi broke on Wednesday, forcing another 100,000 people to join the 2.3 million already evacuated, state officials estimated. The rains have led to the deaths of 211 people in 10 provinces, while 119 others are listed as missing, according to Xinhua news agency.
