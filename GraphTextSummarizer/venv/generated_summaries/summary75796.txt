-- The space shuttle Discovery was waved off from its first chance to land Friday afternoon because of unstable weather near Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA said. " Crews have been activated at Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert in case NASA decides to land the shuttle there, where the weather is not considered an issue. Discovery initially was scheduled to return to Earth on Thursday, but poor weather in central Florida also forced a delay. The shuttle will make another orbit of Earth, while NASA mission managers watch to see if extreme moisture and lightning threaten a safe landing. The space agency, however, usually exhausts all landing windows in Florida before sending the spacecraft to California.
