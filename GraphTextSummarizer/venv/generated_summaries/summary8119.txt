Miramonte is located in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about 6 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. Since his initial appearance, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy said that Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011, after school officials learned of the police investigation. The law enforcement probe began when investigators found "over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom, with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape," a Los Angeles County sheriff's statement said. Dismissed by the Los Angeles Unified School District school board about a year ago, Berndt was arrested January 30.
