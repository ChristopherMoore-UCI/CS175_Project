Drug subs come in several forms and are built of fiberglass, wood and steel in the swamps along the west coast of Colombia, under the cover of heavy foliage, Coast Guard officials say. U.S. Navy and Coast Guard personnel approach a sinking drug sub about 200 miles off the coast of Ecuador. Federal officials estimate drug subs now transport about one-third of all cocaine that moves by sea from South America to the United States. "As we go through the first prosecutions associated with this, we are actually kind of paving new ground here on how it is we have to prepare cases," said Adm. Thad Allen, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. "This is a unique statue probably born out of the frustration of federal officials trying to prove criminal activity on part of the drug traffickers," said Robert Silbering, former special narcotics prosecutor for New York.
