Woods will resume Friday with six shots separating him from English duo Paul Casey and Steve Webster who sit on seven under part alongside South Africa's Darren Fichardt. That should be of little surprise however, given Casey's past successes on courses set out by the Scot. " ThorbjÃ¸rn Olesen and Ricardo Gonzalez both finished on six-under after recording rounds of 66, while Sweden's money-list leader Henrik Stenson was forced to stop after reaching four-under through 10. " The course, which has been designed by Colin Montgomerie, appeared to suit Casey's game. The Englishman's past two European Tour victories at the 2011 Volvo Golf Champions and this year's Irish Open have both come on Montgomerie's courses.
