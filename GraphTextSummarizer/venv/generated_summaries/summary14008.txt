The secretary-general promised assistance to affected people in southern Kyrgyzstan and those seeking refuge in Uzbekistan, and said he intended to consult with key members of the U.N. Security Council upon his return to New York later Wednesday. -- The flow of refugees fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan has gone from a flood to a trickle, the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said. Aid workers were calling the fallout from ethnic clashes in Kyrgyzstan a humanitarian crisis. Francois Blancy, deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Uzbekistan, said more aid is needed. The violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks had calmed down earlier this week after more than 170 people were killed and more than 1,400 were wounded.
