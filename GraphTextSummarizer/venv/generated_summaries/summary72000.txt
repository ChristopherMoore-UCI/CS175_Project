He had been on the run since the robbery and homicide almost two months ago, according to FBI spokesman John Gillies. -- A fugitive accused of stealing $2 million from an armored truck he was driving and killing his partner was caught early Tuesday in Florida, according to the FBI. Konias is believed to have shot his partner, Michael Haines, in the head February 28 before stealing cash from the Garda armored vehicle in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Kenneth Konias Jr., 22, was arrested in Pompano Beach by the FBI, the Broward Sheriff's Office and a South Florida Violent Crimes Task Force. Last month, Pittsburgh police discovered about $24,000 at Konias' grandmother's grave site and more than $200,000 at his parents' home.
