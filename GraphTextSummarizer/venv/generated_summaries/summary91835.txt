A coalition of 44 organizations in eastern Congo wrote to the Security Council on Tuesday, pleading for more troops. A U.N. peacekeeper rides atop an armored vehicle last week in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo.

A spokeswoman for the British mission to the United Nations said London is "not ruling in or out EU forces," instead focusing on strengthening the U.N. presence in eastern Congo. -- Britain and France are calling for an additional 3,000 United Nations troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the U.N. already has its biggest peacekeeping mission, a senior British diplomat said Wednesday.
