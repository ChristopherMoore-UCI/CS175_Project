At issue was whether Covington's remarks represented such testimony or were "excited utterances" that helped police assess a crime emergency. In April 2001, police in Detroit found Covington at a gas station with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, in great pain, and having a hard time speaking. She added that since "the situation was fluid" with different officers arriving at different times and each asking what happened, police "did not conduct a structured interrogation," which would normally be barred from trial without the presence of the person who had been questioned. The high court in 2006 gave greater protection to defendants over the use of hearsay testimony in criminal cases. The justices concluded the mortally wounded man's statements to police were "non-testimonial" and therefore admissible in court.
