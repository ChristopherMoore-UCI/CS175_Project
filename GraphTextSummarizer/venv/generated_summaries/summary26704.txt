Joining these soaring landmarks are some even more eye-popping structures; the towers of Crescent Place and the Hotel Crescent, designed by South Korean architecture firm, Heerim Architects and Planners. Funded largely by money from oil and gas exports, the city has become one of the most vibrant places on the planet for grand designs, with numerous head-turning projects towering above low-rise Soviet-era apartments and medieval walled city. The firm won the rights to build the two projects, as well as the 39-story Crescent City and 38-floor future headquarters for the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), through an international competition. Within five years in Baku more roads, new parks, a new transit system, water supplies and internet connections will all be in place. "(Azerbaijan) is considered to have the will and economic power based on high-growth that can widely accommodate new architecture designs," wrote a spokesperson for Heerim.
