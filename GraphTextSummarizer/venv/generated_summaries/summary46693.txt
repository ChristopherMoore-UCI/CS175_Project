Manchester United qualified from Group C with a 1-0 win away to Scottish side Rangers, as Wayne Rooney scored the winner in his first start since early October. Juan Mata's 17th-minute penalty was followed by the first of striker Roberto Soldado's two goals, then fellow striker Aritz Aduriz netted at the near post at the second attempt and winger Joaquin whipped a deflected effort into the top corner. England's Tottenham, playing in Europe's top club competition for the first time, remained top of the table after crushing Werder Bremen 3-0. Third-placed Twente hit the crossbar through second-half substitute Denny Landzaat in the 75th minute, but now face a drop into the second-tier Europa League. The Italian champions scraped a 1-0 win at home to Dutch league winners Twente to go through to the last 16 ahead of the final round of matches on December 7.
