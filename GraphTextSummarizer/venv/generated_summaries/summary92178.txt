Shatz is one of 50 Pearl Harbor survivors and 10 World War II veterans expected to attend Saturday's ceremony, which is slated to begin at 7:45 a.m. (12:45 p.m. ET) and last 90 minutes, said Eileen Martinez, a spokeswoman for the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument and the USS Arizona Memorial. The 90-year-old former sailor told CNN affiliate KHNL that he had intended to fly Wednesday from Los Angeles International Airport to Honolulu, Hawaii, to take part in a memorial on Saturday at Pearl Harbor in honor of more than 2,400 who died in the Japanese air attacks in 1941. "United agents in Los Angeles noticed Mr. Shatz in the lobby attempting to check in for the flight and, after approaching him and offering assistance, proactively rebooked him on the best available alternate flight. At the end of the ceremony, current enlisted military personnel will form an honor cordon through which the WWII veterans, Pearl Harbor survivors and civilian witnesses in attendance will walk or, in some cases, ride in wheelchairs, Martinez said. -- Nearly 72 years after surviving the attacks from the menacing skies over Pearl Harbor, Ewalt Shatz found himself fighting another battle: this time, just to make it to the islands.
