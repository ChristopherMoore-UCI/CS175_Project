But the American, who will compete in the doubles event alongside her sister and top seed Serena Williams, refused to look for excuses after her defeat by the 22nd seed Makarova, who will face U.S. world No. 141 Irina Falconi in the second round. The former world No. 1 came into the year's first grand slam in good form after reaching the final of a warm-up event in Auckland in New Zealand, but despite winning the first set against Russia's Ekaterina Makarov, Williams slipped to a 2-6 6-4 6-4 defeat. It was Kumkhum's first ever match with a top 10 player and her victory means she will at least equal her best grand slam performance to date -- reaching the second round in Melbourne last year. Fresh from picking up her first title in two years in Auckland, 14th seed Ana Ivanovic beat Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens 6-4 6-4. Li's reward for beating the world No. 239 is a second round meeting with Switzerland's Belinda Bencic.
