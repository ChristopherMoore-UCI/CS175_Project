For example, the "X-rated" bet that they made before the opening of "21 Jump Street" -- wherein Hill promised to "kiss the tip" of a certain part of Tatum's anatomy through his underwear if they reached $35 million that first weekend -- is exactly the kind of off-the-wall camaraderie that comes across on screen. In the "Jump Street" movies, the pair play former high school foes who become friends after being partnered as police officers. What works so well in the film, which sees the pair's undercover cops head to work on a college campus, is what cements the duo's bond off-screen: a raunchy, daring sense of humor. The concept is a spin on the '80s TV series of the same name, and, like in the TV show, Hill's Schmidt and Tatum's Jenko are at first sent to work undercover in a high school. And if they weren't really friends off screen, they probably would be.
