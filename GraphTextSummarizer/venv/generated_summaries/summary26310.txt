The dream of a smartwatch has been around in popular culture for decades -- cartoon detective Dick Tracy had an early version of one -- but recent advances like smaller, cheaper sensors and low-power Bluetooth technology are finally making it possible to pack powerful features into tinier shells. The Android powered device will be called the Galaxy Gear and will be able to handle the smartphone basics: phone calls, Web surfing and e-mails, said the report. Wrists are the most popular body part for the coming wave of wearable devices, followed by heads. The wearable tech market is expected to hit $1.5 billion in 2014, a huge leap from the $800 million it's raking in this year, according to a report by Juniper Research. Samsung will announce the product at an event on September 4, just ahead of the big IFA consumer electronics show in Germany.
