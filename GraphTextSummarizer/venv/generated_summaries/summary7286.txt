-- Shortly after President Obama tapped Stanley McChrystal in June 2009 to be the top commander in Afghanistan, CNN reported that McChrystal would never let a reporter in the room during classified morning meetings he led among senior military officers. "Not just the traffic on the road, but how money is made, who is running rule of law, who do they go to when they have dispute adjudication -- do they go to a Taliban shadow court, a government of Afghanistan official entity?" " ... Tillman's mother said last year that McChrystal knew at her son's memorial service that he had died of friendly fire, but did not tell the family. McChrystal told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he helped expedite the Silver Star award for Tillman before confirming that Tillman was killed by friendly fire. On Tuesday, McChrystal flew from Afghanistan to Washington.
