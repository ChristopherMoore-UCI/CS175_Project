Watch Salau describe his feelings on returning Â» Rick Kell, head of Troops First, traveled to Iraq with the soldiers and said the idea came from American troops. Troops First would like to include as many soldiers as possible, Kell said, but U.S. troops will not be in Iraq for much longer. According to them, the main reason for that is the support they've gotten from the military command in Iraq, particularly Gen. Raymond Odierno, the top U.S. commander there. Odierno's experiences with his son, who lost his arm in Iraq, helped the general better understand these soldiers' plight, Kell said. According to Kell, he encounters many soldiers who would like to return, but those who are selected are chosen carefully.
