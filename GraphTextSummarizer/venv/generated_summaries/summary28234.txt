"There will never be another John Wooden," said UCLA Director of Athletics Dan Guerrero. " "This is a sad day at UCLA," said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block. After marrying his high school sweetheart and life-long love Nell following his graduation, Wooden coached at the high school level and at Indiana State before being hired by UCLA in 1948. UCLA also captured 19 conference titles and set an NCAA record with 88 consecutive wins over four seasons, but Wooden was more proud of his players accomplishments off the court. Wooden retired from UCLA in 1975, following his 10th national championship but would occasionally take in a Bruins game from the stands.
