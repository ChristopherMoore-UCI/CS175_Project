" Nine golfers have automatically qualified for the team: Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Zach Johnson, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jordan Spieth, Jimmy Walker and Bubba Watson. Woods, 38, was a potential selection by U.S. captain Tom Watson for the team, but the 14-time major tournament winner said the match play event against Europe's best golfers meant too much and he shouldn't play if he couldn't give it his best effort. He said he plans to return to tournament golf at the World Challenge tournament at Isleworth in Orlando, Florida, beginning December 1. -- Tiger Woods, who quit a recent PGA Tour event because of back spasms, withdrew Wednesday from consideration for the United States Ryder Cup team, the golfer announced on his website. Tom Watson will pick three other golfers for the team and announce their selections on September 2.
