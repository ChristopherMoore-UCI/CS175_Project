The British businessman accused of ordering a hit on his new wife while on honeymoon in South Africa will appear in a Cape Town court on Tuesday. He denies murdering Anni Dewani, 28, in November 2010 in Cape Town. Dewani, a millionaire care home owner, is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife during a taxi ride in Cape Town in November 2010, just over two weeks after their wedding. Upon arrival in South Africa, he is likely to be transferred to the bleak, prison-like Valkenberg hospital, a high security psychiatric facility in Cape Town. Dewani left from Bristol Airport Monday night, according to a statement issued by London's Metropolitan Police, and is set to arrive in South Africa on Tuesday morning, local time.
