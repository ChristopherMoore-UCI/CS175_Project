The victim in the case was one of 400 children seized from the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, in April 2008 by state child welfare workers. Jessop also received an $8,000 fine, said Sheriff David Doran, of Schleicher County, Texas. The children were returned after the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the state had no right to remove them and lacked evidence to show that they were in danger of abuse. -- A polygamist sect member arrested following last year's raid of a west Texas ranch was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting an underage girl, authorities said. Critics of the sect say young girls are forced into "spiritual" marriages with older men and are sexually abused.
