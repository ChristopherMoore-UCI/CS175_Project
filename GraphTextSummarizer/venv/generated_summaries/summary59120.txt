The package includes the first contributions to a $100 billion Green Climate Fund to help developing countries to invest in clean energy and adapt to climate change. In Copenhagen in 2009, countries agreed to work towards keeping the increase in global temperatures below two degrees Celsius to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. If the country failed to do so, Kent said taxpayers would have to give $14 billion to other countries "with no impact on emissions or the environment." However, its decision to formally leave the pact does send a symbolic message to other countries which might be looking for a way out, according to Greenpeace. "It is regrettable and flies in the face of the efforts of the international community for Canada to leave the Kyoto Protocol at a time when the Durban meeting, as everyone knows, made important progress by securing a second phase of commitment to the Protocol," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said at a news briefing, according to Reuters.
