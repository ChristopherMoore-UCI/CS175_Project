Greek authorities have been stopping ships, including the American boat The Audacity of Hope, from leaving Greek waters for Gaza. "Authorities are following the necessary legal procedures," including "checking the identities of the passengers" and "the ship's documents," said Greek coast guard head of press Elias Sambatakakis. -- A French boat trying to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza is "stuck" in Greece, detained along with its crew by Greek authorities, Israel insists on controlling access to Gaza because it says it has to keep weapons out of the hands of Palestinian militants who would use them to attack Israelis. Gaza is run by Hamas, which has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks and is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization.
