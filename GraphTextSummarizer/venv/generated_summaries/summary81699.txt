Asian football chief Mohamed bin Hammam was banned from the game for life after being found guilty of corruption for trying to buy votes in the FIFA presidential election with $40,000 in cash inducements to Caribbean football officials last year. Allegations of corruption also rocked FIFA's governing body last year. -- World soccer's governing body FIFA has nominated the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to be its lead anti-corruption investigator, FIFA said Tuesday. News of his nomination comes a day after police in Italy arrested at least 19 people, including Lazio team captain Stefano Mauri, in connection with a match-fixing investigation -- the latest scandal to plague international soccer. In March, FIFA pledged to reform its governance structure to address concerns about corruption.
