Prosecutors have charged Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz with first-degree murder, however, more than a year since the June 17, 2013, homicide, prosecutors have yet to definitively say who was the alleged trigger man. Prosecutors believe the gun seen in Hernandez's left hand is the alleged murder weapon, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Unlike the missing weapon in the Lloyd case, police have found a .38 caliber gun they accuse Hernandez of using to kill Safiro Furtado and Daniel Abreu in Boston in July 2012.
