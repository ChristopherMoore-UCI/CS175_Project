Founded by pioneering swing coach Leslie King back in 1951, KGS thrives through word of mouth, welcoming around 300 new disciples each year on the strength of its tutelage. " Golf addiction One of KGS' biggest supporters is film star Grant, who has spent hours in Knightsbridge grooving a swing that is regularly put to the test in celebrity golf tournaments around the world. "Sean Connery wasn't a golfer before the film and at the time he was seeing a dentist called Ian Caldwell, then an English amateur champion, taught by Leslie King," Gould explains. "Leslie King once had a guy come in who was the only person he told he couldn't help," Gould says. "Golfers today, unfortunately, are no better than they were back in 1951 when the school opened," Steve Gould, who along with D.J. Wilkinson has more than 35 years of KGS service under his belt, told CNN.
