"There are a number of family reasons which mean it makes sense for him to spend more time in London than he has previously and make that more of a base," a person close to the Israeli billionaire told the Financial Times on Monday. Fellow Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev relocated to London in 2007. His mother lives in London and his son recently left the Israeli army and plans to study abroad, possibly in the UK. Through Quantum Pacific Group, Mr Ofer is controlling shareholder in Israel Corp, the country's largest holding company, which has interests in turn in container shipping, automotive, energy, and the fertiliser company Israel Chemicals. Idan Ofer, Israel's richest man, is relocating to London in a move likely to inflame debate about unfettered wealth and inequality in his country.
