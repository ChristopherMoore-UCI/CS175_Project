Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed a bill into law Wednesday that abolishes the death penalty, making his state the 17th in the nation to abandon capital punishment and the fifth in five years to usher in a repeal. Advocates of a repeal say that Connecticut's past law kept inmates -- who were often engaged in multiple appeals -- on death row for extended periods of time, costing taxpayers far more than if the convicts were serving a life sentence in the general prison population. Of those, only one person has been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. The state now has 11 people on death row. It replaces the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of release as the state's highest form of punishment.
