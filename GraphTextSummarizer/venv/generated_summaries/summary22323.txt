Syrian children can enroll in public schools in Lebanon as long as there is space, but many schools are already at capacity. They need our help to stay alive, to go to school and to be kids again. I met mothers and children who have witnessed unspeakable acts of violence, including the death of loved ones. According to UNICEF, there are more than 270,000 refugee children who are not in school in the country; by the end of the year, the number could exceed 400,000. Clean water, schools, health care and nutrition are all at risk.
