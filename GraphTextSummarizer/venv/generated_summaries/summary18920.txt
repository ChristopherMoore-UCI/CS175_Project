-- A South Carolina sheriff's office is investigating whether Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps smoked marijuana on the University of South Carolina campus. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina, in Richland County. "If someone breaks the law in Richland County, we have an obligation as law enforcement to investigate and to bring charges," Sheriff Leon Lott said in a statement. "The Richland County Sheriff's Department is making an effort to determine if Mr. Phelps broke the law. "I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment," said Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, in a statement Sunday.
