-- Authorities said there was no danger at Texas A&M University after a report of a gunman on campus Thursday turned out to be a person with a replica weapon. It asked those on campus to "seek safe shelter until further notice." Texas A&M, located in College Station, Texas, has an enrollment of more than 49,000. Some members of the Corps are on special drill teams and are known to train with mock rifles on campus. Rudder Tower, where the alleged armed man was spotted, is one of the most heavily trafficked parts of campus.
