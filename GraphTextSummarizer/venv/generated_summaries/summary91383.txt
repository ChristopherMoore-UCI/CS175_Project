Protests against the "Innocence of Muslims" film erupted in September in many Muslim countries, including Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories. He was identified in initial news accounts in September as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the name used in the bank fraud case. Backed by hardcore anti-Islam groups in the United States, the film sparked outrage after an Arabic translation of the film's trailer was released online a few weeks before the anniversary of September 11. The suspects are accused of being involved with the production of the film in California, said Adel Al Saeed, official spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
