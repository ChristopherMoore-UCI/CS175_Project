The case is Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International (12-10). Federal money came with two conditions, including the "Policy Requirement"-- a ban on "assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking." Several groups objected to what they called a "loyalty oath," including the U.S.-based Alliance for Open Society and Pathfinder International. In addition to promoting abstinence, monogamy, counseling, and the use of condoms, the law sought to use U.S. funds to "educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially" as well as finding ways to help "commercial sex workers" themselves get out of the business. The anti-prostitution pledge in the law would still apply to organizations based outside the United States receiving U.S. funds.
