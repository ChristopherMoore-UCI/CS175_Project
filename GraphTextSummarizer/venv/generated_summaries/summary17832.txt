Walmart is the largest employer of black people in the country, and black Americans make up a huge portion of their customers. In the case of John Crawford III, there is video evidence -- and Walmart needs to release the tape to the public immediately. Crawford's family says the video demonstrates that their son was never a threat, and that he was gunned down in cold blood. A few minutes later, Crawford was dead -- shot on sight by police. It appears not just in those who are openly bigoted, but even among believers in racial equality (including many black people ourselves).
