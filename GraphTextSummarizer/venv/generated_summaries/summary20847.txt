Running the 10,000 meters was a compromise, says Jos Hermens of Global Sports Communication, Gebrselassie's manager. "It's not a normal preparation for a marathon," Gebrselassie's manager, Jos Hermens says. In Beijing in August, Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie will once again find himself staring down the 10,000 meters of rubberized track that curls between him and a third gold medal in the Olympic event. Gebrselassie goes on a training run with companions at home in Addis Ababa. They're already superior athletes," Gebrselassie says.
