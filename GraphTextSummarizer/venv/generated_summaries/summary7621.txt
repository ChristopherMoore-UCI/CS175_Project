According to a December 21 e-mail reprinted by Neiman, Apple rejected his app because it "contains content that ridicules public figures and is in violation of Section 3.3.14 from the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement which states: Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind (text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that in Apple's reasonable judgment may be found objectionable, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic, or defamatory. The news of the rejection comes not long after Apple decided to purge its app store of content that included nudity, a retroactive ban that included apps from respected German publications such as Bild and Der Spiegel. Editorial cartoonist Mark Fiore may be good enough to win this year's Pulitzer Prize, but he's evidently too biting to get past the auditors who run Apple's iPhone app store, who ruled that lampooning public figures violated its terms of service. Apple banned an e-book reading application once because it figured out that iPhone users could use it to read a free version of the Kama Sutra. Fiore's rejection may be especially disconcerting to news and media organizations, many of which are betting heavily on iPad apps as a way to get users to pay to read magazines and newspapers, and to get advertisers to pay print-ad prices for online content.
