A person can transfer fecal bacteria by touching door handles, food and mobile phones and, from there, to other people. When surveyed, 95% of respondents told the researchers that they washed their hands with soap where possible, but the researchers said 92% of phones and 82% of hands had bacteria on them. "People may claim they wash their hands regularly but the science shows otherwise," said Dr. Ron Cutler, of Queen Mary, University of London. In the study, researchers in 12 cities took 390 samples from mobile phones and hands, then analyzed in a laboratory what they had found. -- One in six mobile phones in Britain is contaminated with fecal matter, according to research made public Friday that cited poor hygiene as the cause.
