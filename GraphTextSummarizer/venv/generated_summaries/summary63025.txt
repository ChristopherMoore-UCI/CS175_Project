Bobbi Kristina Brown was moved to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital on Tuesday, sources close to the family said, but the daughter of singers Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston remained in a fight for her life after being found facedown in a bathtub over the weekend. " Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. " Even before her mother's death, videos of Brown singing surfaced on YouTube and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to Houston's. "We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina," said Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, lawyers for the performer. The source close to the family told CNN that Brown's eyes opened and closed a few times Monday, but that doctors told family members not to read too much into that movement.
