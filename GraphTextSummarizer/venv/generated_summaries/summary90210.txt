While hotels and spas have increasingly marketed wellness environments to attract health-minded consumers, real estate company Delos, which focuses on so-called wellness properties, is pushing the idea into residences. For instance, the University of Tulsa's Indoor Air Program studies ways to improve indoor air quality in homes, schools and workplace environments. On the fitness side, in 2011, Westin rolled out WestinWORKOUT rooms, which transformed hotel rooms into mini-gyms complete with a treadmill or stationary bike, dumbbells, fitness DVDs, resistance bands and stability balls. Corporate offices are slower to the trend, but are also starting to incorporate more health-focused design and environments, from filtered air to fitness facilities. This particular project is focused on finding healthier breathing environments for students in schools.
