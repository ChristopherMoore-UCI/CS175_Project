In Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty-based view toward free speech, and which became the dominant theory in First Amendment jurisprudence. He wrote: "But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. It is easy to claim that these Sigma Alpha Epsilon boys did not deserve First Amendment protection. How inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the Eagle's wings. Some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts.
