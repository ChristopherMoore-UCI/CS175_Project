The jawans had complained for years that their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and the opportunity to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations, which pay far more than what they make at home. The Bangladeshi military has revised the number of army officers missing after last week's bloody uprising, from 72 down to six. The earlier number was based on "assumptions," said Lt. Gen. Sina Ibn Jamali, the army chief of general staff. Of those bodies, 53 were confirmed as those of army officers. The 65,000-strong Rifles is a border security force -- distinct from the army, but whose commanders are career army officers.
