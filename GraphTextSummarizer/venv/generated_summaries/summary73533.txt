The IAAF said it was seeking tests on Semenya's gender even before that race. The international governing body for athletics urged caution Friday after reports that the world-champion South African runner Caster Semenya has both male and female organs. IAAF spokesman Nick Davies would not discuss the findings with CNN. Under IAAF rules, any time there is suspicion about an athlete's gender, the athlete can be asked to attend a medical evaluation before a panel consisting of a gynecologist, an endocrinologist, a psychologist, an internal medicine specialist and an expert on gender issues. The process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s, the IAAF said.
