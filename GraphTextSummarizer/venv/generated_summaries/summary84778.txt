Watch snowy scenes from Madrid Â» As children and even some adults gleefully tossed snowballs, city officials urged motorists to stay off the roads and use public transportation. -- A heavy snowstorm caused chaos Friday at Madrid's Barajas Airport, where flights were suspended for hours before Europe's fourth-busiest airport reopened in the late afternoon. Weather forecasters said the snow was expected to continue through Saturday morning, although diminishing in intensity. Large traffic jams formed on the major highways leading from Madrid to Barcelona and other cities, and numerous vehicles ran off the roads and got stuck in the snow.
