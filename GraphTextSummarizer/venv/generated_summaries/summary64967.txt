Relatives pushed for the exhumation and a second autopsy, saying Jewell did not have sickle cell and they believe there were other circumstances leading to his death. " Jewell's father, the Rev. A.B. Jewell Sr., said family members cannot have closure until they know what happened. Hutchins said family members believe Jewell's role on the show put up roadblocks for them early in the investigation. He said they hope the second autopsy will show sickle cell was not a factor and recent witness statements will shed light on the night Jewell died. Police originally said Jewell died from blunt force trauma, but a medical examiner reported that sickle cell disease also contributed to his death.
