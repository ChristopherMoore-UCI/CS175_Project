The "ticker" display is used to display information ranging from incoming calls to status messages. Additionally, the device is DLNA-compliant, so it can quickly connect with TVs and other devices with DLNA capabilities. Its face is made from a 3.4-inch Super AMOLED touchscreen, making it perfect for media consumption. But the most distinguishing feature of this device isn't its main display; it's a secondary, 1.8-inch, Super AMOLED display. It's also touch capable and, when the primary screen is being actively used, incoming messages are routed to it, so the primary activity isn't interrupted.
