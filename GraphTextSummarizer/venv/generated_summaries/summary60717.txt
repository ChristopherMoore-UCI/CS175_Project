More than six weeks after being shot, reportedly by his own troops, President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz returned home Saturday evening from France, where he'd been receiving medical treatment. In his recent interview with Radio France International, he said he "always worked" even during his recovery in France, adding that he'd kept close contact with Mauritania's prime minister, Cabinet ministers and leading politicians. The president added he'd had a successful operation to treat what he described as minor injuries, but then left Mauritania for France for continued medical treatment. A former general, Aziz came to power in a bloodless 2008 military coup -- one of many such coups the country of about 3.4 million people has had since it gained independence from France in 1960. The president discussed his health in an interview with Radio France International, as reported Saturday AMI, saying he is "generally OK and ... thankfully regaining my health."
