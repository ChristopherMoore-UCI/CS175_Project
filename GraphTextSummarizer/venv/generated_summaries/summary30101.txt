Amateur video showed Israeli police officers holding down, punching and kicking Khdeir. -- A Florida teenager whose videotaped beating in Jerusalem was widely decried was to return home late Wednesday, his body still healing from the pummeling he received at the hands of Israeli police. Shibly said that he did not know the outcome of the Israeli police case against Khdeir but that his house arrest had ended Monday. Last week, Israeli authorities said they had suspended a police officer accused of beating Khdeir. Tariq Abu Khdeir, 15, was expected to arrive in Tampa on Wednesday night after completing his house arrest in Jerusalem, said Hassan Shibly, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Florida.
