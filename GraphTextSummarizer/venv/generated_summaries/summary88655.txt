Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in Sunday's election, while opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski won 49.0%, Venezuela's National Electoral Council said Monday. Maduro, who billed himself throughout the campaign as Chavez's political heir, told supporters Monday that the former president's son-in-law would be executive vice president during his six-year term. Capriles' repeated demands for a recount left key questions about Venezuela's future unanswered Monday: Will Maduro's supporters stick behind him? 'I am not Chavez, but I am his son' Maduro, 50, has been Venezuela's interim leader since Chavez's death. Election authorities proclaimed Hugo Chavez's handpicked successor Venezuela's president-elect Monday, despite his challenger's demand for a recount.
