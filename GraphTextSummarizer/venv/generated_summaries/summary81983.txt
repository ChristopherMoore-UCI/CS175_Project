Boosting Impact It wasn't long before image macros -- the graphic jokes initially passed around on bulletin boards or on e-mail -- started incorporating Impact. Impact, which was initially created in 1965, was one of the fonts included in early Microsoft Windows operating systems. Part of it is simple convenience, says Anthony Rotolo, a professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. The caption, in Impact, read, "I can has cheezburger?" That photo started the I Can Has Cheezburger empire -- and probably helped cement the usage of Impact, says Nakagawa, who has since moved on to other projects as an adviser. His own company has created several fonts that have the same metrics as Impact.
