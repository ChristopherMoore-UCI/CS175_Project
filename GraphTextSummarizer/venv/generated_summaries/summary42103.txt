The opposition accused Hezbollah fighters from neighboring Lebanon of joining Syrian government troops in the assault on the city, a claim that al-Assad's government has disputed in the past. One talks with political entities, but not with a terrorist who cuts people's throats, assassinates people and uses chemical weapons," he said, ignoring allegations that his own government has very likely used chemical weapons on Syrian citizens. The Free Syrian Army said it fired rockets from Qusayr across the border into northeastern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah areas. Syrian state-run television reported that Syrian forces "have spread safety and security after taking control of the city hall and surrounding buildings in Qusayr as they continue to chase the terrorists in the city." Activists said artillery shells, mortar shells and bombs from aircraft were raining down as government forces attacked.
