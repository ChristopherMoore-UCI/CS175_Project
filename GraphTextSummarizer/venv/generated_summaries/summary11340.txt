In a written statement, the FBI in Sacramento, California, said the bodies were found in Samaan's vehicle Saturday night but did not identify the bodies, saying more information would be released later. "The Amber Alert system has been put in place so that we can hopefully locate and safely take people back into custody and put the child back, if that's the case," El Dorado County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Bryan Golmitz told CNN affiliate KCRA. The green Toyota 4Runner was found in a remote area of El Dorado County, near Placerville, California, the FBI said. The FBI was working on the case along with members of the Sacramento Police Department, the Sacramento County Sheriff, the California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Justice. An Amber Alert was issued Friday for Madeline, who was last seen a week ago in Sacramento.
