Internal Catholic Church documents have surfaced in the United States which critics say link Pope Benedict XVI personally to attempts to cover up abuse. It published a new summary of its procedures on sexual abuse cases Monday, as it fights the perception that it has tried to hush up abuse in the past. The Vatican is overhauling its rules on how it handles accusations of sexual abuse by priests, it said Monday, without giving any details. The one-page document published Monday outlines the official steps diocese should take if a priest is accused of abuse, how to escalate complaints to Rome, and possible punishments for those found guilty. The summary, produced by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, says local diocese "investigate every allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a cleric."
