Dr. Victor Dzau says workplace wellness programs could play a key role in health care reform. At the World Economic Forum earlier this year, a group of corporate executives engaged in a thought-provoking discussion on a variety of health care topics, including workplace wellness programs. The impact of employee health on productivity and cost of health insurance is well documented. There has been a lot of talk about good health promotion and disease prevention in early discussions of health care reform, but how and whether we achieve these aims will make or break the success of health care reform in whatever form it eventually takes. In response, many medium and large employers have instituted a variety of workplace wellness programs.
