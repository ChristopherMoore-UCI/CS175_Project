-- Two time defending world champion Sebastian Vettel claimed pole in the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka for the fourth straight year Saturday ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. Vettel won in Singapore after race leader Hamilton retired and with six round remaining has become a real threat to Alonso. But Vettel, who stayed clear of a late qualifying crash by Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus, which held up several drivers, including Alonso and Hamilton, was in imperious form as he stepped up his title bid. Button's relegation has moved Ferrari's championship leader Fernando Alonso up to sixth as he bids to protect his 29-point title lead over Vettel. The German clocked the fastest time of one minute 30.839 seconds, which was 0.251 seconds faster than Webber.
