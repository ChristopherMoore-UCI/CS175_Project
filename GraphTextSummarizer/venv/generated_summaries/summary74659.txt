The increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the Syrian city of Kobani reflects more targets of opportunity, not a change in the campaign against the vicious Islamist group, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday. These strikes on small targets in Kobani, such as sniper positions, are "tactical" in nature -- without the widespread "strategic" affect against ISIS that U.S. officials have said is the foundation for the U.S. operation in Syria, a senior U.S. military official told CNN's Barbara Starr. In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, not far from the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands. U.S. officials do not see the Ein Al-Assad military base in Anbar on the verge of being overrun by ISIS, the official said. The past few days around Kobani have seen more ISIS targets, he said.
