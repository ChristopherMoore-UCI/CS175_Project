Affordable Art Hong Kong, a spinoff of the original event launched in London in 1999, attracts art enthusiasts from all walks -- and wallets -- of life, with original works on sale from unknowns and well-knowns at the more than 120 galleries represented from around the world. Here are a few galleries to get you started: Avenue des Arts: Unit 06, 12/F Hollywood Centre, 233 Hollywood Road, Sheung Wan; +852 2744 6699 EC Gallery: G/F, 72a Hollywood Road, Central; +852 2803 7960 Galerie Koo: 7/F, Vogue Building, 67 Wyndham Street, Central; +852 2525 0331 Karin Weber Gallery: G/F, 20 Aberdeen Street, Central; +852 2544 5004 Odd One Out: G/F 34 Sau Wa Fong, Wan Chai; +852 2529 3955 Hong Kong art galleries For many Hong Kong residents, the answer is no.
