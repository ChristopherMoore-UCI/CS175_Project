As for human health, scientists say much more needs to be learned about dispersants -- their behavior with oil, chemical ingredients, chronic and delayed effects -- to understand the risks. -- Over 1.8 million gallons of dispersant chemicals have been added to the Gulf of Mexico to break up oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon's ruptured well. "But what's much more relevant in predicting the full effects of the use of dispersants and dispersed oil are the more subtle effects -- that are sublethal, that may affect growth and reproduction." "Some studies suggest that the rate of degradation of PAHs [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a breakdown product of oil] is actually impeded by dispersants." "We need more data before we decide whether to change dispersants," said Paul T. Anastas, the EPA's assistant administrator for research and development.
