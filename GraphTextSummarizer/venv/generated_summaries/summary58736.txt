In Tuesday's early game, last season's Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund won a lively tie with Zenit St Petersburg. Olympiakos swept aside a lackluster United side 2-0 to see the two-time Champions League winners on the verge of an exit in the last 16. -- If Manchester United were hoping to escape their domestic troubles in Europe then the English Premier League champions only found more tragedy in Greece. But the Russian defense buckled once more and Poland striker Lewandowski, who is joining Borussia's rivals Bayern Munich at the end of the season, stroked in a diagonal cross. Borussia will take a 4-2 lead back for the home leg as Jurgen Klopp's team, just like Manchester United, hope to seek solace from a dismal domestic campaign in the glittering realms of the Champions League. Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick told Sky Sports: "Everyone's having a dig and enjoying it -- we've got to take it on the chin and bounce back."
