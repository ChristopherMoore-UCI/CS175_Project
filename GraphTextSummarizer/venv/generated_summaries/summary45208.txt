it could happen to you before you even know it." David Thomson, author of "The French Jihadists," believes there are many reasons why so many French Muslims are becoming radicalized and heading to Iraq and Syria to join militant groups. Nora, 16, was recruited and given a plane ticket to join the fight in Syria, according to French intelligence. Three weeks later he called to say they were in Syria -- two of the more than 900 French citizens the government believes are involved in the jihad there and in Iraq. Bons, who is a former French soldier, says Nicolas had never spoken to her about wanting to join a religious war, but last year the 30-year-old announced he and his half-brother were going on vacation together. Unlike Bons, one anonymous French bus driver knows his daughter is still alive in Syria -- but he is desperately worried that may not be the case for much longer.
