For the next three dozen years as king, this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including, just recently, taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed, no coup. And he's a very wise man, and he said, "Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness. As I suggested in my talk at TED2010, it was a question about "what counts in life and business" that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks, to Bhutan. Are you focused on the intangible inputs in your life or company, or are you purely focused on the tangible outputs? Why don't we care more about gross national happiness?" Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success, what has come to be known as GNH, or gross national happiness.
