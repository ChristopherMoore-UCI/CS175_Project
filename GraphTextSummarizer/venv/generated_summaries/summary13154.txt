And try runner-up Nick Viall did -- by slipping a letter to Andi Dorfman after she had selected contestant Josh Murray to receive her final rose. Not at all awkward, given that Dorfman is now engaged to Murray, right? Viall let it be known that if that relationship doesn't work out, Dorfman still has a shot with him -- though he made no promises about a happy ending. During the "After the Final Rose" ceremony, Viall appeared to break the unspoken "Bachelorette/Bachelor" code of revealing that he and Dorfman had been intimate during their fantasy suite time. Following Monday's finale in which Dorfman dumped Viall, much was made about the letter he had written to her after their breakup. In it, Viall pours out his feelings for Dorfman.
