Here in New York state, we spend almost $6.1 billion on health care related to adult obesity -- the second-highest level of spending in the nation. The $404 million this tax would raise next year will go toward funding public health programs, including obesity prevention programs, across New York state. New York Gov. David Paterson says taxing soft drinks could help combat obesity. No one can deny the urgency of reducing the rate of obesity, including childhood obesity. In June, New York state raised the state cigarette tax an additional $1.25.
