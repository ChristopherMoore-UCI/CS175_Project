Goa is popular with Western tourists but several tourists have died from drug overdoses in recent years while women have been attacked and sexually assaulted. NEW DELHI, India -- Police covered up the murder of a British teenage girl in Goa last month to protect the tourist industry, a state minister and local media said Monday. The mother said Monday she sent a letter to Goa's chief minister asking for India's Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.
