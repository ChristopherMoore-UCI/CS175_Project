Samsung separately filed a complaint back in June with the United States International Trade Commission claiming Apple has violated five patents related to wireless communications standards and mobile device user interface. Apple claims that Samsung's newer Galaxy Tab 10.1 copies the iPad's look and infringes upon its design patents. The recent ruling is expected to give Samsung a stronger footing in a legal battle it is involved in with Apple in several countries across the world, including the United States. Apple recently was denied a preliminary injunction on several of Samsung's mobile phones and tablets in America by a San Jose court. "The Full Court of Australia decision on November 30 clearly affirmed our view that Apple's claims lack merit and that an injunction should not have been imposed on the Galaxy Tab 10.1," Samsung said in a news release, referring to the earlier ruling that lifted the injunction.
