Diwali -- from the word Deepavali, meaning "row of lights" -- is observed by Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities, who celebrate for five days in autumn to mark the victory of light over darkness. But this year's celebrations are likely to be anything but peaceful, with an explosion of Diwali parties lighting up cities across the world. Recent years have seen Diwali parties pop up in locations from Ontario, Canada to Melbourne, Australia, where traditional Diwali celebrations mix with showcases for Indian food, music, dance, and film. From Singapore's Little India district to rural Somerset, UK, iReporters have sent pictures of Diwali lights shining out. Celebrated for centuries across much of the Indian subcontinent, Diwali is now exploding: spreading the promise of wealth, knowledge and happiness to new communities across the world.
