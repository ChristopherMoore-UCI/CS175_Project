In a move to squash dissent within North Korea's ruling elite, the once-powerful uncle of Leader Kim Jong Un was removed from his government position at a Ruling Workers' Party politburo meeting Sunday, North Korea's state news agency KCNA confirmed. Jang Song Thaek, who married Kim's aunt, was the vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and has often been pictured beside Kim, who has ruled North Korea since his father's death in 2011. Tensions between North and South Korea soared this year as Pyongyang reacted angrily to tightened United Nations sanctions imposed in response to its latest nuclear test. Jang and his allies were accused by Kim of double-dealing behind the scene, "dreaming different dreams" and selling off the country's resources at cheap prices, thereby threatening North Korea's economic development, according to the KCNA statement. North Korea, a state shrouded in secrecy, is involved in a protracted standoff with its neighbors and Western powers over its nuclear weapons program.
