The center hopes to "develop transdisciplinary programs that target prevention of violence through research, education and engagement," said Jerzy Nowak, founding director of the center. Ishwar Puri, head of the engineering department, was at Norris Hall Friday, stressing the importance of the campus moving past the tragedy. Nowak's wife, French instructor Jocelyne Couture-Nowak, was among the 30 students and faculty members Seung-Hui Chokilled at Norris Hall before taking his own life there. Students walk through a passageway connecting Norris Hall to another building at Virginia Tech. "Relocation to Norris Hall has a symbolic character to the families and friends of the victims, to the survivors, Virginia Tech, the Blacksburg community, and the world," he said.
