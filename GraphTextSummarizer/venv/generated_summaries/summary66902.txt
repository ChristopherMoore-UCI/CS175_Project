Fuel consumption estimates on super-yachts have ranged up to one liter of fuel per second when traveling at high power. The solar sail: super-yachts could cut fuel consumption and emissions by using a sail similar to this. Super-yachts owned by billionaires like Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen are currently among the biggest fuel guzzlers on the planet. See a photo gallery of the world's best super-yachts Solar Sailor's CEO Robert Dane told CNN the technology could work perfectly with super-yachts. Dane estimated the sail could save about 5 percent in fuel consumption from the solar power and another 20 to 40 percent from wind power when the vessel is traveling at 18 knots.
