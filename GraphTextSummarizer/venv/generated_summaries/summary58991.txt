"More training for staff in Haiti, more doctors, more nurses, more treatment centers, more medications, more toilets, more clean water." "There's a history of some violence [during Haitian elections]," International Crisis Group spokesman Bernice Robertson told CNN. Last week, days of violent protests brought Haiti's second-largest city, Cap-Haitien, to a standstill amid voter frustration about government corruption and the growing cholera outbreak. But with no clear front-runner, elections could be forced into a runoff in January if no candidate gains more than 50 percent of the vote. Within a year that saw a massive earthquake, a spreading cholera epidemic and recurring signs of government instability, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere is gearing up for its latest battle: presidential elections.
