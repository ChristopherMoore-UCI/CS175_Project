-- North Korean leader Kim Jong-il tapped his son to join the powerful National Defense Commission -- a move analysts say makes the latter the heir apparent, South Korean state media said. The 25-year-old picked for the North Korean defense commission is the youngest of Kim's three sons, Yonhap said. "Kim Jong-un had been appointed to a low-level post, called 'instructor' at the National Defense Commission days before the first session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly meeting was held," South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, quoting a source. Jang, who has been married to Kim's sister since 1972, is considered his right-hand man, according to Yonhap. The secretive North Korea shields its internal affairs from international scrutiny.
