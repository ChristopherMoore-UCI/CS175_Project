Abu Ghaith's 22-page statement could be admitted in federal court if he was given a Miranda warning, but military tribunals could allow the statement even if the warning wasn't given, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. Several Republicans insist that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the bin Laden relative who was also al Qaeda's chief spokesman, should be sent to the detention compound in the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, also said that Abu Ghaith should have been sent to Guantanamo. From at least May 2001 to 2002, Abu Ghaith appeared with Osama bin Laden and his then-deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri and warned that attacks similar to 9/11 would continue, Earnest said. Military legal expert Eugene Fiddell said the conspiracy charge against Abu Ghaith is not a war crime and is outside the jurisdiction of a military commission.
