Only the Descent Module will land on Earth, carrying Commander Kevin Ford of NASA, Russian Soyuz Commander Oleg Novitskiy and Russian Flight Engineer Evgeny Tarelkin. The undocking of the Soyuz will mark the beginning of the 35th ISS mission, which awaits the arrival of two more Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut in two weeks. NASA TV will broadcast the undocking and landing live. A Soyuz carried the first ever crew to the ISS in November 2000, according to NASA. Soyuz modules are vital to the Russian space program.
