Former New York Gov. George Pataki and police union officials quickly lashed out at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Earlier, officers and New York Fire Department personnel saluted an ambulance carrying the two officers as it drove by. The governor accused de Blasio of putting officers' lives at risk because the mayor supported recent protests over the killing of Eric Garner by a New York police officer who was not indicted. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was joined by other New York borough presidents Sunday as he urged the public to refrain from protesting until the slain officers are buried. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Pataki was wrong for making those comments.
