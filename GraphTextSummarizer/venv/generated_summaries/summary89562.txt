The modified petitions included one calling for officials to end the prosecution of a Florida teen charged in connection with a same-sex relationship with a 14-year-old; a petition to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay; and a petition to allow gay Boy Scouts leaders, said Brianna Cayo-Cotter, a spokeswoman for Change.org. Successful Change.org campaigns have included one in which a petitioner asked Bank of America to rescind a $5-per-month fee on bank cards. Change.org was hacked late Friday by someone who made "cosmetic" changes on the popular petition website, officials said. The petition received more than 300,000 signatures and helped to spark wide media coverage. Change.org officials believe the petitions were selected because they were all in a featured section of the website and weren't picked because of the causes they represent, she said.
