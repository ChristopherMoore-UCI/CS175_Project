Mr. President, who are you wearing? Monday evening, the president and first lady will attend the Commander in Chief's Ball, which honors service members and their families, a tradition started by former President George W. Bush; and at the Inaugural Ball, the president and first lady will celebrate with people around the country who bought tickets to attend. After the daytime events, which will include the inaugural address and parade, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will end their night by taking to the dance floor at two inaugural balls. -- As Inauguration Day approaches, the question on everyone's lips is: What will the first lady be wearing? Glitz, gowns and government bigwigs will all be on display at Monday's parade of inaugural pomp and circumstance. "When we look at the gown that Jackie Kennedy wore 50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore more than a hundred years before that, it really takes us beyond the history books and the photographs, and it helps us understand that history is really made by real live people," said the current first lady at the unveiling of her gown in March 2010. "Sometimes sketches and descriptions of the dress and even formal photographs of the incoming first lady wearing the dress were released in advance to newspapers," she said.
