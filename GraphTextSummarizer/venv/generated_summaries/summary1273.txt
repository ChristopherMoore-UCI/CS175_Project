"Here, we have two different types of salt," said Demba Dieng, a wholesaler who buys and re-sells salt. Fame makes 60 cents for each bucket of salt he collects. "However, in Europe, they use the 'big salt' to melt ice on the roads." While most of Fame's salt will be sold on, he has kept some for his family back in Mali in the hopes that one day, he can share it with his father, who also used to be a salt harvester on Lake Retba. The salt content of Lake Retba or Lac Rose, as it's locally known, rivals that of the Dead Sea -- exceeding 40% salinity in some parts -- and it is a combination of the sun and a salt-loving micro-algae, dunaliella salina, which has turned the water a brilliant shade of strawberry pink. While the rally may have shifted to South America five years ago, men and women from West Africa continue to come here for an entirely different reason -- to harvest salt.
