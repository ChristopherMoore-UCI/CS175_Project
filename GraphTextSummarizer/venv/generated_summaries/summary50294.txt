Convenience could be all it takes to talk people out wanting privacy. A handful of other respondents also predicted that privacy could be bought back in the future, creating classes of people who can't afford privacy. "I expect the dynamics of security and privacy are going to be a bloody mess for the next decade, mired in ugly politics and corporate greed," said Microsoft research scientist Danah Boyd. "People are becoming more attuned all the time to the fact that they are paying for 'free' services offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other popular companies by giving up personal information that is sold as a commodity by those companies," said Anderson. Some of the respondents predict a fierce battle between companies, governments and individuals over control of personal information.
