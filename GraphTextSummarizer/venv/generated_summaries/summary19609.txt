Some reports have claimed Minaj had planned to bring out Nas and Hill during her performance, but after Minaj was told not to perform by YMCMB label chief Lil Wayne, the guests took the stage in her absence. "I was not scheduled to be a special guest on her set at Summer Jam, I was invited by Nas to perform with him," says Hill in the Twitter post. Hill also had some remarks for the music industry, saying, "We have to find a better way to commercially exploit music, while giving artists their proper respect. This cannot be done while taking their contributions for granted, or trying to control the scope of their growth and power through threats and fear tactics." Following Nicki Minaj's no-show at the Hot 97 Summer Jam, Lauryn Hill took to Twitter to clarify her situation and "an innaccuracy."
