"Flappy Bird" is just the latest in a string of smartphone games starring avians, though it makes "Angry Birds" look like "World of Warcraft." Reviewers curse the game and warn others not to follow them down the dark hole of "Flappy Bird." "My family called an exorcist to try and remove this devil game but flappy bird had already firmly gripped my soul," said iOS user Ahhccwat. This time it's "Flappy Bird," a no-frills smartphone game that has become the most downloaded free iPhone and Android app in the past week. "Flappy Bird" currently has an average four-star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the Apple App Store and 228,000 on Android. Have we reached a level of boredom bordering on dangerous if we're spending our time en masse on something so pointless?" "Flappy Bird is a condition of the universe," says writer and game designer Ian Bogost in a 2,800-word article for The Atlantic.
