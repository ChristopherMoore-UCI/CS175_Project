Law enforcement officers could enter information on stolen cars, stolen guns and stolen jewelry -- but there was no central place to keep information on missing children. John Walsh was a hotel developer in south Florida, living a seemingly idyllic life with his wife and son, when a horrific tragedy changed his life -- and the lives of thousands of strangers. The devastation led Walsh to dedicate himself to catching fugitives and seeking justice for crime victims. He's a co-founder of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Before Adam Walsh's kidnapping and death, there was no national database on missing children. "Our recovery rate for missing children has grown from 62 percent in 1990 to 97 percent today," the center says.
