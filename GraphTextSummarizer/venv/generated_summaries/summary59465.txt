Most of Britain was covered in snow, with 20 to 30 centimeters (nearly 8 to nearly 12 inches) of snow in the southern parts, and up to 15 feet in the Pennines, the mountain range that runs from northern England north to Scotland. It warned of "very heavy snowfall" in southwest and southeast England and London, with up to a foot of snow possible. Dozens of cars were left sitting on the side of the road in Southampton, near England's southern coast, after drivers became stuck in snow. The Met Office, Britain's weather service, said more snow was expected Wednesday for southern and northeast England. A snowy day in Chertsey, Surrey British Airways was forced to cancel "dozens" of flights in and out of London's Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 due to snow and ice, a spokesman told CNN Wednesday.
