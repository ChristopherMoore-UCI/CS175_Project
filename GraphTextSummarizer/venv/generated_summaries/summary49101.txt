The exchange got to the heart of the Republican candidate's central takedown of Markey - that the longtime Democratic congressman's roots in Washington disqualify him as a voice for Bay State voters. Democratic Rep. Ed Markey Tuesday won a special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, topping Republican businessman and former Navy SEAL Gabriel Gomez in an election marked by low voter turnout. The contest was the second time in three years that Massachusetts voters headed to the polls in a special U.S. Senate election with national implications. If he wants to stay in the Senate past next year, Markey will need to run for re-election in November 2014, when a full six-year term will be at stake. Markey, who had led in all the pre-election public opinion polls, will serve the remaining year and a half of the term of longtime Democratic Sen. John Kerry, who stepped down earlier this year after being confirmed as U.S. secretary of state.
