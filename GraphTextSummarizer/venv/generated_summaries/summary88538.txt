England coach Fabio Capello will name his provisional 30-man squad for South Africa on Tuesday, and United were quick to dispel any fears that Rooney might be not fit for his second World Cup finals appearance. Balotelli, who said Totti had abused him, was also given a one-match suspension along with Inter teammate Cristian Chivu for separate incidents. Veteran striker Francesco Totti's chances of being called out of international retirement were seriously damaged by his red card in the Italian Cup final defeat by Inter Milan last Wednesday. -- England striker Wayne Rooney is expected to be fit for the World Cup in South Africa despite suffering another injury setback on club duty with Manchester United on Sunday. The 24-year-old, who last month was sidelined with ankle damage, went off with a recurrence of his recent groin problem 13 minutes from the end of United's 4-0 victory over Stoke.
