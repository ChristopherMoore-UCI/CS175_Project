CNN Latino targets the growing and diverse U.S. Hispanic market, delivering a broad spectrum of programming that will include news, lifestyle, documentary, talk and debate as an alternative to traditional Hispanic networks. -- CNN en Espa√±ol will launch CNN Latino, a new Spanish language syndicated programming block custom made for the U.S. Hispanic market, in late January 2013. "There is a real demand for relevant, dynamic, quality programming and CNN Latino is a unique product designed specifically for the growing U.S. Hispanic audience, representing the dual reality of U.S. Latinos today who are multigenerational and proud to be bilingual. There is a company-wide initiative at CNN to produce more content for the U.S. Hispanic audience. The launch of CNN Latino is the first step to bringing this syndicated programming block to local broadcast stations in key Hispanic media markets across the country."
