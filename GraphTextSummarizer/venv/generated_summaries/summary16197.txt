-- When pitcher Josh Faiola walks out of the dugout on opening day with the Lake Erie Crushers, he'll already have a large group of fans in the stands -- his new roommates at the Belvedere of Westlake assisted living facility. Faiola made his way to the assisted living center in Westlake, Ohio, near Cleveland, with the help of Cindy Griffiths-Novak. But I don't think he'll need them." Norma J. Lane, 85, said even though she's more of a football fan, she's looking forward to following Faiola and baseball more closely. " Faiola, who had surgery two years ago and was dropped from the Orioles during spring training, is hoping his stint with the Crushers can help get him picked up by a Major League team. Pitcher Josh Failoa stands as residents and friends of The Belvedere of Westlake welcome him Tuesday.
