"The judge and jury believed Saldate," Kozinski wrote in his March ruling overturning Milke's murder conviction. A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. During her trial, "no ... witnesses or direct evidence (linked) Milke to the crime" other than Phoenix police Detective Armando Saldate Jr., according to Kozinski. A jury convicted Milke of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on October 12, 1990, less than a year after her 4-year-old son was found dead. Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' Chief Judge Alex Kozinski ruled this spring that Milke did not receive a fair trial.
