Less than 24 hours after Cruz pow-wowed with House Republicans over pizza pies, Boehner canceled the vote when he realized he didn't have enough support to pass what was already considered no more than a show vote. That denial hasn't kept House GOP leadership aides and rank-and-file Republicans from pinning the bill's failure on Cruz getting involved in the wrong chamber. But Cruz and his tea party allies in the House were determined to oppose the bill unless GOP leaders tacked on a provision that would reverse an Obama administration policy shielding young migrants and toughen the United States' deportation policy. Conservative pundit Erick Erickson, who said House Republicans should tack the Cruz-backed provision to a border bill, also weighed in. These questions about the influence of the House GOP leaders couldn't come at a worse time as House Republicans transitioned leadership into new hands.
