Apple pointed out in its statement that Macs running the most recent operating system, OS X Lion, have not come with Java pre-installed and that the computers automatically disable the plug-in after 35 days of inactivity. -- An Eastern European gang of hackers bent on stealing company secrets was responsible for recent attacks on Apple, Facebook and Twitter as well as dozens of other less-publicized hacks, according to new reports. One site used in the attacks appears to be called iPhone Dev SDK, a forum for developers who work with Apple's mobile operating system. Apple confirmed Tuesday that some of its employees' computers had been compromised after they visited a hacked website for iPhone developers. Like a lion waiting for those speedy gazelles to slow down and have a drink, criminals hack and load viruses onto sites they suspect attractive targets will visit, then wait.
