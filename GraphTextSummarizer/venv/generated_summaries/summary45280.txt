"With the removal of subsidies on oil and gas, domestic demand for energy in Iran is expected to decline, leaving more energy resources available for export. While gas prices will affect the middle and upper echelons of society, what is most worrying to others are rising prices for food. In the Iranian capital, Tehran, police manned gas stations as some cab drivers hiked fares and residents complained about prices going up fourfold for essential items after the government began slashing subsidies to help bolster the Islamic republic's sagging oil-based economy. The government began its plan to remove subsidies on Sunday and deployed security forces to several major gas stations in the capital city, Tehran, to offset the threat of potential protests. Iran observers attribute it to a climate of fear following a government crackdown in the aftermath of the 2009 presidential election controversy.
