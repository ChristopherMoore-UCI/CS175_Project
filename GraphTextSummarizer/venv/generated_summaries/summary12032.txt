Like the sad irony of the Anti-Defamation League (a group actually formed to "secure justice and fair treatment for all against...hatred, prejudice and bigotry") now speaking out against the Islamic center to promote interfaith dialogue and education being proposed for near the former World Trade Center site. -- It's a beautiful August morning in Jersey City, New Jersey. Building bridges of understanding, rebuilding shattered economies in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan and educating citizens on both sides will. America grew into a beacon of liberty and freedom because it gave every citizen the unalienable right to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." I was truly impressed by the fact that America gave me as an immigrant the same opportunities it did to its own citizens.
