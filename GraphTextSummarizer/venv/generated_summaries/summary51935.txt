Republicans involved in the negotiations with the White House on the package have warned that any changes by the House could derail the entire proposal, causing tax rates to increase in 2011. Among other things, House liberals were  strongly opposed to what they argued was an excessive giveaway to the rich in the form of a lower estate tax. At the same time, liberal Democrats, including Weiner and Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, want a chance to vote on further possible changes, including replacing the payroll tax deduction with an extended "make work pay" tax credit set to expire at the end of the year, DeFazio said. A number of House Democrats wanted to change the estate tax to levels previously approved in a separate House bill that would exempt inheritances up to $3.5 million and tax amounts above that at a 45 percent rate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi depicted the measure as a necessary step to prevent taxes of working class Americans from increasing, even though it also extended lower tax rates for the wealthiest Americans who she said don't need the benefit.
