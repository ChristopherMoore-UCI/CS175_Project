Zambia's Evans Kangwa had the chance to grab the win his side needed to qualify late on but made a hash of his effort while Cape Verde, level on three points with DR Congo, only missed out on the quarter-finals by virtue of goal difference. For a time, DR Congo, tournament winners in 1968 and 1974, looked devoid of a response until drawing level against the run of play in the 65th minute through substitute Jeremy Bokila. But DR Congo held firm for a record sixth straight draw in the tournament, the game ending slightly farcically in the final minute with neither side really playing as news of the result from Ebebiyin came in. In a tense finale to Group B, all four teams still had the chance to qualify for the last eight until the final whistle went in a goalless draw between Cape Verde and Zambia in torrid conditions. If Zambia had hoped the players would be inspired to shine in the wake of a pre-match call from President Edgar Lungu, who won the election at the weekend, then they were to be sorely disappointed.
