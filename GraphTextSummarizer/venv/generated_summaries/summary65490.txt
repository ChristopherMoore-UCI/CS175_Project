There is bipartisan consensus that the United States is now at war with ISIS and that Congress should be a part of the decision-making process on how to deal with that, by passing a new authorization for military force. " "It's ridiculous," Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colorado, said a few minutes later. "As if there is not enough to do and it's not just the war issues, it's immigration reform, ENDA (Employment Nondiscrimination Act) -- it's a number of different bills that have been filed that have bipartisan support," Polis said. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-North Carolina, said he'd be glad to vote for a new use-of-force authorization against ISIS. "There is broad agreement in the country that this ISIS group is a threat," Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pennsylvania, told CNN. Obama: ISIS threat against U.S., allies 'doesn't frighten us' Democrats noted that leaving now has become a tradition to help the House, where Republicans are a majority.
