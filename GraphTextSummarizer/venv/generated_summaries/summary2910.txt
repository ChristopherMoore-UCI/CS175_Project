On September 25, she took him to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where, Louise said, hospital staff were told twice that Duncan had come from Liberia. When Duncan arrived in the United States on September 20, "he didn't tell me that he came in contact with anybody with Ebola," Louise said. " Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said his 21-year-old son is also among those quarantined in Louise's apartment, where he lived. And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment. Duncan was taken by ambulance to the hospital on Sunday, September 28, after Louise's 35-year-old daughter saw him "shaking really hard" and with a fever when she came by to give him tea.
