-- Mitt Romney promised Monday to restore U.S. foreign policy to a traditional role dating back decades, based on exerting global influence through military and economic power, in a major speech two weeks before he debates President Barack Obama on international issues. "If this is how he handles the world now," the narrator in the new ad says, "just think what Mitt Romney might do as president." Responding to the ad, a Romney campaign spokeswoman said Obama was the one who had "weakened" the U.S. standing in the world. While Romney sought to distinguish himself from Obama on foreign policy, specific proposals he cited remained similar to what the administration is doing. Polls show Obama gets higher marks than Romney on foreign policy, and the former Massachusetts governor hurt his international credentials on a three-nation trip this summer that included a high-profile gaffe in which he questioned London's preparedness to host the Olympics. " Romney and Obama will debate foreign policy on October 22 in Florida following their second debate in New York on October 16.
