The dream trio of Woods, Rory McIlroy and Masters winner Adam Scott will tee off from the first hole at the Merion Golf Club on Thursday at 1:14 p.m. local time and then at 7:44 a.m. on the 11th hole on Friday, the United States Golf Association said. It prompted the slumping McIlroy to take to twitter, writing "Decent group for the first 2 rounds at Merion I see...." Woods split with his caddy, Steve Williams, in 2011 in a move that left the New Zealander in "shock." There's more intrigue because Woods is firmly against anchored putting -- while anchored putting helped Scott claim his first major at Augusta in April. Williams was beside Woods for 13 of his 14 major titles but now works with Scott. Although he is the world No. 1, Woods hasn't won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open.
