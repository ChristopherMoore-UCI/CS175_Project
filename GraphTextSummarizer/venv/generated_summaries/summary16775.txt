The British government said Wednesday it will appeal a European court ruling that certain police stop-and-search powers are a breach of human rights. " London's Metropolitan Police said that because of sensitivity and concerns about use of the stop-and-search powers, they are only being used at "pre-identified significant locations" like landmarks, tourist sites, and crowded places, or where certain police operations are taking place. Gillan and Quinton complained that the police use of the stop-and-search powers under Section 44 breached the European Convention on Human Rights -- specifically their right to liberty and security, right to respect for private and family life, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly and association. Said Quinton, in another statement issued by Liberty, "There has to be a balance between private life and security. The court found that the "coercive powers" of the anti-terrorism legislation amounted to a clear interference with the right to respect for private life.
