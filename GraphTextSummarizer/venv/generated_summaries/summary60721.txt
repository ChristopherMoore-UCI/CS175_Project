That is why it is self-defeating to restrict the range of possible Supreme Court nominees to the small group of sitting federal appellate judges. The best example of how there is no single "judge's answer" to Supreme Court issues can be found in the eight death penalty cases decided during the 2006 term. As Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy recently said, there is a need to select Supreme Court nominees "from outside the judicial monastery." We should welcome, and not irrationally restrict, the variety of experience that can be brought to Supreme Court decision-making. Supreme Court decision-making would be richer if it included people who had actually written legislation or had run federal agencies or had governed states.
