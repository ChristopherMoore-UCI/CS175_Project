A senior House GOP leadership aide indicated other members could also face some type of repercussions for their public rebuke of Boehner. He ultimately received 216 votes, enough to fend off an embarrassing vote on a second ballot but plenty to reinforce the notion that Boehner is struggling to maintain control over restive House Republicans. He said the 25 members who voted for someone else or declined to vote was less about Boehner personally, but about his leadership's record of bringing major legislation to the House without enough input from members. Freshman Republican Rep Lee Zeldin, who backed Boehner, told CNN it was time for the House GOP members to move on and start focusing on coordinating with the new Republican controlled Senate. After the vote, one of the Republicans who voted against Boehner, Huelskamp said the vote re-electing Boehner "sends a clear message that that  U.S. House Republican majority is status quo -- more of the same."
