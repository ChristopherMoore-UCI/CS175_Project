Three years later, operators are still having to pump more than four tons of water an hour -- 26,000 gallons every day -- into each reactor to keep them cool, Yoshida said. Engineers eventually want to fill the primary containment vessel surrounding the No. 2 reactor with water, but to do that, they have to fix the leaks, Yoshida said. The damage to reactors 1 and 3 was dramatically visible, as massive hydrogen explosions blew apart their concrete housings in the first days of the accident. Matt Cole, Kurion's engineering director, said the arm will be used to inspect three areas around that chamber, known as the suppression pool, for suspected leaks. The unit's turbine plant soon filled with water that was loaded with nuclear wastes, backing up through service tunnels and spilling into the neighboring Pacific Ocean.
