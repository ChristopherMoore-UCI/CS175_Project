A stew of horror tropes mixed with an eye for decade-crossing design, the Delmont has been planned down to its last detail, Frey said, including the costumes, sound design and even the slot machines featured in the lobby's casino. Roth will be making a special appearance on opening night, performing an illusion that's actually pretty dangerous, CEO Robert Frey said. Marketed as the only year-round horror attraction in Vegas -- the first of its kind -- the hotel-themed haunt is the work of Eli Roth, the actor-writer-director who has built a career on low-budget, blood-drenched horror films such as "Hostel" and its sequel. At any one time, there will be 35 to 40 actors at work, many of whom have previous experience in "haunt environments" such as haunted houses. But even though the Goretorium has been built with a flurry of high-tech tricks, the scariest moments aren't necessarily the most advanced, Frey said.
