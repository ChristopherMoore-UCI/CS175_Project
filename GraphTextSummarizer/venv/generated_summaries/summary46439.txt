Many who haven't already abandoned the 9-to-5 workday for the 24-7 life of weisure probably will do so soon, according to New York University sociologist Dalton Conley, who coined the word. It's no coincidence, Conley says, that weisure has been growing simultaneously with the popularity of the personal computer, which has helped professionals with more tedious parts of their jobs -- and has made many jobs somewhat more interesting. Well, first, there's more work and less play, according to Conley's book "Elsewhere, U.S.A." "For the first time in history now, the higher up the economic ladder you go, the more likely you're going to have an extremely long workweek," he says. "Increasingly, it's not clear what constitutes work and what constitutes fun," be it "in an office or at home or out in the street," Conley said. 'The creative class' People are more willing to let work invade their leisure time because, for a lot of Americans, working has become more fun, Conley says.
