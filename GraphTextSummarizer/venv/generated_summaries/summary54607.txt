Based on Howard Bryant's book "The Last Hero: The Life Story of Henry Aaron," the film will trace the two years from 1972 to 1974 during which Aaron chased, and bested, Babe Ruth's record -- an accomplishment that was met with both breathless media coverage as well as death threats. The hope is to go into production next year, and release in 2014, in time for both the 40th anniversary of Aaron's record, and the man's 80th birthday. -- EW has confirmed that producers Mike Tollin ("Varsity Blues," "Coach Carter") and Glenn Rigberg ("Struck By Lightning") have obtained the rights to make a feature film biopic about Henry "Hank" Aaron, the baseball legend who broke Babe Ruth's decades-long career home-run record on April 8, 1974. He first worked with Tollin on the latter's Oscar-nominated 1995 feature documentary, "Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream," and the two have remained friends since. Barry Levinson ("The Natural") is attached to direct, working with screenwriter Adam Mazer, who wrote Levinson's HBO biopic on Jack Kevorkian, "You Don't Know Jack," which Rigberg exec produced.
