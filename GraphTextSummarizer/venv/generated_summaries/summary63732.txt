Yet even with stronger laws, it is the testimony of young children that will ultimately bring punishment to those who prey on children. In Russia, possessing child pornography is not a crime and laws that govern child exploitation are weak. Government authorities say the majority of sexual crimes against children are never reported or investigated. This week, the Kremlin's child advocate, Pavel Astakhov, spoke in favor of a more stringent policy to force Internet providers to take responsibility for child pornography sites hosted on their servers and social networks. Those are among the reasons that even the Russian government admits the country is a world leader in the production of child pornography.
