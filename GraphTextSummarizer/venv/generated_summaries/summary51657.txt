" Slippery Rock University isn't the only school making changes to graduation ceremonies because of swine flu fears. "However, we believe that it is more important to protect our students, employees and families than to proceed with graduation ceremonies at this time. Cisco Junior College in West Central Texas is canceling Friday graduation ceremonies. "Since direct contact is one of the ways flu viruses spread, we have decided to forgo the traditional congratulatory handshake as you come forward to receive your diploma and have your photo taken with your dean," the school told students in a letter posted on its Web site. Fort Worth schools will be closed at least until May 12, authorities said, announcing that one student was confirmed to have swine flu.
