Nostalgic local residents and excited tourists gathered Saturday at Luna Park in Coney Island to help celebrate the anniversary of the treasured landmark. Luna Park honored the ride's original fare of 25 cents for the first 85 minutes Saturday. Brooklyn gave roller coaster fans something to scream about Saturday. The day's festivities, many of them free, were to be followed by a fireworks display over the Coney Island beach. Zaki said visitors lined up three hours before the park opened Saturday.
