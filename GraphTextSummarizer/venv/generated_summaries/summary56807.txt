"It was a very highly secure storage center," said Lt. Robert Edgar, who supervises a Special Burglary Section at Los Angeles Police headquarters. The 14-time Grand Slam titleholder learned that 51 of his 64 championship trophies -- including those marking his first Australian Open cup, five season-ending ATP World Tour titles, two Davis Cup wins and other memorabilia -- were among the coveted items stolen. He declined to give further details about the investigation or the potential market value of the stolen items. Los Angeles Police want to question a "person of interest" in the theft of nearly all of legendary tennis champion Pete Sampras' trophy collection from a public storage facility. He defeated Andre Agassi at the 2002 U.S. Open before retiring the following year with the most grand slam wins in tennis history.
