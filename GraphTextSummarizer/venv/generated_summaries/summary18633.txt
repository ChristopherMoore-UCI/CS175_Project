The CPSC and Napa Home & Garden recalled 460,000 bottles and jugs of gel fuel in June, and the CPSC recommends the removal of all remaining gel fuel stock from store shelves. -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Thursday a recall of pourable gel fuels used in outdoor decorative lighting because of burn and flash fire hazards. The nine manufacturers and distributors involved in the voluntary recall include Bird Brain, Bond Manufacturing, Sunjel, Fuel Barons, Lamplight Farms, Luminosities, Pacific Decor, Real Flame, and Smart Solar USA. Incidents of flash fires and burns have been reported when consumers add the gel to an already burning fire pot. So you have to use a dry chemical extinguisher to get the flame out," CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum told CNN.
