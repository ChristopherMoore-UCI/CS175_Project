Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg calls manned missions "an incredible waste of money" and argues that "for the cost of putting a few people on a very limited set of locations on Mars we could have dozens of unmanned, robotic missions roving all over Mars." Actually, there are very good reasons to stop spending billions of dollars on manned space missions, to explore space in ways that are safer and much less costly, and to grant much higher priority to other scientific and engineering mega-projects, the oceans in particular. Space enthusiasts claim that space exploration has generated major spinoffs for our life right here on Earth. Given the looming crisis of water scarcity, we badly need more efficient and less costly methods to desalinate ocean water. The main costs of space exploration arise from the fact that we are set on sending humans, rather than robots.
