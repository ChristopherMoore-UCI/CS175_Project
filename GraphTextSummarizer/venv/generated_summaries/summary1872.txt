There were at least 20 requests from traders at rival banks to Barclays' Euribor submitters to lower or raise rates between 2006 and 2008, according to findings by the Financial Services Authority in its settlement with Barclays. In its settlement with Barclays, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, described an unnamed trader as having "orchestrated an effort to align trading strategies among traders at multiple banks [...] in order to profit from their futures trading positions". According to several people familiar with the matter that senior Barclays trader was Mr Moryoussef, who worked for Barclays from 2005 until 2007. There had been a broad assumption that most banks under investigation were suspected of manipulating Libor submissions in the financial crisis period running from 2007-9 to appear healthier than they really were, sometimes allegedly with the implicit nod from policy makers. According to an FT investigation, Mr Moryoussef is alleged to have contacted a number of traders whom he knew at other banks, either through previous employment or via professional or personal networks.
