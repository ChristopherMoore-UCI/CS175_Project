Vice President Joe Biden emphasized the issue of income inequality to a gathering of major donors and activists Friday night, telling them Democrats will work to address it to help working people, an attendee at the event told CNN. Income inequality appeared to be a priority for this audience, and has been a key focus for such leaders as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who received a warm welcome when she spoke to the group Thursday. He got emotional, according to the participant, when he recounted how his father could not get a loan for him to attend an Ivy League university -- and he said people in such situations need the country's help. Not all of the vice president's remarks went over well, including his telling the group that Americans still prefer Democrats despite the electoral drubbing. Biden told the gathering that income in the United States is the most unequal it has been since the 1920s, according to an attendee, who spoke to CNN on the condition he not be identified since it was a private event.
