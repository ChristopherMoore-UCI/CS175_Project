Their research indicates Neanderthals were more than just the cavemen-like characters depicted in Geico commercials, but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an "advanced level of prowess" in catching birds, according to Frayer. Frayer co-wrote "Evidence for Neanderthal Jewelry: Modified White-tailed Eagle Claws at Krapina" with three other Croatian scientists. Frayer, a professor emeritus of anthropology, was a part of the study published in the journal PLOS ONE that looks at eagle talons found in present-day Croatia. The talons are among the thousands of human remains, animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by Croatian scientist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger. Just say "thank you." A new study published this month suggests Neanderthals were more "cognitively advanced than we give them credit," Kansas University's David Frayer said in a release.
