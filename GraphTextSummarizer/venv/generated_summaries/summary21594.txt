The Istanbul team had been due to enter the second-tier Europa League after losing to English team Arsenal in a two-legged Champions League playoff. "UEFA welcomes today's decisions of the CAS rejecting the appeals made by Fenerbahce SK and FC Metalist Kharkiv against the UEFA Appeals Body decisions of 15 July 2013 and 14 August 2013 respectively," read a UEFA statement. Turkish football club Fenerbahce have been excluded from European competitions for two years after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld a ban issued by UEFA. Metalist were replaced by PAOK Thessaloniki in the Champions League qualification competition following the original verdict earlier this month. The CAS also upheld a one-year ban meted out to Ukrainian team Metalist Kharkiv, also for match-fixing.
