In his first extensive comments about the controversy over the name of Washington's pro football team, owner Dan Snyder penned a letter to fans defending his decision not to change the Redskins name. "After 81 years, the team name 'Redskins' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from, who we are, and who we want to be in the years to come," Snyder said. It is unclear whether Snyder will be part of those meetings, but Halbritter said he hopes Snyder will come because "it is clear from Mr. Snyder's letter that he does not understand (the) consequences" of using Redskins as a team name. "In the spirit of the dialogue that Mr. Snyder says he is willing to engage in, we are inviting him to join the NFL delegation in its upcoming meeting at our homelands," Halbritter said Wednesday. "During his visit, we will organize a special meeting of Oneida Nation families where Mr. Snyder can personally explain to them why he believes they deserve to be called 'redskins.'
