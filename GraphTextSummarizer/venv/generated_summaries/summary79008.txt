But according to political analyst Mark Plotkin, Gray's time as mayor may be short-lived. Three of the last four occupants of the office have been stung by ethics questions ranging from crack cocaine use and possession to campaign finance violations. -- Mayor Vincent Gray knew in January 2012 that members of his staff had not properly reported funds raised for his 2010 campaign, according to a source close to a federal investigation into his campaign funding. Gray reused the "One City" mantra in his 2010 race for mayor. The allegations have led three of Gray's former colleagues on the Washington council -- David A. Catania, Mary M. Cheh and Muriel Bowser -- to call for his resignation, while also writing the next chapter in what has been a long history of political scandal coming from Washington's mayoral office.
