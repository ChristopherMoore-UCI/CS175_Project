Odeh would be entitled to a seat on Israel's foreign affairs committee in the Knesset and is obligated to address the Knesset after every speech by the Prime Minister. But as he got older, he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. With a large block in parliament, Odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a Palestinian state living beside Israel. Sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street, Sami Abuliat says Odeh is a good spokesman for Palestinians living inside Israel. Over hummus and stuffed vegetables, he speaks about a 10-year plan to close the social gaps between Israel's Jews and its Arab population, speaking about issues such as education, housing, employment for women, public transportation in Arab towns and recognition of unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev. In a sea of Jewish parties campaigning at Hebrew University, Ayman Odeh was the star attraction.
