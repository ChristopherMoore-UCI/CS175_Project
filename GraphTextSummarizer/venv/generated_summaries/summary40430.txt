In a TV exclusive with CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest, Prime Minister Najib Razak told CNN the report will be available to the public next week. Asked for a response, Boeing sent CNN a statement: "Our thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with the families and loved ones of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. So far, it has found no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The Malaysian Cabinet has agreed to have an international team investigate the disappearance of Flight 370, acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft.
