Hassan and Hussein Benhaffaf, who were joined at the chest, are in intensive care and sedated but stable, said consultant pediatric surgeon Edward Kiely, of Great Ormond Street Hospital. The twins were born in December at University College London Hospital, CNN affiliate ITN reported. "We thank God, we thank the surgeons and the gifted team at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and we thank from the bottom of our hearts the Irish nation and everyone who prayed for our beloved twins. Though joined at the chest, they shared no major organs, Britain's Press Association and Irish broadcaster RTE reported. Their parents, Angie and Azzedine Benhaffaf, flew with their babies to London last month to prepare for the operation, ITN reported.
