-- Google has updated its Maps app, rolling the new-ness out now to Android devices and coming soon to Apple portables. According to Google's blog post: "In addition to current traffic conditions, we've added two new features to help you navigate around traffic. Says Google: "One important change you should know about is that Latitude and check-ins are no longer part of the new Google Maps app, and will be retired from older versions on August 9. We understand some of you still want to see your friends and family on a map, which is why we've added location sharing and check-ins to Google+ for Android (coming soon to iOS). One of the most helpful additions in this most recent update is intelligent re-routing based on current traffic conditions.
