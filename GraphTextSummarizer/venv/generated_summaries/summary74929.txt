" The State Department's continued referencing of the other allegations against Gration came amidst fruitless attempts by CNN to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for Secretary Clinton to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 Inspector General's report against Gration repeatedly hammered him for the use of "commercial email for official government business" which was considered to be "flouting of direct instructions to adhere to Department policy." Considering that "Department of Defense dot mil accounts, USAID accounts, and every Kenyan account used the same routers and security firewalls as a Gmail account," he took issue with State Department protocols. Conducting official business on non- Department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies." "The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing, and spoofing of email accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information. Gration noted that Cheryl Mills, the then-State Department Chief of Staff "obviously knew Secretary Clinton was using commercial email, yet she stated my use of Gmail was one of the reasons I had to move on."
