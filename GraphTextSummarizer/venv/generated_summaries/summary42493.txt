Publicly, at least, Beijing's diplomats maintain China is not worried about Myanmar's engagement with the U.S. "China welcomes Myanmar and Western countries to improve their relations on the basis of mutual respect," says Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei. Even as Myanmar's leadership begins to mend fences with Washington, few expect to see China and Myanmar drift too far apart, thanks to the two neighbors' inter-dependent relationship. "Close to the shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia, Myanmar is important for China to develop its southwestern provinces, which have a population of 200 million people," writes Li Xiguang, a professor with Tsinghua University in Beijing, in his column in the state-run Global Times newspaper. Just days before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's historic visit to Myanmar, amid signs of what Washington considers positive changes in the country under a new government, China's vice president Xi Jinping told Myanmar's top general in Beijing the two countries should strengthen military ties. "The visit also sends a strong signal to China that the U.S. is seeking to contain Beijing's influence in Myanmar."
