-- Billy Bean, a former major league player who announced after his career that he is gay, has been appointed as an "ambassador of inclusion," Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said Tuesday.

She said her brother would be happy but would wonder about all the fuss "because when you're just busy trying to live a life and be a decent human being, and play the sport as best you can, with all the respect you can, it should be a done deal or an easy deal for anyone." Jason Collins became the first publicly openly gay player in a major U.S. sports league when he took the court for the NBA's Boston Celtics. The league has said the partnership will include education and training for fans, players and teams.
