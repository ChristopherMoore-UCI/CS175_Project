-- Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama. Obama's main antagonist, of course, is the hyper-partisan Congress that refuses to agree on the most basic issues, such as raising the debt ceiling, which Congress has done more than 40 times since 1980. Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News. First, Obama should announce that retaking control of the House in 2014 is a top priority. It looked as if Obama had righted his ship and would be able to refocus Americans on his priorities.
