-- British boxer Dereck Chisora threatened to shoot compatriot David Haye when the two became embroiled in an ugly brawl after Chisora had been defeated in Munich by WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko. At a press conference after Ukrainian Klitschko had beaten his opponent on points, the British pair became embroiled in an angry exchange before Chisora left the stage to confront former WBA heavyweight champ Haye and a scuffle ensued. At this point Haye, who had been keen to come out of retirement to face Vitali, interjected to say: "You don't want to fight David Haye, no?" Boente replied: "You had an offer, you didn't accept it, now you are out. Haye, who had been covering the fight for a UK television station, reacted angrily when Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente told reporters: "With the bad experience we've had with British fighters we will now look for other countries. He also said on four separate occasions that he would "shoot" Haye. Vitali, who took his record to 44 wins from 46 fights with victory, later told Sky News: "If you are sportsman with millions of people watching you have to set a good example, and Chisora didn't do that."
