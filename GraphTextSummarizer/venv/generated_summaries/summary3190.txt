-- Doctors distributed antibiotics to passengers aboard an Italian cruise ship after four crew members were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, Italy's health ministry reported Monday. The 294-meter (965-foot), 2,500-passenger Orchestra is currently in the French port of Villefranche sur Mer, on the outskirts of Nice, and the ministry said Italian authorities have notified their French counterparts. The disease is passed by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. More than 2,800 doses of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and rifampicin were issued for passengers, and the ministry said passengers who have disembarked in the past week should take similar precautions. "The strand was found in the crew that worked in the kitchen and that, therefore, they should not have had continuous and close contact with passengers," the Health Ministry noted.
