Trooper Alex T. Douglass was in stable but critical condition after being shot late Friday night just outside the police barracks in Blooming Grove, Commissioner Frank Noonan said. "We hope to interview him and see if he can provide any information on the incident," Trooper Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, said Sunday night. Earlier, Noonan said police had no description of the shooter or any information about the motive. Noonan stressed that police would be interviewing "hundreds" of people. A Pennsylvania State Police officer shot in an ambush is conscious and speaking for the first time since his surgery, according to police.
