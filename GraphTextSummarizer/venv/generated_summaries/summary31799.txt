And what hope do South Korea have of emulating their 2002 World Cup glory in South Africa next summer? "He has developed his tactical and technical ability and he has become a very important player for us," Ferguson told a press conference during United's summer tour of Korea. Yet when he signed for Manchester United from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, some unfairly thought that it was a mere sop, a marketing tool for Manchester United to sell more replica shirts.
