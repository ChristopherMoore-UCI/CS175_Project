-- Bahraini pro-government medics and state media staffers "bullied and intimidated" an Irish delegation of health workers and politicians here to secure the release of more than a dozen Bahraini health workers, said former Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews. " "We have not come to save Irish doctors," Damian McCormack, who led the delegation, told reporters. The incident occurred as the Irish delegation was completing a two-day fact-finding mission intended to determine the condition and secure the release of more than a dozen doctors and medical staff detained on anti-government charges. But the news conference began to fall apart when 10 to 15 pro-government doctors and reporters for the state-run media approached the Irish delegation demanding to question them about their visit. As the pro-government doctors and reporters circled the Irish health workers in the hotel lobby, officials decided to call off the news conference.
