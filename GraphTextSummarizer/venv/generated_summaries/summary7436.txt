Before the attack, Yousufzai was in the process of starting a charity, the Malala Education Development Organization, to promote female education in northern Pakistan. Now the 14-year-old girl from Pakistan is slowly recovering after being shot in the head by the Taliban for blogging against them and defending the right of girls to go to school. To make a donation to UNICEF's Stand with Malala campaign and support education programs in Pakistan, visit the organization's website. The Citizens Foundation has worked to improve education in Pakistan since 1995 and started 830 schools, according to the organization's website. "I Am Malala" is an online petition honoring Yousufzai and calling for Pakistan and countries worldwide to ensure all children have access to the education.
