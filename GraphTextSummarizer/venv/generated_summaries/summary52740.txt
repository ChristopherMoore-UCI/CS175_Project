Power worked for Obama's campaign in 2008 until she resigned after referring to Hillary Clinton -- the other leading Democratic contender at the time -- as a "monster." "As one of our country's leading foreign policy thinkers, Samantha knows that our nation's interests are advanced with strong and principled American leadership," Obama said in a statement. Power also has written extensively on preventing genocide, with criticism of the United Nations for failing to stop attacks in Bosnia and Rwanda. The confirmation, by a 87-10 vote, was lauded by President Barack Obama. Prior to the confirmation, Power was senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council and a former special assistant to the president.
