Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF or in English, Doctors Without Borders) said some of Sirte's residents remain trapped in the fighting. Most residents have abandoned Sirte after a month of fierce battles. On the outskirts of Sirte, a mansion with a columned facade lies in ruins, though its opulence is still evident under shattered glass and chunks of concrete. The 50 remaining patients are mostly people who have suffered violent trauma, severe burns and fractures, according to MSF. There is no water supply in the hospital and one of four operating theaters has been shelled, MSF said.
