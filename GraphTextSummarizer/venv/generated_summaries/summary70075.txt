With the aughts winding down and September traditionally a rough month for movies, Rotten Tomatoes decided it was a good time to update an old list of bad movies and look at some of this decade's worst, said Matt Atchity, the site's editor-in-chief. Critics may not be able to doom a bad movie, but they can give a boost to small good ones -- and they keep a dialogue going about movies in general, he said. Still, Atchity defends the role of movie critics, themselves much reviled (and, given the struggles of newspapers and the rise of social media, much unemployed) in recent years. But, seven years after its release, "Ecks" can now claim one honor: It's the worst movie of the decade, according to RottenTomatoes.com, the movie review aggregator site. "We've seen some really, really poorly reviewed movies in the last few weeks," he said.
