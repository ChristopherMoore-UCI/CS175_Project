Routh, an unemployed former Marine reportedly diagnosed with PTSD, was gone, and so was Kyle's black Ford pickup truck, police said. Routh drove up in Kyle's truck at his sister's house 65 miles away, police said. According to a police body camera video played in court Thursday, Eddie Ray Routh was sitting in Kyle's stolen truck when he told a detective: "I don't know if I'm going insane. The man accused of killing Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was the subject of "American Sniper," and Kyle's friend told a detective after the shootings that he was worried about his own mental state. After the killings, Adcock said, Routh drove Kyle's pickup to a Taco Bell off Interstate 35 and purchased two bean burritos, leaving a restaurant receipt in the driver's side door of the truck.
