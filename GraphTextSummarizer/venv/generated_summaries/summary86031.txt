If 10 years ago supporters of marriage equality dismissed all those who opposed gay marriage -- or who had even had used derogatory terms about gays -- as bigots incapable of evolving, we never would have seen the new acceptance of marriage equality by mainstream America. In 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws that barred interracial marriage in the famous case of Loving v. Virginia, 73% of Americans actually supported such laws. Of course she can, just as others have changed their views on issues of race and marriage equality. We also witnessed America evolve for the better regarding interracial marriage. Our country's history is filled with examples of people's views changing over time for the better -- the most recent example being on the issue of marriage equality.
