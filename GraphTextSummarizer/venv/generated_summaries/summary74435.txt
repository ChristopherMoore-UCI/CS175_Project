-- Arsenal lost 6-0 to league leader Chelsea in English football's Premier League and it looked like another side from North London would suffer a heavy defeat Sunday when Tottenham fell behind 2-0 to Southampton. " Southampton possesses quality players, too, with the English trio of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Jay Rodriguez all impressing this season and hoping to be on the plane to Brazil for the World Cup. But unlike the Gunners on Saturday, Spurs rallied and kept their slim Champions League hopes alive by downing Southampton 3-2 with a dramatic injury-time winner at White Hart Lane. Sherwood -- who replaced the axed Andre Villas Boas in December -- publicly criticized his team following a 4-0 reverse at Chelsea two weeks ago and Tottenham has since put in better performances, even if it lost to Arsenal last week and was bundled out of the Europa League. Gylfi Sigurdsson's low shot handed Tottenham all three points and pulled Tim Sherwood's men to within six points of Arsenal in the race for fourth, the final Champions League spot.
