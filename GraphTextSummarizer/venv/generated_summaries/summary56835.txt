North Korea's KCNA reported a South Korean army unit hung portraits of the late leader Kim Jong Il and the founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, on walls and doors of a military base and wrote "unspeakable defamatory words below them." -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his troops to be on the highest alert Sunday as he visited the DMZ, or demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. About 150,000 North Koreans protested at the Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang on Sunday to condemn the South, according to South Korean media. Asked by reporters about the presence of such posters, Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said, "For South Korean soldiers fighting at the front line, it's important for them to be armed with a proper mindset against the enemy. Current joint military drills between the United States and South Korea have been condemned by the North as a provocation.
