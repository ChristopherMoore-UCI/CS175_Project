"I don't understand why a political organization, in Europe or somewhere in the world, they have the right to ask FIFA to enter into any activity -- especially in the election," said Blatter, who has been FIFA president since 1998. -- Defiant FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told one of Europe's top political organizations not to interfere in the world football body's affairs after it called for a probe into his 2011 re-election. Blatter, who turns 76 on Saturday, also said it was strange that the opposition to FIFA came only from Europe but not from Asia, Africa or South America. Meanwhile, Brazil has accepted FIFA's apology after secretary general Jerome Valcke told journalists the country needed a "kick up the backside" to be ready in time for the 2014 World Cup. The first results of FIFA's ongoing reform process -- triggered by corruption scandals ahead of the December 2010 vote for naming hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups -- will be made public at the end of March, he said.
