Sri Lanka wasted no time recording victory as Upul Tharanga smashed an unbeaten 67 and put on 72 with Tilkeratne Dilshan, before he was caught by Maurice Ouma off the bowling of Otieno. Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande won the toss and elected to bat but openers Maurice Ouma and Seren Waters fell before eight runs were on the board. -- Lasith Malinga became the first bowler to claim a hat-trick of dismissals in two Cricket World Cups as his devastating spell of bowling helped Sri Lanka dismantle Kenya. Minnows Kenya had no answer to his fierce spell of bowling, capitulating to 142 all out in Colombo before the hosts lost only one batsman as they recorded a  nine wicket victory in just 18 overs. Just a few balls later Malinga claimed his sixth victim as he bowled Elijah Otieno to end Kenya's innings on 142.
