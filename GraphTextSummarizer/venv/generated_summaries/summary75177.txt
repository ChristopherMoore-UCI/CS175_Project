Nadal was playing his eighth straight final since returning from a seven-month injury layoff in February and has been on an upward curve with each successive week. -- Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams underlined their status as overwhelming favorites for the French Open by breezing through their respective title matches in Rome Sunday. We had a lot of tight games and the match was closer than the score, but Serena played a very good match and was better in the important moments," Azarenka told the WTA Tour official website. Earlier, Williams blasted 41 winners as she beat Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka by the same score. It was Nadal's seventh title triumph in the Italian capital but for Swiss ace Federer it was a sobering experience.
