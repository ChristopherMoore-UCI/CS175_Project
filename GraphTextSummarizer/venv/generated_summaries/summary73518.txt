The three men, Innocent Kaina, Baudouin Ngaruye and Sultani Makenga are part of the leadership of the M23 rebel group, the United Nations says, and are currently entrenched in the far eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area not only known for its immense beauty but also immense store of raw materials, such as copper, diamonds, and gold. The sanctions come as a new cycle of unrest continues in eastern DR Congo. -- The past three weeks of U.N. Security Council meetings have culminated in the sanctioning of the three men accused of being part of the M23, a rebel group accused of recruiting child soldiers to commit massacres and rapes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was also involved in the Kiwandja Massacre in November 2008, where 67 civilians, mostly young men, were murdered in north eastern Congo, the United Nations says. According to Human Rights Watch, the three are responsible for recruiting child soldiers, some as young as eight years old.
