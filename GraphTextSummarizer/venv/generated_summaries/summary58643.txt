"There are no words to express how very sorry we are for the hurt such a mistake has caused the families of our fallen warriors," said Col. John L. Mayer, commanding officer of the Marines Wounded Warrior Regiment. The Marine Corps was apologizing Tuesday for sending the packages to families of the fallen instead of the Marines wounded in action but still alive. More than 9,000 were sent out, but 1,150 went out to families of the Marines who had died. -- Some Marine Corps families, mourning a son or daughter killed in action, received an unexpected surprise for the holidays: an ornament of the Purple Heart, a letter addressed to their fallen hero and even information about athletic reconditioning. "This initiative was meant to thank combat-wounded Marines and sailors for their service."
