The indictment against Sowell also alleges that he assaulted women on December 8, 2008, and on September 22 and October 20 of this year. Sowell's charges in those cases include attempted murder, rape or attempted rape, kidnapping, robbery and felonious assault. A grand jury has indicted Anthony Sowell on 85 counts, following the discovery of 11 sets of human remains at his Cleveland, Ohio, house in October. Sowell, 50, faces rape and kidnapping charges as well and also has been charged with brutalizing three other women and raping two of them, Mason said. Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid told reporters this week that Sowell has been a "model prisoner," is kept in an isolated unit and has declined visitation requests.
