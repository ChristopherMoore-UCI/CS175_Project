Forecasters issued severe weather warnings Thursday, predicting heavy snow for many parts of the country including Scotland, northeast England, parts of central England, and the entire south from Cornwall to London and the southeast. London's Heathrow Airport was open, but said some airlines were experiencing delays and cancellations because of snow disruptions at other airports. Thursday, airport officials handed out 1,000 blankets along with food and water to stranded passengers who had little to do but sit around and hope for the weather to improve. "You normally have this change in the wind pattern later in the season, but it won't bring snow because the ocean will be colder," Ramos said. A quarter of flights out of Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport and 10 percent of flights out of Orly were canceled Thursday, air traffic control said.
