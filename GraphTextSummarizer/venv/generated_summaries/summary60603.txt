That has prompted advisory groups and institutional investors including ISS, Ethos, F&C and Hermes Equity Ownership Services to rebel against what they see as a lack of disclosure on how pay is calculated and a high proportion of variable pay. The discontent among UBS shareholders also goes beyond the recent upsurge in investor activism expressed in non-binding votes on pay at other big banks including Citigroup and Barclays. "ISS continues to have concerns about lack of safeguards against excessive pay and poor pay practices, lack of disclosure in key areas, and certain aspects of UBS's remuneration system," the advisory group said in a recent note to clients. Last year, more than a third who voted refused to back the pay report and in 2010 more than 45 per cent of investors declined to endorse it. The trading scandal has triggered management changes including the replacement of chief executive Oswald Gr√ºbel by Sergio Ermotti last September.
