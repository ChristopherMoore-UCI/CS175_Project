At some points, annual radiation doses run five to 10 times what's allowed for nuclear plant workers. Shikata said the government is still studying how to clean up areas where the annual dose tops 50 millisieverts, the standard international limit for nuclear industry workers -- "a difficult area to realize returns," he said. "I have to accept this because an earthquake and tsunami are natural disasters," Namie town councilman Bunsai Watanabe said. And even when annual radiation levels can be cut below the 20 millisieverts the government says is safe -- itself a measure that has been the subject of debate -- former residents may be reluctant to come home. The work so far focuses on areas where annual doses of radiation are between 20 and 50 millisieverts a year -- seven to 16 times the typical amount a resident of an industrialized country receives in a year, but below the threshold for an increased risk of cancer.
