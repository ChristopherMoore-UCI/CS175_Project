" Sandra Bullock is joined by 15 more Entertainers of the Year, including the masterminds behind Breaking Bad, Dallas Buyers Club star Matthew McConaughey, girl on fire Jennifer Lawrence, a very Grumpy Cat, and more. Bullock's tremendous talent and range â€” to say nothing of the woman's trademark grace and good humor in good times and bad â€” is what earned her the top spot on our annual list of the most exciting performers in 2013. While Bullock nixes any talk of The Heat 2, she says she's keen for another project with her fast friend McCarthy. First the 49-year-old Oscar winner teamed up with the uproarious Melissa McCarthy in Paul Feig's winning buddy cop comedy The Heat. When she signed on to The Heat Bullock didn't expect to be playing straight man to McCarthy's firehose-blast of a performance.
