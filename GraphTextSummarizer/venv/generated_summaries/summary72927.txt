In downtown Tampa, the Hillsborough River carries diverse creatures from manatees to rowers through a collection of old factories and new office buildings. While hundreds of boats clog the waterways surrounding downtown Tampa, thousands of people enjoy a parade on land. Yes, you will still find humidity and sunburned tourists, but also a diverse Tampa Bay area community that includes Greeks, Cubans and Scientologists. As I've traveled around America's peninsula, I've noticed that compared with other Sunshine State destinations, Tampa's climate is superior. In the summer of '97, I moved with my family to the Tampa Bay area from Georgia.
