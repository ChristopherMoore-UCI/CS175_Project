Hall, though, was flown to The Medical Center of Plano with what the public safety department described as "serious injuries." Joy Dover, a hospital spokeswoman, said later Saturday that Hall was in stable condition. Rep. Ralph Hall was being driven by his friend, 73-year-old Howard Zielke, when someone turned into them and collided with their vehicle around 2:50 p.m. (3:50 p.m. ET) in Fannin County, the Texas Department of Public Safety reported. Shortly after losing a Republican primary this spring to tea party-backed candidate John Ratcliffe, thus spelling an end to his 32-year stay in Congress, Hall cracked: "I figured it out -- damn guy got more votes than I did!" As to Hall himself, his office said he "suffered a hip injury and minor cuts and bruises, but is expected to make a full recovery." The congressman's office provided more details.
