-- He might have been best known for his acting career, but Robin Williams, who has died aged 63, was a cycling fanatic who counted among his friends Lance Armstrong and five-time Tour de France winner Eddy Merckx. British-based Team Sky, which has dominated the sport in recent years with Tour de France winners Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, was quick to pay tribute on its official Twitter feed. Williams' interest in the sport appeared to be inspired by Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France wins after admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in 2012. "I am shocked at Robin Williams' death," Merckx was quoted on a Belgian radio station VRT Tuesday. The Hollywood funnyman took part in the Ride for the Roses charity event in Texas, which was organized by Armstrong's foundation and Williams was a regular supporter on the Tour de France.
