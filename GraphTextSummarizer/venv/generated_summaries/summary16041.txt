As skeptics of the argument for lethal assistance pointed out, even with U.S. weapons, Ukraine's military would never be able to defeat Russian regulars, while Moscow's ability to arm the separatists would always outstrip Washington's ability to arm the Ukrainian government. The prospect of U.S. military assistance also no doubt affected the Russian calculation. Yet even if U.S. weapons would not reach Ukrainian forces for months, the very commitment to provide them would insert the United States much more directly into the conflict. While Russian officials are keen to portray the U.S. as a declining power, in their more honest moments they appreciate the reality of U.S. financial and military power (perhaps more than many in the Obama administration do) and are keen to avoid a test of strength they cannot win. But it also increased the pressure on Merkel and French President Francois Hollande to press for a deal to avoid what they feared might be a bigger conflict, fueled by U.S. weapons.
