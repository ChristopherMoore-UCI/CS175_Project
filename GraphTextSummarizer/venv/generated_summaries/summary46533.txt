As Adams takes a break from designing his first bowl, he looks around and talks with students and faculty. Corcoran student Jeff Herrity has been working with clay for 10 years, but he's still excited to sit down and create bowls that someone will put to use. "There are over 9,000 homeless people in the nation's capital," says the Rev. John Adams, who has been trying to break the cycle of homelessness and hunger in Washington for more than 30 years as president of So Others Might Eat. This year, for the first time, the group is partnering with the Corcoran to help supply bowls for the fundraiser in March 2010. "It's great to spend an entire day making bowls and thinking about what they will be used for, Herrity said.
