Pettersson, meanwhile, began the final round with a one-shot lead over Colt Knost and finished with a confident two-under 69 to move clear of the field for his fifth PGA Tour title. Knost had a disastrous final round of 74 to drop out of contention, leaving Pettersson to claim victory by five strokes from another American, Zach Johnson. Describing how he put the pounds back on, Pettersson told the PGA Tour website: "Well, you drink 10 beers and (eat) a tub of ice cream before bed." -- Rory McIlroy reclaimed golf's No. 1 ranking without lifting a club after Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald finished down the field in 37th at the RBC Heritage on Sunday. I built it up nicely last year through tournaments and winning a bunch.
