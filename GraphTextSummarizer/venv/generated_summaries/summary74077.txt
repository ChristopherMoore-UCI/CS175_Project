Beautician Katie Cutler read about the attack on a British newspaper website and created a fundraising page via the GoFundMe website. But the outpouring of support has left many with a restored faith in humanity, and the fundraising continues: Other hugely successful crowd-funding campaigns include over $5.4 million raised by Stephen Sutton, a teenager with incurable cancer who eventually passed away. An assailant shoved Alan Barnes, 67 -- who is just four feet six inches tall and partially blind -- to the ground and demanded he hand over his money in Gateshead, a town in the north east of England. The donations were not just monetary either -- Cutler says a man has offered to fit a new kitchen for Barnes; another has pledged to decorate his new home. Barnes suffered a broken collar bone, but his attacker left empty handed.
