The federal government should pay back New York and other cities that have shelled out millions to deal with Ebola, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday. Schumer said Sunday that money should include a special "Ebola Contingency Fund" that would reimburse states and local governments for treatment and containment of Ebola. City health officials also ramped up operations to keep track of people returning from Ebola hotspots in West Africa and those who had direct contact with Spencer, Schumer said. "The world-class effort mounted by the city and Bellevue to fight Ebola was not cost-free -- far from it," Schumer told reporters Sunday. Last month, the World Bank estimated that the cost of Ebola could top $32 billion over the next two years if the deadly virus spreads to more countries in West Africa.
