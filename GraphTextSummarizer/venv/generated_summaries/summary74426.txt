One of the explosions at a school on the outskirts of Peshawar destroyed a wall, said Sahibzada Anis, Peshawar's administrative chief. Since October, the city has been the target of a series of attacks launched by militants to revenge a major Army offensive to root out the Taliban. Two other bombs were set up outside a school in the Khyber Agency of Pakistan's semiautonomous tribal areas, according to Azam Jan, a senior local administration official. Peshawar, the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, is at the core of Pakistan's war on terror. One blew up and damaged a wall while the other was defused by local officials.
