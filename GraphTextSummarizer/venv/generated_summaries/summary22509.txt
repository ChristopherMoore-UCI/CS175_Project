Not wanting to wade into the debate around gun control, my position on guns has been one of naivety and willed ignorance. -- President Obama took a great first step in making our country safer Wednesday when he signed executive actions to reduce gun violence and urged Congress to reinstate the 2004 assault weapons ban. Know what these weapons of mass destruction do, know who is trying to stop research on gun safety, know what organizations are pushing for more comprehensive bans. Voices of the people played a role in the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and public opinion pushed Congress to pass the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. My cousin found solidarity with other parents whose children had been snatched by gun violence, making instant activists out of moms and dads.
