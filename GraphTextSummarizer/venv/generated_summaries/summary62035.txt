The San Diego County District Attorney's Office filed murder and felony charges Wednesday against the 10-year-old suspect, said Steve Walker, a spokesman for that office. " Since he is a juvenile, the boy accused of killing Ryan Carter cannot be found guilty but can be convicted on a "true finding of fact," explained Walker. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department received a call shortly after 1 p.m. Monday about the stabbing in Lakeside, which is about 20 miles northeast of San Diego. The boy -- whose name has not been made public, in accordance with the district attorney's policies regarding juvenile suspects -- is now being held in a juvenile detention center in the county, he added. An attorney for the young suspect "denied the charges" during his arraignment Thursday morning, according to Walker.
