The "Screaming Indian" logo isn't racist..." Others just wanted a piece of the controversy: @mattplanet said: "Okay, so we all know some prototypes of that screaming indian Braves BP cap were made...somebody got to get us one..." Debate over sports mascots is, of course, not new. Sometimes this happens with the blessing of Native American tribes, and other times -- like with the NFL's Washington Redskins, a term that many feel advances a demeaning stereotype -- they have been denounced as racial slurs. That was certainly the reaction for some Americans, especially Native American groups that were highly critical of the screaming Indian logo. All signs indicate that the Braves fully intended to go with the Indian design until the recent controversy caused them to have second thoughts. U.S. professional and collegiate sports teams have used Native American logos and names for years.
