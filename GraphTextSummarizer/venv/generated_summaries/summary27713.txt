In the past, authorities have blamed Islamic militants for carrying out attacks inside Pakistani cities. In February, several newspapers in Denmark reprinted the controversial cartoons of Islam's prophet, Muhammad, after Danish authorities arrested several people who allegedly were plotting a "terror-related assassination" of the cartoonist, Kurt Westergaard. The country experienced a month-long lull in attacks after a new government took office in March and set on a course to negotiate with militants. Pakistan Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir told reporters at the scene that police are beefing up security at embassies and foreign missions throughout the city. The embassy is there to have a cooperation between the Pakistani population and Denmark, and that means they are destroying that.
