See also: 'African women need a hand-up not hand-out' Women in Rwanda have been handcrafting baskets for centuries, using them as containers to carry food and transport goods or as decorations during weddings and baby christenings. Nkubana's efforts to empower the underprivileged women of Rwanda cultivated to the creation of Gahaya Links -- the company started operations in 2004 with only 27 women. Through Gahaya Links, Nkubana has taken the traditional basket from Rwanda to the shelves of high-end U.S. stores. "[It's] really amazing to see how a small piece of work, how culture can restore values in people, how healing comes through a small basket," says Janet Nkubana, co-founder of Gahaya Links, the company that has made Rwanda's hand-woven baskets internationally famous. Under the "Africa Growth and Opportunity Act," which allows Nkubana's products duty-free entrance into the U.S. market, Gahaya Links sells its handicrafts in American department stores such as Macy's, Kate Spade, Anthropologie and Same Sky.
