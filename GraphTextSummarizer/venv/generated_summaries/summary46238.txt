Instead, Romney has been working hard on his own favorability rating in Michigan, which has crept up from 49% to 55%. There will be a lot about how great American cars are, Mitt's experience as a businessman, Obama's relative incompetence and Romney's Michigan childhood. The latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset. But Santorum also probably recognizes that the only way he'll win Michigan is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about Romney's conservatism. But Mitt has been countering the "weirdo factor" with a series of ads and personal appearances in Michigan that emphasize his local roots and his concern for the auto industry in a state beset by tragic levels of unemployment.
