Super Bowl XLVIII kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Temperatures will rise just before the match-up between the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos to the low 40s, and it will feel like the high 30s once you measure the wind chill, CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said. Forecasts show that a break in the weather might come just in time, providing a dry -- if chilly -- field of play on Sunday night. Gray said most of the showers will be off shore and to expect dry conditions at the game. Elsewhere across the country, winter weather advisories on Saturday stretched from Oklahoma northward into Missouri, Illinois and Michigan.
