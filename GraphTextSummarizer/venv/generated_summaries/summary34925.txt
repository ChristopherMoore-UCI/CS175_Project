In New York, officials are beefing up police presence, particularly around transportation hubs and religious sites, New York Police Department spokesman James Duffy told CNN. U.S. Park Police spokesman Paul Brooks said security has not been increased at national monuments in Washington, and there are no new directives to officers. And in San Francisco, police increased patrols at key locations, including mass transit, popular landmarks and embassies, said spokesman Gordon Shyy. Miami police told CNN it was "business as usual," and that the department is constantly monitoring for potential threats. However, this worldwide alert serves as an important reminder for us to remain vigilant at all times," police Chief Ron Pavlik wrote.
