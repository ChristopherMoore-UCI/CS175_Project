United hit back with a late bundled goal from young substitute Federico Macheda, which television replays showed came off the Italian's arm, but Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov could not convert a chance to equalize in time added on. Chelsea, who had scored 12 goals in the two previous matches and did not have to play in midweek following last month's Champions League exit against Inter Milan, started the game in dominant form. Roberto Mancini's team were 4-0 up after 20 minutes, and led 6-0 before an hour had been played as Emmanuel Adebayor scored twice along with goals from fellow strikers Craig Bellamy and Carlos Tevez. United pulled a goal back with nine minutes to play as substitute Nani broke down the left and his cross rebounded off goalkeeper Petr Cech, onto Macheda and into the Chelsea net, with visiting captain John Terry appealing in vain for handball. Carlo Ancelotti's team traveled to Old Trafford to face a side reeling from the loss of injured England star Wayne Rooney following the midweek European Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich. Bottom club Portsmouth delayed their inevitable relegation with a 0-0 draw at home to Blackburn despite having defender Anthony Van den Borre sent off with half an hour to play.
