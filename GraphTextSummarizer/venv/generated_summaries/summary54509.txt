Name: Andy Sorrells Age: 29 Hometown: Franklin, Tennessee Occupation: Loan Processor Height: 6 feet 3 inches Heaviest weight: 500 pounds Current weight: 220 pounds Pounds lost: 280 pounds  Defining moment My wife, Maggie, had started the Weigh Down Workshop program. But I knew there had to be a way someone could eat normal food and still lose weight. I just started without a real goal of losing a specific amount of weight and reduced my portion sizes. You just have to eat what your body craves and reduce portion sizes. When I was born I was close to 11 pounds and all of my life I've dealt with weight issues.
