He said first learned of the attack in a telephone call from a friend in Chibok, who told him the town was under attack by Boko Haram. What did the Nigerian government know about the mass abduction of schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants, and when did it know it? They will join a team of U.S. and British officials already in Nigeria, helping find the girls, planning rescue efforts and devising strategies to help subdue Boko Haram. The soldiers were not there' As many as 200 Boko Haram fighters carried out the Chibok school raid, Amnesty reported, herding the girls out of bed under the cover of darkness after a firefight with the handful of security forces in the town. Amnesty is not the first to accuse Nigeria of failing to take enough action to stop the Chibok raid or other attacks, or to stage a forceful enough response in the aftermath.
