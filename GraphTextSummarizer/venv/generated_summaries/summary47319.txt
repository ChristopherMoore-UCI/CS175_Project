-- As the administration considers what executive actions President Barack Obama can take on immigration, the central question is how far can he go? With Congress divided, Obama to go his own way on immigration Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration law professor at UCLA and author of the new book "Immigration Outside the Law," said there are legal limits on the President's authority over immigration law. They say that's because deferred action -- a type of prosecutorial discretion that grants some undocumented immigrants relief from deportation on a case-by-case basis -- is a well-established practice under existing immigration law. The paper predicted that extending deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants could trigger a constitutional showdown with congressional Republicans. Another big question the White House must consider is what kind of precedent a big, bold move could set not just for future undocumented immigrants but for the exercise of executive power on other issues such as environmental policy and enforcement of civil rights laws.
