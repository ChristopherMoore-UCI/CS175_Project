Prosecutors argued that Rios Montt was aware of the repressive strategies that the military was using against anyone suspected of being a guerrilla, such as killings, forced disappearances and kidnappings. -- More than three weeks of testimony in the genocide trial of former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt were nullified by a judge Thursday on procedural grounds, state-run media reported. A three-judge Supreme Court panel had pushed forward with the trial of Rios Montt despite unresolved objections to procedures in lower courts. Standing trial alongside Rios Montt is Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez, who was head of intelligence in the early 1980s. Rios Montt ruled Guatemala from 1982 to 1983.
