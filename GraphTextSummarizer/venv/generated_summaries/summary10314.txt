Dario Khan then put through his own net seven minutes later as he stabbed the ball past Rafael while trying to clear a loose ball, but Almiro Lobo pulled a goal back after half an hour when he headed home as Benin defended woefully at a corner. Striker Razak Omotoyossi, who plays for French club Metz, netted the opener from the penalty spot in the 14th minute after being brought down by Mozambique goalkeeper Joao Rafael. In Tuesday's other Group C match, Mozambique came from two goals down to deny Benin a historic first victory at the tournament. Substitute Goncalves Fumo leveled the score 10 minutes after halftime as goalkeeper Yoann Djidonou, who had flapped ineffectually to allow Lobo to score, was caught out after coming out of his area to clear the ball. But the move backfired as Egypt substitute Mohamed Gedo drove in a low right-foot shot on 88 to seal his side's first victory over the Super Eagles in 23 years.
