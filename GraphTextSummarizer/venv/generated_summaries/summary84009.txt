On Saturday, activists and protesters plan to march through downtown St. Louis and rally at Kiener Plaza in the center of downtown to "show our strength as we stand united against police violence, both here in Ferguson and across the country" and to send a message of "Not One More," organizers said. The dispute soon spilled over onto the streets of the St. Louis suburb, sometimes violently, as protesters and police clashed. Demonstrators will invoke a Mexican Halloween tradition, and they will erect a Day of the Dead altar on Friday night in Ferguson to memorialize Brown and the deaths of any other loved ones offered up by participants. McCulloch's office is presenting the case to a St. Louis County grand jury, which could indict Wilson on charges related to Brown's death or opt not to. Demonstrators picked this spot because it's the office of St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch.
