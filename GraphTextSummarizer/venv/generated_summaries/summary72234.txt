Next year will see the arrival of Moxy (Marriott), Tommie (Commune Hotels) and Radisson Red, plus the expansion of already established hipster brands, like Aloft (Starwood), Andaz (Hyatt), CitizenM and Hotel Indigo (InterContinental Hotels). "This segment doesn't want to be confined to one enclosed space, and that's an idea that's been adopted by many brands," explains Nikhil Bhalla, vice president of equity research in lodging at FBR Capital Markets. "Every big company is looking at the same statistics we're seeing and saying, 'wow, we better do something for our millennial segment if we want to stay relevant,'" says Ramesh Jackson, the vice president and global brand manager for Moxy Hotels. Radisson Red, for instance, has replaced many of the workplace staples found in more traditional rooms with more collaborative furnishings, like a sofa in place of a one-person armchair. When it comes to satisfying the insatiable techie hunger of today's traveler, new hotel brands know that wi-fi alone no longer cuts it.
