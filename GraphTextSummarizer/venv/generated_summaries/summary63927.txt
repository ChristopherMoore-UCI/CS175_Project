Companies as diverse as American Airlines, TDS Telecom, 1-800-FLOWERS, Sprint and Xerox have programs that enable traditional workers to transition to telecommuting or hire workers specifically to work at home. While many companies are allowing existing employees to transition to various telecommuting options, some companies are also building work forces that are made up solely of employees working from home. Here is a sample of 10 companies that only hire at-home workers: • Alpine Access is a call center company that uses customer service representatives that work from home. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is another company that is mixing traditional workers with employees who work from home. • Convergys hires home-based call center agents who provide support in customer service, and also supplies sales agents or help desk staff for companies.
