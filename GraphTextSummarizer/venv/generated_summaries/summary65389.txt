He may have fully intended to figure out a new take on Patrick Swayze's iconic philosopher-surfer, but just months before cameras were supposed to roll on the "Point Break" remake, news broke that star Gerard Butler had officially dropped out of the project. The remake of director Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic has been in the works since 2011, and finally, in the last year, it looked like Alcon Entertainment was getting traction. Why 'Point Break' is the best summer movie EVER Alcon Entertainment did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment. The Hollywood Reporter, which first broke the Butler news, cited creative and scheduling differences for the fallout and says that Alcon still intends to keep its start date and will work quickly to recast the role. All we can say is "Vaya con Dios, brah."
