Thai authorities have said they are holding three Iranian suspects -- Saeid Moradi, 28, whose legs were blown off by his own bomb -- and Mohammad Hazaei, 42, who was taken into custody Tuesday at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport as he tried to board a plane to Malaysia. The police charged the man, Atris Hussein, after finding outside Bangkok "initial chemical materials that could produce bombs." All three face charges that include joint assembling of explosive devices, joint possession of explosive devices without permits and causing an explosion injuring other persons. The Thai National Security Council has drawn a tentative link between the bombs in Bangkok and those in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the explosive devices were similar. Thai police want to arrest another Iranian allegedly behind the bombs in Bangkok, a fifth member of a group they say intended to strike Israeli diplomats.
