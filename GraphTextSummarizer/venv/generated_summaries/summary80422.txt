, Haiti felt the brute force Friday of Hurricane Tomas, which could dump up to 15 inches of rain and trigger flash floods and mudslides. Tomas became a Category 1 hurricane as it approached Haiti early Friday, forecasters said. By Friday afternoon, rain had stopped falling. Rain associated with the storm started falling on Haiti on Thursday as aid agencies scrambled to move as many people as possible into storm shelters. "We were expecting something perhaps a little larger, but it's still quite significant," Desruisseaux said about Hurricane Tomas, adding that rescue teams throughout Haiti are still working to assess the damage.
