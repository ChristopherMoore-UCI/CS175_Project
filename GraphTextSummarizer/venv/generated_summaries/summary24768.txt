It read: "Media reports concerning alleged racist comments by one of the presidential candidates for the Italian FA have alerted FIFA's Task Force against racism and discrimination and its chairman Jeffrey Webb. "As such, FIFA has written a letter to the Italian FA asking it to take the appropriate steps to investigate and decide on this matter and report to FIFA. "I think the question is, where does this leave this very strong struggle, this real big problem that Italian football has had historically?" The FIGC said they would not be commenting when contacted by CNN but FIFA made its position clear with a statement on Tuesday morning. "In the letter, FIFA reminded the Italian FA that the fight against racism is a top priority for FIFA. "In 2013, the FIFA Congress unanimously passed a strong resolution on the fight against racism and discrimination, which, among other measures, reminded the member associations about their obligation to put every effort into eliminating racism and discrimination in football. "In its correspondence, FIFA also stressed that officials of the football community are expected to act as role models in the fight against racism."
