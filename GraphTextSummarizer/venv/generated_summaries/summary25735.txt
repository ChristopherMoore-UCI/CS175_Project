Exit polls suggest el-Sisi won 95.3% of the vote, while opponent Hamdeen Sabahy garnered only 4.7%, according to data from the Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research and the Egyptian TV channel MBC Masr. "The announced results are an insult to the intelligence of the Egyptians." Turnout at 48% despite extra day of voting The election was called amid a turbulent political year in Egypt that saw Mohamed Morsy -- the country's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak -- himself removed from power in July in a military coup. Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news agency reported an even more lopsided margin, based on unofficial results, with Sabahy only getting 3.5% of the vote. "We cannot give any credibility or ratification to the announced numbers of turnout or results," Sabahy said. Presidential Elections Commission member Tarek Shebi ended up putting the final turnout figure at 48%, according to Ahram Online -- hardly a resounding number.
