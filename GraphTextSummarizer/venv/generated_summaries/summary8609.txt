-- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho is hopeful that star striker Cristiano Ronaldo will return for Wednesday's Champions League clash with Lyon. We all know that the moment the lead increases the championship is lost." Nevertheless, Mourinho said his side would not be taking anything for granted against 18th-placed Hercules, and hoped for a positive result before the home clash with Lyon -- who knocked Real out at the same stage last season before reaching the semifinals. One team plays the Champions League on a Tuesday and La Liga on Sunday, and another play on a Wednesday and Saturday," he said. The Portugal captain will not feature in Saturday's La Liga game at home to Hercules, having sustained a thigh injury during Real's 7-0 defeat of Malaga on March 3. However, despite recording a 3-1 win over Racing Santander last weekend -- and having an unblemished home record this season and Mourinho with any club for the past nine years -- Real remain 11 points behind defending champions Barcelona in the Spanish league.
