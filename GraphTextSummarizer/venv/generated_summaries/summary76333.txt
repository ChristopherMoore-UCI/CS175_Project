-- After sparking controversy to have designer John Galliano teach a three-day master class at Parsons The New School for Design, the school announced on Wednesday the class has been canceled. In their earlier statement, Parsons acknowledged the controversy saying, "We believe that over the past two years, Mr. Galliano has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions. Galliano was fired from the fashion giant in March 2011 after making anti-Semitic remarks in Paris. " Soon after the class was announced, a petition was created on Change.org against Galliano teaching at Parsons and generated more than 2,100 supporters. He added: "I only have myself to blame, and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion." Abraham Foxman, national director for the Anti-Defamation League, said Tuesday in a statement, "I think it's time that John Galliano be evaluated on his skills." "He apologized, he repaired, he reached out.
