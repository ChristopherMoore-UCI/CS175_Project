But while it's important for parents to gain a deeper understanding of what their infants, toddlers, and preschoolers are capable of learning, it is also critical they see what these responsive and nurturing interactions look like in order to maximize teachable moments throughout their daily routines, such as meal time, bath time and bed time. Unfortunately, children with these risk factors typically have lower school readiness scores than those not affected by such circumstances, particularly in reading, mathematics, and executive function skills. It might surprise many to hear that current research has demonstrated that by 18 months, scientists can detect differences in various parts of the brain between children living in low socioeconomic status environments and those in middle or upper class environments. The results, documented in the "Kindergartners' Skills at School Entry" report, suggest that almost half of children -- 44% -- enter kindergarten with one or more risk factors based on their home environment (for example, poverty, parents with less than a high school education). Organizations such as Too Small to Fail and Text4baby, which we are currently partnering with are illustrating for new parents how to talk, read, and sing to their child throughout everyday moments, as well as suggesting ways to engage in stimulating activities that support their child's development, especially language and vocabulary development.
