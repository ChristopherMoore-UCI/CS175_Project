Hill was identified by a "victim/witness" in the shooting, according to an affidavit filed in Oklahoma County District Court by Inspector K. Whitebird. Several people had been questioned about the shootings, but no arrests had been made as of Tuesday afternoon, KOCO reported. In a statement Tuesday, the Oklahoma City Thunder said team officials were talking with police to determine what happened and whether it could have been prevented. "Whenever you get about 8,000 people outside of a venue, we are going to be outnumbered," Nelson told CNN affiliate KOCO. Eight people were shot Monday night just blocks from the Chesapeake Energy Arena as large crowds were leaving the playoff game between the Lakers and the Thunder, police said.
