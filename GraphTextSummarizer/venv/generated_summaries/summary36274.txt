-- Former Miami Dolphins player Chad Johnson is to be arraigned Thursday on a misdemeanor domestic battery charge Johnson and Lozada, a cast member on the VH1 reality TV show "Basketball Wives," married on July 4. Johnson is charged with first-degree misdemeanor domestic battery in the alleged head-butting last month of his new wife. According to the arrest report that the Davie Police Department released last month, Lozada returned to the couple's home from grocery shopping shortly after 7 p.m. August 11 and noticed a receipt with a charge for a box of condoms. The southern Florida native spent last season with the New England Patriots, then signed in the offseason with the Dolphins.
