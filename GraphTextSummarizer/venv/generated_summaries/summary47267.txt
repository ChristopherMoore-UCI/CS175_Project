While still dwarfed by the nation's millions of homes with cable, a growing number of consumers have begun "cutting the cord" in recent years -- opting to rely exclusively on network broadcasts and streaming Web services like Netflix, Amazon and YouTube for their movie and TV show needs. The TiVo Roamio OTA DVR (the OTA stands for "over the air") can record and store programs aired by CBS, ABC, NBC, PBS, Fox, Univision and other networks. The difference, TiVo says, is that the OTA uses devices in the home to record video, instead of recording it outside the home then streaming it to digital devices. "We never had legal challenges regarding recording content in the home for an individual consumer. Aereo captured shows from the broadcast airwaves and let users stream them digitally to their computers, smartphones or tablets.
