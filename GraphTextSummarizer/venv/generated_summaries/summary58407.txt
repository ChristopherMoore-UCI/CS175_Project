Kiev going West Yatsenyuk signed the political elements of a trade pact with the European Union on Friday as Russian lawmakers finalized annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. It cautioned U.S. citizens "to defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine and to defer all travel to the Crimean Peninsula and eastern regions of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Lugansk due to the presence of Russian military forces in the Crimean Peninsula." The Zaporizhia was taken over and placed under the flag of the Russian naval fleet when its commander abandoned it after deciding not to join with Russian forces, Seleznev, the Ukraine defense spokesman, told CNN. The reports "highlight the dangerous situation created by Russia and belie President (Vladimir) Putin's claim that Russia's military intervention in Crimea has brought security to that part of Ukraine." Although Russia insists that its actions are legitimate, Ukraine's interim government has said Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea.
