-- Three Pakistani police officers were found guilty of sexual exploitation and abuse of a 14-year-old Haitian boy while they were serving in a U.N. police mission in Haiti, a U.N. spokesman told reporters Tuesday. The three were found guilty in a court-martial proceeding conducted by Pakistani authorities in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, said the spokesman, Martin Nesirky. The three were in a Pakistani-formed police unit serving in Gonaives, Haiti, as part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake there in January 2010. Pakistani authorities alerted Haitian officials to the outcome of the military procedure this month, saying that "the guilty parties will be punished, including dishonorable discharge from service, loss of benefits and imprisonment, with the latter sentence to be served immediately on return to Pakistan." That's obviously a matter between Pakistan and Haiti, but as we stated from the outset, the United Nations considers this to be a case of the most serious sexual exploitation and abuse."
