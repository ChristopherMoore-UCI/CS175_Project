The incident left one of the girls slightly injured after she held on to the getaway car to stop it from leaving the scene, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Girl Scouts are financially responsible for any cookies they order, troop leader Jean Marie Johnson said. "So I think he learned his lesson a little bit ... and then they dragged my friend Rachel across the street." Rachel Johnson told the affiliate she got a few bumps and scratches when she held onto the back bumper to stop the car from driving away. Who steals money from Girl Scouts, I mean, really?" The cash box contained about $200, according to the affiliate. He grabbed the cash box and ran, leaving the girls stunned outside a Walmart store in Fort Bend County.
