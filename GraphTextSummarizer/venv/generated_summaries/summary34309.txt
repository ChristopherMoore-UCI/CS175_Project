At least one Madonna show had been canceled, Rosenberg told CNN. The accident happened when a crane collapsed while lifting a large metallic truss -- a structure from which lights hang -- into place, Lt. Thierry Delorme of the French Navy told CNN. Flora Genoux in Paris, France, contributed to this story for CNN. "My prayers go out to those who were injured and their families, along with my deepest sympathy to all those affected by this heartbreaking news," Madonna said in a statement issued by her representative, Liz Rosenberg. A third person was in critical condition, said Alexandre Lanzalavi, a spokesman for Marseille Hospital.
