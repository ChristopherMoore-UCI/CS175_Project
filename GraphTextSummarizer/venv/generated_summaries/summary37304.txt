As Bernard Moon, co-founder and general partner of the Korean-American venture fund Spark Labs noted, Songo is "basically a transportation lab where they are experimenting with various kinds of car sharing to bike sharing to water taxis and intelligent highways. As an example of non-American innovation, Frigstad spoke particularly highly about the work of Shai Agassi, the Israeli creator of the electric vehicle network Better Place which, he noted, is "far ahead" of anything created in the U.S. But even Better Place pales in comparison to Songo, a $35 billion Korean city of the future built from the ground up. As Steve Lefever, who heads up Frost & Sullivan's Russian office, explained, car sharing exists in Moscow but with a twist. But flying cars do actually exist. Absent from the $35 billion Korean city of the future are flying cars.
