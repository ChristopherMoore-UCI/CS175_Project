And, he pointed out, the vast majority of religious people do not have OCD. However, religion may influence whether someone with OCD experiences obsessions and compulsions related to religion, Abramowitz said. Consulting people and books isn't pathological, but in scrupulosity the behavior of checking is excessive compared to other religious people. Attempts at characterizing how many people might have this disorder, from the 1990s and early 2000s, suggested that somewhere between 5% and 33% of OCD patients have religious obsessions. In societies where religiosity is more stringent, the numbers are higher: 50% of OCD patients in Saudi Arabia and 60% in Egypt said they had religious obsessions, according to studies from the early 1990s.
