In an article published Monday, The Commercial Appeal said the 70 case files would include the FBI's investigation of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. while in Memphis in 1968 and examinations of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the NAACP, and peace and black power movements. According to Tobin, the FBI will not be required to release Withers' actual informant file but will include information Withers gathered. Withers' informant file would have information on how much Withers was paid by the FBI and likely would have instructions given to Withers about which civil rights activists the agency wanted him to gather information on. Chris Peck, editor of The Commercial Appeal, told CNN when the newspaper first reported Withers worked for the FBI, it was a "bombshell" because he was a well-respected and trusted figure in the civil rights movement. The newspaper said Withers worked as an FBI informant from 1958 to 1972.
