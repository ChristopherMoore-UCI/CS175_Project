Even those sounding the alarm over the potential politicization of Israel acknowledge that Democratic support for Israel, and Jewish support for the Democratic Party, remains strong. For years, support for Israel has been one of the few reliably bipartisan issues on Capitol Hill, with members on both sides of the aisle embracing the embattled Middle East country and welcoming its leaders with open arms. That number compensated for the steep drop in support from Democrats so that overall support for Israel among Americans remained steady. Some expressed concerns that Netanyahu's speech could also exacerbate demographic trends that suggest younger Americans may not offer as robust support for Israel as older Americans do. But when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Republican House Speaker John Boehner to address Congress on Tuesday — when he is expected to sharply criticize White House deal-making with Iran — he alienated more than the Democrat who sits in the Oval Office.
