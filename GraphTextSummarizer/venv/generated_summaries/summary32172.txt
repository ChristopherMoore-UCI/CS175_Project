The U.S. military, facing continuing protests over drone strikes, has halted military cargo shipments from Afghanistan, citing a potential risk to drivers and contractors along the route once it enters Pakistan. If the crossing does not re-open, shipments out of Afghanistan could be made by air, or longer land routes to the north, but both would be more costly in the long run. "We are aware protests have affected one of the primary commercial transit routes between Pakistan and Afghanistan. We have voluntarily halted U.S. shipments," Defense Department spokesman Mark Wright said. On average, the United States ships about 33,000 tons of cargo out of Afghanistan each month.
