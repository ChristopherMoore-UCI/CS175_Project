-- It's been one year since Fort Bragg soldier Kelli Bordeaux went missing, and there's now a reward being offered for information that could help authorities solve the mystery, according to police in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Last April, police and the military searched an area near a Fayetteville bar where Bordeaux was last seen and last used her cell phone, authorities then told CNN. Last April, Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine said that Bordeaux was described as a "very good soldier, not the type of person that would come up AWOL or missing." The Army official told CNN that police searched Bordeaux's apartment and vehicle, but the official did not know where the vehicle was found. Bordeaux's mother, Johnna Henson, said she had been told by police that an individual gave her daughter a ride to the bar, where Bordeaux sang karaoke.
