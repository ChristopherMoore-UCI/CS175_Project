He said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure Mr. Garner." London said Pantaleo had been trying to arrest "someone who was noncompliant." Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer who a New York grand jury decided not to indict in the death of Eric Garner, spoke with internal affairs investigators about the case this week. Garner died in July after Pantaleo and other officers tried to arrest Garner, who they said was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes. A cell phone video of the arrest shows Pantaleo wrapping his arm around Garner's neck. "He indicated he never used a chokehold," said Stuart London, Pantaleo's attorney.
