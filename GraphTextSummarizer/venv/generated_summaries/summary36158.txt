For 19 years, Indiana State Police searched for him, but it was last October when the missing boy case turned into one of changed identities. Some months of detective work followed and police found the grandparents, who they say admitted to assuming new names, in a town near Landers, who has been living under a name given to him by his grandparents. His paternal grandparents, reportedly angry about a custody case involving the small boy, took him and disappeared from Indiana. A spokesman with the Indiana State Police said the FBI and Social Security Administration also were investigating the case. According to a news release on the state police website, a detective was given Landers' Social Security card.
