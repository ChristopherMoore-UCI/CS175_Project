Discounts will be offered to students, seniors and other groups, and the museum will offer free general admission between 5 and 8 p.m. each Tuesday. "The 9/11 Memorial does not yet receive government support for ongoing operations as many other important museums of our national history do," Daniels said. And the fee will help balance a $63 million operating budget for 2014, said Anthony Guido, communications manager at the 9/11 memorial. But the ticket price, which was approved Thursday, will "ensure the organization's financial health" and "help fund the necessary operational costs," said a statement from Joe Daniels, the 9/11 memorial president. "It was never intended to be a revenue-generating tourist attraction with a prohibitive budget and entrance fee," Sally Regenhard, assistant chairwoman of the group 9/11 Parents and Families of Firefighters and World Trade Center Victims, said in a prepared statement.
