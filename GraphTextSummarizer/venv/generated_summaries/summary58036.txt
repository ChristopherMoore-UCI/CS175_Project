The Edenbridge society said it had considered depicting Savile, British chancellor George Osbourne or extradited Muslim cleric Abu Hamza. -- A plan to burn an effigy of Lance Armstrong -- and adorn it with references to Jimmy Savile, the British broadcaster accused of child sex offenses -- has caused outrage. Other celebrity "victims" have included former British prime minister Tony Blair, ex-French president Jacques Chirac and deceased Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The nine-meter high structure has around its neck a medal referencing Jimmy Savile, who died a year ago at the age of 84 and is now the center an investigation into hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse. Where once the November 5 ritual of burning effigies reflected political turmoil and dissension among the population, now it has become a family event controlled by strict rules and regulations -- but one where the wry British sense of mischief still emerges, making targets of establishment figures.
