Bill Gortney told reporters Sunday. -- Efforts to protect ships from pirates in the waters off Somalia's east coast face a tremendous challenge: "It will certainly take hard work and money and focus," he said, "but we've got to stop it or we begin to risk lives in areas of the world that are vital for national security." He noted that while Phillips' story had a happy ending, more than 200 mariners remain captives at sea, and called on the international community to beef up security in the waters by arming crews, increasing warships and reducing the ability of Somalis to obtain ships from coastal safehavens.
