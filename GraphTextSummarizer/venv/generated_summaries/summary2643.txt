In other words, a lot more than the price of the book. Stutzman, who is a former deputy chief of staff for former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said he was duped into reading Armstrong's book, drawn in by the cyclist's compelling life story.

Stutzman is part of a class-action lawsuit against Armstrong and his book publishers accusing them of peddling fiction as fact. After years of vehemently denying that he used drugs to boost his performance during his record seven Tour de France wins, Armstrong confessed to Oprah Winfrey last week that he lied. Joining Stutzman is a Sacramento chef and cycling enthusiast, Jonathan Wheeler, who says he too was moved and inspired by the Armstrong book.
