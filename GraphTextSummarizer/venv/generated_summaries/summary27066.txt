Or because you want to satisfy yourself that you're cleverer than the latest "celebrity charlatan?" Grayson Perry, one of Britain's leading contemporary artists, is under no illusion as to why people go to museums -- the first piece in his new show at the British Museum is, he admits, "me getting my revenge in first." " The British Museum has been a place of pilgrimage for Perry since he was a child -- though he admits to a sense of disappointment on his first visit, because the model boats in the Egyptian collection were not as shiny and new as the cars he played with at home. Cheeky, yes, and full of Perry's quirky sense of fun, but like the rest of the "Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman" exhibition, it is also a love letter to museums and galleries in general -- and to one in particular: The British Museum. "The tool that begat all tools," Perry says, describing the "incredibly powerful, visceral moment" when one of the museum's curators handed him a box filled with ancient stone tools, and invited him to pick one up, cementing his links with the first craftsmen who created them. As MacGregor points out, Perry is not the first to find inspiration in the museum's historic galleries -- but he has taken it further than anyone else.
