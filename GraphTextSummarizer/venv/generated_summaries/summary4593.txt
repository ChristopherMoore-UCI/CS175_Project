For a time, all homes in Florida were required to have sinkhole coverage. Florida is failing its citizens in sinkhole science and policy. Hundreds of sinkholes form every year in Florida. Florida has lax building standards when it comes to sinkholes. If you travel across Florida, you will see many billboards advertising legal services to those who are impacted by sinkholes and want what they feel is just compensation.
