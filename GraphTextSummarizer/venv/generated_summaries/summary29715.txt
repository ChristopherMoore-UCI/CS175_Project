The removal comes after an investigation by Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper, which reported that a uniform and a pair of shoes purportedly belonging to concentration camp victims and yellow Star of David armbands were among items offered on the site. A spokesman for eBay said Sunday that the company has removed items described as Holocaust memorabilia from its online auction site. "We don't allow listings of this nature, and dedicate thousands of staff to policing our site and use the latest technology to detect items that shouldn't be for sale. The site generally makes 10% of the final sale price of item, in addition to possible listing fees. "The company did the right thing by removing the items and apologizing."
