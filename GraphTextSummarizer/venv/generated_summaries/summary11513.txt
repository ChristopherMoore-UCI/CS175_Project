But Marci Solomon is hoping she'll be the one laughing -- all the way to the bank -- when her Geo Metro saves her from skyrocketing gas prices. See how the Geo Metro stacks up with the Toyota Prius Â» Solomon toyed with the idea of purchasing a Prius but decided that for a price of $7,300, the Metro was the more economical option. "Gas prices are definitely driving increased popularity in the Metro, which at times wasn't cool," he said. Solomon, like many others, was taking a huge hit when it came to gas prices. The Metro has been making a huge comeback, especially on eBay, where Solomon bought the car, because of its extremely high gas mileage.
