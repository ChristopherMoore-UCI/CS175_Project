A Utah judge appointed Jeffs to control the estate while he decides a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray. "The proceeding was conducted in accordance with Mr. Coleman's desires as expressed in his will, that no funeral service, wake, or other ceremony memorialize his passing," attorney Robert Jeffs said Thursday. It is expected to take Utah District Judge James Taylor several months to hold a trial to decide which document is Coleman's last legal will. Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage at the Provo, Utah, hospital. A will signed by Coleman in 2005 named Gray as executor and awarded all of his estate to the Portland, Oregon, woman.
