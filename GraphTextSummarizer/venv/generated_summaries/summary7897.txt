Earlier, the security official had told CNN that two attackers were killed in the attack on the compound in the town of Sukkur, in Sindh province, but that number conflicted with additional reporting CNN has gathered. In addition to housing Pakistani security offices, it also includes judges' homes and police housing. "It seems the blasts were targeting the Barrage Colony compound where the ISI offices are," said Deputy Inspector General in Sukkur Javed Odho, referring to Pakistan's intelligence agency. -- At least seven people are dead after assailants attacked a compound housing senior government officials, including those of the Pakistani intelligence services, a first responder and a security official told CNN Wednesday. Mohammed Urif, in charge of ambulance services, said rescuers have transported 35 to 40 injured people to nearby hospitals.
