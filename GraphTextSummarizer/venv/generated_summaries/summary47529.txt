File image of armed MEND militants in Niger Delta region of Nigeria The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in an e-mail message to reporters that the "major Shell and Agip crude trunk lines in Bayelsa state" were struck. "The Agip pipeline which connects the Agip Brass terminal was sabotaged at Nembe creek while the Shell Nembe creek line was done at Asawo village," MEND said. A Nigerian militant group claimed Wednesday it sabotaged oil pipelines in the country's oil-rich southern Niger Delta, but the country's military denies the assertion. Under the amnesty proposal, militants must hand in their weapons and take part in government rehabilitation programs. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rain forest, the UNDP says.
