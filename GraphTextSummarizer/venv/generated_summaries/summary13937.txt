But the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks renewed calls for increased domestic intelligence to prevent future attacks. In one, a new agency would be created using intelligence agencies from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and intelligence community. After the attacks, the FBI moved to transform its primary mission from law enforcement to counterterrorism intelligence and prevention. The RAND Corporation said one option would be for domestic intelligence to operate under the FBI. " "Public demand for domestic intelligence is driven by the perceived threat, and those perceptions can change much more rapidly than the threat itself," the report says.
