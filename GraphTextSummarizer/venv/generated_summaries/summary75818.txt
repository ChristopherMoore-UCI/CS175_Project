During the trial, prosecutors argued that Ray's recklessness caused the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota. Ray and his attorneys asked for probation, but Judge Warren R. Darrow said the evidence shows "extreme negligence on the part of Mr. Ray. Ray tearfully told the court that he has "no excuse" for what happened that October day or since. Ray asked Darrow to sentence him to probation, saying he is no threat to society and promising never to conduct another sweat lodge ceremony again. Before Darrow announced his judgment, prosecutor Sheila Polk characterized Ray as a dangerous "pretender" who had cast himself as a victim of an overzealous prosecution.
