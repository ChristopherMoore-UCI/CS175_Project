Shoebat said the major group, the Forum for Middle East Understanding, includes his own Walid Shoebat Foundation. Shoebat warned that making special accommodations for Muslim beliefs was a step toward establishing Islamic religious law. -- Walid Shoebat had a blunt message for the roughly 300 South Dakota police officers and sheriff's deputies who gathered to hear him warn about the dangers of Islamic radicalism. He warned the police and first responders gathered in the hotel conference rooms that the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah had operatives working in Mexico and that drug cartels were raising money with Islamic groups. Shoebat spoke at a 2010 conference in South Dakota and was so well-received that he was invited back for the May event in Rapid City, according to state officials.
