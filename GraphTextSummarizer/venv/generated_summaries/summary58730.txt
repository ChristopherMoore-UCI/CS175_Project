Though Morsi had previously argued for banning women from the presidency, he said before the election that as president he would stand for women's rights. "The role of women in Egyptian society is clear," Morsi told CNN weeks before the runoff election. Morsi moved into his offices Monday, said Jihad Haddad, an adviser to the transition team. "For the first time in Egyptian history -- not just modern but in all Egyptian history -- a woman will take that position," Ahmed Deif told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday. -- Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, will appoint a woman as one of his vice presidents and a Christian as another, his policy adviser told CNN.
