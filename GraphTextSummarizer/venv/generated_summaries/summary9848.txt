It was decided that the season would continue but the league has been scarred by the upsurge of football violence between the competing ultra groups, as well as the purging of Mubarak supporters from the Egyptian Football Association, including the country's most successful national coach, Hassan Shehata. "F*** the mother of Hosni Mubarak!" shouted Assad, the leader of Al Ahly's militant ultra group Al Ahlawy, at the police in front of him. But would the old rivalry with Al Ahly return? But Mubarak and Al Adly -- the former Minister of the Interior and the man formally in charge of Egypt's hated police force -- were now under arrest. Traditionally it has been one of the most violent derbies in world football, with the match -- which ended in a 2-2 draw -- taking place at the neutral Cairo International Stadium under heavy police guard.
