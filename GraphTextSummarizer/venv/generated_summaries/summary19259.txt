But that hasn't stopped Dutch teenager Max Verstappen climbing behind the wheel of a Formula One car to make history Friday during practice for this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix and become the youngest driver to participate in the sport. Next season, Verstappen will be a full-time racer for Toro Rosso, which has historically been a stepping stone towards a drive with the hugely successful Red Bull Racing team. "I have to thank Red Bull and Scuderia Toro Rosso for giving me the possibility to be in the car already this year on Fridays and get well prepared for next year. The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, Max completed 22 laps of the Suzuka Circuit before engine failure brought his big day to a premature end. "The car is bigger compared to the one I'm used to in Formula 3 and there are a lot more things to think about while you're driving, so I had to use some laps to get confident with such a different car," added Verstappen.
