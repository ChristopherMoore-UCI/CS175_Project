Thanks to the Obama campaign, new activists aren't going to be as easily attracted by witty aphorisms and wordplays as previous demographics were. Rachel Motte says Rush Limbaugh still can animate conservative popular opinion. One thing is likely -- the next big conservative leaders who do resonate well with the age group that favors Obama will cite Rush as a major influence. That's going to change the way young people all over will approach the political process; after all, 66 percent of the 29-and-under crowd voted for Obama. Rush doesn't need to be removed as leader of the Republican Party, because he's never held that position, much as Democrats would like you to think he has.
