Texas has suffered its worst fire season in state history with more than 3.5 million acres burned, according to state officials. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is battling a large grass fire in the marshlands of Jefferson County, Texas, an agency official told CNN on Tuesday. The dry spell that began in 2010 was the worst the state has seen since 1895, Texas Lt He estimated the area burned by Tuesday afternoon to be between 10,000 and 12,000 acres, but he said the fire was not threatening any structures. An unusual La Nina weather pattern led to a nearly 11-month fire season in the state, fire service spokeswoman April Saginor said.
