Currently, marijuana dispensaries are selling recreational pot products that contain up to 100 milligrams of THC in a single candy bar. With edibles, it takes longer to feel the effects of THC, marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, which can lead people to eat too much, then being hit hard by serious side effects that include delirium and psychosis. Serious concerns over marijuana edibles have surfaced since Colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use. It's part of a public education campaign launched Wednesday by the marijuana advocacy group, Marijuana Policy Project, urging adults to consume pot responsibly in states where marijuana is legal. Colorado state regulators are looking into stricter requirements for marijuana edible manufacturers that include better labeling and limiting each package to a single dose, about 10 milligrams of THC.
