If working women and men across this country want to see fairness returned to the American workplace, they should reach out to their elected officials and put pressure on them to support the Paycheck Fairness Act. No company should fear the truth about their own pay practices if they are doing the right thing, and the Republican Party should not protect corporate profit margins at the expense of American families. The Paycheck Fairness Act shouldn't be a partisan issue, and few stories make this clearer than that of my client Terri Kelly. Although my firm was able to prove that Kelly -- along with a class of thousands of other women -- were underpaid in a discriminatory way, winning that case took almost seven years, with more than 60 lawyers and staff working about 37,000 hours and spending more than $2 million in out-of-pocket expenses. The lack of transparency and accountability surrounding compensation continually confounds working women.
