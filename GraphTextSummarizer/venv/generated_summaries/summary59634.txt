Lohan, whose offenses included two drunken driving convictions, and Brown, who pleaded guilty to beating girlfriend Rihanna, got probation, community labor and court-ordered counseling. Their entertainment careers have been stunted since their 20th birthdays by repeated probation violations that led to stints in rehab, months of additional community labor, frequent trips to court and occasional days behind bars. Brown's lesson for Bieber Chris Brown got glowing probation reports the first two years after he pleaded guilty to felony assault in August 2009. The "Baby" singer faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license after a traffic stop in Miami Beach, Florida, and an assault charge for allegedly hitting his limousine driver in Toronto. Probation gone bad A lesson for Bieber might be that even if those first crimes don't bring jail time, breaking probation rules can get you locked up.
