But if transporting the dog across the country proved too expensive, Ley wanted a close friend to take charge of Bela and carry out her request that "the dog be put to sleep, cremated and that the dog's ashes be placed with her own ashes." "On the whole, we don't allow people to euthanize healthy pets," said Edward Queen, a professor of ethics at Emory University. Ley's attorney, Doug Denmure, told CNN affiliate WCPO-TV that his late client preferred to send Bela to Best Friends Animal Society's no-kill sanctuary in southern Utah to live out the remainder of his days. Bela was with Ley when she died at home November 25. Meanwhile, animal lovers on Facebook and Twitter are urging that Bela be spared, calling Ley's decision selfish.
