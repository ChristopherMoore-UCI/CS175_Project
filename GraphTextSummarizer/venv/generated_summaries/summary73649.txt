State courts generally hear probate cases, while bankruptcy proceedings are confined to federal courts. The justices decided whether Smith's estate received a proper hearing in federal courts, and whether state probate courts should be the proper venue for hearing such cases. Smith had made several personal-injury allegations against Pierce Marshall -- who died in 2006 -- during the bitter bankruptcy hearings. His will left nearly all assets and trust to his son from a previous marriage, E. Pierce Marshall, and Smith received virtually nothing. "A constitutionally required game of jurisdictional ping-pong between courts would lead to inefficiency, increased cost, delay, and needless additional suffering among those faced with bankruptcy," he said.
