Atleti struggled to break down their well-organized opponents all night and had to withstand a period of Elche pressure before Costa sealed victory in the 90th minute. Referee Carlos Clos Gomez pointed to the spot but David Villa couldn't convert as he fired weakly at Elche keeper Manu Herrera. -- Atletico Madrid overcame struggling Elche at the Vincente Calderon on Friday and moved a step closer to the club's first La Liga title in 18 years.
