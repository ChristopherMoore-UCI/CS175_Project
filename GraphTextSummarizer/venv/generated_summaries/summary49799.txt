A group of Iranian protesters, opposed to dialog with the United States, were at Tehran's airport where Rouhani supporters had also gathered to welcome the president home, Fararu said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's arrival in Tehran Saturday was marked by an incident during which a shoe was thrown by a protester in his direction, Iran's semi-official Fararu news agency said. Rouhani, who was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, spoke by telephone Friday with U.S. President Barack Obama -- the first direct conversation between leaders in Washington and Tehran since 1979. Western leaders believe the country's nuclear program is designed to produce weapons. Rouhani's recent comments have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the Iran's controversial nuclear program.
