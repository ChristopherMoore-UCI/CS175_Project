"The bombing was carried out to (avenge) the killing of Maulana Waliur Rehman, commander of TTP South Waziristan, who was killed on May 29, 2013, in a U.S. drone strike in Miranshah," TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said. Senior leader Azam Tariq, appearing alongside spokesman Shahidullah Shahid, claimed that the TTP has "always been conducive to talks but that the media has been twisting the TTP's stance in a negative light." Despite the violence, the TTP on Sunday called for fresh talks with the Pakistani government, in a news conference recorded by its media wing. The pair said that continuing talks was "not in the hands of the TTP but in that of the Pakistani government." "It is the Pakistani government on the order of the United States that started the war on the homes of the TTP and it is only the Pakistani government that can stop this war," said Tariq. In the wake of the attack, which he strongly condemned, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he was canceling a planned trip to Davos, Switzerland.
