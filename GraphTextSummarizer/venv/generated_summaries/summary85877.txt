Rubicon was News Corp's codename for its Â£7 billion bid for the UK's biggest commercial broadcaster, BSkyB. News Corp abandoned the bid amid the furor over phone hacking allegations. Jurors were shown an email from Simon Greenberg, director of corporate affairs at News International, News Corp's UK newspaper arm, to Brooks and another executive in early June 2011. News of the World closed in July 2011, amid public revulsion at the hacking of a missing 13-year-old, Milly Dowler. A Metropolitan Police detective, Steven Fitzgerald, told the trial that in the two years before the police pounced on the operation in August 2006, News of the World's private detective, Glenn Mulcaire, and journalists made 6,813 calls to 281 unique voicemail numbers, or UVNs. The prosecution suggested the closeness of that relationship meant Brooks must have known about phone hacking when her lover was editing the paper -- which she denied.
