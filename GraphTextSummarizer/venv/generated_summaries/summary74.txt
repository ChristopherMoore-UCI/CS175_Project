But Rajab and other activists say the photographs of Saqer show he was tortured and killed while in police custody. Rajab, who was arrested last month, said that the government is engaged in a campaign of intimidation against him and other activists. In a statement on its website, Bahrain's Interior Ministry said the photograph Rajab published is different from the one taken in the presence of a medical examiner after Saqer's death. Nabeel Rajab published on his Facebook page images of a man identified as Ali Isa Saqer. While reporting the story, the CNN team was detained by security forces in the street outside Rajab's house.
