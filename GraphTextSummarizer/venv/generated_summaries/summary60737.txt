What is known is that the container they were in arrived to Tilbury -- located on the River Thames about 30 miles east of London -- aboard a ship owned by P&O Ferries at 6 a.m. (1 a.m. ET) from the Belgian port city of Zeebrugge after a nearly nine-hour trip. Company spokeswoman Natalie Hardy told CNN that P&O Ferries operates two such trips a day between London and Zeebrugge. One of them, an adult male, was declared dead at the scene, according to Essex police Superintendent Trevor Roe. -- Dockworkers at a major London port discovered 35 people inside a shipping container Saturday morning. 'Screaming and Banging' Workers at Tilbury Docks made the discovery after "screaming and banging was heard from inside the container," Roe said.
