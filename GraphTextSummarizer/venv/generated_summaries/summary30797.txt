The two girls became friends, according to SAPA, and eventually, Morne Nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter's new friend. The second daughter, who was born four years after Zephany was kidnapped, started eighth grade at a Cape Town school this year, according to SAPA. The Nurses have been allowed to visit Zephany for short periods, South African media reported. She is being called Zephany Nurse, though it is not the name with which the 17-year-old South African girl grew up. South African Police have been mostly quiet about the case.
