"I used to take vitamin supplements, but changed to the IV drip because I feel the effects more quickly," a 20-something woman at the Tenteki 10 Caf√© told CNN. In trendy neighborhoods of Tokyo customers are lining up for vitamin injections that promise to improve health and beauty. They can't take a break from working and get the vitamin drip for an extra kick of energy," a Tenteki nurse told CNN. "Blue" is the most requested vitamin pack among these men: a concoction of B1 and vitamin E that claims to offer relief from exhaustion. She said she receives specific injections to get better skin, burn fat and boost her energy.
