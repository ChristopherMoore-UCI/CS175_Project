In Baltimore this year -- just like last year and just like next year -- police will arrest tens of thousands of poor black men, mostly on drug charges. The protests started in response to the death of Freddie Gray in police hands. And police will never solve the problems of absent parents, mass incarceration, or a violence culture centered around the economics of drug prohibition. Here's the thing: Police officers who weren't there don't know what happened to Freddie Gray. But those who caused destruction on Monday had little, if anything, to do with Freddie Gray protests.
