Back in the United States, Obama leads McCain by a much smaller margin: 47 percent to 41 percent, according to CNN's latest "poll of polls. "What that means, of course, is that the 'CBS Evening News,' 'NBC Nightly News' and ABC's 'World News' will be broadcast from Europe and the Middle East this week, throwing an even brighter spotlight on Barack's [Obama's] excellent adventure," said Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's "Reliable Sources." McCain, however, was met by zero anchors on his foreign trips since he became the presumptive Republican nominee, Kurtz pointed out. A recent poll from Britain's Guardian newspaper and ICM Research suggests that Obama is five times as popular as McCain there. Conducted this month, the poll indicates that 53 percent think Obama would make the better president, compared with 11 percent for McCain. The novelty of Obama's trip increases the media attention because the storyline is more interesting, according to Michael Crowley, senior editor of The New Republic.
