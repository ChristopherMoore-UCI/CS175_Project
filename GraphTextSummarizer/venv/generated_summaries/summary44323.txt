" That's the verdict of FIFA vice president Jeffrey Webb, ahead of a meeting of the governing body's executive committee in Marrakech next week. "I support the publishing of the Garcia Report, appropriately redacting to respect prior witness confidentiality agreements," added Webb, referring to Michael Garcia, the American lawyer who investigated the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process for FIFA. -- Bedevilled by a series of corruption scandals, football's world governing body FIFA has come to an "historical crossroad. His remarks came just before the Dutch Football Association demanded FIFA hand over a copy of the report, while Greg Dyke, chairman of the English Football Association warned that "urgent action" must be taken to restore confidence in the world governing body. Earlier this year, Marco Villiger, FIFA's legal director, told reporters that it would be difficult to sustain witness confidentiality if the report was published.
