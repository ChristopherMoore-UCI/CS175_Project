"This kind of genetic screening is going to be one way forward to predict who is at high risk," said Dr. John Mann, a psychiatrist and neurochemist at Columbia University Medical Center. "With a test like ours, we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe," said the study's lead author, Zachary Kaminsky, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine. In a new small study, researchers were able to predict who had experienced suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide just by looking at their blood. Kaminsky and his colleagues ran tests on samples of blood, looking for an increase of certain chemicals on a gene called SKA2 that seems to help the brain regulate stress. "If someone is really committed to committing suicide, they may choose to lie," Kaminsky said.
