According to a report by Secret Service agents who were watching Hinckley without his knowledge, on one outing last July, Hinckley did not attend a movie and instead went to a bookstore where he passed by an aisle of books that included an account of the day Reagan was shot. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy, and police officer Thomas Delahanty. " Sims often spends time in Williamsburg when Hinckley is there and drives him back to St. Elizabeths. The doctors signing the report said such leave would be permitted only upon an assessment, at the end of the new visits, that "Mr. Hinckley is experiencing a good mental status and that he does not present as [sic] a danger to himself or others. Sims was asked if she ever noticed Secret Service agents keeping an eye on Hinckley.
