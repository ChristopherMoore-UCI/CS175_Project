Cheney huddled with House Republicans, saying Obama wasn't prepared for the terrorist threat posed by the group and urging the GOP to support a more muscular national defense, House GOP members told CNN. -- A day before President Barack Obama lays out his strategy to counter the ISIS terror threat, House Republicans sought the counsel of Dick Cheney, a key architect of the Iraq War. A press release about Cheney's speech at the American Enterprise Institute is titled "9/11 and the future of U.S. foreign policy." Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, summed up Cheney's advice to GOP members about the November elections: "Keep the eye on the safety and security of the country." Cheney was there to boost enthusiasm among rank-and-file members, but he also told House Republicans that the party needs to rebuild the military and focus its public message this fall on the importance of a strong national security policy. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, said the pitch to highlight national security was received positively by rank-and-file members, but he also admitted that the cost to boost the U.S. forces would be "significant." Terror fears could help GOP in midterms Kinzinger told CNN he shared Cheney's concerns about declining military readiness.
