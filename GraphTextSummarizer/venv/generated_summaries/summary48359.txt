"The significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients," said Dr. Steven Katznelson. Jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills, creating MatchGrid, a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly. "Where there had been only three or four options, with the inclusion of the altruistic donor, we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients. "The ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs, one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair," the medical center said in a statement. They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients.
