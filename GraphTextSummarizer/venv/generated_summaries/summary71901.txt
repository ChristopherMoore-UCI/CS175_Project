"It means there's nothing stopping them and the native wildlife are in trouble." Pythons wiping out mammals in Everglades, researchers say Everglades National Park and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are working with other agencies on the problem of the Burmese python, a non-native but established species in Florida that is one of the deadliest and most competitive predators in the southern part of the state, according to the university. The snakes have no known predator, and population estimates range from the thousands to hundreds of thousands. There are state laws now that prohibit people from owning Burmese pythons as pets or taking them across state lines without a federal permit. Previous records for Burmese pythons captured in the wild were 16.8 feet long and 85 eggs. -- University of Florida researchers examining the carcass of a large, pregnant Burmese python said Monday they found a record 87 eggs inside, giving them important clues about the reproductive capability of the dangerous, invasive species.
