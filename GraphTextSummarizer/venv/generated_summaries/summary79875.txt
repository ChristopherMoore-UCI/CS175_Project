Unlike England, where investment decisions are made by the city in conjunction with the national government, when it comes to infrastructure we've got a bundle of intermediary state agencies and regulators deciding what's best for the city and how much investment it deserves -- and a bunch of state politicians circumscribing their ability to do so at every turn. For a start, infrastructure investment here is no more a priority than it is in other places across the country: It's simply not something that voters want badly. The press was full of reports about the condition of our nation's bridges, and Washington was abuzz with new ideas for financing roadway infrastructure. No one should stand behind age as an excuse for vulnerability in infrastructure. The problems in New York stem from many factors.
