The FBI says it has increased convictions of securities and commodities fraud, health care fraud, mortgage fraud, insurance fraud, and money laundering. At an FBI headquarters briefing on the stepped-up fight against financial misdealings, the bureau proudly showed a 30-second public service announcement featuring actor Michael Douglas. A new report issued Monday by the FBI shows that in the last fiscal year, FBI investigations led to 242 indictments and 241 convictions of corporate criminals. But in a new message to help the FBI, Douglas says, "The movie is fiction, but the problem is real." Douglas asks viewers who suspect financial crime to contact the FBI. The FBI on Monday unveiled a videotaped message from the actor who played the infamous fictional insider trader Gordon Gekko to help bolster a wide-ranging attack on financial crimes.
