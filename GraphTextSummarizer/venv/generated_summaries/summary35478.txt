"It's a welcome development, but we are continuing to do our normal assignment of maintaining law and order," said Col. Rabe Abubakar, a spokesman for Nigeria's military. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says. The militants have claimed attacks in recent years on oil platforms, chemical tankers, and oil pipelines. Before the cease-fire, MEND destroyed oil pipelines in Lagos during a night raid on Monday. The militant group MEND said seven military joint task force gun boats with heavily armed troops were headed toward a camp near the border of the coastal states of Delta and Ondo.
