"We always knew there was a reason that 'Thompson' signed his name as 'Mr. X' and did not want to be identified," U.S. Marshal Pete Elliott said Monday. "I happened to be a little bored that Friday afternoon," Elliott said Monday. Cody, now 65, disappeared in 1984 as IRS agents were investigating him in a case that led to his indictment in 1987 on four counts, including making false statements to an investment brokerage firm, taking stolen funds across state lines and lying on a loan application, according to court documents. When U.S. marshals arrested "Bobby Thompson" five months ago, they said they knew he was using a fake name. But time and technology caught up with Cody when Elliott opened his web browser and began a series of Google searches.
