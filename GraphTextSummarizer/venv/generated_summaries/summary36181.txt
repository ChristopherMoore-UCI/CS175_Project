While some laid-off workers may get health insurance coverage though a spouse or partner, their research suggests that only about 14 percent of people who are not eligible for COBRA could get coverage through a partner or some other source after losing their job, she says. (COBRA only covers workers in companies that offer health insurance, have 20 or more employees, and are still in business.) That means that health insurance costs dramatically escalate at a time when people have little or no money to burn. "One of the biggest challenges to health care coverage reform has been that the status quo is okay for many people, particularly for many people who vote," she says. "So it's pretty urgent that the economic stimulus bill not only address the job situation, but address health insurance coverage too," she says.
