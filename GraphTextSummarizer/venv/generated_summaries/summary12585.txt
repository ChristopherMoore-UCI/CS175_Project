After she graduated, Washburn joined the Army and went to Afghanistan, where near the end of her first tour she helped deliver a baby during a snowstorm while communicating with medical personnel by radio. But she loved Philadelphia from her visits there and applied for an Army ROTC scholarship at Drexel University. The Bronze Star recipient served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, including one as a member of the Army's new Cultural Support Program. Rachel Washburn, 25, said she learned during her Army training to think of a happy place when confronted by stress. For that, she liked to think of her first game as an Eagles cheerleader.
