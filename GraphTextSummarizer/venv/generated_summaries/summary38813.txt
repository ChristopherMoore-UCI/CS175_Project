An Alaska Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing Monday after its pilot reported hearing unusual banging. The agent, who is an employee of Alaska contractor Menzies Aviation, told authorities he had fallen asleep, the statement said. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, said Alaska Airlines. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes, Alaska Airlines said. He passed a drug test and was discharged, Alaska Airlines said.
