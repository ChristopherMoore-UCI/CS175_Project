Amid Iranian tensions, Iraq seeks alternative oil routes A Pentagon official insisted all active duty U.S. troops have been accounted for and no civilian was recently reported missing, and even the man's ex-wife said she didn't know he had been kidnapped. The statement described Hultz as a "private citizen" who was in Iraq "on private business," and "not an employee or contractor of the U.S. government." During the news conference, the lawmakers produced what appeared to be the man's U.S. military identification card and U.S. contractor ID card. A U.S. official, who had knowledge of the man and had seen the video from the al-Sadr-linked militia, identified the man as Rand Michael Hultz -- a former Army soldier who served in Iraq shortly after the 2003 invasion and later returned as an "entrepreneur. Another U.S. official with knowledge of Hultz, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he returned to Iraq in 2006 as a civilian contractor.
