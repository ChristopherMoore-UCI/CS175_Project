Watch Sankurathri talk about the school he started in memory of his family Â» The same buses that pick up students for Sankurathri's school in the morning are often used later in the day to bring eye care patients from other rural areas to the Srikiran Institute of Ophthalmology, Sankurathri's eye hospital, named for the 7-year-old son he lost. Sankurathri's wife and two young children were flying on Air India Flight 182 from Ottawa, Canada, to Bombay, India (now known as Mumbai), in 1985 when a bomb exploded, killing everyone on board. "India has so many problems," says Sankurathri, 64. Sankurathri has been back in India for almost 20 years. Sankurathri keeps in touch with past students.
