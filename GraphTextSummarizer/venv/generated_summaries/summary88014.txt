Clinton has long been an avid sports fan and has remarked in the past that he watched more games while his wife, Hillary Clinton, was traveling for work as secretary of state. While in the White House, Clinton also had the opportunity -- as all presidents do -- to congratulate and meet championship teams from the major U.S. sports leagues, something, he said, he "really, really enjoyed. Bill Clinton has had a number of glory days since he played church league basketball in Arkansas. Clinton called into the Mike & Mike show on ESPN Radio to talk about Humana Challenge PGA Tour event this weekend in California. I loved it." Clinton was also an avid golfer in the White House and recently took to defending President Barack Obama against heat he occasionally takes for golfing.
