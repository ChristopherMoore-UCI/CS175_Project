Qadri confessed to assassinating Taseer because "he did blasphemy of the Prophet Mohammed," Naeem Iqbal, spokesman for Islamabad police, said Tuesday. The Pakistan People's Party, the nation's ruling party, said it would observe two weeks of mourning over Taseer's death, according to GEO TV Pakistan. Qadri told police Taseer had described the blasphemy law as "the black laws." A spotlight was put on Pakistan's controversial law in November when a Christian woman, Asia Bibi of Punjab province, was sentenced to death for blasphemy. He is accused of killing Gov. Salman Taseer on Tuesday, allegedly because the governor had spoken out against the country's controversial blasphemy law.
