But a controversial penalty decision in injury time handed Equatorial Guinea a lifeline. Spain-born striker Javier Balboa, who was once on Real Madrid's books, scored and sent the game into extra time and towards an ecstatic, and violent, conclusion. The referee again awarded a controversial free kick in the first half of extra time but there was nothing controversial about what happened next. Equatorial Guinea stunned Tunisia by coming from behind to secure a famous, unexpected and bad tempered 2-1 victory and reach the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Equatorial Guinea were one of the lowest ranked teams in the Africa Cup of Nations.
