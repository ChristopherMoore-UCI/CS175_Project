Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around £11 billion," said Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the committee. A new tender process opened in December last year with interested parties required to submit full bids by March 23 2012. Hodge said that the committee were "particularly concerned" with the rise in cost of security for the Games which has doubled from the 2010 estimate of £282 million ($442 million) to over £550 million ($862 million) by December 2011. The Olympics and Paralympic Games get underway on July 27 and August 29 respectively. The London Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) early estimate of a need for 10,000 security guards has now jumped to 23,700.
