The officials said there are reports of some civilian casualties in Wednesday's fighting -- which has been concentrated in Swat's district capital of Mingora -- but they denied local media reports that 35 civilians died. Pakistan's military is pounding Taliban targets in the country's Swat Valley, trying to clear militants who control parts of the district's main city, military officials said. Fighting continues in those two districts, and the operations are "progressing smoothly," the military said Wednesday. An estimated 40,000 people have fled Mingora, according to Khushhal Khan, district coordination officer. Taliban militants have laid siege to Mingora, looting banks, attacking army headquarters, the police station, and the main power grid station, the officials said.
