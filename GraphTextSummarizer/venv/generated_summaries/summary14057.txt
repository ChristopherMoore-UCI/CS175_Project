Google Glass will help fight the antisocial and "emasculating" habit of compulsive smartphone checking, Google co-founder Sergey Brin said in a surprise appearance at the TED Conference Wednesday. Opinion: Why life through Google Glass should be for our eyes only Brin also said Glass helps advance a longstanding dream of his to let users receive highly relevant information without actually having to run searches. In his 10-minute TED talk, Brin didn't provide concrete new details on Glass, a cross between a smartphone and a pair of glasses. In contrast to a smartphone, Google Glass allows people to keep their head up as digital information is overlaid onto their world, no matter where their gaze is pointed. "My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all â€” the information would just come to you as you needed it," Brin said.
