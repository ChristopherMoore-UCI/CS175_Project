Several timber backdrops at the range were partially or completely burned, but because the facility sits in wetlands next to a lagoon, the fires weren't a threat to Naval Base Ventura County at Point Mugu, said spokeswoman Kimberly Gearhart. Authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation Friday for the affluent Ventura County community of Hidden Valley, northwest of Los Angeles. "The sheriff said they would come pounding on the door if they came close," said Ventura County resident Elizabeth Dickenson. Many Ventura County residents, especially those who live in or near the mountains, were on edge about the fires and possible evacuation. The Los Angeles area fire, based in Ventura County, has damaged 15 residences and five commercial properties and has destroyed 25 outbuildings, fire authorities said.
