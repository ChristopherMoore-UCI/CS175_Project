She was taken first to Indiana's St. Vincent Salem Hospital before being flown about 35 miles southeast to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, according to Brian Rublein, a spokesman for Kosair. As of Saturday evening, authorities were reporting that at least 37 people had died as a result of the severe weather, including 18 in Kentucky and 14 in Indiana. Adams said that the boy's whereabouts have been unknown since twisters ravaged his Indiana town, destroying its high school, knocking down trees and tearing roofs off buildings. With lights knocked out throughout the region due to the potent storm, authorities were using thermal imaging and search dogs in an attempt to locate the boy, according to Adams. "She is in critical condition," Rublein said Saturday night.
