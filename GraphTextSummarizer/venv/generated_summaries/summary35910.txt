As of Friday, it has been 100 days since Apple co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs passed the company torch to Tim Cook. Jobs recruited Cook from Compaq Computer in 1998 to run Apple's operations. Cook had promised in a recent e-mail to his staff that Apple wouldn't change under his leadership, but he introduced at least one corporate program that would have been out of character for Jobs. "Steve made our world a better place," Cook said at the Apple memorial for Jobs. Since that first day, August 24, Wall Street and legions of Apple fans have had their gazes fixed on Cook.
