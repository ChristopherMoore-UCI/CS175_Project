The National Weather Service has issued beach hazard and high surf warnings from more than 100 miles north of L.A. down to the border of Mexico. The dangers "There is the potential for damaging and life threatening surf," says the National Weather Service, which predicts waves breaking at heights of 10 to 15 feet. He said many of the surfers off Malibu Surfrider Beach were not used to waves as big as the ones this week. But even at that distance, Marie's counterclockwise swirl is still washing waves up the California coastline. One person died in the water Tuesday night, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Scott Miller said, but it was unclear whether the death was directly related to the tumultuous surf.
