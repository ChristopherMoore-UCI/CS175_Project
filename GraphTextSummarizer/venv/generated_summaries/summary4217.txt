The suspect was arrested on Tuesday at the IFEMA fairgrounds by plainclothes police officers as he was about to receive a backpack and a green shirt worn by volunteers, said the spokesman, Rafa Rubio, the communications director for World Youth Day, told CNN. But others in Spain say there are substantial hidden public costs, including the 10,000 police officers on duty for security, the use of the Cuatro Vientos military air base for Mass, and a discount for visiting Catholic youth on the city's metro, at the same time as regular metro fares have risen sharply. Rubio said the suspect, age 24, had completed the process to become a volunteer for World Youth Day and he added that the arresting officers at the volunteer check-in area were so discreet that many in the World Youth Day organization were not aware of what had happened until hours later. "World Youth Day rejects all violence. " World Youth Day has 30,000 volunteers, many of them from outside of Spain.
