The Colorado state transportation agency reported other closures Monday afternoon along I-70 from the same weather system. According to the National Weather Service, scattered snow showers in Vail -- home to one of the nation's best-known ski areas -- were expected to linger into Monday evening. -- A 30-car accident and bad weather caused the closure Monday of Interstate 70 in and around Vail, Colorado, a state transportation spokeswoman said. By 7 p.m., all parts of the highway in Colorado had reopened, according to the state Department of Transportation's website. That includes a stretch of eastbound I-70 northeast of Vail, between Frisco and Silverthorne, and a longer westbound part of the highway between Georgetown and Silverthorne because of "multiple accidents."
