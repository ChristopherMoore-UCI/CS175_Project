Before he was Jihadi John, he was little John -- a young version of the same Mohammed Emwazi who authorities say later became the English-speaking face of ISIS terror. More than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN indicate that, as far back as 2009, British security services believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. They say that the Kuwaiti-born Mohammed Emwazi went from being a typical "boy next door" type growing up in West London to being one of the most high-profile recruits of ISIS, the Islamist extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in Syria and Iraq. A man who says he is Emwazi's father told the Kuwaiti newspaper al Qabas that "there is nothing that proves" the man known as Jihadi John is his son, Mohammed. The boy in the video is Emwazi, his former headmaster at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy told CNN.
