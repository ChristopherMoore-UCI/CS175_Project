But the Press Herald newspaper of Portland reported that the findings included videotapes of Wright having sex with numerous men, a ledger containing prices for various sex acts and detailed customer records. She said she isn't getting any letters from readers upset that Wright's name has been plastered in media accounts of the case, bringing up what some say is a long-held double standard in prostitution cases -- the accused prostitute gets all the attention, while her customers slip away out of public view. On Monday, police released a partial list of those accused of hiring Wright after a judge rejected a request to shield their names from public view. Police are also issuing summonses for the men on Wright's list, accusing them of engaging in prostitution, a misdemeanor charge. Police are releasing the names and addresses in batches, and more names are expected soon.
