-- An 80-year-old Roman Catholic priest was found stabbed to death in his church in the city of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, CNNMexico.com reported Thursday, citing state police. Barragan said there is a shortage of priests in Oaxaca. State police rescued Garcia and then arrested him on charges that he was responsible for the deaths of two officials who were shot after an anti-mine rally. Wotto had been the parish priest at Nuestra Senora de las Nieves (Our Lady of the Snow) for eight years. The Rev. Martin Octavio Garcia Ortiz from the town of San Jose del Progreso was abducted June 19 in a dispute over a local mine.
