"When times are good we prefer actresses with rounder faces," psychology professor Terry Pettijohn told Salon.com writer Daniel D'Addario in a piece titled "Anne Hathaway: Hollywood's most polarizing star." When Hathaway won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA, award this year for best supporting actress for her role as Fantine in "Les Miserables," her acceptance speech did not go over well. Salon.com goes on, "As the economy improves, Hathaway -- whose peak of fame, post-boyfriend, pre-Oscar-hosting, came amid the 2008 economic crash -- may just be a reminder of bad times." " Pettijon concluded that Hathaway has a "mature face" made distinctive by its slender shape and bone structure: "It suggests she would be popular when times are more challenging." Even in the midst of The Onion tweeting a vulgar term during the Academy Awards about 9-year-old best actress nominee Quvenzhane Wallis, there was still time to bash Hathaway.
