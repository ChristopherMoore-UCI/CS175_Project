Kanye West and Twitter: A brief history It all started with Kimmel's parody of West's recent interview with BBC Radio 1, during which he spoke at length about feeling artistically boxed in and the status of hip-hop as the new rock n' roll. Kimmel, who admitted Wednesday that he'd only seen a few portions of West's viral interview, latched on to the rapper's reference to leather jogging pants, which he says he invented before they became fashionable. -- Love him or hate him, Kanye West will always be himself -- especially when he's burying the hatchet with Jimmy Kimmel. I really felt bad about all of this stuff, I did," Kimmel told West. In the end, West explained, Kimmel became a sort of scapegoat for all the other members of the media who've published "bogus" information.
