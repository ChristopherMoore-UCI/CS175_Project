" Marco Rubio blasts Obama administration, pushes American leadership abroad Rubio said simmering tensions between Japan and China, inflamed by recent Chinese efforts to expand its military influence in the East China Sea, are very real -- and shared by leaders in the Philippines. "All of the emerging major issues of the 21st century over the next 50 years are going to be in Asia, given the population growth, and given the instability that you see in North Korea, given the rise of China," Rubio told CNN in a weekend phone interview from Seoul, South Korea. "The takeaway, if you go to Japan or the Philippines, the takeaway is that China is trying to become dominant, that China is driving the U.S. out," Rubio said. In a Friday speech to the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, Rubio said American engagement in Asia is crucial to U.S. national security and economic vitality. " Rubio: Culture keeps U.S.-UK bond strong Rubio affirmed the importance of America's economic and military interests in Asia and expressed support for the so-called "rebalance" -- the Obama administration's effort to re-engage with Asia by forging deeper alliances with friendly nations and pursuing a stable relationship with China.
