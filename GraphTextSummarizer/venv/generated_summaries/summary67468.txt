Former AC Milan coach Leonardo took over from Benitez and guided Inter to a second-place finish in Serie A last season, before his move to France's Paris St. Germain as director of football led to ex-Genoa boss Gasperini being appointed in June. Known as the "The Tinkerman" from his time at Chelsea when he constantly rotated his team, Ranieri refused to make any promises of success this season as Inter seek a 19th Serie A crown. Benitez, who led Liverpool to Champions League success in 2005, was sacked in December 2010 despite taking Inter to victory at the FIFA Club World Cup. His appointment means that Inter have now had four different coaches since current Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho left the San Siro in May 2010. He has signed a contract binding him to the club June 30, 2013," Inter's official website reported on Thursday.
