Miss Universe officials insist the change is in spite of, not because of, legal threats from women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred made on behalf of contestant Jenna Talackova. "For more than two weeks, the Miss Universe Organization and Mr. Trump made it clear to GLAAD that they were open to making a policy change to include women who are transgender," said GLAAD spokesman Herndon Graddick. Talackova, a 6-foot-1-inch blond Canadian, underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago. "We made the decision two days before we even heard that (Allred) was involved," pageant owner Donald Trump told CNN Monday. Allred launched a blistering attack on Trump at a news conference a week ago, saying his pageant had no right to question Talackova's sexuality.
