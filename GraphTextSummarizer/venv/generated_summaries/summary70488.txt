Through Shot@Life, Americans can raise awareness and funds to help the United Nations immunize children in developing countries against polio and other diseases. UNICEF and others are doing amazing work delivering polio immunizations, including in hard-to-reach places where the fight against polio will be won or lost. Yet today, polio continues to cripple children in some parts of the world. The United Nations Foundation's Shot@Life campaign is carrying this message forward and empowering individual Americans to join the fight against polio. That's why world leaders came together last month at the United Nations to reaffirm their commitment to ending polio and to issue an urgent call to fill a funding gap that threatens to undo the progress that has been made.
