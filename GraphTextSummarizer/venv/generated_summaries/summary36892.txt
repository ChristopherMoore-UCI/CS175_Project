Rebuild respect between communities and police One-size-fits-all mandates and decrees from Washington -- from drug laws to civil asset forfeiture to no-knock warrants â€” create divisions between local law enforcement and the local communities they serve. It's the same for police militarization, which has occurred in large part because Washington has supplied local agencies with weapons and tools that are inappropriate for use in local communities. The list of federal crimes is so long, so broad and so vague that you and I likely commit three felonies every day, unwittingly breaking numerous federal laws as we go about our daily business. Criminal justice reform is rapidly becoming one of the few bipartisan issues of our time. Reduce punishment for nonviolent crimes Politicians should consider reducing nonviolent offenses from felonies to misdemeanors, and end mandatory sentencing for nonviolent crimes.
