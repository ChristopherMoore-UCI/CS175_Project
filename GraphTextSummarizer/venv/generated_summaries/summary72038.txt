The male camel was in rut and became very aggressive, Wichita County Sheriff David Duke said. She told the newspaper about two women who raised camels as pets, who were killed when a male camel knocked them down and planted his front feet on them, common mating behavior. Peggye McNair, 72, the owner of the farm and a well-known camel breeder, was one of the victims of the attack Saturday, police told CNN affiliate KFDX. In a 2009 interview with the Wichita Falls Times Record News, McNair said "camels have gotten a bad rap." Owner McNair tried to close the gate, but the male camel came after both of them and trampled them to death, police said.
