According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, "80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed." The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.
