-- Security forces in northern Iraq found a mass grave containing scores of people killed during the height of sectarian violence last decade, police told CNN on Saturday. Baquba police Lt. Col. Ghalib Atiya al-Jabouri said the victims included civilians, police and soldiers slain during the height of sectarian violence between 2005 and 2008. Some victims were blindfolded and others had their hands tied behind their backs, signs of al Qaeda in Iraq activity. Buhriz, he said, had been controlled by al Qaeda in Iraq between 2006 and 2008. Iraq had been engulfed by fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.
