Dormer did not provide additional details, but said Suffolk County police officers have been in contact with their Atlantic City counterparts since the early stages of the Long Island investigation. Aviation teams that flew over parts of Long Island had "identified a significant number of items that aren't natural for the area," said Nassau County Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter. Airplanes and helicopters with high-resolution technology are being used in the search effort, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer explained Wednesday. "We didn't uncover anything that was noteworthy," said Nassau County Police spokesperson Kevin Smith. Earlier this week, police discovered skeletal remains -- including a human skull --  prompting the widening search.
