McIlroy has also denied reports of a rift with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem for abandoning the U.S. circuit after only one year as a full-time member. I have no sort of vendetta against Tim Finchem or the PGA Tour; I love playing in the U.S. and have always found the people very welcoming." South Africa's Tim Clark won last year's Players Championship, with Westwood finishing tied for fourth, four shots behind. Both have opted to take up European Tour membership in 2011, meaning they can only play three events on the PGA Tour outside of the majors. -- Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy's decision to skip the Players Championship at Sawgrass in May has been defended by their manager Andrew Chandler. The absence of current world number one Westwood from the TPC has been seen as a snub to the PGA Tour, but Chandler says it is purely down to the calendar.
