-- Spain's El Gordo, or "the fat one," annual Christmas lottery paid a hefty $3 billion in prize money on Wednesday to thousands of people testing their luck in Spain's deep economic crisis. It has become such a deep tradition in Spain that even people who don't buy lottery tickets usually end up with some tiny fraction tickets given away by their local butcher shop or pharmacy. Other winners included a group of truck drivers from southern Spain who had purchased some of the winning tickets at a lottery office in central Barcelona, Spanish media reported. Spaniards on average spent about $80 for lottery tickets. The lottery draw was held at a convention center in central Madrid this year, moving from its previous location at a school for the first time in 47 years, because officials said, more space was needed due to increased interest.
