And in my opinion, being a father, that's enough." Reeves, a 71-year-old retired Tampa police officer, got into an altercation with Chad Oulson because Oulson was texting Alexis' babysitter during the previews for "Lone Survivor," police said. " Nicole Oulson, speaking for the first time since her husband was gunned down January 13, wore a pink cast over her arm, covering a gunshot wound that police say she suffered while trying to protect her husband from Curtis Reeves that harrowing afternoon. The attorney also said that Reeves was the victim in the altercation and that Chad Oulson was the "aggressor." Neighbors and family friends told CNN affiliates that Reeves was a friendly fellow, completely unlike the man described in news reports about the shooting. Defense attorney Richard Escobar told a judge earlier this month, to no avail, that Reeves had close ties to the community, was a former Hernando County Crime Stoppers president, lived with his wife of more than four decades in a neighboring county, and had two children, one of whom is a Tampa patrol officer with more than a decade of service. The witness said after Reeves shot Oulson, he sat down and put the gun in his lap.
