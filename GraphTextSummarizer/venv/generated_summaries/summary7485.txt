When he refused to open on Thanksgiving Day this year and force his employees to work, he says, he was told to write a letter of resignation. "That's something I can't decide right away," he told CNN in a telephone interview as he prepared to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family -- and without pizza. Shortly after a manager at a Pizza Hut franchise in Elkhart, Indiana, announced that he was fired for refusing to open on Thanksgiving Day, the company is offering him his job back. Now, Pizza Hut's corporate office says the franchise "made a serious error in judgment, one which we hope to help remedy. "We fully respect an employee's right to not work on a holiday, which is why the vast majority of Pizza Huts in America are closed on Thanksgiving," the corporate office said in a statement.
