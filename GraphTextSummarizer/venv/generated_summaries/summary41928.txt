"You cannot own a reptile, or wildlife for that matter, like this, in the city of Los Angeles without having a proper permit," Mark Sanchez of Los Angeles Animal Services said of the Jaxson case. On Thursday, Los Angeles Animal Services responded to a home with an eviction notice only to find an abandoned alligator in the backyard -- about six miles from where another alligator was found Monday. "It is illegal to keep wildlife without a permit in the City of Los Angeles," according to LA Animal Services. American alligators are primarily found in the Southeastern United States, around Florida and Louisiana, according to National Geographic. Not one, but two alligators have been found just a few miles apart in the Los Angeles area this week.
