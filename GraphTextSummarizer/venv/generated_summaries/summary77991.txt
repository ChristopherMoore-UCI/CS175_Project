Opinion: After 25 years, Exxon Valdez oil spill hasn't ended More about oil spills Halliburton pleads guilty in 2010 Gulf oil spill case That gave scientists looking into the aftereffects of 2010's Gulf of Mexico oil spill the chance to watch the growing hearts of large commercial species like tuna and amberjack after exposing them in laboratories to oil collected from the undersea blowout. The results ranged from abnormal heartbeats in fish exposed to low concentrations of oil to "severely malformed and malfunctioning hearts" at high levels, said John Incardona, an environmental toxicologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "You mess up the heart, you mess up the ability of species like this to do simple functions like swim to catch its prey," said Galvez, the co-author of a 2013 study that pointed to similar problems among fish in coastal marshes hit by oil. "Those fish would in all likelihood survive the immediate effects of oil exposure, but would also probably end up with a milder heart malformation that could reduce their aerobic performance -- which for fish, means swimming," Incardona said.
