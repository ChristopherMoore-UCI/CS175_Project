The Sacketts property did not border Priest Lake, but the EPA determined gravel on the lot amounted to a pollutant into "waters of the Untied States." "EPA is not above the law," said Damien Schiff, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, representing the Sacketts in court. Gravel had already been laid for the foundation when EPA officials told them their land was a wetland. " "The combination of the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act and the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of violations alleged in this case still leaves most property owners with little practical alternative but to dance to the EPA's tune," he said. The high court in 2006 failed to reach a standard that would have redefined current wetlands mitigation laws, the laws now confronting the justices and the Sacketts.
