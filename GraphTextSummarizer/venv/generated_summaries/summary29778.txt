As someone who loves to dress other people, Nguyen jumped on the challenge of copycat fashion. Fortunately, "impossible" doesn't exist for blogger Anna Nguyen. "It's fun to change up everyday style," Nguyen says. Based out of Irvine, California, Nguyen is no stranger to celebrity fashion. Although a Lady Gaga fan, Nguyen doesn't neglect other musicians in the name of being one of Lady G's "little monsters," the nickname given to Gaga fans.
