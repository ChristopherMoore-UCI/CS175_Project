Five places -- Anguilla, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Turks and Caicos Islands -- require 13 years of education. At the other end of the spectrum are Bangladesh, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Myanmar and Pakistan, which require only five years of education, according to UNESCO. Among all of the locations in the table, the average amount of compulsory education is nine years, starting by age 6 and ending near 14. By age 9, children in Myanmar and Pakistan are already finishing up their legal obligation for school. Puerto Rico starts two years later and ends at 18, which is tied for the highest "ending age" along with Belgium, Germany and Uzbekistan.
