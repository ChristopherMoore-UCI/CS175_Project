"My heart goes out to the parents and families of children who are injured or lose their lives in incidents associated with consumer products," CPSC Commissioner Nancy Nord said in a statement released in conjunction with the agency's announcement. In July 2010, Baby Matters and the CPSC issued a joint recall and refund of the company's Nap Nanny Generation One recliner. The recliners, manufactured by Baby Matters, LLC, based in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, include the Nap Nanny and Nap Nanny Chill infant models. Despite design improvements, warnings and instructions to the company's Generation Two model and Nap Nanny Chill recliner, there have been four more fatalities, the CPSC alleged. The Nap Nanny recliner is designed for sleeping, resting and playing and includes a shaped foam base with an inclined indentation for the baby to sit and a fitted fabric cover with a three-point harness, the CPSC said.
