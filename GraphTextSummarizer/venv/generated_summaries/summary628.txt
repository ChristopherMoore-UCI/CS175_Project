"Anyone reading this or following this case, please remember our beautiful Meredith," Stephanie Kercher said in a statement distributed Sunday by attorney Francesco Maresca. -- A day before American Amanda Knox's appeal of her murder conviction resumes in an Italian appeals court, the sister of slaying victim Meredith Kercher vowed to keep fighting for justice on her behalf. Meanwhile, they said, the clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra, which allegedly contained Sollecito's DNA, was "dirty" and had been allowed to rust, making further testing futile. The Kercher family has not forgotten Meredith, she said, "and we will continue our fight for justice with the continued support of our lawyer Francesco Maresca and his team, the police and prosecution and all those involved in Italy as well as everyone all over the world who still thinks of us and Mez." DNA on Kercher's bra was also traced to Sollecito.
