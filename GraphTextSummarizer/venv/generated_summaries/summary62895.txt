Earn or use points at least once every 24 months, and you'll keep your points forever; a perk that Winship said is a huge improvement from Southwest's current system, which erases any points not used within two years. One of the key changes in Rapid Rewards is that members can now redeem points on every seat, every day and on every flight with no blackout dates or seat restrictions. "This is very big," Tim Winship, editor-at-large for SmarterTravel.com said of the changes, which are aimed at making it easier for members to earn and redeem points. Rapid Rewards members earn points based on the price of the flight and the type of fare purchased. By changing the way rewards are calculated --  by revenue rather than miles -- Southwest is going in a direction that other airlines will be hard-pressed to follow.
