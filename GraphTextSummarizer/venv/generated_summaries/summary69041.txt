" Trooper shooting suspect might try to target more officers, police say CNN's Chris Welch and Sonia Moghe reported from northeast Pennsylvania while Mariano Castillo reported and wrote from New York. Frein is on the run and possibly armed, but there is no indication that he is a danger to anyone other than law enforcement, Bivens said. "Based on our investigations, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years," State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Sunday. " State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Wednesday that investigators know Frein "has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder." "While we can never completely rule out an act of violence, I am convinced that Frein has engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement, specifically the Pennsylvania State Police, and will likely stay focused on that fight," he said.
