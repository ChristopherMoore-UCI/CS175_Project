-- People have called 911 to complain about lousy hamburgers and cold french fries, but what happened Sunday night in a Connecticut town may have set a new standard for misuse of emergency calls. A power outage knocked out cable service Sunday evening in parts of Connecticut, leaving Cablevision customers unable to watch television, including the hit show now in its final season. Misuse of the 911 system may result in an arrest." Cablevision said it had restored service by 11 p.m. Sunday. " When a lack of cable TV is a reason to call 911, "I have to wonder what this world is coming to and if people truly understand the definition of emergency," read another comment. 911 should only be called for Life Threatening Emergencies ONLY.
