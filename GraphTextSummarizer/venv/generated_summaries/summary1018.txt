In key, high-profile cases in which racial profiling was either explicitly or implicitly at the core of the complaint, the conservative majority simply ignores the racial implications of sweeping decisions that leave racial minorities subject to arbitrary law enforcement practices. Take racial profiling -- the single most explicit manifestation of racial prejudice in the United States today. The court also found it implausible that federal law enforcement officials might have engaged in racial profiling after 9/11. Stop-and-frisk policing is only one aspect of the national indignity of racial profiling. Rather than recognize how these practices strike at our bedrock constitutional rights to due process, equal protection and freedom from unreasonable searches, the Supreme Court recently doubled down on racial profiling.
