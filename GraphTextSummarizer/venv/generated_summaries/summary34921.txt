This week's disclosure of classified government programs to collect information on phone calls, e-mails and Internet use for national security reasons quickly dominated headlines, forcing President Barack Obama to reassure Americans on Friday that "nobody is listening to your telephone calls. For example, he noted that that overseas phone calls from the United States can be subject to greater scrutiny than domestic calls. " To handle what he called a "horrible communications challenge" in response to the firestorm created by this week's revelations, West said the Obama administration needs to explain the difference between outright spying such as listening in on phone calls and the more general data mining of the newly disclosed programs. Obama, then a first-term senator from Illinois, voted for the revised measure after taking part in mostly unsuccessful efforts to further strengthen civil liberties provisions. In particular, the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor's claim of a "false choice" between civil liberties and national security following the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks now argues that such a choice was inevitable.
