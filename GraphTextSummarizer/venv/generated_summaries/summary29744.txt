Burrell also told the inquest he did not believe Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's, husband was involved in Diana's death. " Burrell told the inquest that Diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in June 1997 with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with Muslim men. Burrell, whom the late princess once called "my rock," cast doubt on whether Diana was ready to marry Fayed. Burrell worked for the British royals for 21 years and became close to Diana after her separation from Prince Charles. Burrell testified that after Diana's death, her mother, Frances Shand-Kidd, worked every day for a week shredding the papers from Diana's desk.
