"That's because I don't know how to throw a wedding," I hiss as I pull off my stained Sunday night yoga pants and rummage through the laundry bag for my slightly less stained Saturday afternoon yoga pants, marveling all the while at the fact that I don't do yoga. That night in bed, I turn to Johannes (love of my life, father of my child, official party co-host). I want everyone to relax and have a good time, but that has to start with me, and I'm about as laid-back as a caged hummingbird guzzling a can of Red Bull while awaiting biopsy results. "Why do I suck at parties?" This leads me to a new theory: "Maybe bad parties are hereditary, like green eyes and diabetes," I say to Johannes.
