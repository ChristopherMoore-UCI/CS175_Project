The July 12 edition of The Nation magazine cited two witnesses who said they saw members of Iran's national police force in July 2009 cross the border into northern Iraq to apprehend Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal. "The lack of coordination on the part of these hikers, particularly after being forewarned, indicates an intent to agitate and create publicity regarding international policies on [Iran]," the assessment read in part. The field report was one of 400,000 the whistle-blower website WikiLeaks released Friday concerning U.S. and coalition operations in Iraq. -- A classified U.S. military document appears to lend credence to claims that Iran crossed the Iraqi border to arrest three American hikers. Bauer and Fattal remain jailed in Tehran's Evin prison.
