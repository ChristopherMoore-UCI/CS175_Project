The Australian sixth seed earned her first WTA Tour final appearance since losing to Francesca Schiavone at Roland Garros last year when she beat China's Li Na 7-6 (8-6) 6-0 in the opening semi. "After losing in the final of the French last year, I did struggle mentally for a little bit. The Russian avenged her defeat by the Dane at the same stage of the Indian Wells hard-court event in March as she triumphed 7-5 6-3 on Italian clay. " Stosur has lost all seven encounters with Sharapova, but none of those matches have been on clay. "It's the first time I'm playing her on clay and her best results have been on clay," Sharapova said. -- Former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova has the chance to win her first title in a year after beating current top women's tennis player Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals of the Rome Masters on Saturday.
