The 405, as it's locally called, cuts through the Santa Monica Mountains and connects suburban San Fernando Valley with Los Angeles International Airport and the well-to-do neighborhoods of west Los Angeles, such as Bel Air and Brentwood. K.N. Murthy, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's executive director of transit project delivery, said: "The risk factors that caused transportation, law enforcement and emergency response agencies heartburn during last year's I-405 freeway closure have not changed. The highway construction project this weekend will complete a carpool lane system over the mountain pass to create a continuous carpool lane of almost 73 miles in each direction between Orange County and Los Angeles County's San Fernando Valley -- the longest in the world, officials said. Last year's closure of Interstate 405 -- described by local officials as "the nation's busiest freeway" -- was expected to be so apocalyptic that car-loving Los Angeles labeled the weekend shutdown "Carmageddon." -- The nation's second largest city is preparing for potential traffic paralysis with the closure this weekend of a major highway that passes through the mountains of Los Angeles.
