Apple devices are more conservative with preinstalled apps, but there is a core group of iOS apps you can't uninstall. Android devices can use the Android Device Manager. The option is under Settings ->Wireless & Networks -> Data Usage on Android devices. You can also install third-party apps to monitor data usage, some of which break it down by individual apps. Hunting for and downloading new apps is the most exciting part of a new gadget.
