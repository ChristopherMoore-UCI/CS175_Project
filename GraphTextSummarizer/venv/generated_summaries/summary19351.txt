Republican members privy to the Senate's top intelligence briefings criticized President Barack Obama's terror-fighting policies and U.S. national security agencies began scanning their databases Thursday amid reports that the two gunmen in Wednesdays' attack traveled to Syria this summer and as suspicions swirled that the pair were influenced by ISIS. The attack in Paris is also giving new fire to legislation Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) believes will help prevent Americans who join ISIS or other terrorist organizations from returning to the U.S. Poe is reintroducing a bill in the coming days that will compel the State Department to revoke the passports of Americans who join or assist any foreign terrorist organization. Poe will also introduce two bills requiring the State Department in coordination with other agencies to submit reports on the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and terrorist groups' use of social media, which groups like ISIS have used to recruit and radicalize foreigners. " Collins added that the U.S. has greater capabilities today to thwart terror attacks, but that the expansive influence of ISIS and other terror groups via the Internet and social media has created a "lone wolf problem," which is harder to address. U.S. officials and lawmakers reeling from the tragic terrorist attack in Paris that killed 12 are turning the attention back home as they assess what the attack means for U.S. national security.
