In a very different way, President Obama has created a huge opportunity for Hillary Clinton because of his failures. The former first lady, senator, and secretary of state is in excellent position to run the kind of campaign that is true to her history, in large part because of the impact that President Obama has had in the past six years. Unlike her husband, who felt in the early 1990s that he had to emphasize his centrist, new Democratic credentials, President Obama has opened the doors for a Democrat to build their campaigns on the tradition of the New Deal and Great Society, rather than running away from that legacy. How did President Obama make this happen? Though hesitant at first, President Obama has embraced the major social movement of our dayâ€”gay rightsâ€”taking a more progressive stand than any president before him.
