Earlier this month Microsoft announced a partnership with Chinese manufacturer Huawei to create a sub-$150 smartphone specifically aimed at developing markets in Africa. But elsewhere in the world, Elop said his cheapest device would appeal as either a failsafe that users can turn to when their smarter handsets are struck dumb by power outage or as a novelty stand-in for costlier, bigger devices. "Normally in my pockets I have four or five," he said, adding that his array of handsets usually included rival models that he carried around to keep tabs on Nokia's opposition. Nokia hopes that by focusing on budget as well as top end users it can reclaim ground from rivals such as Apple, Samsung and ZTE who have in recent years undermined the Finnish multinational's previously dominant position. Many manufacturers continue to produce phones that retail so cheaply that some are treated as disposable.
