Later, at the museum commemoration, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said Apollo "fundamentally changed how humankind views its place in the universe." "What you achieved will never be forgotten," Bolden said. As a boy in Hawaii, Obama recalled, he would go out with his grandfather to welcome back astronauts from missions that concluded with Pacific Ocean landings. Armstrong called the Apollo program "a superb national enterprise" that "left a lasting imprint on society and history. The July 20, 1969, moon landing followed four test missions and came just two years after a fire that killed the first Apollo crew.
