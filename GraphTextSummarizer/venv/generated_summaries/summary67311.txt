"Alison's loss is a devastating blow not only to Human Rights Watch but also to the people of Rwanda and the Great Lakes region," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the humanitarian organization, said in a statement. Alison Des Forges died in the crash of Flight 3407 outside Buffalo, New York, on Thursday night. Human Rights Watch said Des Forges was born in Schenectady, New York, in 1942 and was a historian by training. Des Forges, who lived in Buffalo, spent four years in Rwandadocumenting the 1994 genocide and had testified about that atrocity and the current situation in central Africa before U.N. and congressional panels, the group said. The statement issued Friday said she graduated from Radcliffe College in 1964 and in 1972 received her Ph.D. from Yale.
