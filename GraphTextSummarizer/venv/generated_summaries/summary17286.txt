Rivers honed her act as a stand-up in the 1960s, when few other women had the guts to talk about not being desired by men on stage or joke about women who were flying to Puerto Rico for illegal abortions on "The Ed Sullivan Show." first dates Unlike Betty White, Rivers didn't have the benefit of starring in a series of beloved television shows, nor did she play characters as affable, matronly, or warmly dotty. Soon after Betty White hosted "Saturday Night Live," I remember asking my friend Nate, a fellow "Golden Girls" fanatic, what he thought of all the fuss around White's meteoric comeback. Rivers, younger than White by over a decade, has been working steadily since the 1950s, and, after this week's release of a great new documentary about her life, "Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work," she is poised to become the Next Belated Big Thing -- for those who needed 60 years to catch on to the fact that she is wonderful. He was right: the recent trend of people catching on to the fact that Betty White is terrific felt patronizing, and not just because most were astonished that an adorable old lady could land a joke better than most "SNL" hosts one-third her age (I'm talking about you, January Jones); it was the belated appreciation of White's fabulousness that made all of us look even sillier.
