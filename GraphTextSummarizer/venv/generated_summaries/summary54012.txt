"When U.S. soaps air elsewhere, when British and Australian soaps air and when telenovelas air, a good portion of them air at night and they don't necessarily have some of the same stigmas of daytime programming in the U.S." Despite their vaunted place in American television history, soaps have not always received the praise or recognition of their night time counterparts. From there, telenovelas share a history with soaps in that the stories morphed into radio programs and later television shows, he said. The show can be seen in more than 110 countries and garnered 24.5 million viewers across the globe in 2008, making it more watched than any other telenovela or soap opera on television, according to Guinness. "Soap operas are considered part of daytime (TV) here and they are considered part of prime time (TV) in many other areas," he said. So while the future looks brighter for telenovelas, soap operas appear to be in their winter of discontent.
