This Thanksgiving, my thoughts turn to Nick, Stan and the thousands of other storm victims in New York and New Jersey who are homeless this holiday season. AmeriCares also has a mobile clinic traveling the streets of New York City, providing portable exam rooms for health clinics unable to treat patients due to damaged facilities. Many are living with family members or in shelters and, if they are lucky, will be able to move back after New Year's. When our relief workers arrived, shelter officials were grappling with how to care for a large population with chronic illness. We also delivered wheelchairs, medical cots and 1,400 pounds of medical aid -- everything from cough and cold medicines to first aid supplies.
