Twomey said C.J. had been upset about not making an Air Force special forces team. " More than 150 packets, each containing a small portion of ashes, have gone out so far, with 300 other people offering to extend C.J.'s journey. Along with the ashes, Twomey sends a note and a small photo of C.J. in a Boston Red Sox T-shirt. On Facebook, the pictures and videos chronicle the places: From the Grand Canyon to the Caribbean, from Australia to Morocco, C.J.'s ashes have been spread. Now, a plea initially to Facebook friends throughout the United States to help C.J. "see the mountains that he never got to climb, see the vast oceans that he would have loved, see tropical beaches and lands far and away" by scattering his ashes has turned into an international effort.
