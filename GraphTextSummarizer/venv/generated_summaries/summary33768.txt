This week's numbers, including the latest tally from Ohio, will not be verified and compiled by the CDC until next week. "This year represents the highest number of cases reported in the United States during this time period in 18 years,"  Dr. Greg Wallace, head of measles activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an e-mail. The measles outbreak that began when unvaccinated Amish missionaries traveled to the Philippines has more than doubled in size in 10 days, Ohio health officials reported Friday. Ohio health officials said some patients have been hospitalized, but most have recovered on their own. Amado said the number of cases had slowed down, but then picked up to about 20 cases per day this week.
