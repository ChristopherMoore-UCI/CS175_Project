-- Actress Lindsay Lohan will be featured in the January/February issue of Playboy, a spokeswoman for the magazine said Monday. At the time, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said it was likely Lohan could be booked in and booked out the same day. Lohan was released from jail early Monday, just hours after she was booked in, authorities said. The issue is expected to hit newsstands late December, Theresa Hennessey told CNN, declining to offer details. The actress must work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court-ordered community service, Judge Stephanie Sautner told her.
