But it was the people, not the cool cars, that grabbed Brainard's interest and inspired his black-and-white photo book "All Tore Up: Texas Hot Rod Portraits. The book "All Tore Up: Texas Hot Rod Portraits" is available through the University of Texas Press. I hope that (this) comes across to people." George Brainard is a photographer based in Austin, Texas. " From Brainard's portraits, it is evident that people themselves are like living works of art, externally embellished in expression and internally rich in history and meaning. "I'm really looking forward to taking the book to that and to the people who are in the book and the people who are part of the culture seeing the book and getting their response." "All Tore Up: Texas Hot Rod Portraits" is Brainard's first photo book and will be released on March 1.
