Fort Bliss is located close to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas, but straddles the Texas-New Mexico border. He was identified as Steven Kropf, 63, of El Paso, Texas. The two female victims were transported to Beaumont Army Medical Center, where one, Bettina Maria Goins, 44, of El Paso was pronounced dead. Most of the base is located in New Mexico, but the main headquarters is in Texas. The man killed after he allegedly shot two women -- one fatally -- at a convenience store at Fort Bliss, Texas, was identified Tuesday as a retired Army sergeant.
