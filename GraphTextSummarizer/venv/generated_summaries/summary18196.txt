Since then however the theory has spread, to such an extent that now at least 77 people have been suggested as the author of the works attributed to Shakespeare -- including such absurdities as Queen Elizabeth I and Miguel Cervantes, author of "Don Quixote." We are energetically pursuing a campaign to defend Shakespeare's name, and have enlisted the help of many high profile figures, including the Prince of Wales, and a string of British actors and writers. It has a long poem in praise of Shakespeare written by Jonson, which refers to him as the Swan of Avon (the name of the river of his town of birth). He was supplanted by the poet and dramatist Christopher Marlowe, whose death in 1593, when Shakespeare's writings were just starting to appear, is one of the best recorded events in English literary history. An absurd story about him, suggesting that he was both the son of Elizabeth I and her lover, father by her of the Earl of Southampton as well as the author of Shakespeare, is told in the new film "Anonymous," directed by Roland Emmerich and starring Vanessa Redgrave as the Queen.
