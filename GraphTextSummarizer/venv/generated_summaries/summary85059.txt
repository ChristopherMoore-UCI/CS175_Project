The reason is that life at sea pays far better than a job on Philippine soil: 40% of Filipinos live on less than two dollars a day, while the starting salary for seafarers like Orozco is $1,500 a month. What the union won't do is urge its members to stop working at sea, even in the regions where pirates readily take seafarers hostage. Thirty-year-old Reydomingo Nuval was on the same ship as Orozco, and says he will go back to sea because he needs to support his family. Orozco credits the anti-piracy course for his survival, but the Philippine Seafarer's Union, the country's second largest union of seafarers, says the course is simply not enough. A third of all international seafarers are Filipino, which also makes them the largest group of hostages at sea.
