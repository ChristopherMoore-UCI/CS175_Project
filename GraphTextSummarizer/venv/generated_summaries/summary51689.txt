Hungarian emergency services officials said more ruptures and cracks are evident in the dam walls, and that it's just a matter of time before they break and spill an additional 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge across the countryside. But, he said he hadn't seen the photo released by the The World Wildlife Fund showing one of the pools of sludge -- a byproduct of the process to turn bauxite ore into aluminium oxide -- leaking into a nearby field. " Zoltan Bakonyi, the chief executive of the MAL aluminum plant, spoke with CNN's Diana Magnay a day after he was released from jail pending trial. But he added that it is his "moral duty" is to "help" and put his energies "120-percent into the aid effort." Bakonyi categorically denied that a hole was present in the reservoir in the days or weeks before the spill happened. The sludge from the spill reached the Danube -- Europe's second-largest river -- within days, raising fears of wider contamination in Hungary and countries downstream, including Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Ukraine.
