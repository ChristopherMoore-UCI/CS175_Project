Paul Colford, a spokesman for the wire service, said Vitter's statement "came into the AP's New Orleans bureau without prior contact from the AP." Flynt took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post in June to offer $1 million for "documented evidence of illicit sexual or intimate relations with a congressman or senator." Flynt launched a similar campaign in 1998 in an effort to counter the drive to impeach then-President Bill Clinton over allegations that he had lied about his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Dan Moldea, an investigative journalist working with Palfrey on a book, told CNN that he discovered Vitter's number in Palfrey's phone records and passed the information to Flynt. Giuliani told reporters Tuesday "it's too early to tell" if Vitter will leave his campaign, and said he should not be judged on the problems of some people associated with his campaign or with his administration as New York mayor. "Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and from my wife in confession and marriage counseling." Vitter, 46, represented New Orleans suburbs in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004, when he ran for the Senate. Â» Vitter was one of the top backers of a failed constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage and serves as the Southern regional chairman of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign.
