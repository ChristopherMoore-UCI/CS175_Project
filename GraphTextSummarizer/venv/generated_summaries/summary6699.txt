Wolfsburg striker Grafite had a penalty saved by Hans-Jorg Butt, his first miss since moving to the Bundesliga in 2007, after Ribery fouled Sascha Riether but the Brazilian added a late consolation from Edin Dzeko's deflected cross. Seventh-placed Hoffenheim also have 28 points following a 2-1 win at home to bottom club Hannover, ending a four-game losing streak as first-half goals from Carlos Eduardo and Sejad Salihovic were the club's first of 2010. Former Palermo coach Francesco Guidolin, who has had four stints at the Stadio Renzo Barbera, was denied a point on his first return with an opposing team as Brazilian Fabio Simplicio smashed an 87th-minute winner. Bayern were 3-0 up after an hour against ailing champions Wolfsburg as Dutch forward Arjen Robben scored in the second minute from Thomas Muller's left-wing cross and defender Daniel van Buyten headed his sixth goal this season from Ivica's Olic pass on 26. Hamburg led 3-1 with 15 minutes left after an early goal from Marcell Jansen and two from Croatia striker Mladen Petric, but Milivoje Novakovic pulled one back with a fine free-kick on 75 minutes and Adil Chihi equalized two minutes from time with a shot that deflected in off defender David Rozehnal.
