-- WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Julian Assange is defending the group's recent leak and said it poses no real risk to soldiers or civilians in Iraq. They showed, Assange said, the deaths of 109,000 people, including soldiers and civilians. U.S. authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, the documents show, it said. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell has said field reports do not contain evidence of war crimes. Assange said WikiLeaks redacted the new round of documents, which included 391,832 reports.
