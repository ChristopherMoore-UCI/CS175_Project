Ascot has already witnessed what was arguably the greatest win of Frankel's career -- maybe even the greatest win of any racehorse's career -- his 11-length victory in this year's Queen Anne Stakes at this year's Royal Ascot. For those who have yet to see Frankel in action, Saturday provides one last opportunity to witness a piece of racing history as the Henry Cecil-trained colt lines up in the showpiece Champion Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. Frankel himself was named after legendary American trainer Bobby Frankel, who lost his own battle with cancer in 2009, the year his namesake was born. Assuming Frankel can deliver again on Saturday he will give us the Hollywood ending this story so richly deserves. Long after the applause has died down around Ascot and the last champagne has been popped, Cecil will begin the work of easing Frankel down in preparation for his new life away from the track.
