Austin police rescued some people from vehicles stuck in water, but no injuries were reported, city spokeswoman Candice Cooper said. More than five inches of rain fell Sunday in Austin, and the National Weather Service reported 12 inches of rain in some spots. "My main concern is the weather of the next 72 hours, especially Tuesday night," said Michael C. Fisher, emergency management coordinator in Bastrop County, east of Austin. Heavy rain could bring flash floods, and "people still have the tendency to drive into high water," he said. Only minor flooding was reported Sunday, but additional rain will flow rapidly over saturated ground and add to waterways still swelling from Sunday's runoff.
