The Setara Institute for Peace and Democracy, a local think tank, noted in a recent report a marked increase in the number of attacks against Ahmadiyah and other minority religions in Indonesia in recent years. "How many Ahmadiyah have to die at the hands of mobs before the police step in?" said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Amateur video of the incident obtained by Human Rights Watch showed people pummeling what looked like lifeless bodies with sticks and rocks. The attacks were the second violent incident against minority religious groups in Indonesia in the past three days. The most populous Muslim country in the world, Indonesia has previously been touted as an example of tolerance and democracy in the Islamic world.
