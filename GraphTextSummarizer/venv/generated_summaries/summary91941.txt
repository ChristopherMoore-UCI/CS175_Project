The process may have been uninspiring, but it signals a significant move by one of the world's largest markets for smuggled ivory to curb wildlife trade. Hong Kong follows recent initiatives by several countries, including France, Philippines and the U.S. to crackdown on ivory trade. Ivory bracelets and carved figurines were incinerated along with elephant tusks. In January, over six tons of illegal ivory was chipped and ground into powder in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The ceremonial burning marked the first stage of the government's plans to destroy the 28-ton stockpile of ivory it has confiscated over the years.
