The mother's desperate call was one of the first items in a police affidavit that chillingly chronicled the killing of popular high school teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, allegedly at the hand of shy student-athlete Philip Chism, 14. At 9 p.m., Danvers High School principal Sue Ambrozavitch sends out a mass e-mail to high school staff reporting Chism missing. The affidavit unsealed Friday -- which police used to obtain a search warrant for Chism's home -- offers a chronology of the gruesome slaying of the algebra teacher and how a student in her last-period class became the prime suspect: After informing police that her son had not come home, Diana Chism went to the Danvers station house to file a missing-person report. Chism was "visibly upset" after Ritzer mentioned his home state of Tennessee, the student told police. -- After failing to find her teenage son on the grounds of Danvers High School, Diana Chism called police in the small northeastern Massachusetts town where she lives with her three children.
