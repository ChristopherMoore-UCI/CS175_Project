Closer is owned by the Mondadori publishing company, which is headed by Marina Berlusconi, daughter of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. French President Francois Hollande is considering legal action against the French version of Closer magazine after the publication alleged he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet, French news agency Agence France-Presse reported Friday. The President has four children of his own from his previous long-term relationship with prominent French Socialist politician Segolene Royal. As of 1:15 a.m. Saturday (7:15 p.m. ET Friday), several stories on the pair's alleged relationship were still up and linked on the magazine's homepage. According to AFP, Gayet, who appeared in one of Hollande's 2012 election commercials, filed a complaint in March over rumors of the affair, which she said were a breach of privacy.
