The grenade attack Monday injured at least 40 people in a Uganda-bound bus, Kenyan police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. The group, considered the al Qaeda proxy in Somalia, has previously threatened attacks on Uganda and Burundi. The nation's authorities had warned of holiday terror attacks by the Islamist group hours before the blast. He declined to comment on any evidence linking the suspect to the militant group that has been battling Somalia's transitional government for years. The two countries contribute troops to the peacekeeping effort in Somalia.
