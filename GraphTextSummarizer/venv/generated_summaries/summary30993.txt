However, speaking Friday in Berlin, Merkel said she was "absolutely convinced" that Samaras and his partners in Greece's coalition government were doing everything they could to solve the nation's economic problems. He added that the Greeks are a proud people, who "don't like to borrow and depend on borrowed money," a point he also made after his talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Friday. Even after a historic restructuring in March, Greece is still struggling to cope with a punishing debt load as its economy remains mired in a years-long recession. Greece is widely believed to have gone off-track with its program following the political turmoil of this year's elections, which left the nation without a fully functioning government for weeks. Hollande also recognized the efforts already made by Greece, whose people have had to endure painful austerity measures and five years of recession.
