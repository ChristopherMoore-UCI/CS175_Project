The slow movement, however, has only a 5% chance of becoming the sort of violent landslide that killed 36 people last month in rural Washington state, said Roxanne Robinson, Jackson assistant town manager. On Saturday, crews installed water tanks on the hill as a fire prevention measure because the temporary two-inch water line isn't sufficient for potential firefighting, Robinson said. Theirs was catastrophic, and ours has been slowly creeping down the hill," Robinson said Saturday. The slow landslide began March 4 when the event moved a town water pumphouse and broke a 16-inch water main, sending water gushing into a two-lane highway, Robinson said. Red Cross personnel trained a dozen local people Saturday to staff a public shelter they plan to open Sunday evening.
