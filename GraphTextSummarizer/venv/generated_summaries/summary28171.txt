-- U.S. drone strikes targeted al Qaeda hideouts in southern Yemen on Wednesday, killing 27 suspected militants, local government officials said. Militants headed to Azzan after they lost control of Abyan province Tuesday, sending the town's residents fleeing over fear of more strikes. No senior al Qaeda leaders died in the attack in the Shabwa province town of Azzan, the officials said. Yemeni forces are patrolling major towns in the province in search for militants, witnesses said. The new government plans to search for al Qaeda sleeper cells in major Yemeni cities, said Ali Saeed Obaid, a spokesman for the military committee, the country's highest military authority.
