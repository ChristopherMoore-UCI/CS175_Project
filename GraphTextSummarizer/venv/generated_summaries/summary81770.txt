He said 30 agents from the FBI, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim "that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of Mr. Byrd. That's why we investigate these types of cases." Lucas, who is himself African-American, said Friday that he's worried people will jump to the conclusion that Byrd was murdered and that race was a factor. Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas on Friday identified the man as Otis Byrd. The body was found at 10:21 a.m. Thursday, deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house Byrd was renting, according to Lucas. " Mississippi NAACP chapter President Derrick Johnson issued a statement calling on "federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of Mr. Otis Byrd."
