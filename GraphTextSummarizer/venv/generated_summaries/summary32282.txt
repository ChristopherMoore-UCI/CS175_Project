"A democratic election produces capable village officials who will help villagers get back their seized land and stolen assets -- so it's a necessary step in the process," Yang Semao, who was elected deputy village chief, told CNN before casting his ballot. From September to December 2011, thousands of locals took to the streets of Wukan, protesting the illegal seizure of their farmland by corrupt officials, expelling local Communist Party leaders and clashing with anti-riot police who surrounded the village. Back at Wukan School, Wu Fang echoed other local villagers when she said a "fairer" election wouldn't solve the core issue that triggered the original protest: the sale of almost 1,000 acres of land by local officials to developers without any compensation to farmers. Xue tweeted that she had decided to stand for election at the last minute, defying officials who warned her that she may lose the job that provides the only income for her mother and two younger siblings. While the Chinese central government has permitted direct village elections since the 1980s, critics say the Wukan election is nothing more than symbolism and that the Communist Party still keeps a tight grip on dissent nationwide, especially in the wake of the Arab Spring.
