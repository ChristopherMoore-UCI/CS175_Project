I'm asking "Star Wars" fans to try to stop spending money on your rehashes. To be fair, I get that the legions of die-hard "Star Wars" fans are partially to blame for your latest twist of the knife. This is one of the worst ideas you've ever had about "Star Wars." When I sat in the theater in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1977 and saw "Star Wars" (I refuse to call it "A New Hope") Sure, it seems like every other movie that gets released these days is 3-D -- some a lot better than others.
