-- Around 1,000 people accused of being witches in Gambia have been locked up in secret detention centers and forced to drink a dangerous hallucinogenic potion, according to human rights organization Amnesty International. Amnesty claims Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, pictured in 2006, invited "witch doctors" to the West African nation. " Amnesty claimed Gambian President Yahya Jammeh had invited "witch doctors" -- believed to be from neighboring Guinea -- to the West African nation  following the death of his aunt. Victims and their relatives tell Amnesty that "witch doctors" accompanied by police, soldiers and security forces have been visiting villages and seizing people accused of being witches by force and at gunpoint. Jammeh, a former soldier who has ruled Gambia since leading a military coup in 1994, is reported to believe that witchcraft was involved in her death, according to Amnesty.
