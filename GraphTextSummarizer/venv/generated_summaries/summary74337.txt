Earlier this week, King Abdullah promised the new government would launch a national dialogue on political reform, tackle corruption and review Jordan's restrictive election law to involve a wider range of political opinion. Most of them marched from Friday prayers at Salahuddin Mosque the short distance to the office of Prime Minister Marouf Bakhit, who was appointed by King Abdullah II a few days ago. The protesters chanted "Alahu Akhbar" ("God is Great"), demanded political reforms and railed against government corruption. Afterwards, the Islamists described the meeting as "clear and frank" in which they asked for political reform beginning with a new more democratic election law and a government chosen by Parliament rather than the king. -- Several hundred protesters braved rain and cold temperatures here in the capital to protest against Jordan's new prime minister Friday.
