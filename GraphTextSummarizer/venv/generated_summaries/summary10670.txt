" A further seven players, including American John Daly, are a further stroke behind, while world number two Phil Mickelson is off the pace after an opening round level par 71. -- Veteran American Paul Goydos has become just the fourth player in PGA Tour history to break the 60-shot barrier after carding a remarkable 12-under-par 59 in the opening round of the John Deere Classic on Thursday. The former Ryder Cup player carded a six-under-par 65 to hold a narrow advantage over Graeme Storm, Damien McGrane and Edoardo Molinari in the traditional British Open warm-up. Michael Letzig and Australian Matt Jones head the chasing pack after carding seven-under-par 64s, with Letzig also keeping a bogey off his card. Goydos follows in the footsteps of Al Geiberger (1977), Chip Beck (1991) and David Duval (1999) after his 12-birdie blitz at the TPC Deer Run, Silvis, Illinois.
