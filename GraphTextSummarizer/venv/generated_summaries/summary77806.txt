Castro was arrested last Friday at his home in Norwalk and was being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $2 million bail. The alleged abuse began in October 2004, shortly after Castro took a job as associate pastor at Las Buenas Nuevas Church in Norwalk, and continued until September 2012, the department said in a news release. During that time, Castro was working as an associate pastor and counselor at Las Buenas Nuevas Church in Norwalk, the department said. But Jorge Juan Castro wound up preying on them instead, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Friday. "He did this by invoking fear by threatening to tell the victims if they reported him he would have the victims deported, while additionally threatening to expose the victims to public embarrassment and ridicule.
