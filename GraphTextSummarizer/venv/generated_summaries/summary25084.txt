" Heart attacks may seem like a senior citizen phenomenon, considering that about 82% of people who die of coronary heart disease are at least 65, according to the American Heart Association. "More often than not, the first symptom of heart disease could be heart attack," Ackermann said. Heart attacks are often the result of coronary artery disease, which occurs when a waxy substance called plaque builds up in the coronary artery. Heart attack risk goes up in men older than 45 and women older than 55, but it can happen even earlier. And men are more likely to have heart attacks than women.
