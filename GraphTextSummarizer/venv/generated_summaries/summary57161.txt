When Wojcicki joined Google in 1999, she became the company's first marketing manager, later leading the initial development of high-profile projects like Google Images and Google books. YouTube has a new boss and she has a "healthy disregard for the impossible" -- according to Google CEO Larry Page. She's behind Google Images and Google Books. She was the 16th person they hired and is married to fellow Google executive Dennis Troper. Her younger sister Anne married Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and her teacher and journalist mother Esther has consulted the company on education issues.
