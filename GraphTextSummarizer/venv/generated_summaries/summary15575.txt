"I told him, 'Get away from me, I don't want to talk to you any more.'" Gregg Irving did not return a call from CNN, nor did his mother, Margaret Irving. Police said Gary Irving had been living as Gregg Irving, the name of his younger brother. As a felon, Irving was not allowed to possess the guns, and he will be charged by federal authorities on firearms offenses, Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio said. In February 2012, after the arrest of alleged mobster James "Whitey" Bulger after 16 years on the run, members of the Massachusetts state police's fugitive task force and the FBI met with Dickson to see whether Irving, too, could be located. That night or the next morning, Gary Irving drove his mother's car through his family's garage door, Dickson said.
