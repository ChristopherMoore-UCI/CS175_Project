-- At least five homes were destroyed after a tornado touched down in western Oklahoma Monday evening, authorities said. The tornado hit about 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), said Ken Gallant, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma. Other homes were damaged, and power was out to about 900 residences in and around the city of Hammon in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, Michelann Ooten of the Department of Emergency Management said. Jerry Dean, county commissioner of Roger Mills, said the county barn was among the structures destroyed. Roger Mills officials continued to assess the damage, but all residents appear to be accounted for, Ooten said.
