-- A man who was sought by police in Texas after four children were burned with sulfuric acid has turned himself in, authorities said Monday. Cooke County Sheriff Michael Compton said all four children are being treated at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas. In the incident last week near Gainesville, Texas, a container of sulfuric acid ruptured in a pickup truck, police said. When police arrived at the cafe, Stout attempted to flee and resist arrest, but was taken into custody, authorities said. Tracy Lynn Escobedo is taken into custody for allegedly burning four children with sulfuric acid.
