Walk the streets and crowded markets of Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po to get a sense of old Hong Kong. Dragon's Back, a gorgeous ridge trail, is a great place to catch stunning views and a nice sea breeze, and ends near the charming beach village of Shek O. If you're up for a real challenge, start at Tai Tam dam and hike to "The Twins" for a double dip of very steep climbing that leads to unforgettable views of the south side's beaches. Once the sun goes down, find a comfy spot on one of the dozens of trendy rooftop bars -- like Wooloomooloo in Wan Chai or Aqua Bar in Tsim Sha Tsui -- for stunning views of Hong Kong at night. First-time visitors won't want to miss taking the tram to The Peak for the quintessential Hong Kong experience, but keep in mind that it's a tourist trap, full of kitschy shops and a Madame Tussaud's wax museum. For a true Hong Kong experience, cross Victoria Harbour by taking the Star Ferry from Central to Kowloon and some of the world's most densely populated neighborhoods.
