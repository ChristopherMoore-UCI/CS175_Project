Bayer Leverkusen are tied on points with Dortmund after a 2-1 win over Augsburg at the weekend, a point behind reigning champions Bayern, while Hoffenheim remain in mid table. Hoffenheim have failed in their bid to get their 2-1 Bundesliga home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen replayed despite the controversial 'ghost' goal scored by visiting striker Stefan Kiessling. Kiessling has six goals for the season, including his effort against Hoffenheim, one behind the leading tally. " Hoffenheim cited an incident in a match between Bayern and Nuremberg in 1994 when Bayern's Thomas Helmer scored a similar 'ghost' goal in a 2-1 win. Kiessling, bidding for a regular place up front in the German international team for the World Cup in Brazil, has been subjected to much criticism and there have been renewed demands for FIFA to introduce video technology to help referees in such situations.
