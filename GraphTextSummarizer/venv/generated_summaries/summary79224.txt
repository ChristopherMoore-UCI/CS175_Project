States with the Model Penal Code test have chosen to include a control element, and certain states still using the original M'Naghten test have added that "irresistible impulse" or control element. It may seem strange that a medical-sounding determination like insanity has different definitions from state to state. This led to the development of another kind of test -- the "irresistible impulse" provision in many states, under which a defendant who can distinguish between right and wrong can still be absolved if he is still unable to stop himself from committing an act he knows to be wrong. The legal standard for insanity varies across America, with each state free to apply any number of tests developed over the last centuries. As it stands today, some 46 states have an insanity defense, and 45 of those have insanity tests based on either M'Naghten or the Model Penal Code tests.
