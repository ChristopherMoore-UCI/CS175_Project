"The story about Formula One started because Red Bull gave me the opportunity to test after my title in 2008, and everyone was very surprised that I was close to the times. -- All-conquering rally champion Sebastien Loeb has told CNN that it is "too late" for him to consider a career switch to Formula One. My goal next year will be to get another title," Loeb said. The Frenchman, who has broken every record in the off-track motorsport in clinching a seventh consecutive world title this season, had his dreams dashed late last year when he was refused a licence to drive in F1. And for the future I will maybe have some other plans, but not specially in Formula One."
