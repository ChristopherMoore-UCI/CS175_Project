Kim Jong Un also spoke at the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korean founder, Kim Il Sung. -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday made his second public speech, signaling a departure in leadership style from his late father. A North Korean expert says the speech shows Kim Jong Un is more similar to his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, than his father, which is what the nation's propaganda machine has emphasized. "His grandfather, unlike his father, was a reasonably good speaker, not charismatic, but he could talk for hours if necessary and was clearly not shy when it came to talking in public, it was part of the image," said Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University. Speaking to tens of thousands of children in Pyongyang on the 66th anniversary of the Korean Children's Union, Kim said the country has a good future.
