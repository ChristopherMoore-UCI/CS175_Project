Gasoline prices are high, energy prices are high. "It's got to involve investing in alternative fuels, so that we can have some alternatives to gas and significant investment in public transit," Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, a key supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid, said Sunday. Bush talks mostly about increasing supply through more oil drilling in places like Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And with the federal government now more than $9 trillion in debt, where would Congress find the money to pour into public transit and research into alternative fuels? But while gas prices keep soaring, the chances of Washington finding a solution keep dropping because Democrats and Republicans are deadlocked over how to fix the problem.
