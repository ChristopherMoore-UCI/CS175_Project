Another photo shows a couple on their wedding day with their child, the company said, a nod to increasing rates of mothers giving birth outside of marriage. The company joins a growing list of brands using same-sex couples in promotional materials, from Banana Republic to Target. The new "Will You?" campaign, shot by fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh, features seven scenes of couples. The rest of the images show couples in various romantic settings: on a city rooftop, driving in a convertible, at home on a sofa. The pair, shown sitting on a stoop in New York City, are a couple in real life, Tiffany spokeswoman Linda Buckley said.
