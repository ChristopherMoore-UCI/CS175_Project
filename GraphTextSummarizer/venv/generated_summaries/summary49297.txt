After Casillas picked up an injury in January, Mourinho signed Sevilla's Diego Lopez, and continued to play him even after Casillas regained full fitness. Pepe has lost his place in the side to young French defender Rafael Varane in recent weeks. The 50-year-old has been strongly linked with a return to the English Premier League and former club Chelsea, with the current coach of the London-based club hinting on Tuesday Mourinho is set to replace him. He has had to fend off regular reports of dressing room unrest and a rift with one of Real's key players, goalkeeper Iker Casillas, the World Cup-winning captain of Spain. "I like Diego Lopez as a goalkeeper more than Casillas," he explained.
