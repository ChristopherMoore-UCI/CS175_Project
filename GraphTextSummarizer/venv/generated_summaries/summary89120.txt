Pundits, veterans and Internet critics on all sides of the political spectrum have spent the past week poring over the film's 132 minutes, and the memoir by Kyle on which it's based, in search of fodder for political arguments. In recent interviews, Eastwood, screenwriter Jason Hall and star Bradley Cooper have said they are dismayed by attempts to ascribe political meanings to what they see as primarily a portrait of real-life Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and the Iraq War's impact on him. "These fellows who are professional soldiers, Navy personnel or what have you, go in for a certain reason ... and there's no political aspect there other than the fact that a lot of things happen in war zones." "For me, and for Clint, this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier ..." Yes, "American Sniper" encourages audiences to root for Kyle and his fellow soldiers as they respond in horror to 9/11, face dangerous insurgents who try to bomb them and track down one especially lethal enemy sniper. By the time he returns from his fourth tour in Iraq, Kyle has clearly lost his appetite for warfare.
