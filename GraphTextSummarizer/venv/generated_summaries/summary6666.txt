Conte has a solid record as a coach, guiding Siena to promotion back to Serie A last season, a feat he had already achieved with Bari in 2009. " Conte was a crowd favorite with the club's supporters, winning a host of titles during his 13-year playing career, including an Intercontinental Cup, the Champions League, the UEFA Cup and five Serie A titles. He believes that Juventus have the ingredients in place to enjoy success: "There's an excellent foundation with some investments made last year, I'm very calm, there's absolutely no need to start all over," he told AFP. Juventus named former club captain Antonio Conte as their new coach Tuesday in place of Luigi Delneri. It followed a difficult season in which the 'Old Lady' finished seventh in the standings for the second straight year and missed out on European qualification.
