"They have done such a great job with this year's car, and I just feel like we've really built a foundation this year which we can use next year to put ourselves in a position to fight with them. "I'm really excited about next year," the 2008 world champion told CNN World Sport. "We have new rules, new engines and the cars are going to be a lot different. "There's every chance that Red Bull will have just as competitive a car next year as this, but what I'm really confident in is the guys who are building my car," the 28-year-old rallied. We have achieved something just incredible this year, to go from where the team wasn't really so successful last year to becoming the ones that are competing with Ferrari and Red Bull.
