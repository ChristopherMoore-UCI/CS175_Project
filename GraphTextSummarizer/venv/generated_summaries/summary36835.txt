-- Hurricane Barbara weakened to a tropical storm Wednesday after it crashed ashore along Mexico's southern Pacific coast. The storm is the second of the eastern Pacific hurricane season, after Tropical Storm Alvin this month. On the forecast track, Barbara is expected to move over southeastern Mexico into Thursday. The storm was about 50 miles west-northwest of Tuxtla Gutierrez, according to the hurricane center's last advisory. Barely a hurricane, the moisture-laden storm made landfall in the state of Chiapas, about 20 miles west of Tonala, the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center said.
