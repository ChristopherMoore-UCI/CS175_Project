In January, CNN obtained surveillance video that purportedly shows Coulibaly and Boumeddiene outside a Jewish institution in Paris. Boumeddiene is believed to have crossed into Syria from Turkey around the time Coulibaly started his terrorism spree in Paris. It also included several pictures showing the aftermath of the Paris attacks, praised Coulibaly and called for more attacks against those "insulting the Prophet. The second issue of an ISIS French language magazine, which began circulating on pro-ISIS Twitter accounts Wednesday, contains a purported two-page question-and-answer story with Hayat Boumeddiene, who is believed to have disappeared into Syria before the January 9 attack. Boumeddiene, 26, claimed in the purported interview that she encountered no difficulties reaching ISIS territory and she felt good to be on ISIS soil.
