-- Veteran sports anchor George Michael died early Thursday after a two-year battle with cancer, according to his former TV station. A statement issued by the station said "George was a pioneer in sports broadcasting." "Michael was a prominent fixture, providing the most accurate and spirited sports news and highlights," Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty said. Michael retired from broadcasting in March 2007. "He truly captured the hearts and minds of sports fans in the District and around the country."
