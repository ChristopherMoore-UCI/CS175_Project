It will provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during space travel and provide safe reentry from deep space. Ruck's film is slated to be screened in May at the International Space Development Conference in Los Angeles that will host speakers Buzz Aldrin -- the Apollo astronaut who was the second man on the moon, Elon Musk, CEO of Space X, and Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of Space X. But the film really took shape when Ruck met Blair Mason, then a 17-year-old high school senior keenly interested in space travel. Ruck's film examines the state of America's space program and captures the passion for human space travel as well as the somber tone that followed the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. The Orion spacecraft will take astronauts beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) to deep space.
