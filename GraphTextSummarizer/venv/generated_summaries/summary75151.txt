A man who captured video of the fatal confrontation between New York police and Eric Garner was arrested Saturday night on gun possession charges at a Staten Island hotel, according to a law enforcement official. The source said it was only after the arrest that police realized Orta filmed the deadly confrontation with Garner when he told police, "You're only mad at me because I filmed your boy." Orta was arrested leaving the hotel after police said they saw him passing an object to his girlfriend, who placed it in her waistband, according to the source. Demonstrators in New York called the police response during Garner's arrest excessive and criminal. Orta's cell phone video showed Garner -- an asthmatic -- on the ground screaming that he couldn't breathe.
