NBC's "The Voice" was steady, "About a Boy" was up slightly for one episode and tied with last week for its finale, and the finale of "Chicago Fire" was steady and up 12 percent from last season's closer. Fox's "Glee" fell to a dramatic new low for its fifth season finale Tuesday night. ABC's "SHIELD" finale was steady, "The Goldbergs" finale posted a slight gain, the "Trophy Wife" series finale jumped 29 percent from last week. Fox also premiered improv-obstacle course comedy Riot last night to what one analyst called the lowest rating for a series premiere on the Big 4 broadcast network ever. "Glee" was even topped in the preliminary ratings by The CW's "The Originals" finale, which is inflated slightly due to some baseball preemption in New York City, but The CW says its shows should still beat Fox's lineup in the demo when the final numbers are released.
