Our global human rights organization, based in the U.S. and India, works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable. When I describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption: that we here in the U.S. are working solely to stop violence against women in India. Perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was, "Violence against women is really bad...in India." We know from "The Hunting Ground," documentarian Kirby Dick's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women, and many men, have had violated their right to an education free from violence. We know that women are leaving the tech industry, Wall Street, and Internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence.
