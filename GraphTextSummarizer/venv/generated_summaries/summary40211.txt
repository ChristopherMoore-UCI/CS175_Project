The move came amid continued change in Egypt's government, with Sharaf announcing Saturday that Hazem Al-Beblawy and Ali Al-Selmy had been appointed as deputy prime ministers. -- Egypt's foreign minister resigned Saturday, part of a reshuffling of Egypt's government in the face of continued demonstrations calling for reforms. A former deputy foreign minister for foreign affairs, he became foreign minister in June in place of Nabil Elaraby. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and Sharaf's caretaker cabinet have been in charge of the country since Mubarak's ouster, a time that has been marked by significant, evolving changes in Egypt's government. The exact circumstances surrounding Orabi's resignation are unknown, though he had a long history of government service in Mubarak's government.
