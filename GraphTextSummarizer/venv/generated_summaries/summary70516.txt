-- Syria's embattled government allowed about 200 activists and intellectuals, including some it had previously jailed, to hold a conference on democratic reform Monday at a Damascus hotel. For its part, a Syrian military spokesman said Sunday that more than 400 police officers and government troops and police have been killed battling "armed gangs." "The big question regarding this conference is, where are the young people?" asked Wissam Tarif, a pro-democracy activist based outside Syria. " In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday's conference was "a worthwhile step," but told reporters that "the violence has to stop. But some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as President Bashar al-Assad tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests say the people in the hotel don't necessarily speak for them.
