The Senate rejected a similar amendment but will allow the Health and Human Services secretary to decide whether abortion coverage would be granted under a government-sponsored plan and will permit coverage in private plans. Two Democratic sources said the deal includes a proposal to replace the public option by creating a not-for-profit private insurance option overseen by the federal Office of Personnel Management, much like the current health plan for federal workers, and another allowing people 55 or older to buy into Medicare coverage that currently is available to those 65 or older. The Senate plan would require individuals to buy health insurance, with a fine for noncompliance of $95 in the first year that would escalate to $750 by 2016. They also differ on how easy it should be for illegal immigrants to buy health insurance with their own money. In general, the House bill gives illegal immigrants more opportunity to buy health insurance and would verify their identity in fewer areas.
