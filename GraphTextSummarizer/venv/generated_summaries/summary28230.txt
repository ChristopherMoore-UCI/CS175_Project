The future of Europe: 3 scenarios International bailouts have kept Greece from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue, but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras was sworn in Wednesday as Greece's new prime minister, following months of political uncertainty for the debt-stricken country. "History and the people will judge them by their results," Tsipras said of the parties backing some kind of bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping Greece afloat. The leftist party has supported bailouts from international lenders while seeking to renegotiate the terms. Greece will go to a two-day summit in Brussels later this month determined to push fellow European leaders on the issue, he added.
