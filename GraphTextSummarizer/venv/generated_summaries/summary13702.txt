"Landsat is a centerpiece of NASA's Earth Science program, and today's successful launch will extend the longest continuous data record of Earth's surface as seen from space," NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement. We've got good telemetry coming back from LDCM, so all is well so far," Dunn told NASA TV. In 2012, the National Academy of Sciences warned that a combination of budget pressure, program delays and a pair of launch failures in 2009 and 2011 left the United States facing a "rapid decline" in its capability to monitor land and seas from space. The $855 million platform, about the size of a sport-utility vehicle, has been in the works for years amid concerns about maintaining the U.S. suite of geoscience satellites. The imagery has been used to monitor urban growth, water use, farm production and a variety of natural disasters, from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens to the historic earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011.
