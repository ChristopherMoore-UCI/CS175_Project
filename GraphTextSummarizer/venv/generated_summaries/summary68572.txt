-- Less than one month after being rescued, one of the now-famous Chilean miners will compete in the New York City Marathon Sunday, according to Mary Wittenberg, president of the New York City Road Runners Club. Wittenberg said Pena will be traveling to New York with his wife. The 12th miner to be rescued, Pena is a diehard Elvis Presley fan who, despite speaking little English, knows most of the words to Elvis classics and led the trapped miners in sing-alongs during their 69-day ordeal underground. "He had the fortitude to take the time and run when in what most would describe as a pretty scary situation," Wittenberg told CNN. But Pena insisted on running in the 26.2-mile marathon, Wittenberg said.
