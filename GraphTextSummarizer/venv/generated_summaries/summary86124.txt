"There are other trains in Europe but for me high-speed train will be the future of Europe," he says. Montezemolo and his consortium of partners, including French state rail company SNCF, have invested â‚¬1 billion ($1.2 billion) in NTV, breaking Trenitalia's monopoly. Both Italo and state-run rival Trenitalia currently have promotional offers, but Trenitalia's flexible standard tickets from Rome to Milan start from $107 and go up to $200, whereas flexible standard tickets from Rome to Milan on Italo range from $110 to $163. "It's an opportunity for the consumer," says Trenitalia's Emanuele Carando.
