The tennis world is in mourning after Elena Baltacha died at the age of 30 after losing her battle with liver cancer. A number of tennis legends took to social media to pay their respects to Baltacha with American Billie Jean King tweeting: "Saddened to hear about Elena Baltacha's passing. Baltacha turned pro in 1997 and spent 132 weeks as British No. 1 between December 2009 and June 2012. " A charity event, called The Rally Against Cancer -- Rally For Bally, will be held on June 15 with a host of tennis greats set to turn out in support. The final event of her playing career was the 2013 U.S. Open last September, where she was defeated during the pre-tournament qualifying competition.
