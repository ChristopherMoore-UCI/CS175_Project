Cheap lager is no longer cheap and, regardless, beer has been usurped by fancy wines. This is because beer can be bought and consumed not just in bars, but in shops, gas stations, newspaper stands and on public transport. This is a country whose former prime minister, the legendary Bob Hawke, was once in the Guinness Book of Records for sculling 2.5 pints of beer in 2.5 seconds. Classic drink: "Cardonay" or a "Sav" -- typically Austral-mangled wine varietals consumed either pre- or post-stubbie (of beer). But sculling 2.5 pints of beer in 2.5 seconds will do the trick every time.
