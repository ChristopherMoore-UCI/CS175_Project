-- Sen. Marco Rubio, who is considering a presidential run, said Sunday that President Barack Obama has thrown away valuable leverage to bring about political changes in Cuba. Defenders of Obama's decision to ease sanctions on Cuba and normalize diplomatic relations with the island nation, including Paul, have called the embargo and sanctions on Cuba a 50-year policy that has failed to provoke any political change and have pointed to U.S. decision decades ago to engage and trade with China and Vietnam. "Rand Paul, if he wants to align himself and become a supporter of the Obama foreign policy, particularly toward Cuba, that's his right, he has a right to do that," Rubio said on Sunday. " And while embracing that analogy, Rubio also dismissed a comparison between Cuba and China when prompted about whether he would end the U.S.'s trade relations with China if he became President, noting that there are "geopolitical realities" when it comes to the Asian power. "With all due respect, Sen. Marco Rubio was captain of the GOP cheerleading team for Obama's arming of Syrian rebels, bombing Libya resulting in a jihadist wonderland and illegally giving foreign aid to Egypt's military government.
