The Englishman and other officials had been traveling in a minibus behind the Sri Lankan team bus when bullets ripped through the vehicle, killing the driver and critically wounding fourth umpire Ahsan Reza. Meanwhile match referee Chris Broad criticized Pakistan's security forces for their conduct during the attack, claiming they had abandoned match officials traveling in the convoys as "sitting ducks." "I am extremely angry that we were promised high-level security and in our hour of need that security vanished and they left us to be sitting ducks. Gunmen jumped out of the cars and started firing, sending bullets ripping through the bus. "By that stage everyone was on the ground," Baylis told CNN. That's when we just hit the deck and suddenly we heard bullets thudding into the bus.
