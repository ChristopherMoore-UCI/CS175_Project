Whether you want to admit it or not, teenagers are sending sexual messages and naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and girlfriends. Some may feel they have an obligation to charge these teens with the most serious offense possible and, according to the law, naked pictures of underage kids are usually considered child porn. According to the study, 51 percent of girls say it's "pressure from guys" that's making them send sexual messages and pictures of themselves. Yes this kid needs to be punished but we don't need our 13 or 14-year-olds charged with child porn and lumped in with adult pedophiles and labeled as sex offenders. Alpert, 18, was convicted of transmission of child porn and he will carry the label of "sex offender" until he is 43.
