In his news conference Monday evening, Ibrahim denied the assertions and said Gadhafi forces were in "complete control" of al-Zawiya after having halted rebel attacks there. And in Assaba, east of Qawalish, also in the western mountains, rebel fighters had surrounded the city and negotiations were under way for Gadhafi forces to turn themselves in, Jwaili said. Gadhafi forces shelled al-Zawiya with Grad rockets from nearby Janzur, killing two rebels, bringing the number of dead in al-Zawiya to 11, with dozens more wounded, Jwaili said. NATO airstrikes, though, have hit Gadhafi forces in Janzur, aiding the rebels, he said. West of Sabrata, rebels surrounded Gadhafi forces inside a military camp, he said.
