The Bush presidency is stupid speeches, stupid high gas prices, stupid bad economy, stupid war on terrorism, stupid war on drugs, stupid hurricane fixing, stupid global warming, stupid war -- stupid, stupid, stupid. We'll have smart speeches, smart high gas prices, smart bad economy, smart war on terrorism, smart war on drugs, smart hurricanes, smart global warming, smart war in Georgia -- smart, smart, smart. He does smart speeches that promise everyone everything they need and make us feel good about our country and how much greater our government could be. I don't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me. It's hard to find someone running for president who would be content to be what George Washington humbly called the "chief magistrate."
