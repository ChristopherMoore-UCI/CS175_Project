Except for his getting married last month, Bruntrager told The Washington Post on Wednesday that Wilson mostly stayed out of the public eye. They told CNN that Wilson is in talks to leave the Ferguson Police Department and may give up being an officer altogether -- after a grand jury decided not to indict him in the death of Michael Brown. "He had to leave the grass, literally, half mowed," his lawyer, Neil Bruntrager, told CNN's Don Lemon late Wednesday. His time in hiding Wilson's shooting of the teen sparked days of sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. Days after he fatally shot an unarmed black teen in August, Officer Darren Wilson was cutting grass when he was told his home address was circulating online.
