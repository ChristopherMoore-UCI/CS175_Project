After the brutal civil war in Kosovo in the late 1990s, which pitched Kosovo Albanian insurgents against Serb security forces and Belgrade-backed Kosovo Serb paramilitaries, the country began operating under a U.N. mission and a NATO-led peacekeeping force. President Fatmir Sejdiu hailed a call from 100 Serb intellectuals urging Kosovo Serbs to take part in the elections and countered those Serbian voices he says are discouraging Kosovo Serbs from going to the polls. Next month, at the International Court of Justice, Serbia is expected to challenge Kosovo's independence -- recognized by the United States and other countries and entities. " "I believe the November elections are a critical opportunity for the Kosovo Serb community to assume much greater control of the day-to-day running of their own lives in ways that really matter," Dell said in a speech last month. The OSCE -- which had been organizing all elections in Kosovo since 2000 and now provides technical support and advice to Kosovo's Central Election Commission, "would certainly like to see an orderly process without incident on Sunday," Bucaj said.
