This means, for 2012, Zuckerberg will have to pay tax on the $2.3 billion at close to a 50% rate, federal and California taxes combined. One puzzle to tax experts is why Zuckerberg waited so long to cash out, causing that large ordinary income tax hit. Have you heard that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg will pay between $1 billion and $2 billion in taxes? At a minimum, buying shares during the IPO allowed Zuckerberg to cash out at the market top, and then to sell off shares -- as he did "for tax purposes" -- without any additional tax hit. Indeed, Zuckerberg now holds shares with tax losses built into them, which he can sell to offset capital gains elsewhere in his portfolio.
