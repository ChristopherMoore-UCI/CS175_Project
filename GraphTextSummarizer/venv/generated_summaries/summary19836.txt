One solution I've found to all this madness to invoke the spirit of the Great Pumpkin, who collects candy left on doorsteps every Halloween night to replace the candy with a real treat -- a book, new computer game, skateboard, etc. So, are you a bad parent if you let your children eat Halloween candy? Children are more vulnerable to the effects of candy than adults because they often aren't aware of the ramifications (such as a $1,400 root canal that comes later in life), and they don't brush, floss and take other actions to negate the effects of bad decisions. The effects of candy have compounding ramifications as children get older. In this way, Halloween candy may be a gateway to serious systemic diseases. -- Every Halloween, I get the same questions from parents: "Should I let my kids have candy?" "How much candy is safe?"
