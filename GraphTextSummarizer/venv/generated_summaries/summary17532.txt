According to a senior House Democratic aide, Democratic Rep Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represented House Democrats in discussions with the administration and Republicans, said the decision to accept the GOP estate tax proposal was "an unnecessary giveaway to Kyl." GOP Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who was negotiating for Senate Republicans, sponsored an estate tax bill that is essentially the same as the deal outlined by Obama. House Democrats vented their frustrations with President Barack Obama's tax proposal at a closed-door meeting Tuesday night, with rank-and-file members slamming the White House for leaving House Democrats out of final negotiations, and agreeing too quickly to a GOP proposal on the estate tax. According to the senior Democratic aide, in addition to concerns about the substance of the proposal, equally upsetting to attendees was how "House Democrats were left out of the process at the end." The aide added, "they view it as a trend," noting that it started with the president's stimulus package. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk to House Democrats Wednesday afternoon. Hoyer didn't directly answer whether he believed House Democrats could make significant changes to the administration's plan, saying, "I think it's under discussion," but he added, "the majority of the House is still Democratic"
