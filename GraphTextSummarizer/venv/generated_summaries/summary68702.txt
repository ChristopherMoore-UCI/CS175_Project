North Korea conducted a nuclear test in May, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. "It's part of military training, but there seem to be no movements of troops or anything that would suggest preparations for military operations. "North Korea needs to stop this type of activity and return to the process of bringing about a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." The intelligence official, who could also not be named for security reasons, said the launches came as no surprise because North Korea had issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a "military firing exercise," according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN. Russian military experts are carefully studying the reports but the launches will not change the political situation, a spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry said.
