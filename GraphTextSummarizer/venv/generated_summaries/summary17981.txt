"Of course, they have to take care of the security of the city and, of course, our concern now is where is Gadhafi," he said, referring to longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. In July, rebel military council member Mohammad Ethish released a statement that appeared to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with Younis' killing. It includes representatives from throughout Libya and is headed by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, its chairman and a former justice minister under Gadhafi. "They seek an undefined moderate Islamist state with an active civil society." Lamen also cited "older regime elements," including "technocrats of the old regime, the military, the revolution committees and professional syndicates." Saad Djebbar, a lawyer who negotiated the release in Scotland two years ago of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie, said it is vital to establish a "coalition of cultures" that would represent all regions, tribes and factions to ensure a stable Libya post-Gadhafi. There is concern about the NTC continuing to lead the new government during any transition because its members are self-selected and drawn largely from eastern Libya.
