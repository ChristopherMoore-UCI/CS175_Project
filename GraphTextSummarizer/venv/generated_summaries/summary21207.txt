-- Even "the office cat" knew about phone hacking at News of the World, a former journalist at the tabloid insisted in court Wednesday, testifying that his phone hacking skills were the main reason former Editor Andy Coulson hired him. Testy exchanges Coulson's attorney, Timothy Langdale, spent Wednesday grilling Evans about subjects from the mechanics of phone hacking to his efforts to get immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. At the height of the phone hacking furor in July 2011, Cameron said he would make a profound apology if it turned out that Coulson had lied about his knowledge of phone hacking. But he continued hacking phones at News of the World, he testified, saying it was "absolutely" the reason Coulson hired him. A similar exchange came later Wednesday morning when Langdale attacked Evans' assertion that phone hacking was discussed at the main weekly News of the World news meeting.
