Interactive: U.S. and allied assets around Syria Administration officials said Tuesday Obama is expected to meet briefly with Putin at this week's G-20 summit -- "on the margins," one White House official said. During a fast-paced three-day overseas trip that includes visits to Stockholm, Sweden and a G-20 summit in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the president will face allied, yet skeptical leaders who remain unconvinced that military action is necessary to punish Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Obama-Putin will have a chance to talk on 'margins' of G-20 summit White House officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have complained of Russian obstruction to any United Nations intervention in Syria's bloody civil war. But Obama's principal adversary on Syria, Putin, appeared to open the door to U.N.-sanctioned military action in an interview with the Associated Press and Russia's state Channel 1. However, the president is only visiting the Scandinavian nation as a result of his administration's decision to cancel a bilateral summit in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the latest example of worsening U.S.-Russian relations.
