-- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro lashed out at U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday for demanding changes on the island in order to improve bilateral relations and referred to him as "stupid." On Wednesday, Obama told Hispanic journalists that he would be willing to change the country's tough line on Cuba "when we start seeing a serious intention on the part of the Cuban government to provide liberty for its people." On Thursday, Castro responded with sarcasm in a written essay published in Cuban state media. He went on to say many things would change in Cuba, but only thanks to Cubans' own efforts and "despite" the United States. He also slammed a recent ruling by a U.S. judge against a Cuban agent, but he said it was to be expected.
