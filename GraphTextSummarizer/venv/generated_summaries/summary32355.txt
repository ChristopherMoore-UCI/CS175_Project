In a brief new commercial, Tim "Trivago Guy" Williams comes across as more polished than the disheveled pitchman he was a few months ago. The winner was Aaron Marino, an Atlanta-based style consultant (PDF) who not only got to reshape Williams' image, he received a five-day trip to Berlin to watch the new spot get shot. The new look is a response to the complaints -- some wry, some serious -- the company got after an earlier series of ads featuring Williams. The company sponsored a contest to give Williams a style makeover. As one person on Twitter wrote, "I had no idea #trivagoGuy was a thing, but I do know that my wife and I both wondered why homeless people were doing travel ads."
