Theoretical physicists noted even before the Higgs discovery that its relatively high mass would mean lower energy states exist. So, the simplified argument goes like something like this -- the Higgs particle pervades space roughly uniformly, with a relatively high mass -- about 126 times that of the proton (a basic building block of atoms). Having space time gobbled up by instability in the Higgs field. It's the combination of the Higgs and top quark masses that determine whether our universe is stable. The physics underlying this speculation is related to the Higgs particle, whose discovery was announced July 4, 2012, at the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest particle accelerator, in Geneva, Switzerland.
