KABUL, Afghanistan (Reuters)  -- Former Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, died on Monday, aged 92, presidential palace sources said. Zahir Shah came from a long line of ethnic Pashtun rulers and is a distant relative of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Daoud was later killed in a coup and after Soviet troops entered the country in 1979 to prop up the communist government, Afghanistan has barely seen peace. Zahir Shah ruled Afghanistan from 1933 until he was deposed by his cousin in 1973. Zahir Shah ruled Afghanistan from 1933 until he was deposed by his cousin in 1973.
