-- President Barack Obama interrupted a campaign speech twice on Thursday to seek help for people in the audience who collapsed. Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady said that between 1:45 and 2 p.m., about an hour before Obama's speech, ambulance crews stationed at the campus as part of the White House event responded to reports of people "fainting, getting dizzy, and otherwise passing out. "I think we might have had somebody faint down here, so if we got the paramedics," Obama said about halfway through his remarks under bright afternoon sunshine at Bowie State University. Prince George's County medical personnel said they responded to a number of sick cases at the university on Thursday. The president was stumping for Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is seeking re-election.
