French striker Cyril Thereau put the home side ahead in the first half but La Viola leveled only a minute later when Argentine defender Guillermo Rodriguez scored after a corner. Rodrigo Palacio added the clinching second with five minutes to go as Diego Milito set up his fellow Argentine to score his first goal for Inter. Inter Milan secured their fourth straight victory in Italy's top flight Sunday with a 2-0 win over Catania to maintain their pursuit of unbeaten Serie A leaders Juventus. Lazio's 3-2 win over struggling Milan has left them in third ahead of Inter on goal difference. Boosted by their 1-0 defeat of AC Milan in the city derby last weekend, Inter were always on top in the San Siro after star man Antonio Cassano headed home in the 28th minute.
