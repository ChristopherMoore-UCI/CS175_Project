-- A lawyer for Angelina Jolie's former body double -- who is suing Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. over alleged phone hacking -- said Tuesday that other people have contacted his team with their own claims. The defendants "knew or should have known that executives, employees and agents of The Sun and News of the World were engaged in widespread phone hacking," the suit alleges. Siegel said he also represents families of victims killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks whose phones may have been hacked by News Corp. employees, and that the FBI has opened an investigation.
