By Thursday evening, Baltimore police said they'd determined that Paul Warren Pardus, 50, of Arlington, Virginia, shot a Johns Hopkins doctor late Thursday morning after becoming distraught over an update he had received about his mother's medical condition. When they detected no movement, police entered to find the suspect and his mother dead, Baltimore Police Commissioner Frederick Bealefeld said. By 5:20 p.m., police said that the suspect had been using an alias, and that his real name was Paul Warren Pardus. Pardus then retreated to his mother's room, where he fatally shot his mother and then himself, Baltimore police said. But earlier, details about Pardus' name, how he died, and even whether he died -- at one point a hospital spokesman said he'd been apprehended, when police said he hadn't -- had been reported differently.
