-- Prosecutors across Delaware are dropping charges in scores of drug cases -- and thousands of others remain in limbo -- as an investigation continues into missing evidence at the chief medical examiner's drug lab. The drug lab has remained closed, and the state is sending drug evidence to a private lab in Pennsylvania to be analyzed. In February, Delaware State Police announced a joint investigation with the Delaware attorney general's office after drug evidence at the state's controlled-substances lab had gone missing, been tampered with or been substituted. "Access to the drug evidence locker was not restricted to, or monitored by, a single individual and could be accessed by any OCME employee with a passkey and a passcode," Deputy Attorney General Caroline Cleary wrote in a letter, dated April 16, to O'Neill's office. At the time, there were 3,700 pending drug cases, 500 of which were felony cases.
