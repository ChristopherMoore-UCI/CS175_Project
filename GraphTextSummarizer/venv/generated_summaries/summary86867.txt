"Smuggling and infiltration into Israel from its western border is used by terror organizations to execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers," the Israeli military said in the statement. -- Israeli soldiers apprehended three suspects who tried to cross into Israel while patrolling their country's border with Egypt, authorities said Thursday. Israel says the incident occurred after the suspects refused to comply with Israeli orders to stop. Al Masry also rejected an Israeli statement that described last month's apparent discovery of an explosive device along the border, while also scolding Israel for "politicizing" the incident. "They crossed over from South Rafah in northern Sinai," said Gen. Saleh Al Masry.
