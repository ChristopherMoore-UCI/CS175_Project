Ancelotti has won Europe's top club competition as both player and coach with AC Milan, and is well aware of Al-Khelaifi's vision for PSG and the need for him to deliver Champions League football to the Parc des Princes next season. "This club does not have a big history like Milan, like other clubs like Manchester United, like Real Madrid, like Barcelona," the 52-year-old, who replaced Antoine Kombouare in December, told CNN. The club targeted superstar David Beckham and Argentina forward Carlos Tevez in December and January but both players ended up staying at their respective teams, Los Angeles Galaxy and Manchester City. Since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in May 2011, significant steps have been taken, on and off the pitch, to make sure PSG can challenge for major titles -- and new manager Carlo Ancelotti is under no illusions about what is expected of him. " Ancelotti's appointment at PSG has also seen him reunited with Leonardo, who he managed in two separate spells at Milan.
