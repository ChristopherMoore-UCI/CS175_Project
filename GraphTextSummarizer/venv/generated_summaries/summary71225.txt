Investigation continues in another case Friday's arraignment comes as authorities continue to investigate Hernandez in connection with an unsolved 2012 double homicide case in Boston. For his part, according to a TMZ report last month, Hernandez declared his innocence as he responded to a fan letter, saying that "all the people who turned on me will feel like crap." Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the shooting of his friend Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. After Lloyd's murder, Bristol, Connecticut police discovered the vehicle by accident while searching the garage of Hernandez's uncle, a law enforcement source told CNN. "He's bearing up under the pressure," defense attorney Michael Fee said when Hernandez was indicted last month.
