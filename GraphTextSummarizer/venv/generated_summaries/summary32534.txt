Medicine Nobel Prize goes for work on cells that form brain's GPS system This uses light to make individual molecules glow and allows a dense super-image to be resolved at the nanolevel. Hell, of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, GÃ¶ttingen, and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, both in Germany, developed a way to use two laser beams to make individual molecules glow on and off. Two Americans and a German won the Nobel Prize in chemistry this year for their work on optical microscopy that has opened up our understanding of molecules by allowing us to see how they work close up. Speaking to the Nobel committee by phone after the prize was announced, Hell said the development of nanoscopy was "very important to life scientists" because the use of focused light is the only way to see how the body works at a cellular level. Committee chairman Sven Lidin said that thanks to their development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, cells could be studied close up and the boundary between chemistry and biology had blurred.
