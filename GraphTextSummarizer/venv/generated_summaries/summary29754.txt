Courts, however, have traditionally given wide leeway for airport screening under the Fourth Amendment, according to Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who specializes in American constitutional law. A few randomly selected passengers will be subjected to a pat down even if they clear the metal detector or AIT machine. The only noticeable difference may be the presence of the AIT machines, which are larger than metal detectors. Q) Are kids exempt from enhanced pat-downs? The AIT scans the exterior of the body, and should therefore not detect the presence of metal inside the body.
