-- Fidel Castro has released a previously unannounced two-volume memoir of his life, Cuban state-run media reported Saturday. The two volumes, titled "Fidel Castro Ruz: Guerrilla of Time," is based on conversations with the writer and journalist Katiuska Blanco. In a six-hour presentation Friday, the leader of the Cuban Revolution and former president was jovial as he spoke about the 1,000-page work, the Granma newspaper reported. A Cuban writer, Graziella Pogolotti, said she encouraged Castro to continue writing, despite the challenges of recalling the past, Granma reported. "They are going to talk to you about two books that you had no idea about," Castro said, according to Granma.
