A royal spokesperson said: "Kensington Palace has a working kitchen provided by the Sovereign (public) Grant to support receptions and other public events which might be hosted there. That's what the British taxpayer has put toward the refurbishment of Apartment 1a, Kensington Palace, which recently became the official residence of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George. So was Kensington Palace given priority over other repairs? The Queen received Â£36.1 million ($61.3 million) from the British Government for the 2013-14 financial year in what's called "The Sovereign Grant," and it covers the costs of her public duties and the upkeep of palaces including Kensington. For example, public money was used to renovate the existing kitchen, but Catherine and William wanted a second "family kitchen," which they paid for themselves.
