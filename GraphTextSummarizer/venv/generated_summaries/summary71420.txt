Prior to the season opener in Australia last month, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone told the sport's elite teams to cut their spending, while suggesting a mandatory budget cap could be introduced. "In my view, the future should indeed lie in some kind of budget cap under which each and every team could do what they want to, because we all have different strengths," Monisha Kaltenborn, CEO of the Swiss-based team, said in an interview with Formula1.com. They have to refocus again on the basics -- on racing, spending on the sport -- and not on baronial motor homes and all kinds of entertainment," Ecclestone told Formula1.com. The chief executive of Formula One team Sauber has backed recent calls for a budget cap saying that it would make the sport "more interesting." After what Kaltenborn described as "painful" second half to last season, she says the team is now settling down after the departure of manufacturer BMW at the end of 2009.
