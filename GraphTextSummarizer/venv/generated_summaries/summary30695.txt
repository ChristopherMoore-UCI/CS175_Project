Christmas Day could easily have gone into history as another day nearly as infamous as Pearl Harbor day or 9/11. We as taxpayers are now spending billions on airport security and other intelligence to keep us safe. Airport security was a joke, and our national intelligence apparatus was a bunch of fiefdoms that didn't want to cooperate and wouldn't share information with each other. The United States was attacked, allegedly by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who got past whatever security precautions might have stopped him from boarding Northwest Flight 253 for Detroit, Michigan. Her boss, the president, made that plain in his comments Tuesday: "The bottom line is this: The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack, but our intelligence community failed to connect those dots which would have placed the suspect on the no-fly list," Obama said.
