"Mr. Hicks has made a number of admissions regarding his activities, including in letters to his family and in his book, for example that he undertook training with militia and terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and that he had met Osama bin Laden on many occasions and considered him a 'brother.' "David Hicks can now be truly free of Guantanamo." Hicks was captured by U.S. troops in 2001 in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led attacks against the Taliban were launched. The court found that the activity for which Hicks was convicted was not an offense triable by military commission at the time he was caught. In a statement, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis said the ruling was based on a question of law, not on whether Hicks had engaged in the alleged activities. A U.S. military appeals court on Wednesday vacated the conviction of David Hicks, an Australian who pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorism.
