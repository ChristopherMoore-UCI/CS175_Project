Obama said he called New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday night to commend him for the way he's handled protests that erupted in the city. "When it comes, as we've seen unfortunately in recent days, to our criminal justice system, too many Americans feel deep unfairness when it comes to the gap between our professed ideals and how the laws are applied on a day to day basis," he said during an address during the White House's College Opportunity Day of Action. The Grand Jury decision not to indict the police officer who killed Eric Garner, an African American father of six, sparked protests throughout New York City and across the nation Wednesday night, just over a week after another acquittal in the death of a black teen at the hands of a white police officer prompted similar unrest across the nation. -- President Barack Obama on Thursday said that the recent events surrounding the deaths of two black men at the hands of white police officers underscore that "too many Americans feel deep unfairness" with respect to the criminal justice system. But he characterized the challenge ahead as greater than simply reforming the criminal justice system and restoring a sense of justice â€” rather, Obama said, there's a need to restore "a sense of common purpose" in America.
