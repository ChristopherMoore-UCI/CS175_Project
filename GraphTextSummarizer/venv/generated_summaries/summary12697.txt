Federal authorities have tied al-Odah to al Qaeda on a number of fronts, including that his name appeared in a document on the terrorist group's official website and that his passport was found in an al Qaeda safe house Yet his father, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the first Gulf War, says al-Odah has been wrongly imprisoned. -- A Kuwaiti man tied to al Qaeda, who was in Afghanistan in the days after 9/11, is out of the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he'd been held for the last 12 years, the Pentagon said Tuesday. He was in the longtime Taliban stronghold of Kandahar on September 11, 2001, the day that members of al Qaeda -- the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden that had found a home in Afghanistan -- hijacked four U.S. commercial airliners and crashed them, killing nearly 3,000 people. Tora Bora is where U.S. forces and their allies cornered bin Laden in December 2001, before he managed to escape into Pakistan, according to a U.S. Senate report. Al-Odah was then passed to U.S. authorities, and he was moved to Guantanamo Bay in early 2002.
