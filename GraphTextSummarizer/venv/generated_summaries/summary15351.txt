The latest figures available for Spain and Greece put youth unemployment over 50% with many young people choosing to migrate to northern Europe, where job prospects are considerably better. Instead, Beccalli-Falco argued that Europe needed to open its borders to young people looking to escape chronic unemployment. Speaking with CNN's Max Foster, Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, chief executive officer of GE Europe, said: "You have some areas of Europe where unemployment is 30, 40, 50%," he added, "that drives the thinking that if you go nationalistic you're going to solve the problem." Despite the eurozone posting a meagre 0.1% growth in the third-quarter Beccalli-Falco believes that "any kind of fragmentation" in Europe's political and economic union would only damage growth further. -- Europe must stop being nationalistic if it wants to help a lost generation of workers, the regional boss of U.S. conglomerate General Electric says.
