-- More emotion, aggressive leadership overseas, fresh ideas and active bipartisanship: That's the advice four former White House chiefs of staff have for President Obama as he faces the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate and crises around the world and at home. Former Chiefs of Staff Bill Daley, who worked for Obama from 2011-12; Andrew Card from George W. Bush's White House; Mack McLarty of the Clinton administration; and Ken Duberstein, who worked for Ronald Reagan, sat down with Candy Crowley on Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." "That message is not resonating with the American people." Both Card and McLarty agreed that the President's focus on international leadership on the threat of ISIS, Ebola and relations with Russia is essential for a leader facing gridlock in Congress. "They have to demonstrate an ability to govern, the same way President Obama needs to reach out and start building relationships, not just with Democrats but with Republicans." In response to critics who say the President has not showed enough leadership in facing these issues, Daley said that if Obama appears as if he's phoning it in, it's a misperception.
