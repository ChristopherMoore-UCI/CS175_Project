" Women have been the center of attention throughout much of the Olympics, both within and without Games venues, as they broke records, sparked drama, impressed with immense skill and poise and won medal after medal. Despite such media storms, overall many sensed a shift in the right direction, a sea change in attitudes towards women in competitive sports. This understated entrance marked an extraordinary moment for the kingdom and for the Olympics itself, as the first occasion in the history of the Games when all countries participating have had women athletes in their teams. For hosts Great Britain, the undoubted superstar was Jessica Ennis, a heptathlete of remarkable talent and composure who snatched gold despite immense pressure and the unforgiving lens of modern celebrity. Tunisia's Habiba Ghribi became her country's first woman to win a medal in the games, saying afterward her medal was "for all the Tunisian people, for Tunisian women, for the new Tunisia".
