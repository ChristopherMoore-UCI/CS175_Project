Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had attempted to reach Anna Stoehr after his company sent an apology about the age restriction, according to her daughter-in-law Marlene Stoehr. Anna Stoehr of Plainview, Minnesota, gained widespread attention in October when she said she'd had to lie about her age to sign up for the social network. Lived on a farm until she was 112 Facebook isn't the only area where Anna Stoehr stood out -- she was also the oldest person in Minnesota. "She turned 114 in October of this year and received a huge bouquet of 114 flowers from Facebook after they learned that she was not able to sign up without putting in a fake age of 90 or 95," Harlan Stoehr, her 84-year-old eldest son, told CNN on Tuesday. When Facebook didn't have her birth year as an option, Ramireza helped Stoehr write a letter to Zuckerberg -- on a typewriter.
