Thus began the creation of the mind-controlled exoskeleton, or what Nicolelis and his colleagues call a "brain-machine interface," a way of connecting brain tissue to artificial devices. Before there was a mind-controlled exoskeleton, there was a neuroscientist named Dr. Miguel Nicolelis who was curious about "brain storms," flurries of activity caused by neurons at any given moment. " Nicolelis wanted to know how brain storms generated behavior, so he began recording them. "We wanted to understand how large populations of brain cells interact," how memories are built, how we move our bodies or how we sense the world around us, said Nicolelis. "We are able to show that you can read the signals and send them to devices," said Nicolelis, adding that the devices, in turn, move according to the voluntary intention of the patient.
