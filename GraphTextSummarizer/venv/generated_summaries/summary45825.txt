The Park City version uses local vodka and wears a green cap of wasabi and celery mousse. Like many Rocky Mountain ski towns, Park City's vibe is part snowhemian, part Patagucci. Accordingly, instead of skis, I brought three books and "National Lampoon's Vacation/European Vacation" double-feature DVD. We parked ourselves at High West, a handsome whiskey distillery, restaurant and saloon built in a turn-of-the-century house and livery stable on the edge of town. Which means peak times can be easy sailing.
