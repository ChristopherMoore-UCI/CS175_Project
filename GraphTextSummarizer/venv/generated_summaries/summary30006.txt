Others Republican governors seen as prospective presidential candidates, like Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, have been outspoken opponents of Obamacare, refusing to implement it and saying they'd like to see it repealed. Kasich angered conservatives when he bypassed Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature and embraced Obamacare's Medicaid expansion last year. In states that have expanded Medicaid, Democratic Senate candidates like Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky have pressed their Republican opponents about what would happen to the hundreds of thousands of low-income residents who now have health coverage. A Kasich spokesman said the governor was referring solely to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion -- not the entire law -- and that his comments were reported out of context. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has sought a middle ground, arguing for a version of the Medicaid expansion that includes changes such as individual health savings accounts requiring personal contributions -- a program initially crafted under his predecessor, Mitch Daniels.
