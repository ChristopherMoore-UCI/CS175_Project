The 48-year-old Mancini's dismissal follows City's shock FA Cup defeat by Wigan on Saturday and their inability to defend the English Premier League title the club won last season, with rivals Manchester United running away with the league this season. After buying City, Sheikh Mansour invested more than $600 million on players like Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Carlos Tevez, and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors Manchester United to the title on goal difference last season. The buildup to the FA Cup had been overshadowed with widespread rumors that Mancini, who signed a five year deal last July, would be replaced by former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, who guided Malaga to this year's Champions League quarterfinals. Mancini's dismissal comes a year to the day since City beat Queens Park Rangers to win its first top-flight title in 44 years and nearly two years to the day since he won the club's first trophy in 35 years, when beating Stoke City in the 2011 FA Cup final. "I categorically deny I am the new Manchester City coach, nothing has been signed and no agreement reached," said the Chilean.
