Gourcuff thumped home the second in stoppage time to seal a vital three points, their second straight victory taking them top of Group D with six points from three games. In one frantic spell in the second half, he denied Mathieu Valbuena, Karim Benzema and Samir Nasri with a string of stunning saves. -- Substitutes Loic Remy and Yoann Gourcuff scored late goals as France boosted their Euro 2012 qualifying campaign with a 2-0 victory over Romania in the Stade de France on Saturday night. But Romania were also a threat and soon afterwards thought they had gone ahead through Cristian Sapunaru, but his shot, after a mistake by Gael Clichy, hit the inside of the post and into the grateful arms of Hugo Lloris. France, looking to rebound after a disastrous World Cup and losing their group opener to Belarus, produced a lively first half display and Benzema came close to opening the scoring as his curling effort shaved the outside of the post.
