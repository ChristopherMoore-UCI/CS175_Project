President Franklin D. Roosevelt, knowing he had the nation on his side, threw down the gauntlet when he proclaimed: "All but the hopeless reactionary will agree that to conserve our primary resources of manpower, government must have some control over maximum hours, minimum wages, the evil of child labor, and the exploitation of unorganized labor." States had tried to institute minimum wages, but the United States Supreme Court repeatedly struck down those state laws. Some states have their own minimum-wage standards that are higher than the federal rate; the states are free to demand that workers earn more per hour than the federal $7.25 level, but may not pass laws that pay workers less. And so, in 1938, the first federal minimum wage went into effect: Twenty-five cents per hour. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour; Obama wants it to be raised to $9 per hour.
