A new Food and Drug Administration report, "Pathogens and Filth in Spices," says that 12% of U.S. spice imports are contaminated with bug parts, rodent hairs and other ingredients more appropriate to a witches' brew than your mother's favorite recipe. The amount of "filth" the FDA found in imported spice was twice that found in other kinds of imported food. The FDA says it has increased its inspections of spice facilities and will take further action to strengthen the spice safety net. The FDA study also found that 7% of spice imports the inspectors examined were contaminated with salmonella. The report points out most of the contamination likely comes from what it describes as "poor storage practices." Deem said it is not a big surprise the FDA would find some issues with spices that arrive in the United States in raw form.
