The relentless pace of New York life means no neighborhood maintains its identity for too long -- you won't find many Italians in Little Italy these days. When most people think of New York they think of Manhattan, but there are of course four other boroughs in the city, each made up of countless distinct neighborhoods. New York is a celebrity city -- even if you've never been there you'll recognize it from countless movies and TV cop shows. New York City is the quintessential metropolis, the city other cities aspire to be. Frenetic, chaotic and glamorous, it may not be the capital of America, or even New York State, but in many ways it's the capital of the world.
