-- Former Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali said Monday he has been unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. Ben Ali argued, contrary to the assertions of his opponents, that he has always worked for what he thought "was the good of the Tunisian people, improving living standards and progressing on the path to modernity." Protests against Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- began to erupt late last year. At least 300 people were killed and 700 injured during the Tunisian uprising, a top U.N. human rights expert said last month. The former leader denied allegations that he has improper bank accounts or property holdings outside of Tunisia.
