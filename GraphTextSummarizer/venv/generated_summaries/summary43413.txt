Substiute Memphis Depay was the hero for the Dutch, becoming his country's youngest ever World Cup scorer, lashing home the winner just 10 minutes after Robin van Persie had dragged his side level. The Netherlands, which had trailed 2-1 after Mile Jedinak's penalty had given Australia shock 54th minute lead, eventually prevailed 3-2 in a pulsating and often breathtaking affair. Depay burst forward towards the penalty area and his low effort flew in off the fingertips off Australia goalkeeper Matthew Ryan. Last Friday, Netherlands brought the tournament to life with one of the greatest results in recent World Cup history. Cahill's fifth World Cup goal - and possibly his last -- was worth the entrance fee alone.
