-- Three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond has told International Cycling Union (UCI) president Pat McQuaid to resign, accusing the Irishman of "abusing his power." LeMond called on McQuaid and his predecessor -- honorary UCI president Hein Verbruggen -- to quit, insisting that progress in the sport can only be made if they step aside. The UCI has come under fire amid the doping scandal that implicated Lance Armstrong in "the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen. LeMond's comments are sure to intensify the pressure on McQuaid and the UCI after it was revealed they failed to pick up signs of doping in Armstrong despite testing him over 200 times. McQuaid has insisted a $100,000 donation from Armstrong to the UCI in 2002, revealed in USADA's report, was not part of a cover-up.
