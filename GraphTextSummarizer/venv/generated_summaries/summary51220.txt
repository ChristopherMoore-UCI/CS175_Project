"Leonard Nimoy showed a young, nerdy, bullied me that not only could science be important and valued, but it could literally save entire ships, planets, and galaxies of lives," he said. Longtime friend and co-star William Shatner remembered Nimoy "like a brother. The hashtag #LLAP, which stands for "Live long and prosper" and which Nimoy used to sign his tweets,  was trending across several social media platforms after the news of his death. His co-stars, fellow celebrities and fans reacted with heartfelt tributes from around the world and all the way to space, where astronaut Terry W. Wirts flashed a Vulcan salute aboard the International Space Station. And then there were the ordinary fans -- Trekkies, aspiring actors and science geeks who related to Nimoy's brainy Spock character -- who posted personal messages and remembrances.
