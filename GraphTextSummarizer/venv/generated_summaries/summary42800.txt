"Gayus is just the tip of the iceberg, his case indicates rampant corruption in the judiciary system, the tax office and the immigration office but the main issue seems to be avoided," said  Adrianus Meliala, a criminology professor and police observer. "I'm really disappointed with legal system mafia task force (formed to combat corruption in the judiciary system), who didn't investigate the high level officials and instead politicized the issue. -- An Indonesian court on Wednesday handed a seven-year sentence to a former tax official for corruption in a case that  exposed rampant government graft. Gayus Tambunan was also fined 300 million rupiah ($30,000 ) after being found guilty of corruption. This case doesn't surprise me because corruption has become a culture in the tax office and this shows that the reform process is far from finished."
