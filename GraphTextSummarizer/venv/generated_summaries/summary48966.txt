Kim Clijsters, who won the $4.5 million season-ending event in 2002 and 2003, earlier triumphed in her opening White Group match 6-2 6-3 against fellow former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic despite serving 10 double-faults. The Australian romped to her second straight victory in the Maroon Group, following her revenge win over French Open champion Francesca Schiavone on Tuesday. The 40-year-old, who twice won the teams event as a player, takes charge ahead of next March's World Group first-round clash with Chile. Azarenka was disappointed after squandering a great chance to upset second-seeded Russian Vera Zvonareva, with the Belarusian losing 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 in the day's first match despite leading by a break in both sets. Wozniacki, who thrashed seventh seed Dementieva on Tuesday, will next take on Italy's Schiavone on Thursday.
