"SolaRoad is a world first that will put the Netherlands on the map as a leader in sustainable innovation," said Henk Kamp, the Dutch minister of economic affairs, at the opening. The path is made of concrete modules with solar cells and covered with a thin layer of tempered glass. Testing will continue for three years to further develop solar roads, officials said. The world's first road capable of turning sunlight into energy officially opened for traffic Wednesday in the Netherlands. The energy created from the road can power things like street and traffic lights or households, according to company officials.
