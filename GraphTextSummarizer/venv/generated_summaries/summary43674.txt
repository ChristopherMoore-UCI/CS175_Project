-- A quiet rendition of "Amazing Grace" capped an emotional candlelight vigil Monday night for slain Yale University student Annie Le, whose body was found on what was to have been her wedding day. Students at Yale attend a candlelight vigil for Annie Le Monday night. A Yale professor said on Monday that the building has good security and only certain people can enter, let alone access certain areas. Kaplan said Le's killing has left Yale students shocked and wary. Yale also added security personnel inside Sterling Hall of Medicine, where Annie Le had her lab."
