NBC News has shuttered EveryBlock, a hyperlocal news site that pulled in and mapped useful information from a variety of rich sources, including Craigslist posts, police reports, restaurant inspections and Yelp reviews. You could see Flickr photos, recent muggings, local news stories and home foreclosures on your street, viewed as a map, list or RSS feed. Over the years the site expanded beyond Chicago to deliver local news for 19 cities, including San Francisco, Atlanta, New York and Los Angeles. "Though EveryBlock has been able to build an engaged community over the years, we're faced with the decision to wrap things up." Chicago always remained the most popular EveryBlock city, accounting for more than half  the site's traffic, according to Alexa rankings.
