Group D would appear to be the most evenly contested group at the finals, with Didier Drogba's Ivory Coast -- who have lost two of the last finals on a penalty shoot-out alone -- taking on Algeria, Tunisia and a Togo side that boasts Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor. The draw for Africa's premier sporting event took place on Wednesday in Durban, a city which will host a handful of Group A games. Meanwhile, Tunisia won the competition on home soil in 2004 while the Togolese are set to play at their first Nations Cup since withdrawing from the 2010 edition in Angola after two members of their delegation were killed in a terror attack in the state of Cabinda. South Africa will use five World Cup stadiums for the Nations Cup -- with Port Elizabeth and Rustenburg joining Durban, Nelspruit and Johannesburg -- with the latter city set to host the tournament finale on 10 February. and I think this is a fairly good draw for us," South Africa coach Gordon Igesund told the website of African football's ruling body CAF.
