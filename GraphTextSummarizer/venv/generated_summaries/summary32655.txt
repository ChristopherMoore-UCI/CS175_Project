The selling price nearly tripled Rockwell's previous auction record, "Breaking Home Ties" which sold for $15.4 million in 2006, according to Sotheby's. -- Norman Rockwell's painting "Saying Grace" sold for $46 million -- a record for works by the late artist and for a single American painting -- Wednesday at Sotheby's American Art auction. "We are thrilled -- it's a really great moment for American art and for Rockwell," Elizabeth Goldberg, head of the American Art Department at Sotheby's, said. Seven of Rockwell's paintings sold Wednesday came from the family of Kenneth J. Stuart Sr. -- a longtime friend of the artist, and art editor at The Saturday Evening Post -- and nearly totaled $60 million, according to Sotheby's. Rockwell is remembered most as the illustrator of The Saturday Evening Post, where he captured Americans' day-to-day lives.
