Although he couldn't give exact numbers, Special Agent Stephen Emmett told CNN that the number of "sovereign citizens" taking over homes by fraudulent means has grown by the dozens. "This threat was made to a representative of the mortgage company and reported to our office," said Major Jeff Mitchell of the Clayton County Sheriff's Department The male resident, who claimed to be associated with the Black Hebrew Israelites, had first gone to court, arguing, "It would be unfortunate that the people are subject to Sheriff as the peace breaker and promoter of unhappiness, and the people have to protect themselves from the ones employed to protect the people," Mitchell said. The FBI said sovereign citizens are responsible for many crimes, including impersonating police officers, threatening judges and using fake currency and documents. "We are working with the FBI to identify possible sovereign citizens living within Clayton County," Mitchell said. According to the FBI, sovereign citizens don't believe they need to adhere to federal law.
