Edwards' letter also raised the possibility that two others involved in presidential trip preparations may have "had contact with foreign nationals." "Although allegations related to the non-USSS (U.S. Secret Service) personnel were outside the scope of the investigation, one of these employees is a Department of Defense employee affiliated with the White House Communication Agency and the other, whose employment status was not verified, may have been affiliated with the White House advance operation," Edwards wrote to House and Senate members interested in the matter. A senior administration official said inaccurate hotel records implicated a volunteer working for White House advance. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine issued a statement saying she was "troubled that the IG's findings reveal White House personnel may have been involved." She said the White House press secretary said on April 23 that a review by its counsel's office concluded there were "no credible allegations of misconduct by anyone on the White House advance team or the White House staff. "Although we found that these agents engaged in misconduct, our investigation developed no evidence to suggest that the actions of USSS (U.S. Secret Service) personnel in Cartagena compromised the safety and security of the president or any sensitive information during this trip," Charles Edwards wrote to House and Senate members concerned about the matter.
