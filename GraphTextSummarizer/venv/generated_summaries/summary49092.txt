I loved Betty Hutton and Judy Garland and all the musicals, and I came into the business after entering the Miss Burbank contest, doing a Betty Hutton imitation and winning the prize, which led to a studio contract and the beginning of my career. (The Hollywood Reporter)Announcing Debbie Reynolds as this year's recipient of the SAG Life Achievement Award, SAG-AFTRA president Ken Howard saluted her as "a tremendously talented performer with a diverse body of screen and stage work, live performances and several hit records." Reynolds, 82, has been performing since age 16, when she won the title of Miss Burbank. I also loved "How the West Was Won," "The Tender Trap" with Frank Sinatra, "The Mating Game" with Tony Randall â€” and I had great fun working on "Goodbye Charlie" with Walter Matthau, who I thought was a wonderful man. It would have been great fun.
