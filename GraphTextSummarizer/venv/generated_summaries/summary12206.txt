It was a trial that drew criticism from international rights groups, who accused UAE authorities of "serious pretrial violations of fair trial rights." The charges, according to judicial authorities, stem from Article 180 of the country's penal code, which bans "establishing, instituting, founding, organizing, administering or joining an association, corporation, organization or any branch thereof, with the aim of overthrowing the regime of the State" The group is also accused of having links to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, an organization prohibited in the UAE. More than two dozen of those who stood trial were acquitted, according to state media. Local media and observers have had access to trial sessions. "They launched, established and ran an organization seeking to oppose the basic principles of the UAE system of governance and to seize power," Attorney General Salem Saeed Kubaish said in a January statement published by state media.
