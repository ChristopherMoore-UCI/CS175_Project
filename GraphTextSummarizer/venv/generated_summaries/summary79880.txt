"We believe that Christian Aguilar may be located near areas of lime rock," Tobias said. Scientists have confirmed lime rock residue was found on Bravo's vehicle, police said Saturday. Aguilar's backpack was found hidden inside a suitcase in Bravo's closet, police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said in a statement explaining what led authorities to charge Bravo with murder. Bravo changed his account of what happened "after being confronted with evidence that disputed his initial statements," Tobias said Saturday. Blood found in several locations in Bravo's vehicle will undergo an expedited analysis and be compared against known DNA samples of Aguilar, Tobias said.
