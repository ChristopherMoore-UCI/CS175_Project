"Con dinero y sin dinero, hago siempre lo que quiero..." Hubertus von Hohenlohe, the Mexican athlete and a descendant of German royalty hums the chorus of the popular Mexican song El Rey (The King) while he proudly shows off his Mariachi suit photos, which he will wear on the Sochi slopes at the Winter Olympics.. "For me it was never a doubt, I knew that I wanted to ski and to compete for Mexico; I was convinced from the beginning that this is my country," Von Hohenlohe told CNNMÃ©xico. In 1981 Von Hohenlohe founded the Mexican Federation of Winter Sports and since 1984 he has competed in the Olympics under Mexico's flag, participating in Calgary 1988, Albertville 1992 and Lillehammer 1994. Although Sochi 2014 will be his last event, Von Hohenlohe will keep on supporting the young athletes who dream on qualifying for the Winter Olympics The Mexican Olympic Committee reported on its website that the Head of Mission for Mexico Carlos Pruneda and Von Hohenlohe are in discussions to work on a scouting project that aims to build a strong team for the next Winter Games. Although he has more European royalty than Mexican blood running through his veins, Von Hohenlohe is considered "an ambassador in style," for being the only athlete that will represent Mexico in the Winter Games. "We (in Mexico) are 100 million people and the only chance we have (of winning a medal) is up to me, but we don't have to look at it like that, you have to see it as I'm an ambassador of this country, an ambassador with style and a human force that goes beyond the result, " Being born in Mexico was a matter of luck for Von Hohenlohe, who is the son of the Prince and Princess of Wurttemberg, a century old kingdom that ruled Germany -- when there was still a monarchy in that country.
