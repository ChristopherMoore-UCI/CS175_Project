But the annual report said Ryanair pilots are subject to limits of 900 flying hours each financial year, as determined by Irish regulators. A survey of Ryanair pilots has found concerns about the low-cost carrier's safety culture, and support for an inquiry by regulators. Mr Conway said in his memo that any pilot who had legitimate safety concerns should raise them through Ryanair's confidential safety reporting channel or with the Irish Aviation Authority. Ryanair's 2013 annual report said safety is the company's "primary priority", starting with the hiring and training of its pilots, flight attendants and maintenance staff. The survey was prompted by a warning in April by Ray Conway, Ryanair's chief pilot and a senior manager, that any pilot signing a petition -- organised by the Ryanair Pilot Group and calling on regulators to evaluate whether the company's employment model had an impact on the safety of flight operations -- would be liable for dismissal.
