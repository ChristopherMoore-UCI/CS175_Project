Brown, who admitted guilt two years ago to the brutal assault of ex-girlfriend Rihanna, won four trophies and performed twice during the telecast from Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium. Brown was sentenced to five years probation and 180 days of community service after he entered a guilty plea in June 2009 to assaulting Rihanna while they were in a car the night before the 2009 Grammy Awards. The 2011 BET Awards paid nostalgic and emotional tributes to several fallen stars and the living Patti LaBelle, but embattled hip hop singer Chris Brown dominated Sunday night's show. When the dust settled, Brown had won for best male R&B Artist, video of the year, best collaboration, and the viewer's choice award. -- A mix up between a computer tablet and a teleprompter during Sunday's BET Awards created an awkward moment that reminded viewers of Chris Brown's domestic violence conviction on a night that otherwise was Brown's triumph.
