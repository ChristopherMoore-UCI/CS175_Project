Earlier on Sunday, Real Mallorca moved up to fourth place, recording a ninth successive home win with a 2-0 victory over rivals Deportivo La Coruna. It was a welcome tonic for Valencia following their Spanish Kings Cup defeat to Deportivo La Coruna on Wednesday and they are now just three adrift of Real who lost 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. Julio Alvarez gave an early warning, hitting the post for Mallorca on 12 minutes and the goal duly arrived a minute after the interval through Mario Suarez, with Chori Castro adding a second eight minutes later. It capped a fine week for Mallorca who reached the quarterfinals of the Spanish Cup in midweek with a win over Rayo Vallecano and now sit in the Champions League places after leapfrogging Deportivo, now two points behind in fifth, as they maintained their flawless home record. Atletico had scored nine goals in their last two matches and the goals continued to flow with Diego Forlan, Paulo Assuncao and teenager Ibrahima Balde on target as a resurgent Atletico moved seven points off sixth-placed Sevilla.
