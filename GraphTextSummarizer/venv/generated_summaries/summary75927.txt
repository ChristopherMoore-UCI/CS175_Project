Beyond immediate financial actions against the Russian regime and even Putin himself, if Russia attempts to expand its military operations and threatens eastern Ukraine, we and our allies in Europe need to be ready to implement a trade embargo, explore restrictions on imports of Russian natural gas, and cut off Russian banks from the international financial system. It is critical the House of Representatives and Senate work together to send a strong and unified message that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unacceptable, and take quick action to punish President Vladimir Putin. How should our friends in Vilnius, Riga, or Tallinn take Russian rhetoric about the need to "protect" ethnic Russians in Ukraine when they, too, have significant populations of ethnic Russians living in their countries? In that spirit, we welcome Obama's call for bipartisan action in the Congress, which will hopefully move to quickly pass a serious package of financial support for Ukraine and to bolster the authorities that the administration already has to pursue and penalize Russian individuals and entities. It is precisely the ambiguity in which NATO left Georgia after the 2008 Bucharest Summit that fueled Russia's belief that it can bully NATO partners and not face a credible response.
