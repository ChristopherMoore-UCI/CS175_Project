" After plenty of uncertainty over whether Button or Magnussen would be retained for 2015, McLaren chairman and CEO Ron Dennis is delighted with the pairing of two former world champions. "I am extremely excited to be embarking on my 16th year in Formula 1 and my sixth season for McLaren," said the 34-year-old, whose future had been heavily debated in recent days. " Between 1988 and 1992, McLaren and Honda won 44 grands prix out of 80, with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost winning all but one of the 16 races in one season. Alonso previously joined McLaren in 2007, but left after just one season due to tensions between him and then rookie teammate Lewis Hamilton -- the now Mercedes driver who was crowned 2014 world champion last month. It remains to be seen whether McLaren's new engine partnership with Honda returns it to the top of the sport.
