Many victims ultimately come forward to prevent other children (sometimes their own siblings) from becoming victims. Studies suggest that most cases with child victims take far too long to resolve in the legal system. But we still have a long way to go before we can close cases like that of Jerry Sandusky with confidence that "justice was done." For most victims of sexual abuse, sending the offender to jail is not the most important thing. But in the complex crime of child sexual abuse, "doing justice" is rarely as simple as convicting and locking up the offender.
