Not that the practice of extramarital affairs and illicit rendezvous is uncommon: Brutal autocrats from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to erratic Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and their sons were rumored to have sexual encounters with numerous women during their reigns. As the president's inbox filled with schoolyard flirtation and adoration, the regime continued a bloody campaign that the opposition says has decimated entire towns and claimed thousands of lives. In New York, Sheherazad Jaafari, daughter of Syrian Ambassador to the U.N. Bashar Jaafari, provided advice on al-Assad's public image abroad while occasionally sending overtly sexual notes calling the ruler "handsome" and "cute." Among the few e-mail responses sent by al-Assad, it appears the isolated ruler is more preoccupied flirting with his British-born wife, Asma, than responding to adulation from other women. A trove of recently leaked e-mails purportedly from embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's inbox appear to indicate several women brazenly flirting with the father of three, some while working for the regime.
