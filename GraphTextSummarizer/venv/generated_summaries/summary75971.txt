Defending champion Novak Djokovic and new World No.1 Rafael Nadal came through testing quarterfinal matches Friday to remain on course for a final showdown at the Shanghai Masters. Djokovic dropped the opening set to Frenchman Gael Monfils before going through 6-7 6-2 6-4 in a grueling near two and a half hour battle while Nadal dispatched in-form Stanislas Wawrinka of 7-6 6-1 in the last match on court. Nadal also spoke of his shock over the sudden death of female F1 driver and compatriot Maria de Villota. The pair exchanged breaks in the first set, which eventually went to a tiebreak, won by former No.7 Monfils. She joins Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Agnieska Radwanska, Li Na, Petra Kvitova, Sara Errani and Jelena Jankovic in the prestigious season closer.
