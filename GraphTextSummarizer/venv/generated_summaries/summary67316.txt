Atwater, 30, was arrested Saturday after Transportation Security Administration screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 in his carry-on bag. Atwater said it was his practice to carry at least two blocks of C-4 explosives for any operation. The court document also said Atwater had another run-in with airport security while leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve en route to Texas when a military smoke grenade was discovered in his bag. According to the complaint, Atwater did not bring up the smoke grenade incident while being questioned about the discovery of the explosives in his bag at Midland International Airport on Saturday. -- A Green Beret charged with attempting to carry explosives onto a commercial airliner in Midland, Texas, was released from jail Friday.
