Funso currently has winds of 213 kph (about 132 mph), which would make it equal to a Category 4 major hurricane if located in the Atlantic, said CNN Senior Meteorologist Brandon Miller. The storm is spreading rainfall over much of Mozambique and Madagascar, and this will continue for several days as the storm is moving very slowly, Miller said. Officials fear fuel and food shortages will start hit northern cities in Mozambique that usually get supplies via roadway from the capital, Maputo. Last week, southern Mozambique was hit by heavy rains from tropical depression Dando. The center of circulation is in the Mozambique Channel, between central Mozambique and the island of Madagascar.
