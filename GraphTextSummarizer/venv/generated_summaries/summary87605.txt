Since the House of the Gladiators collapsed, the ministry has put in place emergency measures at Pompeii, giving the Soprintendenza stronger powers to protect the site, as well drawing up plans to increase the number of archaeologists and skilled workers on site, according to a statement on the ministry website. "The current state of conservation in Pompeii is mediocre," said Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, former Superintendent and archeologist at Pompeii. " Guzzo agreed, saying the promotion of events at Pompeii, such as the anniversary of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, had taken priority over the "silent and daily" work of conservation. According to the research group l'Associazione per l'Economia della Cultura, allocated spending for Ministry of Culture departments in charge of conservation was halved over eight years from 2000 to 2008, though there is evidence of investment in other departments. "The exceptional nature of the site of Pompeii has never been neglected by an Italian government and in particular by Minister Bondi," who's management of the site, she said in a news release, has been extraordinary.
