They are accused of stealing high-end jewelry from locations such as Cartier in New York City, the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Schwarzschild's Jewelers in Richmond, Virginia, from July 2013 through January 2014, according to court papers. Grant and Williams were arrested on January 30 after FBI and New York Police Department officers caught them wearing Cartier watches that matched those stolen earlier the same day from the Cartier store in Manhattan. -- Four men are accused of stealing more than $1 million worth of jewelry across three states, including more than $700,000 in Cartier watches, charges that carry decades-long sentences, authorities said Wednesday. Then, they allegedly "(terrorized) customers and employees by smashing display cases with hammers and stealing high-end timepieces," Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in statement. Authorities identified the suspects as Allen Williams, 35, Roberto Grant, 33, Terrell Ratliff, 22, and Tyrone Dehoyos, 35.
