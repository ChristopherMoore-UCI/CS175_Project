" Iceland fishing for deal on EU quotas The 69-year-old president pointed to Norway and Greenland -- two other Arctic economies and non-European Union members -- as role models. Grimsson said the decision not to save the banks was "the most difficult I ever had to make," but maintained it was the right one. "Allowing the banks to fail is one of the fundamental reasons Iceland is now in a strong recovery with respect to other European countries," he said.

Iceland's president Olafur Ragnar Grimsson told CNN's Richard Quest: "The Arctic region is gradually becoming one of the most important playing grounds in the 21st century world economy."
