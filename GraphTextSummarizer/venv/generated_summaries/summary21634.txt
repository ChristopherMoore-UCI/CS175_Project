It was the first time Sullenberger had flown the New York to Charlotte route since the water on landing on January 15. "This flight today was a lot longer than that one in January, and I was able to give [CEO Doug Parker] back his airplane without getting it wet first." " Thursday's flight also was Sullenberger's first in his new role as an active management pilot for US Airways. In addition to his flying duties, Sullenberger will join the airline's flight operations safety management team, which helps airlines assess potential risks and act to mitigate them, US Airways said. Both men took time off before returning to the cockpit, US Airways said, during which they completed requalification training.
