In the last few years, Tehran has opened new embassies in Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. That model, in which the president grows so powerful that it undermines democratic institutions, has been imitated to different degrees in Bolivia, Nicaragua and Ecuador.

During years when the United States paid little mind to relations with Latin America, home to 600 million people with economies worth $5 trillion, Beijing and Tehran set their sights on the American hemisphere. China and Iran, the two countries the West most worries about, have been busy developing diplomatic relations and increasing economic ties.
