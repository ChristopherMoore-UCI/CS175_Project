Under the Brady Act, when the FBI receives background check requests for gun purchases, it contacts the appropriate federal, state and local agencies to get any missing disposition information and is able to clean up two-thirds of faulty records within just three days of the request. By the Justice Department's own count, roughly 50% of FBI background records are incomplete and don't include the final outcome of an arrest. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia,  introduced a bill to clean up incomplete FBI background checks for employment. The glitch is that FBI records often fail to report the final outcomes of arrests. Although background checks can contribute to workplace safety, inaccuracies in the FBI database mean that these checks are blocking about 600,000 Americans a year from jobs for which they may be perfectly qualified.
