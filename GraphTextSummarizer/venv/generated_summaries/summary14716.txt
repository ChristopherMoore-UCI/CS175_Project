Roberto, who moved to Paris at independence, came back to Angola to take part in elections in 1992 which were followed by political turmoil. The presidential poll was aborted after a disputed first round, prompting a return to the conflict between the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and government forces. LUANDA, Angola (Reuters)  -- Holden Roberto, a central figure in Angola's struggle for independence from Portugal, died on Thursday in the capital of Luanda, the state newspaper said on Friday. Angola, which is enjoying an oil boom, high economic growth and widespread foreign investment, is expected to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in 2008 and 2009, the first national polls in some 15 years.
