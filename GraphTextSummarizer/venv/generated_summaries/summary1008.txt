As was the case with fans who rallied around Jennifer Aniston because they believed she had been wronged by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Powers said she believes Rimes' estranged husband, Sheremet, will emerge the winner of public sympathy. "Ultimately, if people love [Rimes'] singing, they are going to come to her concerts." Us Weekly's Powers said Rimes and Cibrian's situation mirrors that of actress Tori Spelling and her husband, Dean McDermott. LeAnn Rimes, at the 2009 Lollapalooza Music Festival, is being spotted with Eddie Cibrian. During an interview with Matt Lauer in April on the "Today" show, Rimes sidestepped questioning about her relationship with Cibrian. I think people are fascinated by my personal life, and I totally get it." Soon after, Cibrian's wife and mother of his two young sons, Brandi Glanville, was quoted as demanding Rimes leave her husband alone.
