Our meal continues, with a back and forth banter of sushi chef and customer. You eat sushi the traditional way, with your hand, the way Ono has made it. As I finish that first piece of sushi, Ono is beginning to make the second, squid. "Done properly, this is very tasty," says Ono, talking about sushi as a collective whole. Ono has been either training to be or been a sushi chef for more than 70 years, continuously studying the art of sushi.
