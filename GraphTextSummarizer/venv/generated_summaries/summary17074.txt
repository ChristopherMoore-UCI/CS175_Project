It may have been contaminated water that caused little Addison's intractable diarrhea and vomiting or an overwhelming infection. Inside the Dadaab Refugee Camp, a mass burial site sits within walking distance of the close cluster of tents. In just about any other place on Earth, those numbers would scream out from international headlines, but not here in East Africa. Many of these infections are wildly contagious, especially among the hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated kids in these camps. Amin Hassan took me to see the tiny burial site of her 1-month old daughter, Addison.
