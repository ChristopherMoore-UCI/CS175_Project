Al-Najafi urged security forces and Sunni tribes battling across the country to restrain themselves, warning of a civil war if such fighting continues. In northern Iraq, at least 28 people were killed and more than 70 wounded in clashes between security forces and gunmen in Hawija, in Kirkuk province, according to a senior Iraqi army officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. But Sunni politicians claim peaceful Sunni protesters were assaulted during the raid and blame Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister. Over the past few months, al Qaeda in Iraq has claimed responsibility for several attacks across the country that targeted Shiite areas and Iraqi security forces. Two Sunni Cabinet members -- Minister of Education Mohammed Tameem and Minister of Science and Technology Abdul Karim al-Samarrai -- have submitted their resignations in protest over the actions by security forces, their offices said.
