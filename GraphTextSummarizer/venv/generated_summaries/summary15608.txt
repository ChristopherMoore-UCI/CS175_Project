Also in said e-mail, provide your personal e-mail address and phone number as a separate vCard, (no, not that kinda V-card, interneteur -- electronic business cards.) A mass e-mail to relatives and networking contacts is fine, too -- just keep it brief, say nothing but classy things about your former employer, and be prepared to write a battery of "Thanks, yeah, I'm excited!" responses when your e-mail hits peeps' inboxes. A classier step: Tell the important people (the ones who'd want to hear it from the horse's mouth) in person or via personalized calls or e-mails, then compose a Facebook status asking your friends and colleagues to celebrate with you at a local watering hole. So keep the bridge strong (to continue the hoary clich√©) by sending occasional check-in e-mails and, if appropriate, following colleagues on Twitter in the hope they'll follow you back. (If your exit was less, er, voluntary, the same principles apply: "celebratory" drinks become "commiseration" cocktails, and the mass e-mail becomes more of a polite plea for networking leads.)
