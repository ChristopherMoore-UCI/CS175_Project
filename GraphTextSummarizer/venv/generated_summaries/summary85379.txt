A woman trying to get off a train in Saitama, north of Tokyo, fell in a gap between the train and the platform Monday morning, said Takashi Tsukahara, a spokesman for the train operator JR East. About 40 passengers and JR staff rushed to push the train off the woman. Tsukahara said a train carriage typically weighs about 30,000 kilograms, but is able to sway a bit side to side to absorb the train's movements. -- Even during Tokyo's notoriously hectic rush hour, dozens of commuters stopped to push a 32-ton train car out of the way. The commuters pushed the train just enough to free the woman.
