Disabled veterans and surviving families: No longer would a planned cut in pensions hit "medically" discharged military retirees or military spouses or children who depend on military pensions. That's $1 billion more than last year's low point after budget cuts. Social Security Administration: The agency gets a hefty $651 million increase to help it make up for budget cuts in the past. Seated handshakes: The photo of Mikulski and House Appropriations Committee chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, sealing the deal is a double win: a more natural-looking, lawmakers-at-work shot than the traditional standing handshake. If the Obama administration needs more funds to implement the health care law, it isn't going to get them from Congress.
