-- Hong Kong art collector Alan Lo and his father share a love for Chinese art. Lo explains why the risk may be worth taking at auction, compared to buying art through a gallery or middleman. The younger Lo buys modern Chinese art; his dad owns an important collection of traditional Chinese ink drawings. While mainland buyers get most of the bad rap, industry insiders say the problem also exists among buyers from other emerging markets like Indonesia and Malaysia. As a safeguard, major auction houses often require significant deposits before the bidding takes place.
