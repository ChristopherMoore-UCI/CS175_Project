This trend continued in this decade as immigrants dispersed to new metro areas and suburbs within metro areas. Metro areas that want to stem their population loss and boost economic growth -- such as Detroit and Cleveland -- are devising ways to woo immigrants. During the economic expansion of the late 1990s, immigrants found new opportunities in some unexpected places. The city council agreed to a new plan, crafted by 130 community members from all segments of Dayton's communities, outlining a framework for new policies to make the city more open and supportive of immigrants. Meanwhile, immigrants have increasingly settled in the suburbs, so by 2010 a majority of the nation's immigrants are suburban residents.
