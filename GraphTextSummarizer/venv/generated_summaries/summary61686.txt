Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit says he hopes the ceremonies will spread hope to people around the world. In the years since the Wall came down, the city has undergone a massive transformation as people and money poured into the former East Berlin. Jumping out of buildings, running through barbed wire, flying makeshift planes and digging secret tunnels -- all desperate measures used by people to flee East Berlin after the wall went up. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the fall of the Berlin Wall sends "a message of hope and that dreams can come true, nothing has to stay as it is, even if it's difficult. It comprises thousands of illuminated white helium balloons -- to be released into the sky after a performance by the Staatskapelle Berlin orchestra.
