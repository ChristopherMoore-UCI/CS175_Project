Activision is releasing two new Bond games -- "GoldenEye 007 " for the Nintendo Wii and "James Bond 007: Blood Stone" for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC -- and the voice and image of current Bond star Daniel Craig appears in both. The makers of "GoldenEye 007" have to pull off more than just doing James Bond justice. But this week, the promise that appears at the end credits of every Bond film ("James Bond Will Return ...") is being kept by a pair of video games. That new Wii game is an update of the classic 1997 "GoldenEye" game for the Nintendo 64, which itself was based on the 1995 film that introduced Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. Still, the makers of the new Bond games are confident there are enough Bond-deprived fans out there to make "Blood Stone" and "GoldenEye" hits.
