Here's my definition of fast food: fiberless food. Lack of fiber in processed food means rapid absorption and overloading the liver, higher levels of "bad" cholesterol, proliferation of obesogenic bacterial species in the intestine, and slower transit of food through the intestine, delaying the onset of the satiety signal. Public health policies for obesity prevention thus far have not worked, and the president and Congress can't justify spending more money on this. "My definition of fast food?" Fast food was worth $184 billion a year in 2010, up from $165 billion in 2009, and is projected to reach $210 billion in 2016, according to Statista.
