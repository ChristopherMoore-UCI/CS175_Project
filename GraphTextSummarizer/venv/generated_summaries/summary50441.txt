-- A Chicago man who just co-authored a book on how to run with the bulls in Pamplona was gored in the right thigh on Wednesday and underwent surgery in hospital, two friends with him in Pamplona told CNN. The six half-ton bulls from Victoriano del Rio ranch, including the one that gored Hillmann, were due to die in the bullfights on Wednesday afternoon, near where he was injured on the third day of the annual eight days of running, held at 8 a.m. local time, from July 7 to 14. " 'It's been a hell of a sh**ty fiesta so far,' " Hillmann said at the hospital, according to his friend Alexander Fiske-Harrison, who edited their new e-book entitled "Fiesta, How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona." All the great runners have been gored." Fiske-Harrison said he was running on Wednesday near Hillmann and that the latter was trying to guide the loose bull -- which experts consider to be very dangerous -- toward the bull ring, when he got gored. Other contributors to the book include John Hemingway, grandson of Ernest Hemingway, who brought global fame to the ancient tradition through his 1920s novel, "The Sun Also Rises," also published under the title, "Fiesta."
