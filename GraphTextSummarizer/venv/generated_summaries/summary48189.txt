It was also the No. 1 word game, apparently beating out Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends and Shared Needles with Friends. After downloading the app and opening a game account (for which I was denied the user name "RealGilbertGottfried") I soon learned that Ruzzle consists of three two-minute rounds in which you and your opponent each get 16 letters placed in four rows of four that can be linked together to create words by gliding your finger over the screen at any connecting angle. Each letter is also given a point value based on difficulty, and some even award extra points by doubling or tripling the letter or overall word score. So, just to be sure, I Googled this strange new word and discovered that Ruzzle was actually a popular game app for your mobile device. So Ruzzle is officially something that matters, and, at press time, it was the No. 4 overall free app in America.
