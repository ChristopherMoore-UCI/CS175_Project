He had to distance himself, because he's a politician, from what the media was saying I had said, which was un-American." Obama, when asked what he could do to keep Wright's latest comments from dragging him down, replied: "I think people will understand that I am not perfect and that there are going to be folks in my past like Rev. Wright that may cause them some concern -- but that ultimately, my 20 years of service and the values that I've written about and spoken about and promoted are their values and what they're concerned about.

At the height of the Wright controversy, Obama gave a speech on race relations, rejecting his ex-pastor's controversial comments but saying he could not repudiate the man himself. Those are biblical principles, not Jeremiah Wright bombastic principles," he said. Earlier this year, some of Wright's sermons, circulated and widely discussed on the Internet and on television, became an issue in the Democratic presidential race because of the former pastor's ties to Obama.
