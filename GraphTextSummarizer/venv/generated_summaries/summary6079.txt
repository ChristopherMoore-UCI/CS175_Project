The Republican National Committee, in July, chose Cleveland, Ohio, to host its 2016 convention, which is likely to take place in late June or July. In a press release, the committee said that several weeks are under consideration to hold the convention: July 18, July 25 and August 22. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz informed Democrats of the decision to winnow the list to these three cities in an email. The Democratic National Committee announced Monday that Columbus, Ohio, Philadelphia and New York are the finalists to host the 2016 presidential nominating convention. "We're thrilled to move to the next step of the selection process to determine where Democrats will come together to nominate the 45th President of the United States," said Wasserman Schultz said in a statement.
