A state of emergency was lifted last week and Bahrain Grand Prix organizers remain hopeful that they can stage a race in 2011. It read: "Whilst Bahrain would have been delighted to see the grand prix progress on October 30th in-line with the World Motor Sport Council's decision, it has been made clear that this fixture cannot progress and we fully respect that decision. The Bahrain Grand Prix will not go ahead after organizers said Friday that they had abandoned plans to re-schedule the race later this year. "We look forward to welcoming teams, their drivers and supporters back to Bahrain next year," read the statement. About 30 people have died during protests in Bahrain, according to figures from the government, opposition figures and human rights groups.
