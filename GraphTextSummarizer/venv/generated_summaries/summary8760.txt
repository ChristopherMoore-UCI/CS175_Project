With Coulibaly dead, and Charlie Hebdo suspects Cherif and Said Kouachi killed Friday in a separate standoff north of Paris, Boumeddiene is the last prime, publicly identified suspect that police are seeking in connection with France's recent wave of terror attacks. Hayat Boumeddiene seemed kind and polite, always wearing a veil and often motoring around on a scooter with her romantic partner, Amedy Coulibaly, a neighbor in a southern Paris suburb recalls. Now the 26-year-old Boumeddiene is the subject of an international dragnet after Coulibaly -- said to be linked to two brothers suspected in the Charlie Hebdo massacre -- killed hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket Friday before police fatally shot him. Armed investigators on Saturday milled around the apartment shared by Coulibaly and Boumeddiene in Fontenay-aux-Roses, south of Paris. But Disant said that the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly were part of the same jihadist groups, and Paris prosecutor Francois Molins indicated Boumedienne and Cherif Kouachi's wife also were well acquainted, saying they exchanged 500 phone calls in 2014.
