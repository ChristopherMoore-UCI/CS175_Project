Republicans released a new battery of campaign ads that play on fears of ISIS and terrorism, and the Republican charged with helping elect new GOP congressmen said national security was "popping" as a key issue heading into November. Walden said it was too early to tell if the issue had overtaken the economy as the chief concern of voters, but on Friday, the National Republican Congressional Committee rolled out paid television ads in four competitive districts that accused Democrats of cutting funds to fight al Qaeda. "We're seeing a big uptick on national security issues," U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor on Friday. But the issue is somewhat complicated for the party, and it's unclear how a continued -- and likely expanded -- U.S. military operation in the Mideast will affect voters' opinions in the final days of the fall campaign, when voters tend to pay closer attention. The NRCC chairman repeated that he believes his party can win 245 Republican seats in the House, which would mean a net gain of a dozen seats in November.
