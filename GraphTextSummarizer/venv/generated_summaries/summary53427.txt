(RollingStone.com) -- "Le Noise" is Neil Young with eight new songs and no band, accompanying himself on guitars with maximum fuzz and electronics, manipulated by producer Daniel Lanois. And in "Love and War," Young -- his creaky whisper and acoustic guitar buoyed by Lanois' watery treatments -- confesses an uncertainty hard to believe in one of rock's most driven stars: "When I sing about love and war/I don't really know what I'm saying. " "Le Noise" is also the most intimate and natural-sounding album Young has made in a long time: just a songwriter making his way through a vividly rendered chaos of memoir, affection and fear. "Peaceful Valley Boulevard," one of two acoustic-guitar songs, is a detailed American history lesson from Indian wars to electric cars. But I still try to sing about love and war.
