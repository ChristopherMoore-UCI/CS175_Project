Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with anti-tank warheads, but he did not say when. A week ago, a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with anti-tank missiles, which they didn't have before. Rebels have been under intense pressure from government forces in several cities. But it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with (Gadhafi) in power," the three wrote. International delegates attending a meeting on Libya Thursday in Qatar again urged Gadhafi to step down immediately.
