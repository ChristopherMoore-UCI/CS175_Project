Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, and to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States. It said Paul Carlucci, then the chief operating officer of News America, showed the scene to his employees to get his point across: that News America employees will tackle their work with "unbridled aggression." "The selected scene is a perfect metaphor for the business practices both expected and in fact being employed (by News America) to illegally leverage its market dominance," Valassis said in its federal lawsuit. Besides Dow Jones, News Corp. also is the parent company of Fox News, the New York Post, and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. In one of the lawsuits, New Jersey-based Floorgraphics charged that News America attacked Floorgraphics directly by breaking into a password-protected computer system to acquire sensitive proprietary information, including past and future contracts. A News America spokeswoman said the company had no comment.
