While no one has claimed responsibility for the violence that has gripped the city for more than a year, many residents and officials blame it on Islamist extremist groups operating in eastern Libya. Benghazi is the largest city in eastern Libya, where some groups want more autonomy and a greater share of the region's oil wealth. Benghazi is where the 2011 uprising against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi began. The blast occurred as new graduates left a technical school at the base, Libya's state news agency LANA reported, quoting a military source in the city. Three years later, it is the scene of almost daily attacks and targeted assassinations, specifically against security officials.
