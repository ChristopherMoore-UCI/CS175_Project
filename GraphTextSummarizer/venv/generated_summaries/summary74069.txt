Swire criticized U.S. senators who tried to hold hearings this summer into questions surrounding the release of al-Megrahi. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the terror attack, said earlier this month that he recently saw al-Megrahi in Libya. The Scottish government released al-Megrahi just over a year ago on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three more months. Doctors have said al-Megrahi has terminal prostate cancer. Swire, who said he does not think that al-Megrahi is guilty, defended the decision.
