Since CNN spoke with LEGO artist Nathan Sawaya a year ago, his popularity has skyrocketed. Sawaya says one of those pieces, "Grasp," was inspired by his frustration with people who have doubted his ability to make a full-time career out of LEGO sculpting. With 10 days to complete it, and only architectural renderings to work from, Sawaya toiled away in his Manhattan studio snapping tiny bricks together, barely sleeping, to finish the curvy 10-foot statue in time for its unveiling. Sawaya: I think people have passion for different things in their lives and they want to display that passion in a unique way. " "The Art of The Brick," one of two of Sawaya's collections touring North America, features "Red," "Blue" and "Yellow," three life-size pieces depicting human forms in startling poses that have brought Sawaya much attention and praise.
