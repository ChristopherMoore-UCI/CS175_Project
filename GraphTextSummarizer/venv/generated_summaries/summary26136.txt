Most of the deaths happened between August and September, according to K.P. Kushwaha, chief pediatrician at BRD Medical College and Nehru Hospital in Uttar Pradesh state's Gorakhpur district. In 2009, India reported 774 fatalities from encephalitis, including 556 in Uttar Pradesh, federal data shows. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain, primarily caused by food and drink contamination and mosquito bites. The outbreaks are common in the district, near India's border with Nepal. At least 435 patients, mostly children, have died this year from encephalitis in one of India's most impoverished regions, health officials said.
