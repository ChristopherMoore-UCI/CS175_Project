The announcement, a culmination of a months-long deliberative interagency process, came the same day President Barack Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on the sidelines of the G8 summit in Deauville, France. The United States has added Caucasus Emirate, a Chechen group based in North Caucasus, to its list of terrorist groups, and authorized an award of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of its leader, the State Department announced Thursday. " The State Department said designating Caucasus Emirate as a terrorist group will help support U.S. efforts to reduce the group's ability to mount attacks on Russian interests as it tries to expel the Russian government from the North Caucasus region. "The designation of Caucasus Emirate is in response to the threats posed to the United States and Russia," Ambassador Daniel Benjamin, the Department of State's coordinator for counterterrorism, said in the news release. The designation was made under the authority of a presidential executive order that targets groups and individuals that provide support to terrorists, terrorist organizations or acts of terrorism.
