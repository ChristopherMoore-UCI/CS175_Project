Whether individuals prefer to get text messages rather than voice calls appears to have a large correlation with how heavily they use text messaging. " A plateau -- or even an eventual decline -- in the popularity of both voice calls and text messages could profoundly change how carriers charge for voice calls and text messaging in coming years. According to a new study from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 31% of American adults prefer text messages to phone calls. This could mean that someday, standard cell phone calls and text messages might be sold as special add-on services, perhaps handled by separate divisions or companies for extra fees. To put this in perspective, most Americans (but just barely: 53%) still generally prefer to get voice calls rather than text messages.
