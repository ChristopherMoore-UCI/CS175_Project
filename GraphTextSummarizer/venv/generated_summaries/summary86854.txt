After two Washington law firms backed out of earlier commitments to represent House Republicans in their legal challenge, House Speaker John Boehner hired Jonathan Turley on Tuesday. House Republicans are hoping the third time is a charm in their effort to sue President Barack Obama over his signature health care law. Obamacare's next fight for survival House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the move to continue the legal effort and referred to Turley as "a TV lawyer" in a press conference Tuesday. But House Republicans have had trouble retaining a firm because of the political blowback on the issue. Beyond the political concerns, many constitutional experts have raised doubts that federal courts will take up the Obamacare case pushed by the GOP-controlled House.
