Sehong's photographs are portraits of the Korean women known as comfort women, victims who were forcibly taken from Korea and used as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during WWII. They're pictures of elderly women, part of his exhibit that was scheduled to take place at the Nikon gallery. Most recently, Japan's government says two delegations met with the mayor of Palisades Park, New Jersey, asking the city to remove a memorial dedicated to comfort women. Japan helped establish the Asian Women's Fund in 1995, which is supported by government funds and provides assistance to comfort women. Some Japanese extremists believe the crimes against the comfort women never happened.
