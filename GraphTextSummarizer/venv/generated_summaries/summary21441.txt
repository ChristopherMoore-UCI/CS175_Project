It starts by finding shelter dogs with the potential to become search dogs. Trained search dogs, along with their human handlers, have provided help in high-profile disasters such as the Japan earthquake in March and the Joplin, Missouri, tornado in May. "After a disaster, there is a window of opportunity for finding live people," said Wilma Melville, founder of the National Disaster Search Dog Foundation. But it was a 1995 tragedy -- the federal building bombing in Oklahoma City -- that inspired Melville to create it. After arriving in Oklahoma City, Melville said, she was devastated by the scope of the tragedy, in which 168 people were killed. She and her black lab, Murphy, had been training together for several years before they made the trip to Oklahoma City to help find victims.
