Slater has pleaded not guilty to charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief -- both felonies -- and criminal trespass. Slater became a hero to some after an August incident when, authorities said, he grabbed some beer and triggered an inflatable emergency chute from a plane at a JFK Airport terminal in New York. She said that the separation occurred last week, but declined to elaborate how Slater and the company parted ways. "A number of passengers were competing for overhead carry-on luggage areas," Howard Turman, Slater's attorney, has said. Slater has a court appearance scheduled for Tuesday.
