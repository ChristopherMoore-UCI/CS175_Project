Like healthy weight loss, healthy weight gain takes time, Begun says. Ruling out problems Before attempting to put on pounds, individuals who feel they are underweight should visit their primary care doctor for a complete physical examination, says Craig Primack, a medical obesity specialist and member of the American Society of Bariatric Physicians. Gaining a new perspective As society in general has become increasingly overweight, underweight individuals may feel they stand out. If underweight individuals are living healthy lifestyles but still find themselves on the lower end of the weight spectrum, it may be helpful to change how they view their bodies, she says. What to eat and drink when you exercise Primack suggests fewer repetitions of higher weight in exercises that incorporate the whole body, done three to four times per week, in addition to cardiovascular exercise.
