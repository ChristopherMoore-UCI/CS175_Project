On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama said there's no doubt that Syria launched chemical weapons attacks against its own people. Previously reported: -- Cameron opened the emergency session of the House of Commons on Syria Thursday by saying the debate is about "how to respond to one of most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century" -- not about regime change or invasion. The vote, 285-to-272, came just minutes after members of Parliament voted down a Labour Party motion calling for additional time for U.N. weapons inspectors to gather evidence over whether al-Assad's forces used chemical weapons in suburban Damascus. The British government on Thursday published a summary of its intelligence assessment on Syria's alleged chemical weapons use, arguing that at least 350 people died in an attack in the Damascus area on August 21, and that there is no plausible culprit other than the Syrian government. "The threats of launching an aggression against Syria will increase its commitments," and "Syria will defend itself against any aggression," he said, according to Syrian state TV.
