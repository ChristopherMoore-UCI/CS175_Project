-- Andy Murray crushed Roger Federer in straight sets in a one-sided final to claim victory in the Shanghai Masters on Sunday. World number four Murray has now beaten Federer eight times in their 13 meetings, although has crucially lost both times they have met in the final of a grand slam (U.S. Open in 2008 and this year's Australian Open final). "I hit a lot of great shots on the run and you have to come up with a lot of great shots against Federer if you want to beat him." Federer, who moves back up to second place in the world rankings behind Rafael Nadal despite losing the final, added: "I had a good tournament and thought I played well this week. "I enjoy playing Roger," Murray told the official ATP Tour website. "I had some great wins against Robin Soderling, John Isner, Andreas Seppi and Novak Djokovic and I'm very happy with where my game is at.
