Texas, for good or bad, has a highly Christianized political culture, and the very center of the Christian gospels themselves contain a dramatic warning against the dangers of overcommitted prosecutors. As even a casual observer of the campaign of Texas Gov. Rick Perry for president has probably noticed, many Texans care about the Bible. The answer to that question is buried deep inside the psychology of prosecutors and the culture of Texas. As a former prosecutor who then spent 10 years training future prosecutors in Texas, I am not surprised by this development. The commitment of prosecutors is too rooted in emotion to be a deciding factor in a case such as this, and the objectivity of courts must bring to bear what is right.
