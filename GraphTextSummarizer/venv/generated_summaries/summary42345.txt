That discomfort could change in the next few years as the airborne gadgets become commonplace and more people buy personal drones. Last week, the agency issued an exemption that will allow a handful of TV and movie companies to capture aerial footage with drones, but regular people are still on a short leash. The consumer drone market is still wide open for newcomers due to a combination of tangled Federal Aviation Administration restrictions, high price tags, privacy concerns and a bad reputation. Airborne photography is the most popular consumer use for drones, and the Phantom line from DJI currently dominates that field. At its 800-square-foot office in Toronto, the company prints out drone prototypes on industrial-grade 3-D printers and tests them in a 10-by-10-foot cage.
