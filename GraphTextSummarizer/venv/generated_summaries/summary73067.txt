"What happens is we give 50 percent to something that doesn't exist yet and 50 to this moment." To reconnect with his vision, Baumgartner needed to reconnect to what Gervais called his hidden journey — what the jump meant to him, beyond being the first person to skydive from so great a height, or being the first person to exceed the speed of sound (about 700 mph at that altitude) in free fall. "Self talk is the foundation for self-confidence and self-esteem." To sharpen these skills, Gervais put Baumgartner in increasingly uncomfortable situations — which he would not specify — and made him try to gain control of his body and mind. (Baumgartner, who is in Roswell, New Mexico preparing for Sunday's launch, could not be reached for comment, but Red Bull confirmed Gervais' account for Wired.) That said, the repeated weather delays — the jump has been twice delayed by high wind — can't be helping the mental strain, but Gervais is confident that Baumgartner has what it takes to stay focused on the task at hand. To that end, Red Bull, his sponsor, called in Dr. Michael Gervais.
