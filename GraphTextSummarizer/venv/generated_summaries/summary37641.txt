"The question is whether Calderon has coattails," said Ana Maria Salazar, a Mexico City columnist and political talk show host. "It will not change the balance of power much in Mexico," said Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. Calderon's job got tougher when the bottom fell out of the global economy late last year and the H1N1 flu outbreak drew the world's attention to Mexico this year. "There's a general disenchantment about the PAN administration for the past nine years," said John Mill Ackerman, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. PAN candidate Fox -- Calderon's predecessor -- broke that hold nine years ago.
