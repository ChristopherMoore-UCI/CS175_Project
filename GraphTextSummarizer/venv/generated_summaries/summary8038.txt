We can be thankful President Barack Obama is taking aim at one of the prime causes of climate change and extreme weather: air pollution. Placing limits on carbon pollution from power plants is about ensuring that we have clean air to breathe and communities that are safe to live in. Dialing down air pollution is a gust of relief for a retiree without the luxury of air conditioning, who battles climbing temperatures and brutal heat waves. An African-American child is 3.6 times more likely to visit the emergency room for asthma, as compared with white children, according to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health. They secure the hope that someday soon, power plants will no longer be free to dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into our air.
