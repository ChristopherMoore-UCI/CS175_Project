And finally, Uno Chicago Grill's deep dish macaroni and three cheese had a day's worth of calories -- 1,980 -- and more than three days' worth of saturated fat, 71 grams. Those dishes, as prepared by restaurant chains, may look and taste good, but they're loaded with calories, saturated fat, sodium and sugar -- enough to earn them the dubious distinction of being named Xtreme Eating "dis-honorees" on this year's list from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, known as the CSPI. It weighs in at 3,120 calories, 89 grams of saturated fat and 1,090 milligrams of sodium, according to CSPI, equal to three lasagna classico entrees and a tiramisu from Olive Garden. According to CSPI, it also has 2,610 calories, more than a 12-piece bucket of original recipe Kentucky Fried Chicken, and 4Â½ days' worth of saturated fat. This meal packs on 3,500 calories, 88 grams of saturated fat -- that's four days' worth -- 3,720 milligrams of sodium and 15 teaspoons of sugar, according to CSPI.
