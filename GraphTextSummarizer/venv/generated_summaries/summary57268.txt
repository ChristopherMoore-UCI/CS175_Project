U.S. Senate: How they'll vote on Syria strike U.S. House: How they'll vote on Syria strike Bush has declined to weigh in on Syria and Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, running for U.S. Senate in a tough primary challenge against fellow Republican Mike Enzi in Wyoming, has come out against Obama's plan to strike Syria.
