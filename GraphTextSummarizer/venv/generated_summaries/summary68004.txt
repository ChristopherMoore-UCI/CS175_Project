"I am thrilled that 9-year-old Sean Goldman was reunited with his father David Goldman earlier today in Rio de Janeiro and that they are flying home to New Jersey," Clinton said Thursday in a statement. David Goldman and his 9-year-old son, Sean, arrived at Orlando International Airport just after 6 p.m. Thursday after meeting earlier at the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey, who flew to Rio to support constituent Goldman, called the father-son reunion "extraordinary" in a conference call with reporters. Sean Goldman had been living in Brazil since 2004 when his mother, Bruna Bianchi, took him to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation. Smith criticized the decision of Sean's stepfather and other members of his Brazilian family Thursday to "walk [Sean] through a group of reporters and people outside the U.S. Consulate in Rio," Smith said.
