Watch a report on more refugees washed ashore in Indonesia Â» Allegations arose a month ago that a group of Myanmar's Rohingya minority -- who have been fleeing their homeland for years, saying they are persecuted by its military government -- had been dumped at sea by Thai military authorities. "They were part of the nine boats containing Rohingya refugees from Myanmar and Bangladesh that were set adrift by the Thai security forces," Riyanto said. The discovery comes nearly a week after a judge in Thailand fined dozens of other Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who pleaded guilty to charges of illegal entry after fleeing their homeland in December. The Thai government has said that "there is no reasonable ground to believe" that the Rohingya were fleeing Myanmar because of persecution. A survivor told Indonesian immigration officials that his boat was part of a group of boats carrying about 1,200 people who were set adrift by Thai military forces who had found them.
