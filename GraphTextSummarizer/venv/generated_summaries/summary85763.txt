The Casey Anthony trial has lived up to the intense pre-trial hype and drama, beginning six weeks ago with her lawyer's blockbuster opening arguments alleging that her father -- George Anthony, who was Caylee's grandfather -- helped to cover-up that the girl accidentally died in the family pool. On Friday, after all the evidence had been presented, the defense again requested that the case against Casey Anthony be dismissed -- claiming that the prosecution had failed to adequately show how Caylee Anthony died and at whose hands. According to Levey, the jury members -- who are all from Pinellas County, after Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. moved the jury selection process there due to extensive media coverage around Orlando -- will deliberate through the July 4 holiday, assuming a quick verdict is not reached. Prosecution witnesses, including George Anthony, have pointed to the smells emanating from the trunk of Casey Anthony's Pontiac Sunbird that they claim came from a decaying human body -- Caylee's body, they allege. The prosecution also sought to paint Casey Anthony as someone who habitually lied, whether it was about her working at Universal Studios, that her daughter was with an imaginary nanny named Zenaida "Zanny" Gonzalez, or a number of other people and scenarios that she appeared to invent.
