David Rubenstein, the founder of the private equity company Carlyle Group, was the top bidder during a December auction at Sotheby's, and said buying it and displaying it is a way "to show my appreciation for the country which has been very good to me." Rubenstein's is one of four remaining copies of the document commissioned by the King of England in 1297 to establish basic human rights as part of English law. The National Archives considers the manuscript "a milestone in constitutional thought" from the 13th century, and plans to place it on public display later this month. "Any of you who are 700 years old, you'd have a few wrinkles as well, but for something that's as old as it is, it's in very good shape, and I know that it will be kept in excellent shape, hopefully for another 700 years." The Magna Carta will be on public display starting March 12 in the West Rotunda Gallery of the National Archives Building.
