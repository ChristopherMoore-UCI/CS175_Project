Together with Russia, and unlike China and India, Brazil has reduced economic inequality in recent years. It is true that Brazil's rate of economic growth is slow compared to China and India. Such skepticism is becoming common again, as investors compare the projected rate of growth in Brazil this year -- just 3% -- to that in China and India, around 8% and 6% respectively. Brazil's productivity grew by only 1.3% between 1990 and 2010, while China led the way at 8.3%, followed by India at 4.7% over the same period. Brazil's economy has a higher per capita GDP than both China and India, and as a more mature economy, it is not surprising that its growth rate is slower.
