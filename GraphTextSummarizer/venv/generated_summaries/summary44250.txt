"Since opening in 1889, the Savoy has played host to numerous artists, such as Whistler and Picasso," said manager Kiaran MacDonald. -- A Claude Monet pastel drawing of London's Waterloo Bridge has gone on display in the Savoy hotel room where it was created 110 years ago. It is currently owned by a private gallery, Trinity House, and is for sale for a reported $2.32m. Monet (1840-1926) lived in London during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71, and visited the city on several other occasions, in order to depict its buildings through the then-famous fog. Monet drew the bridge across the Thames during a stay in room 618 at the hotel -- now known as the Monet Suite -- in January 1901. "London would be quite ugly if it was not for the fog," he wrote in a letter from the Savoy on an earlier stay in 1900.
