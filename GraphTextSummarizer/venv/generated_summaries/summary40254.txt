Danielle Holley-Walker is a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and is actively supporting the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama. The commentators wonder and marvel at the extraordinarily difficult choice for African-American women in this primary -- will we vote for the woman candidate or the African-American candidate? We argue and marvel at the significant generational divide in the African-American community that is being exposed by this election process. It makes sense, being that the South Carolina Democratic primary is only one day away and African-American women will make up approximately one-third of the voters. Never once have I heard a single woman I know frame the choice about whom to vote for as a question of gender or racial politics.
