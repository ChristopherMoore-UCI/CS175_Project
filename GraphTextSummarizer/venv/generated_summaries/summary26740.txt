Just months after Edward Snowden controversially lifted the lid on digital surveillance being conducted by the U.S. and other governments, the issue of online privacy is back in the spotlight. Mun concedes that the fonts' actual effectiveness may be limited, but that he hopes they will alert people to the issue of digital surveillance: "ZXX is a call to action, both practically and symbolically, to raise questions about privacy. Mun, who worked with the NSA during his time in the Korean military, says that a number of global developments motivated him to act: "The news about the NSA secretly building the country's biggest data center; the House passing the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA); the social network media accumulating abundant information on every individual's life; Google announcing its work-in-progress Glass project -- and the list goes on. Matthew Green, Research Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, says that of the four different fonts, 'False' could be most promising, but that in his view camouflaged fonts are not terribly effective at protecting people's privacy: "For standard optical character recognition that's tuned to read traditional typefaces and handwriting, yes, I think (these fonts) will be confusing ... Each font uses a different optical trick to make them difficult to scan: 'Camo' adds camouflage-like patterns over letters, 'Noise' overlays the letters with dots, 'Xed' puts a neat X across each character, and 'False' uses a small letter beneath a larger 'false' one.
