-- Malaysia's health minister has resigned after being caught on videotape having sex with a female friend the country's national news agency said Wednesday. A day earlier, Health Minister Chua Soi Lek acknowledged that he was the man in a widely-circulated DVD that showed a couple engaged in sex in a hotel room. But news agency Bernama said Wednesday that Chua had resigned from both the post and the party, and his departure was effective immediately. At the time, the 61-year-old also added that he would not resign from his post or his party, the Malaysian Chinese Association, which is part of the ruling National Front coalition. Chua's wife, Wong Sek Hin, told the news agency that her husband had apologized to her and his three children.
