Also Friday, the Obama administration again blasted the decision by Scotland to release Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi from prison exactly a year ago on compassionate grounds due to a diagnosis of terminal cancer. "As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement. U.S. senators also have repeatedly voiced suspicions that Scotland released al Megrahi as part of a deal allowing BP to drill off the Libyan coast. " Menendez also said letters are being sent to Libyan and Qatari leaders, inquiring whether "commercial interests" led them to pressure Britain and Scotland to release al Megrahi. Scottish authorities have defended their actions in the case, saying Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill relied on a medical report from the top doctor in the Scottish Prison Service, along with reports from the parole board and prison governor, in deciding to free al Megrahi, who had been serving a life sentence.
