The end of Beltran Leyva's reign over the cartel of the same name was hailed by Mexico and the United States as a major victory for Mexican President Felipe Calderon's offensive against drug cartels. Arturo Beltran Leyva, a drug trafficker known as "the boss of bosses," was killed on December 16 when Mexican navy commandos stormed a luxury condo in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he was staying. The body was covered in blood-stained $100 bills and Mexican banknotes. -- A medical examiner and three employees were suspended Monday pending the outcome of an inquiry into whether they meddled with the body of a slain Mexican drug kingpin, a state prosecutor's office official told CNN. The Beltran Leyva cartel is known for air transportation expertise.
