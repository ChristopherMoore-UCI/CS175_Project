Facebook on Thursday launched a photo-sharing app called Facebook Camera, which aims to make it simpler for the social network's users to upload and browse photos on smartphones. The filters in Facebook Camera were developed by Facebook and are not borrowed from Instagram." This leaves a large swath of people who are not on Instagram but are actively taking photos and uploading them to Facebook. "It might seem strange for Facebook to release a camera application with built-in filters just weeks after announcing plans to buy Instagram, the social photo app," the Times writes. The news comes only weeks after Facebook spent $1 billion on a similar photo-sharing app called Instagram.
