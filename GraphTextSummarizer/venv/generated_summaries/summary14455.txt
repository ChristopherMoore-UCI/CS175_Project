-- New York mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who began his campaign as a long-shot but surfed a late wave of momentum by tapping into liberal anxiety over the three-term administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, overwhelmed his opponents on Tuesday to finish first in the city's Democratic mayoral primary. A Brooklyn resident who showcased his interracial family in television ads, de Blasio ran up sweeping margins in nearly every borough and demographic category, besting his opponents among voters of all ages, races and income levels. Down the ballot, former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer's bid for political redemption was thwarted in the Democratic race for city comptroller by Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, who reversed Spitzer's early lead in the race by reminding voters of the prostitution scandal that derailed his political career in 2008. De Blasio, the city's public advocate, frequently hammered a "tale of two cities" theme on the campaign trail, painting Bloomberg's New York as an increasingly unaffordable metropolis that rewarded wealthy Manhattanites at the expense of the outer borough middle class. According to exit polling published by the New York Times, de Blasio, who is white, even outperformed Thompson among black voters.
