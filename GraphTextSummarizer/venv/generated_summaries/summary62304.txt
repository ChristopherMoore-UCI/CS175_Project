He will plead no contest to serving alcohol to a minor and falsification, Dan Tierney, spokesman for the Ohio Attorney General's Office, told CNN on Monday. -- A volunteer assistant football coach at Steubenville High School in Ohio is expected to plead no contest Tuesday to two of the four counts he faces in connection with the rape case in the town that captured national attention, a spokesman with the state attorney general's office said. Richmond and Steubenville High School football teammate Trenton Mays were convicted in March 2013 of the rape after a trial that divided the football-crazed Rust Belt town. In January, one of two former high school football players convicted in the rape that shook the eastern Ohio community of Steubenville was released from juvenile detention. Richmond was 16 when he was convicted last year of raping a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville.
