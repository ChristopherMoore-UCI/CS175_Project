And while some moviegoers will buy tickets to a poignant love story looking for a sort of cathartic experience, Mary Beth Oliver, a professor of media studies at Penn State University, says it's unclear if movies actually serve such a purpose. While movies might not actually make viewers feel better, they do "allow us to experience strong emotions in safe places," said John Sherry, an associate professor specializing in mass media effects at Michigan State University. When two people are just getting to know one another, and impress one another, they might think twice before expressing such emotions, said Richard J. Harris, a professor of psychology at Kansas State University. Harris, who has studied couples' experiences with watching romantic movies, said more women than men give themselves permission to respond to sad or romantic movies. And there's a reason why movies make for such great dates.
