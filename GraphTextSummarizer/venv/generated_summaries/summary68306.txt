Sage Stallone died from heart condition "Lawless" is really a Western, with Forrest guarding his turf as fearlessly as Gary Cooper in "High Noon" or Warren Beatty in "McCabe & Mrs. Miller." The film, written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat, is a sturdy piece of traditionalism with outrÃ© touches (like Mark Lanegan's cover of the Velvet Underground's ''White Light/White Heat,'' the perfect anachronistic filigree for a story about white lightning).

The surrounding drama (Shia LaBeouf as the Bondurant kid brother, a greenhorn who learns to fight like a man; Jessica Chastain as a barkeep who swoons for Forrest) is stuffy and derivative. Taking this stand means he's going to face an army of goons, and Hardy, speaking in low, flat, almost musically macho tones, has the bruiser charisma of a caveman Kevin Costner.
