Bossman, a general practitioner, posted pictures on his Facebook page of campaign promises written on prescription paper -- including history, diagnoses and recommendations for treatment of the city's problems. It was more comments like, 'We would prefer to have a real Slovenian be mayor,'" he told CNN Tuesday morning. His plans for the city of 17,000 include encouraging people to drive electric cars down its narrow streets, building a golf course to draw more tourists and promoting local products. Several weeks before the election, the headline of a column in the Dnevnik newspaper -- sold nationwide -- read, "Peter Bossman for President* (well, first as mayor). I'm Peter Bossman, and I'm just running for mayor of a small town," he said.
