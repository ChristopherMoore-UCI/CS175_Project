They share the same habitat as Sumatran tigers, so to keep from becoming a tiger's dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. Walking back to the camp, we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of Sumatran orangutans and for endangered species worldwide. FZS Indonesia Director Peter Pratje warned us not to get too close to the 11-year-old male orangutan. Bobo was then brought to Peter Pratje and his team at the Frankfurt Zoological Society. Sumatran orangutans can be very strong and unpredictable.
