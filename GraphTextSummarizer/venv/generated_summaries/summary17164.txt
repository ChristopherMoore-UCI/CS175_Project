This is a happy day," said SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk on NASA's space blog after the craft roared into space atop a Falcon 9 rocket. The research "will help us improve our understanding of how humans adapt to living in space for long periods of time and help us develop technologies that will enable deep space exploration." The spacecraft's payload includes some 150 experiments that range from growing plants efficiently in space to investigating how the human immune system functions in microgravity. William Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations, said the planned experiments represent important research for the space program. SpaceX is achieving some success with tests on reigniting the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage on descent, Musk said on the NASA space blog.
