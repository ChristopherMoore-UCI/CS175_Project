According to Mohammed Sediq Rashid, Chief of Operations of the Mine Action Coordination Centre of Afghanistan (or MACCA), at least 12 civilians from villages surrounding the range area have been maimed by unexploded ordnance, or UXOs, in the last four years. Three decades of successive wars made Afghanistan one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. He believes that in both incidents he was hurt by unexploded U.S. ordnance.
