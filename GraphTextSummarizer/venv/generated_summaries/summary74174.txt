CNN's Wolf Blitzer wasted no time in teeing up a Perry versus Mitt Romney showdown over Social Security reform. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is strongly embraced by the tea party, revealed Monday night what one might call a moderate or liberal side on a number of issues, opening the door to potential conservative criticism or perhaps an embrace from moderates. Santorum, a longtime champion of individual liberty, said Perry's decision was "big government run amok," receiving loud applause. She moved to the right of Romney and Perry all night and made it a key point to emphasize personal responsibility over government oversight, winning loud applause from the crowd. Perry stood by his original Social Security remarks, calling the program "a broken system."
