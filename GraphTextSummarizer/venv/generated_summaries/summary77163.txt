McIlroy -- the man he pipped to the title -- was among those to congratulate Wilson, as well as European Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter, who tweeted: "I can't tell you how happy every player on Tour will be for Oliver Wilson winning the Dunhill Links. He estimates that, prior to St. Andrews, he had spent about $120,000 over two years merely traveling to tournaments -- and banked barely half of that before tax from a smattering of prize money. With the new tips on board, Wilson put them into practice the following day and immediately broke the course record, albeit at a second-tier European Challenge Tour event in Kazakhstan. He boasted an unenviable place in the record books: the most runner-up spots in European Tour history without a win, having finished second nine times in 227 tournament starts. " Until St. Andrews, where in 2009 he tied for second with McIlroy at the same event, Wilson had not carded a single round under par in two months.
