-- Winger Adam Ashley-Cooper scored the fastest hat-trick in Rugby World Cup history on Friday as Australia triumphed 67-5 against the United States. Two tries in the first 10 minutes from center Rob Horne and flanker Rocky Elsom got Australia off to a strong start, before the U.S. responded with a score of their own through South Africa-born No. 8 J.J. Gagiano. U.S. coach Eddie O'Sullivan will need his native Ireland, who he coached at the last two World Cups, to lose against Russia on Sunday to keep alive the Super Eagles' slim hopes of reaching the last eight. The bonus-point win was Australia's second of the tournament in New Zealand, and the perfect response to last weekend's shock 15-6 defeat against Ireland. "We spoke about being a little bit smarter in our decision-making," scrumhalf Will Genia, Australia's stand-in captain in the absence of regular skipper James Horwill, told the tournament's official website.
