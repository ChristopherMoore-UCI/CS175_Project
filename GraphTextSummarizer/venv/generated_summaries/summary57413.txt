A self-described hopeless romantic, park ranger Margaret Adams likes to lead the full moon night hikes at Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio. Park stats: Cuyahoga Valley National Park is the 10th most visited National Park in the country with 2.3 million visitors last year. Meet our ranger: Margaret Adams didn't expect to fall in love with Cuyahoga Valley when she started as a seasonal ranger there in 1999. "I decided that by the time I walked the stage at graduation, you need to have decided if you're going to be a teacher or park ranger," she said. Another park she'd like to visit:  Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, with its active volcanoes, is the next National Park on Adams' bucket list.
