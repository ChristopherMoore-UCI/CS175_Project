The trial of Detlef S. opened Tuesday, with his stepdaughter and stepson in court. DNA test results introduced in court gave a "99.999%" certainty that the defendant is the father of her children, he said, and Detlef S. admitted Tuesday he was the father. The man, identified only as Detlef S., is on trial in Koblenz, Germany, charged with the sexual abuse of dependents and facilitating the sexual abuse of minors. A third man suspected of abusing the children has died, Koblenz state court spokesman Alexander Walter said. The first allegations of abuse came more than a decade ago, in 1998, but there was no medical evidence to support the claims then, Germany's youth welfare office said in a statement Tuesday after the trial opened.
