Rogaski is quick to point out that these are not fancy manners and etiquette classes. The college students who showed up with bare midriffs and never contributed to discussions during Faye Rogaski's communication classes were surprised when they weren't picked for coveted internships and jobs. Young job seekers have to transition from being a family member, friend or student to a professional in their online communications, warns Jill Ferrall, assistant dean for career development in the School of Business at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. That's when it clicked for her: Teach basic social skills to children because if they want to get far in life, manners are a requirement, not an option. No "please," no "thank you," no face-to-face handshakes, introductions or follow-ups after classes.
