-- Baptist televangelist Eddie Long said Sunday he will fight allegations that he coerced young male church members into having sex with him. The lawsuits accuse Long of using his power and influence within the 25,000-member church to lure young male church members into sexual relationships. In the parking lot after the services Sunday, church member Juan Davis told CNN affiliate WXIA that he was "very satisfied with what I heard. " "Bishop Eddie Long will have painful situations," he said. " On Saturday, New Birth members also voiced support.
