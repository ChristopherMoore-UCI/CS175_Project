A third suspect, Kewane Gatewood, 20, is accused of supplying the assault weapon, and Brad Jett, 22, was allegedly the lookout during the shooting, police said. David Logan, 22, faces charges of unlawful use of a weapon and obstructing justice, police said Saturday. Police said two of the suspects -- Tabari Young, 22, and Bryon Champ, 21 -- fired shots onto a full basketball court. Those four have been charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, police said. -- Chicago police have arrested a fifth suspect in connection with a shooting that injured 13, including a 3-year-old child, earlier this month.
