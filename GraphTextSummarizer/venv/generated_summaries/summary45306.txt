"Eyewitnesses say that grenades were thrown from a vehicle and the suspected perpetrators fled from the scene." There have been several instances of grenade attacks at bus stations and at a bar in Nairobi in recent months. The East African nation has been on edge since it sent its troops into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab militants after the abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. The explosions, which authorities believe are grenade attacks, occurred Saturday at a normally-crowded bus station in central Nairobi. Al-Shabaab, which the U.S. considers a terror group, has threatened to attack Kenya if it does not withdraw its forces from Somalia. In that attack, a Kenyan man pleaded guilty to being a member of the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab and was charged with causing grievous bodily harm.
