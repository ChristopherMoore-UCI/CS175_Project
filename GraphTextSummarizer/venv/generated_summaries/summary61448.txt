With just two months until the 2014 World Cup kicks off in Brazil, England manager Roy Hodgson laid bare the nature of his problems for picking a squad capable of challenging in South America. Speaking at a news conference at Wembley Stadium, Hodgson revealed he may be forced to pick players who have not appeared regularly for their club sides this season -- claiming nearly 30% of his squad will consist of "players who when you see their names, won't be regular players in their first team and certainly won't be first names on the team sheet." "It's a bit of a transitional period and it's something us in England will have to get used to because some of the best players that we have as young players are at the top clubs," he added. The pool of players available to Hodgson has shrunk further following injuries to Arsenal's Theo Walcott and Southampton's Jay Rodriguez, who are both expected to miss the tournament. And while the talented trio of Everton's Ross Barkley, Liverpool's Raheem Sterling and Southampton's Luke Shaw have all recently emerged, Hodgson accepts that England may have to get used to its younger players being left out in the cold.
