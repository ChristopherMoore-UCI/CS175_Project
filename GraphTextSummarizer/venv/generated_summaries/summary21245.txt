In August, Yemen laid out cease-fire terms that included removing checkpoints, ending banditry, handing over all military equipment and weapons and releasing civilians and military personnel. Fighting in and around the northwestern city of Saada caused the deaths of 13 government soldiers, 19 Houthi rebels and 22 civilians, Houthi rebel sources told Hakim Al-Masmari, the editor-in-chief of the Yemen Post. The next month, government officials said Houthi leaders twice rejected the terms. But the rebels demanded an end to government military operations first. Yemen also demanded the rebels stop entering its northern neighbor, Saudi Arabia.
