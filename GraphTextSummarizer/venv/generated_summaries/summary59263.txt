Myanmar workers are the second class, so the priority goes to the Thai workers," said Naing Tan, Myanmar's deputy ambassador to Thailand. On Monday, a Thai provincial official, the Myanmar diplomat and a priest at the temple met to discuss the refugees' plight and agreed to let migrant workers working legally in the country stay. The heavily industrial Samut Sakorn province employs hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Myanmar, according to estimates from Thai and Myanmar officials. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will visit Thailand on Wednesday during a three-day trip to southeast Asia and plans to visit flood-stricken areas in Bangkok, the U.N. said Monday. In the west of Bangkok, draining water is slow, but the government has dredged canals to speed up draining water.
