In Wednesday's other matches, defending champions Team USA got off to a winning start after beating France 4-2 at a sparsely populated Hampden Park in Glasgow. "Today ahead of the women's football match at Hampden Park, the South Korean flag was shown on a big screen video package instead of the North Korean flag," a statement released to CNN read. After a bright start from New Zealand, Team GB took control of the game, but after spurning numerous chances they had to wait for Houghton to break the deadlock on 64 minutes with a well struck free kick. The other fixtures are as follows: Honduras vs. Morocco, Spain vs. Japan, Mexico vs. South Korea, Gabon vs. Switzerland, United Arab Emirates vs. Uruguay, Egypt vs. Brazil and Belarus vs. New Zealand. They eventually returned to start the match over an hour later, as London Games organizers were forced to issue a hasty apology.
