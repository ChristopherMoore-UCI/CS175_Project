White House security was increased immediately after Friday's breach, but permanently adding more guards on the lawn and around the entrances would help prevent jumpers and make it easier to catch anyone who successfully jumps in the future. Josh Earnest, White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that going forward, those doors will be locked when not being used. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has ordered a full review of Friday's incident. Despite the fence and the armed guards, the White House North Lawn is relatively accessible to the public. "Keeping the White House within public reach, if you will, sends an important political message," said Engel, who specializes in presidential security.
