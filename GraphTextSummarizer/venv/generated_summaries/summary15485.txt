Google announced Tuesday that its mobile maps will now include real-time updates about accidents, construction and other potential sources of traffic snarls. Now, Google Maps will notify drivers about more traffic jams as well. Waze won an award for Best Overall Mobile App award at the 2013 Mobile World Congress. Starting Tuesday, Waze users' reports on road conditions will appear on the Google Maps app for Android and iOS in the United States as well as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Germany, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Switzerland and the UK. Mapping apps on phones have already replaced dedicated navigation devices for many drivers trying to find unfamiliar addresses.
