The scope and legality of the government's warrantless electronic surveillance programs was discussed Tuesday as a federal appeals court reviewed a lower U.S. court's injunction that would block collection of data from two plaintiffs who are suing Activist Larry Klayman, an attorney who heads the group "Freedom Watch," filed suit last year based on published reports of wrongdoing from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Klayman, in that lawsuit, said the lack of travel restrictions from areas affected by the Ebola crisis provides an opportunity for terrorists to use the disease for germ warfare. "Just the inception of acquiring that information -- they're not entitled to it -- without any showing of probable cause, or reasonable suspicion of contact with terrorists, that's the problem. " Tuesday he said he has the standing to bring the suit as a customer of Verizon, one of the companies known to be cooperating with warrantless surveillance. Klayman responded by pointing out the government's admission of as many as 2,000 errors in how NSA conducted warrantless surveillance.
