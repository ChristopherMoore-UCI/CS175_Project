Five spots went to PGA Tour counterparts based on their FedExCup ranking, with Billy Horschel highest in the standings at No. 5. Blixt won Sunday's rain affected Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia to see his ranking rise from 103rd to 51st. Bjorn's double-bogey five on the 16th at Royal St. George's in Sandwich, England effectively ended his hopes of capturing a maiden major and allowed the little known Curtis to triumph. Bjorn was one of five European Tour players to earn the exemption based on their Race to Dubai ranking. But in his last five European Tour events, Bjorn registered three top-five finishes and sits 13th in the Race to Dubai.
