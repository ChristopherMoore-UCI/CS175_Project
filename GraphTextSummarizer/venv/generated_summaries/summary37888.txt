British police announced last week that three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- had flown aboard a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. British Prime Minister David Cameron has said the case highlights the need to fight ISIS on multiple fronts. What is ISIS' appeal for young people? While holding a teddy bear that Amira had given her mother for Mother's Day, he said his daughter had never expressed an interest in ISIS. "To convince such young girls at that age that are so vulnerable ... it's just wrong," Begum said.
