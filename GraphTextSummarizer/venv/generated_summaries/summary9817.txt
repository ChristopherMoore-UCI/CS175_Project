Baez can also claim that Padilla made more money becoming part of the Casey Anthony story than it cost him to be part of the search, Griffin said. When the lawsuit is filed, Padilla may have to get in line behind the others seeking money from Anthony. At the time of Caylee's disappearance, Anthony told family members and police that the little girl was with a nanny named Zenaida Fernandez Gonzalez. Padilla says when he heard Baez's opening statement during Anthony's murder trial he felt conned. Padilla said Anthony's attorney allowed him to fly to Florida in 2008 and help search for Anthony's then-missing 2-year-old daughter.
