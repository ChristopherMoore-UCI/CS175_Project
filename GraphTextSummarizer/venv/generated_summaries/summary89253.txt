"Warm Bodies" opened with a bit less than the 2009 comedy "Zombieland," which debuted with $24.7 million, but its star was in line with the debuts of both Chronicle and The Woman In Black, which opened on Super Bowl weekend last year to $22 million and $20.9 million, respectively. -- Young women drove Summit's zombie-themed romantic comedy "Warm Bodies" to the top spot at the box office over Super Bowl weekend, while Sylvester Stallone's Bullet to the Head got tackled, leaving the action icon with the worst debut of his career. For star Nicholas Hoult, who has a slew of high profile releases — including Jack the Giant Slayer, Mad Max: Fury Road, and X-Men: Days of Future Past — on the horizon, Warm Bodies is a nice start to his run as a leading man. Zero Dark Thirty -- $5.3 million The weekend's other new wide release, Sylvester Stallone's R-rated action vehicle Bullet to the Head, got off to an even worse start than Arnold Schrwazenegger's The Last Stand did two weeks ago. The last time a Stallone film opening in over 500 theaters did worse was in 1981, when Nighthawks earned $2.5 million on opening weekend — and that was only from 659 theaters, about 30 percent of Bullet's theater count.
