"This notice confirms your application for employer-sponsored insurance offered by STAFF US House of Representatives was received and approved," read the short letters given to verified staff members and shown to CNN by several employees Monday. But because Congress wanted to taste the medicine of Obamacare firsthand, the Affordable Care Act mandates that the only way members or staff can get health care benefits is by signing up on an exchange. Thus, only Congress has both a requirement to go on the exchanges to get employee health benefits and a firm enrollment cutoff date. But with technical problems popping up in the past few days, House administrators gave employees (including elected members) a safety net. Of course, the exchanges do have some deadlines: You must sign up by December 23 to get insurance coverage starting January 1, and by March 1, almost every American must have health care or be penalized.
