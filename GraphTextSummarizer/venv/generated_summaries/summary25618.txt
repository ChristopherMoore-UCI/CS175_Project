Actress Lindsay Lohan showed up three weeks early at a Los Angeles jail to begin serving her sentence for a theft charge, but it was determined that she would be allowed to serve her time in home confinement, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said Thursday. " "It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Once there, it was determined that she was eligible for home confinement instead of jail, he said. Early release formulas, required by a federal order to reduce jail overcrowding, will likely reduce the sentence to about 14 days, Whitmore said after the sentencing. " As part of Lohan's sentence, Sautner also ordered that the actress remain on supervised probation until she completes 480 hours of community service.
