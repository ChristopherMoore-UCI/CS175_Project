In November, he laid a wreath in St. Omer, France -- where he was stationed during the war -- to celebrate Armistice Day, the end of World War I. Allingham said last year that he remains active to emphasize the importance of remembering the conflict. -- Britain's oldest man and the oldest living veteran of World War I was celebrating his 112th birthday Friday with a party and a fly-past at an air force base. Allingham is Britain's oldest man and the oldest surviving member of the armed forces, according to Guinness World Records. In July, Allingham had a private audience with Queen Elizabeth and attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace. "I don't do these things because I enjoy doing them but to keep the memory alive of all my comrades who fought and died in the First World War," he told the Ministry of Defense.
