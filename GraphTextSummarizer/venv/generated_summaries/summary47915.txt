In a turnabout, Harry ends up more or less working for a guy who's been his nemesis in other books. This is Connelly's 24th novel and the 18th featuring his dogged LAPD detective Harry Bosch. His most recent novel, "The Fifth Witness," hit No. 1 on the bestseller list, and Connelly topped 1 million e-books sold online. I think his cynicism has been alleviated somewhat by having his daughter in his life in the last couple of books. So I'm working on a Harry Bosch book.
