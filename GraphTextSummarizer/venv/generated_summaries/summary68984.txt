-- Internet attacks shut down the social networking site Twitter for about two hours on Thursday morning and caused glitches in other sites like Facebook and LiveJournal, a blogging site. Logging on to sites such as Twitter while they are under attack only makes the situation worse because it adds to the overloading of the system, he said. Internet attacks sometimes hit Web sites as they become popular. "It's not going to be something where malware (harmful software) is going to be deployed and then randomly attacks Web sites." John Harrison, a researcher with Web security firm Symantec, said it is very difficult to learn the identity of the attacker, or attackers, as they could be anywhere on Earth and the infected network could span several countries. Facebook and other social networking sites appeared to be affected by Twitter's shut-down, too.
