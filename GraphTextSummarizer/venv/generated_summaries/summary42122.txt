-- Chinese communists need to fight corruption if China's ruling party is to survive, China's president said Friday. "The Party is soberly aware of the gravity and danger of corruption," said Hu Jintao, who as president also serves as general secretary of the Communist Party of China. Under CPC rule, the Chinese government in recent years has been confronting a slew of intractable problems, including corruption, a growing gap between the rich and the poor and environmental degradation. Hu called on "outstanding individuals in all fields", especially among the youth, to join as party members. "China has developed rapidly in the past 30 plus years thanks to reform and opening up, and the country must promote its future development by continuing to carry out reform and opening up," he intoned.
