Look at the polls in races where specific candidates have tried to scare voters away from their opponents: -- Fear is on the run in North Carolina, where a third party group's campaign mailer in support of Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, which was clearly aimed at African-Americans, warned that electing Republican challenger Thom Tillis would set the stage for the immediate impeachment of President Barack Obama. And, most of all, fear is on the run in Colorado, where Republican Cory Gardner maintains a narrow lead over Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in most polls. From this point on, they need to insist upon something that elected officials don't always give voters: respect. What was on display in many of this year's Senate races was the politics of fear, where politicians are so desperate to get elected or re-elected that they use inflammatory commercials and wild accusations to terrify the same group of voters who they should be trying to inspire with a hopeful and confident message. -- Fear is on the run in Texas, Arizona, California and New Mexico where Republicans want to scare voters into thinking that ISIS and Ebola -- or perhaps even ISIS militants infected with Ebola -- are salsa dancing across a porous U.S.-Mexican border.
