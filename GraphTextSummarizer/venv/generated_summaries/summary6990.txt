Working dogs have left an important paw print on our society -- in Panama City, central America, we see how the specially trained dogs of the Red Cross bring comfort to sick children and prepare for rescue missions during natural disasters. Singer Joss Stone tells Quest why dogs are a girl's best friend. Back in Hollywood, Quest helps pick out the doggy stars of the future with Animal Actors agent Gloria Winship. So it remains to this day, that we need dogs and they need us. Some mutts are not so lucky -- Quest joins actress Allison Janney at the New Leash On Life dog rescue center, where the doe-eyed inmates wait for adoption.
