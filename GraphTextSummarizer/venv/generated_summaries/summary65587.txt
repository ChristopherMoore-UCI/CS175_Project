-- Lionel Messi returned to haunt Arsenal as his two goals helped Barcelona into the quarterfinals of the Champions League after a 3-1 win in Spain. But Van Persie was shown a second yellow card for shooting on goal after being flagged offside. Barcelona then took control as Xavi edged them ahead from a flowing move before Messi grabbed his second from the penalty spot after Laurent Koscielny tripped Pedro. Almunia made a string of vital saves to keep Arsenal in it before the visitors had a late chance to steal the tie when Jack Wilshere put substitute Nicklas Bendtner through on goal but the Danish striker's first touch was poor and he lost possession. Messi opened the scoring just before halftime before the English club pulled level thanks to Sergio Busquets' own goal.
