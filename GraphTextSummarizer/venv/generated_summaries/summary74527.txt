Before the decision, Sneiderman was facing malice murder, felony murder and aggravated assault charges related to the death of her husband, Rusty. He told psychiatric evaluators that he saw hallucinations of demons resembling Barry White and angels resembling singer Olivia Newton-John who told him that the Sneiderman children were his and he needed to kill Rusty. Rusty Sneiderman, a Harvard-educated businessman, was gunned down in the parking lot of a suburban Atlanta preschool in November of 2010. Prosecutors said Neuman confided in White about his alleged affair with Sneiderman, a fact they say can be bolstered by evidence. Prosecutors will continue to pursue four counts of perjury, seven counts of making false statements to law enforcement officials and one count of hindering the apprehension of a criminal.
