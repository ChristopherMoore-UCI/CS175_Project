Netflix is rebranding its 12-year-old movies-by-mail service as Qwikster and adding video games to its catalog, Reed Hastings, the company's CEO, announced Sunday night. "Members have been asking for video games for many years, and now that DVD by mail has its own team, we are finally getting it done," Hastings wrote. " Hastings has worried for the last five years that Netflix will fail to successfully adapt its business to growing opportunities, such as online video streaming, he wrote in a rare public admission for the savvy Netflix co-founder. While Netflix is not going back on the price changes from earlier this summer, customers should not expect further increases, Hastings wrote. "It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes," Hastings wrote.
