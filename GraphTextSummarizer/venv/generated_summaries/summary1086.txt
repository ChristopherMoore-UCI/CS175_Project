Two years ago, after having researched the type of cannon used in Columbus' time, "I woke up in the middle of the night and said, 'Oh my God,' " Clifford told CNN. " The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said. Most of the ship is in shape and will be possible to excavate with the help of the Haitian government, said Clifford, who made a name for himself salvaging pirate ships off the coasts of Cape Cod and Madagascar. Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola, which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Underwater explorer Barry Clifford, who led a team that found and investigated the wreck, says he's confident it is.
