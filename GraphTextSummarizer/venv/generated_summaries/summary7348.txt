-- Bone-dry conditions in an area that has not seen a major fire in more than 60 years pushed a Southern California wildfire from 45,000 acres to more than 100,000 acres in a matter of hours Monday, fire officials said. The Station fire, burning in Angeles National Forest north of Los Angeles, has forced thousands of evacuations and threatened thousands of structures -- including major communications installations on Mount Wilson, said Mike Dietrich, the U.S. Forest Service's incident commander. In addition, two to three dozen recreational cabins were destroyed, said Randi Jorgensen, another Forest Service information officer. And Los Angeles County Fire Department Deputy Chief Mike Bryant noted that "there have been hundreds of homes saved by firefighters in this effort." Three people suffered burns while in the Big Tujunga Canyon recreational area, where three homes were destroyed by the Station fire, said Bruce Quintelier, fire information officer for the Forest Service.
