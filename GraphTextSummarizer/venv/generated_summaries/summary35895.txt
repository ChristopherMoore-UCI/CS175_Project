Directed by Oren Jacoby, the film shows how Bartali was part of a secret Italian resistance movement which helped hide the country's Jews during the Nazi invasion of 1943. "I never thought, back in 1975, that almost 40 years later I would be given the opportunity to tell the story of Italian children who were hidden and saved, along with the story of Gino Bartali and some of the other heroes who risked their lives to do it." And yet for a man who lived in his life in the full glare of the public, a new film, My Italian Secret reveals a very different side to Bartali's remarkable life. Having spent a summer in Rome as a 19-year-old, the story of Italy's Jews and how ordinary Italians managed to defy the Nazis had always been at the back of Jacoby's mind. "One day, the professor who ran the course, a Polish filmmaker named Marian Marzynski, took me to lunch in a caf√© in the Rome ghetto, meters away from a plaque memorializing the roundup of Rome's Jews in 1943," recalled Jacoby.
