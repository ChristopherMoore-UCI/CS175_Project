" U.S. District Judge John Koeltl granted a motion filed by federal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Prisons to reduce the sentence of outspoken lawyer Lynne Stewart, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2010. After visiting Abdel-Rahman in prison, Stewart passed on a message from him to his Islamic Group followers: that Islamic Group should reconsider a cease-fire in attacks against the Egyptian government. "I believe her immediate plan is to seek medical attention at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center." Stewart, who is 74 and has breast cancer, was known for representing poor and sometimes unpopular clients as a defense attorney. In 2010, Koeltl revised his initial sentencing of Stewart from 28 months to 10 years in prison. Wearing navy blue prison garb and handcuffs, Stewart entered a crowded courtroom to a standing ovation.
