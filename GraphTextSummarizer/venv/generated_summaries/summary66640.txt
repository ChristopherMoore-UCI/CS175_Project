"In sailing terms, it would be the biggest thing that ever happened in British sailing," says Ainslie, reflecting on how big an achievement it would be if the indomitable Team Oracle was upset. He might downplay his role -- "I'm not doing any role specifically bar steering the boat when it's on the water" -- but Ainslie is Britain's America's Cup bid. " Ainslie has adopted a "best of British" ethos in everything the team does, despite an influx of international staff in certain key roles. The partnership between the knight and the duchess came about after Ainslie took her sister Pippa sailing. An essentially shy sportsman who has achieved remarkable feats -- he was also part of Team Oracle's America's Cup victory last year -- it's as if Ainslie has become his very own brand.
