"Having the unit on the road and available on a rental basis is opening cryotherapy up to an awful lot more people," Ian Bridge, managing director of cryotherapy consultants Sappari, tells CNN. "It is a growing industry," chairman Bohorquez, who brought cryotherapy to New York after receiving revelatory treatment in Poland on his injured right knee, tells CNN. There are two types of cryotherapy treatments -- whole body and partial exposure -- but both involve serious sub-zero temperatures. "I've used whole body cryotherapy for several years," Harrington commented to CNN. "It's not like sticking your hand in an ice bucket or taking an ice bath -- this is extreme cold," Liam Hennessy, Harrington's fitness coach and a world leading expert in cryotherapy, tells CNN.
