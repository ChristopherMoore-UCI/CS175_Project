This act of wizardry is performed hundreds of millions of times every day with the press of a button, or more increasingly, with a gentle tap of the screen -- and poof, time stops. An inexpensive and easy-to-use camera in every hand didn't usher in the end of photography or automatically turn everybody into Richard Avedon. Because I know that time cannot touch my digital images, I add in the passage of time by using filters. The apps and filters only change a photo's look and aesthetic feel. It seems natural for me to add the option of nostalgic filters to my photographic process.
