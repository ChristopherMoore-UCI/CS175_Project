Lower interest rates and loan forgiveness in some cases are some of the rules that will make borrowing cheaper for many students. Students who graduate with college loan debt can use a repayment plan that will give lower monthly payments. "Just imagine all those people that went to college and had expectations of a good job market and now it's not so hot," said Deputy Undersecretary Bob Shireman of the U.S. Department of Education. -- Colleges aren't getting any cheaper, but federal student loans are. Last year, the government gave out about $80 billion in student loans to more than 7 million students.
