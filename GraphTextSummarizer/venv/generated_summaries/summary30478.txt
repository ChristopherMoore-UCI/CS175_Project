News: Palin speaks out after leaving Fox The exiled-politician-turned-pundit has been a growing staple of cable news. As Palin appeared from Alaska with less frequency, she became less a part of the national conversation. Little wonder that Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes rushed to sign her as a million-dollar-a-year contributor and built a modern studio for Palin in her Wasilla home. The future seemed limitless in 2009, when Palin wrote a book that was a monster best-seller and starred in a TLC reality series about Alaska. And for a time as the 2012 campaign approached, the Fox payroll included no fewer than four potential presidential candidates: Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee and Palin.
