Ambulance drivers wait for Israel and the Red Cross to give them the green light Thursday to leave Gaza City. Â» Rescue teams found 15 wounded people and three corpses in other houses, said the ICRC, which casts the shelling as a single incident. Witnesses told the U.N. they had been calling for ambulances to collect dead and wounded people in the Zeitoun buildings, she said.
