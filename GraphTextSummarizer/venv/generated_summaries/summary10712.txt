A Democratic aide told CNN that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer are drafting a letter to Senate leaders "throwing down the gauntlet" to insist that a pay-as-you-go system be followed, which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases. Major health reform is likely to pass this year, because the special process -- known as budget reconciliation -- won't allow Republicans to filibuster the legislation, as was widely expected. The budget resolution would limit increases in non-defense discretionary spending to 2.9 percent through 2014, according to Conrad. "This budget is a major accomplishment," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad said in a statement. Budget negotiators have fast-tracked part of the budget process.
