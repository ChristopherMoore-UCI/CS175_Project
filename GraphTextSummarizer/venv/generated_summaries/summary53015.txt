The 70th-ranked female has upset some of the sport's biggest female stars, including Russian aces Elena Dementieva (No. 4 seed) and Maria Sharapova (No. 29 seed, who has been ranked No. 1 worldwide in the past). Her skills were apparent from an early age, said Turhan Berne of Norcross, a coach and tournament director who's known Oudin since she was 9. When Oudin took that set, they rose to their feet, screamed, did happy dances and shared hugs. Members of the Racquet Club of the South erupt when Melanie Oudin beats Nadia Petrova. Melanie Oudin, 17, of Marietta, Georgia, has taken the tennis world by storm at the U.S. Open.
