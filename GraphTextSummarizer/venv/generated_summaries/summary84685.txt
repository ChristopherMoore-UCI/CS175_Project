Newtown resident Yolie Moreno said Friday that she plans a unique way to turn those sentiments into the actual building blocks of a future memorial. -- After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, hundreds of thousands of cards, letters, drawings, stuffed animals and other sentimental items poured into Newtown from throughout the world in a show of support. Moreno started an initiative called Embracing Newtown which will make use of the massive amounts of material that turned up starting in January at the town's municipal center. Moreno described the process as energy being transformed into a testament to the love and goodness of the people who reached out to Newtown in so many ways. Moreno enlisted the help of more than 100 volunteers to sort through the piles of mementos.
