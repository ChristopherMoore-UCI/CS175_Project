Sikhs have lived in the area for centuries, running businesses and operating farms. The men were kidnapped by the Pakistan Taliban for ransom from Khyber Agency two weeks ago, said Shafirullah Wazir, the area's administrative chief. As the area has come increasingly under the influence of Islamic militants, so has pressure on the Sikhs. In the case of one of the abducted men, Jaspal Singh, the kidnappers had demanded 20 million rupees, the semiofficial Associated Press of Pakistan said. -- Two men from the minority Sikh community in Pakistan's tribal northwest were kidnapped and beheaded on Sunday, authorities said this week.
