Prosecutors say that on the day after Lloyd was killed, Jenkins got a coded text message from Hernandez. Prosecutors allege Jenkins may have been following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by putting the gun in a black trash bag and borrowing her sister's car to dispose of the bag in a trash bin. Here are some of the key moments from the past week of his murder trial: Judge Susan Garsh on Monday reversed her initial ruling to block any mention of multiple texts from Lloyd before he was slain. Lloyd, a semipro football player, was shot multiple times on June 17, 2013. Thibou will not be able to talk about the nature of the texts, including this one that prosecutors say was from Lloyd: "U saw who I'm with... Nfl... just so u know."
