Former Police Chief William Bratton significantly reduced inner city crime rates in New York and Los Angeles and improved police relations in minority neighborhoods by community policing policies that favored mediating differences instead of authoritarian strong-arm tactics. In the courts and in society, we tend to think of racial bias as overt bigotry and imagine that the George Zimmermans and the Paula Deens of the world hold negative stereotypes of other races and intentionally think less of them as people. Community courts are gaining favor as a way of building partnerships among residents, merchants, churches, and schools to address local safety and crime problems. It's time to make implicit bias explicit. While I am not criticizing this jury's decision, the courts and local communities would all benefit from greater diversity.
