The Apple vs. Adobe standoff over Flash has been one of the tech world's most visible, and at times nasty, disputes. On Wednesday, Adobe announced it will no longer be developing Flash, its media-player tool, for mobile devices. In 1999, he was flatly denied when he asked Adobe to create a version of its popular Adobe Premiere digital-graphics software for the Mac. "Flash is a spaghetti-ball piece of technology that has lousy performance and really bad security problems," he said, according to biographer Walter Isaacson in his book published earlier this month. But Jobs, who in Isaacson's book comes off sometimes as vindictive and brusque as he was innovative and inspirational, told Isaacson that Adobe went downhill after founder John Warnock retired.
