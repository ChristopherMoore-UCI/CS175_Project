Lifelong runner and Austin Marathon race director John Conley has been a part of many races, but none of the finishes he's been a part of quite compare to what he saw Sunday in Texas. "You ran the bravest race and crawled the bravest crawl I have ever seen in my life," Conley said to Ngetich on Sunday night, "You have earned much honor. With just 2 meters left for her to crawl, Ngetich was passed by second place finisher Hannah Steffan. Conley said Ngetich crawled more than 400 meters (1,312 feet) to cross the finish line, leaving her knees and elbows bloodied and her hands stained from the pavement. He'd expected to see Kenyan runner Hyvon Ngetich.
