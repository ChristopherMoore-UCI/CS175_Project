-- FC Basel will take a 1-0 lead over Bayern Munich into the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie after a late winner from substitute Valentin Stocker earned victory on Wednesday, when 2010 title winners Inter Milan also conceded a last-gasp goal to lose in Marseille. Defender Aleksandar Dragovic forced Neuer into a reflex save and Alexander Frei rattled the crossbar from close range. Serie A giants Inter must have also thought they were heading for a goalless draw at the Stade Velodrome until Ghana's Andre Ayew popped up to head home for Marseille in the 93rd minute. It's just not happening for us at the moment," said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Then with four minutes left, Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua picked out Stocker, who had been left clear by poor Bayern defending, and he shot underneath Neuer.
