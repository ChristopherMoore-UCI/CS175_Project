After he was taken into custody and during interviews, Quinones "expressed his plans, preparation and intentions to kill President Obama and former President Clinton," according to an affidavit filed in federal court. Authorities also found books and manuals about FBI hostage rescue teams, Osama bin Laden, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, the Russian mafia and other topics, according to the affidavit signed by FBI and secret service agents. Quinones was arrested Monday after a two-hour hostage situation at Winn Army Community Hospital on Fort Stewart, about 45 miles from Savannah, according to the FBI. Quinones was discharged from the military in February and had a civilian job at Fort Stewart, said the FBI, which released no other information on his military record. Robert Anthony Quinones, 29, of Hinesville, Georgia, will appear before a U.S. magistrate judge in Savannah, Georgia, on multiple charges, including threats to kill President Obama and former President Bill Clinton.
