In recent years bedbug numbers have gone up between 100-500% in North America, in Europe and in parts of Asia and Australia" said Rowan Hooper, news editor for the New Scientist magazine. With Lola's heightened sense of smell, Astley can identify bedbugs and their eggs without having to rely on the telltale signs -- feces that appear as tiny black spots that smear when wiped. Bedbugs like to stay close to people -- "anything that is in close proximity to where we are or where we sleep," explains Astley, owner of Trust K9. Astley gets rid of bedbugs by transforming the infested house into an oven. Astley shrieks and rewards her with biscuits.
