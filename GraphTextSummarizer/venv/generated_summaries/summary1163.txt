-- Aid intended for Gaza that was unloaded from a Libyan-backed ship in northern Egypt was sitting in storage Saturday, awaiting transfer, according to the governor of North Sinai. The ship from the Gadhafi foundation, a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, docked in Al Arish and began unloading aid Thursday. However, it was taking time to sort out the medical supplies -- a top priority for delivery -- from other aid, Gen. Morad Mowafe told CNN Saturday. Israel came under fierce international criticism after Israeli navy commandos boarded a Gaza-bound Turkish aid ship in May and nine people died. Israel said it must inspect all goods prior to their entering Gaza to ensure that weapons do not get into the hands of militants.
