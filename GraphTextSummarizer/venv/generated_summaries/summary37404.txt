-- A Nigerian immigrant is responsible for paying child support for twins conceived through in vitro fertilization with his wife -- even though the procedure took place at least a year after the couple had separated, Massachusetts' highest appeals court has ruled. The court said Tuesday that because the husband, Chukwudera B. Okoli, had originally consented to the artificial insemination procedure, he is now responsible for the payments as the twins' legal and biological parent, according to court documents. Blessing Okoli then acquired the husband's consent to begin the in vitro procedure at a fertility clinic in Boston. The two were married in Boston in 1991 and tried unsuccessfully to have children. Court documents did not indicate Okoli's current immigration status.
