"He was arrested on minor traffic charges and spent only three hours in jail," said representative Domenick Nati. DMX has faced various criminal charges in the past, including probation violation, illegal drug possession and animal cruelty. DMX may realize by now that South Carolina police know who he is and that he does not have a driver's license. He was also arrested in Greenville, South Carolina, on July 26 on charges of driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt, police said. It was his third run-in with the law in his home state in recent months, which included a citation for marijuana possession in Greer, South Carolina, in August.
