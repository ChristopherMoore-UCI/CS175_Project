"They were dismissed because of some are directly responsible for how Gen. Younis was arrested," Abdulmolah said. " Younis and two other rebels were killed after the TNC sought to question him about allegations that he or those close to him had ongoing ties to Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi, Younis' supporters have said. According to Gadhafi spokesman Musa Ibrahim, Younis' killing represented "more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead any sort of government or have any control of eastern cities of Libya." The death of the rebel government's military commander, Gen. Abdel Fattah Younis, on July 28 played a role in board members' ouster Monday, said Shamsiddin Abdulmolah, the council's media director. At least four people are directly responsible administratively for the events leading to the Younis assassination, Abdulmolah said.
