One shows a male putting his genitals on what appears to be a loaf of Subway bread. According to Columbus Public Health, whose inspectors routinely check on restaurants in the area, the Subway franchise did not have any critical violations in its last two inspections that took place this past March and in October 2012. The company released a statement Tuesday about what it called an "isolated incident (that) is not representative of Subway sandwich artists," the latter term being what Subway calls those who make sandwiches at its restaurants. The incident came to light over the past few days at a Subway franchise abutting a gas station in Dublin, Ohio. Gilligan Oil, the company that owns and operates the Subway franchise in question, did not respond immediately Tuesday to CNN's request for comment.
