" Nunziato said that the "astonishing number of TSA security failures" has led airport police organizations to ask Congress to create uniformed standards for airport security. At 11:18 a.m., TSA screeners looked at recordings captured by the closed circuit television cameras. While Port Authority Police Department union representatives complained that the incident was an example of TSA incompetence, a TSA official, speaking on background, said other factors may vindicate the agency. "Unfortunately, these glaring TSA security failures at our nation's busiest airports continue to undermine security, which imperils and needlessly inconveniences the traveling public," Paul Nunziato, president of the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association, said in a statement to CNN. Authorities shut down the checkpoint, and a breach of security was issued, the Port Authority report says.
