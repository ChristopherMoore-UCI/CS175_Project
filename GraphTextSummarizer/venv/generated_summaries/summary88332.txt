Given that, it's not too surprising that MTV's news and music teams -- having noticed that Cyrus' MTV artist page is the most-visited of the year, with her VMAs performance being the most-watched video -- have given her another No. 1. Neither of those music acts should feel too badly about losing to Cyrus -- they're both still on MTV's list of the top 10 best artists of 2013: 1. After stealing the spotlight at not one but two MTV awards shows, starring in an MTV documentary and taking over the network on her 21st birthday, MTV has crowned Cyrus as its best artist of the year. Both singles were accompanied by music videos that became cultural touchstones and almost broke the Internet. Cyrus is the third star to take the title, following Katy Perry and One Direction.
