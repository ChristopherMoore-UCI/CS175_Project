I don't know what tools of the trade Paul Rudd and director David Wain share to dream up the kind of inspired nutso stuff Rudd has done in smart-funny-raunchy winners like "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Role Models." So they hit the road, resigned to accepting shelter and abuse from George's gloriously obnoxious "successful" brother down in Atlanta, a prize pig played to the snout by Wanderlust coscreenwriter/producer and fellow Wain regular Ken Marino ("Role Models"). It's a thrill to see sexy Malin Akerman ("The Proposal"), "Six Feet Under's" peachy Lauren Ambrose, priceless Kathryn Hahn (so memorable an adversary for Rudd in "Our Idiot Brother"), and elder statesman Alan Alda bond over hippie clich√©s. And, no small thing, it's a pleasure to see Aniston thrive in her comedy zone, secure in the knowledge that for every inch of propriety she's willing to cede, Paul Rudd is ready to get 10 times as crazy for a grateful nation. And that's exactly the sweet spot where Wain-ian comedy -- rooted in craziness that breaches the walls of "normal" -- lets Rudd shine.
