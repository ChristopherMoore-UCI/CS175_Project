But to be fair, it isn't as if there hasn't been a string of white males in the past who have been even less suited for powerful White House jobs. President Bill Clinton was the first to name a cabinet in which women and people of color outnumbered white males. What seemed so natural to him was what was what also struck me as new: Photo after photo showed people of color working and meeting their President alongside and of equal standing with whites. But in the West Wing itself, white men continued to dominate the inner circles. President George W. Bush surprised some when he continued that tradition.
