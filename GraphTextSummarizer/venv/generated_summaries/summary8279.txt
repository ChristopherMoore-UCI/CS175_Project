Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger branded the surface 'a disaster' after the FA Cup semifinal defeat by Chelsea last Saturday, while Sir Alex Ferguson called it 'dead' in the aftermath of Manchester United's penalty shoot-out defeat to Everton 24 hours later. Due to the number of non-footballing events, including pop concerts, which are required at Wembley to make the rebuilding project viable, it was felt the rye-grass option was more likely to withstand the extra punishment. In the wake of such criticism, stadium officials decided to launch a thorough review of the pitch and have concluded the rye grass surface should be replaced with immediate effect. A statement read: "Wembley Stadium is a multi-purpose venue and needs to be able to offer both a quality playing surface and a quality calendar of events. The controversial pitch at the new Wembley stadium is to be dug up immediately.
