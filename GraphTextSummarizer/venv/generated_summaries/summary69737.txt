Lester Mullet, 26, Johnny Mullet, 38, and Levi Miller, 53, were arrested last Friday, according to Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla. The attacks, according to Abdalla, were instigated by an extreme Amish splinter group led by Lester and Johnny Mullet's father -- Bishop Sam Mullet. -- I call it a cult -- was shunned from his faith some years ago," Abdalla said in regard to Bishop Mullet. "Nothing moves in this (particular) Amish community unless (Bishop Mullet) says it moves," Abdalla said. Amish men typically grow beards in accordance with their religious practice, according to Donald Kraybill, an Amish scholar at Elizabethtown College.
