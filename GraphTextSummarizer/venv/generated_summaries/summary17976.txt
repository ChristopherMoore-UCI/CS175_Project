-- Cloaked in darkness and enveloped by mist, aerialist Nik Wallenda walked across Niagara Falls on a tightrope late Friday and into the record books. The tense 1,800-foot journey took 25 minutes, according to CNN affiliate CTV. When asked by ABC how he planned to top the walk over Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he hopes to become the first person in the world to walk a tightrope across the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. "It's been a dream of mine for a long time," Wallenda told CNN before the Niagara Falls attempt. Thousands were on hand to watch Wallenda teeter his way on the 2-inch-wide wire over Horseshoe Falls toward Canada.
