Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group -- considered one of the world's most deadly terrorist organizations -- has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Hundreds of Islamist militants have seized a multinational military base in northeastern Nigeria, according to a government official. "Boko Haram overwhelmed the Multinational Joint Task Force and dislodged them from their base outside Baga after hours-long fighting," said Maina Ma'aji Lawan, a Nigerian senator â€Žfrom the state of Borno, where Baga is located.
