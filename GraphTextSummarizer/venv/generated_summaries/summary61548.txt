WBTV: Fantasia Barrino 911 call Barrino publicly acknowledged the affair in a statement Tuesday issued by Dickens that said "Fantasia fell in love with Mr. Cook and believed that he loved her. "Fantasia believed Mr. Cook when he told her he was not happy in his marriage and his heart was not in it," Dickens said. "Fantasia gave inconsistent interviews about the status of her relationship with Mr. Cook because sometimes they were on and sometimes they were off," Dickens said. The overdose came the same day she read a court complaint from a woman who alleged that Barrino carried on a year-long affair with her husband, according to manager Brian Dickens. The police report obtained by CNN said Dickens called 911 to report the overdose at the singer's home in Charlotte, North Carolina.
