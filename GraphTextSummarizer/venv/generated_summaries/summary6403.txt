"When I found out more about the Maori culture, I fell in love with it and with the people, too." To win the part of Khal Drogo, Momoa wanted something powerful and irresistible to watch -- and haka fit the bill on both counts. A 2012 YouTube clip of the audition, resurfaced by Time, shows Momoa giving a captivating performance of a haka, a traditional dance done by the Maori people of New Zealand. Momoa was born in Hawaii, but the actor told New Zealand's Stuff last year that he feels a kinship with the Maori. "I just thought it was apt for the role because it's beautiful and scary." Unfortunately, Momoa's imposing Drogo didn't last long in the "Game of Thrones'" world, but with at least one flashback planned for the upcoming fifth season, fans can always hope to see his character again. The actor gave a breakthrough performance as Dothraki leader Khal Drogo in the first season of "Game of Thrones," and a 35-second audition tape proves that he was pretty much born to play the part.
