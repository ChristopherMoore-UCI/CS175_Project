The question now is whether we should do it on purpose," said MIT associate professor of environmental policy and symposium participant Judith Layzer. MIT's Layzer thinks climate engineering will create new problems that will need their own solutions. -- The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long been known worldwide for its engineering programs, and a symposium at MIT this week will draw scientists from around the globe to focus on a hot facet of the field -- climate engineering. Should We Try?" Climate engineering may sound a little Frankensteinian and worrisome, but it's not a new concept. So one of the lessons of climate engineering, I think, is that some climate engineers insist they're the first generation to purpose this deliberate manipulation. ...
