He admitted telling undercover officers he wanted to set off bombs to destabilize Chicago and was willing to attack police officers, prosecutors said in a statement. "The thought of what might have happened if it (the bomb) was real is horrific," U.S. District Judge Robert Gettlemen said at the sentencing in Chicago, according to the statement released by the U.S. Attorney's Office. -- A Chicago man was sentenced Thursday to 23 years in prison for attempting to set off what he thought was a bomb on a crowded street near Wrigley Field in 2010. A concert took place that night at nearby Wrigley Field, home to the Chicago Cubs. Hassoun thought the bag contained a bomb, but it was an inert device given to him by men he didn't know were undercover FBI agents, prosecutors said.
