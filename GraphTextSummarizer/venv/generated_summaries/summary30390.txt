Lance Armstrong: Cancer won't wait Armstrong found out he had testicular cancer at age 25 when he was emerging as a rising star among cyclists. Ulman, also a cancer survivor, had no idea who Armstrong was at that time, but the cyclist contacted him after reading about the work Ulman was doing with young adults with cancer. The cancer awareness organization that Armstrong founded, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, has been flooded with supportive e-mails and calls in the last 12 hours, said Doug Ulman, its president and CEO. -- Lance Armstrong may be associated with cycling and doping allegations, but for many, his greatest strides have been against cancer. Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors."
