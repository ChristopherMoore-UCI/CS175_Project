Ali Haider Gilani -- son of former Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani -- was on his way to address a public meeting in the city of Multan when the attack happened, police senior superintendent Khurram Shakur told local TV reporters. The kidnapping of Ali Haider Gilani is the latest in a string of attacks that have plagued the run-up to Pakistan's national elections scheduled for Saturday. Two gunmen in a vehicle killed two people and injured eight others as they kidnapped Gilani in Punjab province, his brother Ali Qasim Gilani told CNN. And on Monday, an explosion killed 18 people at a rally for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman, a right-wing religious party with sympathies for the militant Taliban movement. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Jason Hanna and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.
