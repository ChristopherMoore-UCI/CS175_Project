the country singer, 29, said Thursday in an interview on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show." "We've always put his kids first," she added, referring to Cibran's two children from his marriage to Brandi Glanville. While admitting again that she and Eddie Cibran made mistakes when they got together in 2009, LeAnn Rimes says there were tons of lies written about them, too -- but that the couple kept quiet for the sake of his children. " Rimes, who left husband Dean Sheremet for Cibran, acknowledges once again that the whole situation "could've been handled a lot better. The media has been "very irresponsible calling a lot of people fat or anorexic or bulimic or whatever it may be," she said. "It seems like bullying now instead of really taking these diseases seriously that a lot of people are going through."
