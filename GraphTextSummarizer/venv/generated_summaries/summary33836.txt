The police shooting death of a man who allegedly hurled rocks at vehicles and officers in Pasco, Washington, has sparked anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force. Officers attempted "voice commands and low level force," and used a taser, police said, but those efforts were unsuccessful. After two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force. A video posted on YouTube shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. His death sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation.
