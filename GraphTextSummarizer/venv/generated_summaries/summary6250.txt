Research shows that countries with greater local government autonomy are far more effective at protecting people in natural disasters than more centralized government systems because local authorities more familiar with local needs can respond quickly and effectively. George Horwich, who studied the Kobe earthquake, says human capability and the country's cultural attributes are the most essential elements to quick recovery; while individuals' skills are very important, the relationships between people and the ability to work together are essential to community recovery and resiliency. Recovery has been extremely slow: Six months after the quake, about 98% of the debris remained, making much of capital city Port-au-Prince impassable. Disasters also motivate people who might not normally interact with one another to work together to resolve challenges. While wealth is critical in protecting life and capital, other factors are also important: Well-developed insurance markets, trade openness that speeds the flow of emergency resources, and effective management in preparing and responding to disasters are also critical.
