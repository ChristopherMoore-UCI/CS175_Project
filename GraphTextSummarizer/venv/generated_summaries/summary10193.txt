A YouTube video posted by wedding guest Colton Spencer shows the bride, still in a fluffy gown, strapped to a red rubber slingshot, her feet attached to an ATV with a stretchy cord. With Beyonce's "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" playing in the background, Natasha sailed through the air and threw her bouquet back to a crowd of eager women. He was nervous about being strapped to the slingshot for other reasons: "I turned around and saw Tasha's dad driving the ATV." But their parents worried it was too "redneck." Luckily, they decided to hold their wedding at Hobble Creek Lodge in Springville, home of "Utah's human slingshot." Guests will always remember the slingshot, Natasha says, but it wasn't the only exciting moment of the fun-filled night.
