But -- I'm sorry, I can't let go of this -- do people really, really believe that, when I shouted at that guy, I called him a 'f****t' on-camera?" As it would seem from the chilly public reaction, which Baldwin chronicles in his essay, many people definitely do. As his one-time "Orphans" co-star, Shia LaBeouf, did last winter, Baldwin has given a public statement that he's ready to retire from public life. As someone who once relished being out in his home base of New York, where people were generally "very kind" to him, Baldwin says he's now "bitter, defensive, and ... misanthropic" with a distaste for the media that he's never had before. He does so in an essay told to New York magazine, covering a lot of ground recounting the tumultuous events that led up to this decision. Now, as a result, Baldwin is saying goodbye to "public life in the way that you try to communicate with an audience playfully like we're friends, beyond the work you are actually paid for." "I want to go make a movie and be very present for that and give it everything I have, and after we're done, then the rest of the time is mine," he continues.
