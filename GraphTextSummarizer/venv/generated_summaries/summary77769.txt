The investigation must begin with Dana Air, operators of the ill fated Boeing MD-83. In May, the same aircraft had to make two unscheduled air returns following reports of engine failure, according to a Dana Air station manager in Lagos. The government has taken the step of withdrawing their operational license and ground Dana aircraft whilst an inquiry takes place. A strong focus on domestic services and competitive fares had seen Dana Air become the airline of choice for many regular fliers. Dana flights, once paragons of punctuality, started taking off late or sometimes not at all.
