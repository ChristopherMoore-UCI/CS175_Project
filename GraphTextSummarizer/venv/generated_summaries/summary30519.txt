Under the approved rules, developers will still be required to preserve some land as forest and replant other areas, thus helping cut carbon emissions. In recent years, private ranchers and growers as well as the government have invested millions to expand soybean and beef production and build massive hydroelectric dams in the region. On Monday, Brazil announced that deforestation in the Amazon had fallen to a record low for the third straight year, providing more support for the forest code. Environmentalists say that changes to the decades-old regulations on deforestation were necessary, but that the amnesties granted in this bill are excessive. The bill reduces the percentage of land that farmers and ranchers must maintain as forest when they develop it.
