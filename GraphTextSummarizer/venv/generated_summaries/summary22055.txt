-- Cubans are used to the mundane inconvenience of brief, localized power outages that regularly hit the country's aging electricity grid, but the large blackout that plunged the western part of the Caribbean island into darkness Sunday night was unusual. By early Monday, power began to return to homes in Havana and elsewhere after several hours of outage. The brief report late Sunday said that the incident was under investigation and that workers were trying to restore power. Weather reports for Havana indicated partly cloudy conditions on Sunday night with temperatures in the high 70s. The streets of Havana lost electricity around 8 p.m. Residents of the capital took the outage in stride, congregating on the stoops of buildings in search of cooler air on a warm, humid night.
