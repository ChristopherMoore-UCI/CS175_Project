The campaigns, and other entities that have requested them, receive more detailed reports with names, voter ID numbers, and voting status (those who have requested ballots and returned them, as well as those who have voted early). Canvassers only go to targeted households identified by algorithms using early voting/absentee voting data, party registration, voting history, and other micro-targeting information that create a stronger profile of a person or household's likelihood to vote for their own candidates. " Republicans disagree, saying their share of absentee voters have grown, while the Democrats' share is shrinking. Every day, the Iowa Secretary of State publicly releases data with absentee voting numbers. For us that means turning out non-traditional voters," said Christina Freundlich, communications director of the Iowa Democratic Party.
