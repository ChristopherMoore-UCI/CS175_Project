"Overall, the reaction to political events on Twitter reflects a combination of the unique profile of active Twitter users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users," the report reads. "While this provides an interesting look into how communities of interest respond to different circumstances, it does not reliably correlate with the overall reaction of adults nationwide." In the yearlong study, Pew focused on political events such as the result of the 2012 presidential election, the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney and several speeches given by Obama. Pew's research shows that Twitter users are considerably younger than the general public and more likely to lean Democratic. In the Pew's 2012 news consumption survey, just 13% of adults said they ever use Twitter or read Twitter messages. But Twitter pundits don't always lean to the left.
