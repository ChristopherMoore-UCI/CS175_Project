The chase shut down operations for about 10 minutes, forcing one arriving aircraft to delay its landing and holding departing planes on the ground, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said. Police had tried to stop the truck on a nearby street after they realized it was taken during an aggravated robbery in Fort Worth, Texas, on Wednesday, Dallas police said in a statement. Police said the suspect may be linked to other crimes. Four commercial carriers and several general aviation companies use the airport, located just north of downtown Dallas. -- A police chase through central Dallas, Texas, ended on the runways of Love Field after a man driving a stolen pickup truck crashed through the airport's gates Thursday afternoon, officials said.
