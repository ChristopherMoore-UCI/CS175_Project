Klammer is back in Kitzbuhel where this weekend the latest generation tackle the slope which has staged races since 1931. But Sachin Tendulkar never scored a century at the home of cricket Lord's while the clay courts at the French Open blunted the talent of tennis legend Pete Sampras. "The first time when I came here and I saw the downhill I said: 'I'm not doing this, these guys are crazy, they are just nuts'," Klammer told CNN's Alpine Edge. Its combination of blind turns and varying gradients make it the hardest and scariest out there. He did win here four times, a record only broken last year by Switzerland's Didier Cuche.
