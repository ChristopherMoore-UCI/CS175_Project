Fraser's tour group had been scheduled to visit one of Cairo's main museums Friday, but it was closed because of concerns about protests, she said. Arriving back in the capital, they knew things were getting serious because thousands of people were in the streets, Fraser told CNN. "I don't think anybody really feels 100 percent safe, but I think that we're much safer than the people who are in downtown Cairo right now," she said. The company moved its travelers there from downtown Cairo so they could be ready for the first available flights out of the country, she said. "I feel safer on this boat at this moment than I did this morning in Cairo," Fraser said.
