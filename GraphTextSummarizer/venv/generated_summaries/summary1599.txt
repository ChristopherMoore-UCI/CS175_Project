-- United States captain Paul Azinger has upped the stakes ahead of September's Ryder Cup with a stinging attack on his Europe team counterpart Nick Faldo. " Faldo, the record points scorer in Ryder Cup history, was renowned for his single-minded approach as a player -- which won him six major titles but few friends on the course. " Faldo and Montgomerie used to be Ryder Cup partners, but the Scot now seems likely to miss out after slipping down the world rankings. "Nick Faldo has tried to redefine himself," the American told Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper. They famously halved a Ryder Cup match six years later at The Belfry.
