The thieves hauled away more than $10 million worth of valuables and cash from 150 homes in upscale neighborhoods such as Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Beverly Hills, police said. DNA evidence led the LAPD to suspected ringleader Troy Corsby Thomas, 45, of Los Angeles. The gated community of Bel Air was one  of several enclaves targeted by the so-called "Hillside Burglars." The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas told police he had been working as an auto broker. The Hillside Burglars have not struck since Thomas' arrest, police said.
