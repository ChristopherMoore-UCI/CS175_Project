By bringing in National Guard troops, Nixon is moving both Ferguson and St. Louis County police out of the way. By calling National Guard troops into Ferguson, Missouri, authorities are taking the situation "to the opposite extreme of community policing," a former FBI assistant director says. If military police are among the Guard troops, they'll have special training in crowd control that may help, Fritz says. Police also infuriated protesters by releasing a video that they said shows Michael Brown involved in a convenience store robbery -- even though police themselves have said it does not relate to the police officer having stopped Brown as he was walking down the street. Fuentes rejects that idea, saying National Guard troops' training does not prepare them for situations like this.
