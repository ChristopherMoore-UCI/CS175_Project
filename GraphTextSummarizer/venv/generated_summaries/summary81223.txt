That's when I got word that Republican House leaders had banned me and my colleague Rep. Barb Byrum from speaking on the House floor. As a storm of protest grew against our silencing and women across the state started to rally around my use of the word vagina, Republicans changed course. Thousands of men, women and children showed up to see it and show their support for Byrum and me. But later that day, Rep. Mike Callton told the press that what I had said was so vile, so disgusting, that he could never bear to mention it in front of women or "mixed company." Thousands of women, not only in Michigan but across the country and even around the globe, saw exactly what was going on.
