Hedblom, however, kept his nerve as he went one better than last weekend, when he lost the Dutch KLM Open in a play-off with England's Simon Dyson -- the fourth time out of four he has been beaten in sudden death. Defending champion Gregory Havret of France closed with 67 to share third place on 278 with former British Open champion Paul Lawrie, who carded 69 after starting the day one shot adrift of Hedblom in second. His final round featured an eagle on the par-five ninth hole, which followed two birdies, but his title challenge faded with bogeys at 12 and 15. He carded a five-under 67 to follow up successive rounds of 68 as he denied world No. The 39-year-old started birdie-bogey-birdie, then rattled off four successive birdies before dropping a shot at the 15th hole.
