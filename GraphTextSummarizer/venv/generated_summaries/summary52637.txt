-- The head of a Syrian opposition group warns that military operations alone won't be enough to defeat terrorist groups like ISIS -- the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. " A U.S.-led coalition, including nations from the Middle East, have been pounding ISIS and other terror targets since last week. The United States has pledged to provide weapons and military training to moderate opposition forces in Syria. It has to be much, much more than military operations," Hadi al-Bahra, the president of the Syrian National Coalition, said on 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart." Still, al-Bahra said those groups are already battered from a dual-front battle against ISIS and the Syrian government forces of President Bashar al-Assad
