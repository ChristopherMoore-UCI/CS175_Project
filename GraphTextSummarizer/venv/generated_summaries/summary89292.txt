Other victories for Calderon this year included the killing of another drug kingpin, Arturo Beltran Leyva in December, and the subsequent arrest of his brother, Carlos Beltran Leyva. According to the Mexican government, more than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Calderon intensified the government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in December 2006. Mexican authorities have had significant successes against drug traffickers, President Felipe Calderon said in his fourth annual state-of-the-nation speech Thursday, noting that three major kingpins have been captured or killed in the past year. The war on organized crime he heightened after taking office also has led to the confiscation of $10 billion worth of drugs and the seizure of 34,000 motor vehicles, nearly 500 aircraft, 365 boats and 80,000 firearms, of which 50,000 were assault rifles, Calderon said. In addition, Calderon said, authorities have arrested 125 cartel cell leaders or lieutenants and captured 5,108 hit men since he took office in December 2006.
