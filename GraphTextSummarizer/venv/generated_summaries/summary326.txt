Benefits expired Benefits for the long-term unemployed expired last month after Congress opted not to continue a 2008 recession-era law providing nearly a year of payments, footed by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. However, she wouldn't rule out blocking it later if cost offsets aren't added. -- With more than a dozen lawmakers absent due to travel delays caused by bad weather, the U.S. Senate postponed until Tuesday a key procedural vote on a politically charged proposal to extend long-term unemployment insurance affecting some 1.3 million Americans. The Club for Growth urged all senators to vote "no" on the proposal and cited the lack of spending offsets. "I think it's wrong to borrow money from China or simply print up money for it." House Speaker John Boehner will insist on such offsets before agreeing to an extension, a spokesman for the Republican leader said.
