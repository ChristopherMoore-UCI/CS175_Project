It was coordinated from outside South Korea using "zombie" computers -- computers which have downloaded malicious codes -- to target designated websites, slow them down or paralyze their operation, the internet security agency said. Infected computers directed a giant traffic surge to targeted websites. Software company AhnLab said it developed the anti-virus program after receiving reports of the attack from the South Korean government Thursday. Targeted sites include South Korea's presidential office, the foreign ministry, the defense ministry and main banking websites, according to a statement issued by AhnLab. -- A cyber attack Friday morning hit 40 South Korean websites, including those of several government agencies and major banks, the country's internet security agency said.
