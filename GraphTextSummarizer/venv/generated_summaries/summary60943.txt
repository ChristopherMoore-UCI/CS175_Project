Chief Richard Myers called the Colorado Springs church security staffer "a courageous security staff member who probably saved many lives." -- A gunman attacked worshippers at a Colorado Springs, Colorado, megachurch Sunday afternoon, killing one person and wounding four others before being killed by a security staff member, the city's police chief said. Fletcher Howard said area businesses were placed on lockdown after the shooting "to make sure there's not any other suspects at large." As of Sunday afternoon there was no known connection between the two Colorado shootings, Howard said, but he did not rule out that possibility. "Obviously, two shootings at two faith-based locations is very concerning to both us and Colorado Springs," said Deputy Police Chief Gary Creager. New Life Church is on the northwestern outskirts of Colorado Springs, near the U.S. Air Force Academy.
