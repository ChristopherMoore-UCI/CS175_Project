The third seed Federer leads Fish 5-1 in career meetings, but Fish beat Federer in their last meeting in 2008 at Indian Wells, according to ATP World Tour's Web site. In Saturday's semifinal, Fish beat fellow American ninth seed Andy Roddick 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-1 after rallying from a set down and near-defeat in the second set, according to ATP World Tour. The five-time ATP World Tour No. 1 from Switzerland dropped only three points on first serve and attributed a more aggressive game, including rushes to the net, to his downtime since Wimbledon. Of the weather, Roddick said, according to ATP World Tour, "That's the thing with rain delays. On the hard courts it's nice to play forwards and not always be defensive and let the other guy dictate," ATP World Tour quoted Federer as saying.
