When I'm president, there will be no truce with organized crime either," Vazquez Mota says. "Yes, I'm here because I am a woman; but above everything else, I'm here because I have a political career focused on serving people," Vazquez Mota says. Vazquez Mota is running under the PAN, the party of current President Felipe Calderon, whose war on drugs and strategy against organized crime has divided Mexico. She says the book was not about bashing men, but about inspiring women to reach their full potential.
