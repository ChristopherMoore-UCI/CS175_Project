The transfer of fried chicken from Egypt to Gaza took three hours, not exactly fast food, but good enough for a territory where there are no Western fast-food franchises, according to the Monitor report. And Egypt cracked down on the tunnels after 16 of its soldiers were killed in a raid on them last year, the Monitor reported. He did so and sent it to Gaza through one of the hundreds of tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border used to get goods into Gaza prohibited by Israeli restrictions, things such as weapons and cars. "Bringing some meals like these would cost $200 or more three years ago, but now they don't even cost $20," tunnel operator Abu Iyad told the Monitor. For the tunnel operators, fast food may help out with hard economic times.
