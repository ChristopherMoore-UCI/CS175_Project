Prince William is a fan of English Premier League side Aston Villa but he chose two teams from lower leagues to play a full 90-minute match on the royal grounds to mark the 150th anniversary of the FA. Prince William, the heir to the British throne, is President of the English Football Association (FA), a role he says is an extension of a personal passion: "The beautiful game has changed an awful lot during the queen's reign, but it remains the most loved game in the country, most probably the world," he said. The Duke of Cambridge was speaking just before the first official football match at Buckingham Palace. But the day was really about rewarding the unsung heroes of the national game: "Grassroots football thrives on the support of its volunteers week after week," he said. He describes football as "a chance to escape with friends and family and enjoy its virtues -- teamwork, competition, endeavor and, more occasionally on my part, skill."
