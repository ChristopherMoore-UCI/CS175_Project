Godolphin will retain French jockey Mickael Barzalona and Brazil's Silvestre de Sousa for next year. The Italian will not be directly employed by Godolphin, owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, but will continue to race for the stable. "He remains a great friend -- the difference next year will be that he will not be our retained jockey and will operate as a freelance instead. Arguably Dettori is most famous for riding seven different winners in one day at British racecourse Ascot in September 1996. "We have had a tremendous association with Frankie over many years," Godolphin's racing manager Simon Crisford said in a statement.
