After it appeared in The Washington Post and The New York Times, authorities were contacted by David Kaczynski, the FBI said, who provided letters and documents written by his brother. " Najera disagreed, saying the auction is a way to provide Kaczynski's victims with "more justice" in a world where victims rarely receive support from the justice system. Items offered on the website, gsaauctions.gov, include Kaczynski's birth certificate; school records; his diplomas from Harvard University -- where he was accepted at 16 -- along with his diplomas for his master's and doctorate degrees from the University of Michigan; letters to and from him; and original handwritten and typewritten copies of Kaczynski's manifesto, which ultimately led to his capture. "My first thought was, 'Mr. Kaczynski's going to be livid,'" On Wednesday, a hooded sweatshirt very like the one pictured in the composite drawing, along with several pairs of sunglasses, were among some 60 items belonging to Kaczynski offered for online auction by the federal government, with proceeds to benefit some of Kaczynski's victims.
