"The main problem of solving flood is no longer technical but people," Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said during the weekly radio address. Affected businesses include Hi Tech Industrial Park, where Canon and Sony own assembly plants. -- Thailand's floodwaters inched toward downtown Bangkok Saturday, threatening some subway stations as leaders urged residents not to open defenses set up to divert the waters from the capital. The flooding has had an enormous business impact as many factories and offices have been under water for more than a month. Residents have threatened to open the defenses to drain water from their flooded neighborhoods, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said.
