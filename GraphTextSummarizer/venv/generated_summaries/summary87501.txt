But David Howard, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., said the legality of requiring larger, graphic warnings on cigarette packages was already the subject of a lawsuit filed by the maker of Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes. "Today, FDA takes a crucial step toward reducing the tremendous toll of illness and death caused by tobacco use by proposing to dramatically change how cigarette packages and advertising look in this country," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. The proposed requirements, characterized as the biggest change in tobacco health warnings in 25 years, include "nine new larger and more noticeable textual warning statements and color graphic images depicting the negative health consequences of smoking," the release stated. The federal government unveiled new proposed regulations Wednesday mandating "bolder health warnings" on cigarette advertisements and packages, according to a news release from the Department of Health and Human Services. An estimated 30 percent of all cancer deaths are related to tobacco use, health officials say.
