Friday's lunar impact will be visible best in areas that are still dark, particularly in the Western United States. Data from previous space missions have revealed trace amounts of water in lunar soil. These instruments will help NASA scientists analyze the plume of dust -- more than 250 metric tons' worth -- for water vapor. The observatory is in Fremont Peak State Park, which is on a list of California parks that could close because of recent budget cuts. -- Two U.S. spacecraft are set to crash on the moon Friday.
