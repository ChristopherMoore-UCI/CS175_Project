Linked with a return to former club Sheffield United last year, Evans remains without a club after being released from prison in October having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl. Evans' case has also put PFA chief Taylor under pressure after he likened the situation with Evans to that of the families of the 96 people that lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Ched Evans had been on the cusp of a move to Oldham Athletic, which plays in English football's third tier, but the club pulled out of the deal because of "unbearable pressure" on its staff. " Under current rules, Evans is permitted to return to playing football despite still serving his conviction on license. Both Oldham and Sheffield United were dissuaded from signing Evans due to pressure from sponsors as well as criticism from leading politicians and also the British public, with thousands signing petitions against his proposed moves.
