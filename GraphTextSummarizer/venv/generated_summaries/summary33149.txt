Called "The Dream of Reconciliation," the cover shows Martin Luther King Jr. marching arm-in-arm with Brown, Garner, Trayvon Martin and NYPD Officer Wenjian Liu. "It was peaceful, but they were blocking the bridge and were arrested," said Officer Damian Cistaro. Liu and fellow Officer Rafael Ramos were gunned down in their patrol car last month. Protests -- some disruptive, but none violent -- marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day across the country. Seventh-grader Kai Jones said he thinks it's important to protest because "young men my age and older are getting killed, and it's not fair," he told CNN affiliate KGO.
