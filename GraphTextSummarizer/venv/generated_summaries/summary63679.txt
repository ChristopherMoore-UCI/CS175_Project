SEPTEMBER 25: THE FERGUSON POLICE CHIEF'S APOLOGY Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson issued a video apology to Brown's parents, as well as to any peaceful protesters who felt he didn't do "enough to protect their constitutional right to protest." Specifically, he apologized that it took investigating officers four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after Wilson shot him. The most high-profile figure in President Barack Obama's administration to visit Ferguson, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for Wilson's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy-handed police response, and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd. They did so the same day they released surveillance video of Brown at Ferguson Market and Liquor store. Certain facts of the case, however, are clear: Wilson shot and killed Brown on August 9. Authorities have said Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were "walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic."
