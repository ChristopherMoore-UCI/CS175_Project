There were no immediate reports of major damage in the capital, but several areas were without power, Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard wrote on his Twitter page. -- A strong 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck southern Mexico on Saturday night, about 100 miles south-southwest of the capital, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Some startled residents in Mexico City ran out of their houses and into the streets. The quake, which hit at 7:47 p.m. local time, had an estimated depth of 40 miles, the USGS said. No injuries were reported in the quake, located in Guerrero state.
