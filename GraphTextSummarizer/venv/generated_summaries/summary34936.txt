Source: Rihanna argument did not spur Chris Brown fight The talk of their reunion was fueled last month when Rihanna gave Brown a quick kiss and a hug at the MTV Video Music Awards last month as Brown walked to the stage to accept an award. -- Chris Brown acknowledged Thursday he has renewed his "friendship" with Rihanna, the woman he was convicted of beating on the eve of the Grammys in February 2009. Rihanna's injuries included cuts and bruises inflicted by a large ring on Brown's right hand, which he used to punch her, the probation report said. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a domestic violence emergency protective order." Fans react positively to Rihanna's honesty The detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched Rihanna -- identified in the statement by her real first name, Robyn, and the first initial of her last name, Fenty -- numerous times and put her in a headlock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness.
