All three men -- Ruiz, Romero and Martinez -- drove in Romero's truck to the outskirts of Bankhead National Forest. As McWhorder explained, the two had entered into "some type of business arrangement" in Alabama, where Ruiz lived in Decatur and Martinez had family. More charges, and more answers, may be coming as authorities probe his possible connection to more killings from coast to coast. Romero said that earlier on the day of Ruiz's death, he'd been with Martinez. On June 3, Martinez was brought back to Alabama and charged with felony murder in Ruiz's death.
