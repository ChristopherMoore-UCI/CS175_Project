Asteroid 2004 BL86 came about 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth, or about three times as far away as the moon, just after 11 a.m. ET Monday, according to NASA. "While it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more," Don Yeomans, the recently retired manager of NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a NASA news release. The asteroid that flew close to Earth Monday didn't come alone. Observers on the ground didn't see much when the asteroid was closest to Earth Monday morning, because it wasn't at its brightest. NASA images released Monday reveal the asteroid, officially known as 2004 BL86, has its own small moon.
