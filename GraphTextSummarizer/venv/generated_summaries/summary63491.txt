But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ... Ari is an entertaining character, and it's fun to watch him go after things, but people really enjoy kind of when Ari's off balance. Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons. You know when he was coming up, he probably did a lot of the same things [as Ari] and ran over people in similar kinds of ways. Davies is one of the few characters on the show who has the ability to shake one of the central figures: the unshakeable agent Ari Gold.
