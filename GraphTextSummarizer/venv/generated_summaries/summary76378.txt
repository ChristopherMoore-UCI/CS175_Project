The major attraction is Radiator Springs Racers, but fans will also love Luigi's Flying Tires and Mater's Junkyard Jamboree. Soon you enter a nighttime section, where you'll find old friends from Radiator Springs and have adventures including tractor tipping with Mater. The upgrades are important considering a big complaint about California Adventure was that the attractions didn't measure up to other Disney parks. While Cars Land shifts California Adventure into the fast lane, only time will tell if it will save the town (as Lightning McQueen did for Radiator Springs) and turn Disneyland into the world-class destination it aspires to be. Though not as thrilling as Radiator Springs Racers, Luigi's Flying Tires is still unlike anything you've ever ridden, unless you happened to ride Flying Saucers at Disneyland between 1961 and 1966.
