State-run news agency Xinhua reported the movie raked in US$12.8 million in its first two weeks, becoming the current king of Chinese language cinema. It further raised eyebrows when China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, or SARFT, passed the film for domestic screening with just a handful of edits -- a rarity for a film based in politically sensitive themes of coal mining and depressed cops. They don't want the masses to watch films with little cultural value.
