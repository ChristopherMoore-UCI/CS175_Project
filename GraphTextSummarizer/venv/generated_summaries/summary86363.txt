The Nepali Congress wants outgoing prime minister and party president Girija Prasad Koirala for the position. The country's newly elected Constituent Assembly abolished a 239-year monarchy following elections in April. Nepal became a republic after the deposal of King Gyanendra Shah earlier this year. But with no one party winning a majority of the seats, it is unclear who may become president. The three main political parties continued to negotiate over whom to name president.
