-- Dale Robertson, whose horse expertise, Oklahoma roots and handsome looks helped him win cowboy roles in 1950s and '60s, has died at age 89, his wife said Thursday. Robertson was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer just last week while being treated for pneumonia at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California, Susan Robertson said. He and his wife raised horses in Oklahoma until moving to a San Diego suburb last summer, Susan Robertson said. The final 15 years of Robertson's life were spent in ill health, partly because of wounds suffered while serving in a tank crew in North Africa and Europe during World War II, his wife said. "He was in Hollywood when it was great." People we've lost in 2013: The lives they lived Robertson's acting career began after a movie scout saw a photo of him in a Hollywood photo shop's display window.
