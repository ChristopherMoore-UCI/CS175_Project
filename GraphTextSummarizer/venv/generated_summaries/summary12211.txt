" Twenty-eight-year-old Aris Nalci, one of the new generation of Armenian journalists in Turkey inspired by Hrant Dink, said he opposed a proposed resolution in the U.S. Congress to formally recognize the Armenian genocide, arguing it would only hurt U.S.-Turkish relations. On January 19, 2007, Cetin's friend and client, Armenian newspaper editor Hrant Dink, stepped out of his office on to a busy boulevard in Istanbul to go to a nearby bank. During his visit to Turkey this month, President Obama was asked whether he would follow through on a campaign pledge to recognize what happened to the Armenians nearly a century ago as genocide. It also recounts Cetin's reunion, after her grandmother died, with Armenian relatives in the United States. "The historical fact says that the Armenians killed during this period more then 500,000 Ottoman citizens, Turkish citizens." "Regardless of whether 1,000 people were killed or one person was killed, it was still a human" says Cetin.
