When it comes opportunities for entrepreneurs in Uganda, both think are great: "Many markets out there are saturated," says Kabonero, "however when you come to Uganda you'll find that many businesses that exist in other areas don't exist in Uganda, so that's an opportunity that exists. Kabonero and Ndahiro both studied business administration, but were quick to jump on the opportunity they saw in making advertising go digital in Uganda. " The team want to expand their business to the country's classrooms by providing interactive digital solutions for teachers, and they also want to take their screens outdoors: "We envision starting a digital revolution in Uganda and, who knows, perhaps in other parts of Africa as well. "With print, you have to print newspapers every day, but with digital advertising it's just a matter of changing the content that you have and distributing it online, so the expense of having to go through the printing is minimized," says Kabonero. Years later, their friendship would serve as the foundation for starting one of Uganda's first digital advertising companies -- Camouflage Media.
