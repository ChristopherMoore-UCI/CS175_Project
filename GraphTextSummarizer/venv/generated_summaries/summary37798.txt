Zinger is accused of lighting a fire in a prohibited area of the protected Torres del Paine National Park in southern Chile, regional prosecutor Juan Agustin Melendez said. We could be talking about a month or more," said Hugo Knockaert, chief of fire management for Chile's National Forest Corporation. If convicted, Zinger could face a fine and 41 to 60 days in prison, Melendez told CNN Chile. CNN's Guy Azriel, Claudia Dominguez and CNN Chile contributed to this report. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the blaze, but authorities have said they don't know when the fire will be under control.
