The government's complaints against the alleged operatives say their mission was "to become sufficiently Americanized such that they can gather information about the United States for Russia, and can successfully recruit sources who are in, or able to infiltrate, United States policy-making circles." Kalugin said that has been a mission for Soviet and Russian operatives for decades: to look for potential spies in the United States with the ultimate purpose of placing them in key government agencies like the State Department, Defense Department and the White House. The former Soviet spy told CNN he did not believe that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev knew of the pending arrests during his visit to the White House last Thursday, but his impression was that President Barack Obama did know " Kalugin said former Russian president and now prime minister Vladimir Putin -- himself a former KGB agent -- has restored the role of the intelligence agency, now called the FSB, and its arm that deals with foreign intelligence, the SVR. The Justice Department announced Monday that 10 people had been arrested in the United States on charges of being Russian spies on long-term missions in the U.S. He said Canada, with a large number of Russian and former Soviet émigrés, has been used for decades by Soviet intelligence as a "jumping ground" to pick up people for possible espionage operations in the United States.
