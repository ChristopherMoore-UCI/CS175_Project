Seattle iReporter Jim McClure and his wife recently scanned a collection of family camping trip photos from 20 years ago to create photo books for their grown children, now 24 and 28. How have smartphones, Facebook and other social media affected how you take pictures on vacation? Looking through pictures of the Canadian and Colorado Rockies, the Badlands, the Oregon and Washington coasts and the San Juan Islands sparked many memories not documented in the collection. "I wish I had pics of the (possibly human) bone fragment (I found on the beach), the cop giving me a hard time when I reported it, the massive storm that flooded St. John's and stranded me there for three hours while my wife thought I'd been kidnapped for ransom, and on and on." It might have been the vacation from hell, but it seems that any trip can be turned into a great tale with amazing pictures. "One of the best things for me was to spend about a week and a half with my aunt and get to know her from the perspective of an adult," wrote Henderson, an Ottawa, Canada resident, in an e-mail.
