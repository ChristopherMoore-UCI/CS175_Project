ICE press release on arrest At a press conference after the arrest, Angel Melendez, a Puerto Rico-based special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, part of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, alleged that Berrios was able to sexually abuse the minor after gaining the trust of the boy's mother over several years. U.S. Homeland Security agents arrested Israel Berrios Berrios, 58, at his residence in the Puerto Rican town of Naranjito. As he was led by federal agents into a detention center in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, Berrios told a reporter from WAPA, a CNN affiliate, that his conscience is clear. Monsignor Ruben Gonzalez, bishop of the Caguas Diocese, suspended Berrios last year when the allegations first surfaced, but the priest has yet to be expelled. According to the federal indictment obtained by CNN, Berrios used a car connected to the local San Jose parish to transport the alleged victim knowing the young man "would engage in a commercial sex act."
