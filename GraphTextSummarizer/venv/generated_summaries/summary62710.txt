" The global organization which represents professional footballers FIFPro has called for the immediate release of Sarsak, who has been imprisoned since being arrested at a checkpoint while attempting to enter the West Bank in June 2009.. "FIFPro, the voice of all professional footballers in the world, demands that Mahmoud Sarsak be released from prison," said the release on FIFPro's website. "The reports FIFA received state that in apparent violation of their integrity and human rights and without the apparent right of a due process (trial), several Palestine football players have allegedly been illegally detained by Israeli authorities," read a statement on the organization's website. FIFA president Sepp Blatter "expressed grave concern" regarding the incarceration of members of the Palestine team in Israel, including Mahmoud Sarsak who is on hunger strike. " FIFPro's vice-president Philippe Piat described Sarsak's situation as an "injustice." "The freedom of movement is a fundamental right of every citizen," said Piat. "FIFPro is deeply concerned about Sarsak's health and about his imprisonment and therefore asks for his release from jail.
