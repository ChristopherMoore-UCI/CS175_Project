"Technology is helping people get involved in the conversation around democracy and elections, which is very important, as the general interest in the air has waned since the voting date was changed." As incumbent Goodluck Jonathan prepares to face-off against former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, Longe and his team have developed TechSQUAD -- a gang of geeks who work on web-projects that help citizens vote. "The strength of a leader's personality and his key personal networks are playing a very strong role," says Jasper Veen, Nigeria Director at National Democratic Institute. A representative volunteer network of 4,000 observers trained by Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) will corroborate official election results using a system of text messages. And once a government is elected, the site will track whether election pledges become reality. In Africa's largest mobile phone market, programs to encourage citizens to get involved in the election have been gaining traction.
