So that's my iPad," Obama said, referring to personal aide Reggie Love. According to the pool reporter, Jonathan Weisman, the president told Abhisit that he recently bought an iPad for first lady Michelle Obama. -- Apparently President Barack Obama doesn't need an iPad; he's got an aide for that: iReggie. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' retreat in Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday, a print pool reporter was within earshot of a brief exchange between the president and an iPad owner, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. Obama may not have a personal iPad, but he's not too disconnected from Apple's latest technological craze.
