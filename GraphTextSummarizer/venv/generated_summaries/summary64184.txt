" Police actions bring in more protesters Indeed, when police have deployed more aggressive tactics, they have had far from the desired effect. Tear gas The use of 87 rounds of tear used by police on September 28 marked the first time it has been used in Hong Kong since 2005, when South Korean farmers took to the streets to demonstrate against a World Trade Organization summit. There is a "breach of trust" between the public and the police, the HKCLU's Choy says, citing the example of one standoff outside the government headquarters earlier this month, when protesters accused police of smuggling in non-lethal armaments. So most protesters think that police always lie. The authorities have failed in their duty to protect peaceful protesters who came under attack," said Mabel Au, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.
