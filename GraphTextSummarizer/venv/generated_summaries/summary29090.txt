At issue: how states may define mental retardation -- within the context of inexact IQ tests -- when determining whether convicted murderers deserve capital punishment. "If a state conditions the opportunity to demonstrate mental retardation on obtained IQ test scores, it cannot ignore the measurement error that is inherent in those scores that is a statistical feature of the test instrument itself," Waxman told the bench. An average of various tests put his IQ slightly above 70, but within what is called a SEM -- standard error of measurement. "Can they assign that to the defendant, and if they can what is the standard of proof that the defendant has to meet?" Florida Solicitor General Allen Winsor said the defendant had five so-called Wechsler IQ tests conducted post-conviction and scored above 70 on all of them -- 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80. Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote in the appeal may prove decisive, asked, "Is there any evidence that society in general gives substantial deference to the psychiatric profession in this respect?" Justice Samuel Alito pressed for an acceptable standard that was different from Florida's benchmark.
