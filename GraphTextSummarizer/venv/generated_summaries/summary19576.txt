The DUI manslaughter trial of former New York Yankees player Jim Leyritz is set to begin Monday in Broward County Circuit Court in Florida. Under Florida law, if Leyritz caused or contributed to the accident, he can be found guilty of DUI manslaughter, even if jurors believe Veitch shares the blame. Attorneys in the case expect witnesses to disagree about whether Leyritz had a yellow or red light as he entered the intersection of S.W. 7th Avenue and S.W. 2nd Street. Leyritz is charged with driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that killed 30-year-old Fredia Veitch on December 28, 2007. The front of Leyritz's Ford Expedition hit the driver's side of Veitch's Mitsubishi Montero, causing the car  to spin and roll.
