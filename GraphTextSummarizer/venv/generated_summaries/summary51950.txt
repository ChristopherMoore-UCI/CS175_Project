Last week, after scoring both goals in his side's 2-1 victory over England, Suarez hit out at the British media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions. "Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years," he told reporters following the game. Former Italian international Mauro Tassotti was given an eight-match ban in 1994, the longest suspension in World Cup history, after breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique. FIFA added that Suarez and/or his national association are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant, with a 5pm (Brasilia time) deadline. The defeat led to Italian coach Cesare Prandelli offering his resignation in his news conference after the game -- but all eyes were still on Suarez. "The only thing I know is that those are occurrences that happen on the pitch," Suarez told reporters.
