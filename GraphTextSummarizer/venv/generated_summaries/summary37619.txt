-- President Obama used the State of the Union address to outline an agenda for the coming year and, more importantly, to define what his goals would be should he be re-elected in November. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded." Rather than running away from Washington, President Obama embraced the historical value of government. Notwithstanding these limits, the speech is a good start in terms of outlining the issues that President Obama needs to emphasize if he is to excite Democrats and attract independents. Rather than entering in a defensive posture, focusing just on crisis and conflict, President Obama has instead chosen to define the terms of the debate and to offer a positive vision for the future. A speech about economy and promises of policy are not the same as improved economic conditions.
