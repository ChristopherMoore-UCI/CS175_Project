The author of the 1998 paper, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, and his co-authors reaffirmed their findings after complaints about Wakefield's research surfaced in 2004. Tuesday's article is the third and last of a series published by BMJ, which has called Wakefield's study an "elaborate fraud" and accused him of planning to launch a business venture "off the back of the vaccine scare." Following a three-year investigation, Britain's General Medical Council ruled in January 2010 that the way Wakefield conducted his research was dishonest and irresponsible. "From this point forward, Wakefield encouraged the media and a grassroots network of anti-vaccine advocates to believe that this vaccine may cause autism," the Lancet said. Wakefield has accused the author of the BMJ report, freelance journalist Brian Deer, of being paid by the pharmaceutical industry. It noted that 10 of Wakefield's co-authors had their names removed from the paper after learning in 2004 that Wakefield had been paid by lawyers to help build a case against vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose -- and pointed out that Wakefield's most damning assertion was made at a separate news conference after the study was published, not in the paper that the journal published.
