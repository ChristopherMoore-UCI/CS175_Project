Catherine Greig, who prosecutors said was Bulger's "partner" in avoiding capture, must also pay a $150,000 fine, U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled. The girlfriend of James "Whitey" Bulger was sentenced to eight years in federal prison Tuesday for identity fraud and helping the reputed mob boss avoid capture for 16 years. Bulger and Greig were captured at their Santa Monica, California, apartment a year ago. Stephen Rakes, who says his South Boston liquor store was taken over by Bulger, was one of the victims who spoke in court before the sentencing. The couple had, for several years, hidden in plain sight in the palm-tree-lined, oceanside city near Los Angeles in a three-story building named Princess Eugenia.
