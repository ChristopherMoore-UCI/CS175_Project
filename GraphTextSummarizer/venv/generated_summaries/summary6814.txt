As someone juggling two jobs, as an exec for a TV network and as a writer (substitute your jobs here -- career woman and mother, rodeo clown and underwear model, etc.), I often have a hard time slowing down for a stoplight without checking my e-mail. I constantly reinforced my poverty with my friends as if being broke was a badge of honor, like military service or watching Ken Burns documentaries. It was a world fraught with an obsessive compulsive clean freak mother, limbed and limbless bullies, and a series of unfortunate life events that would challenge even the most formidable witch. I had a mock-cover of my first book up on mine before I even got an agent. In the aftermath of this group of us being scammed, for example, there was a lot of screaming (mine) and tears (also mine).
