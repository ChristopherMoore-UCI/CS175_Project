The Brooklyn-based designer has made a meticulous study of airport runways and logged the results on a Tumblr called Holding Pattern. Lines radiating like spokes around unpaved patches are common in many of O'Neil's images and act as warnings to pilots to stay off the airport's lawn. Turns out, MAD is considered a textbook example of good runway design, known for maximizing the flow of air traffic in a compressed amount of space. During a moment of wanderlust she opened Google Earth and started contemplating runway layouts from a birds-eye perspective. No pilots actually say this, but it's good to know that if you see white lines and markings it means you're en route to take off.
