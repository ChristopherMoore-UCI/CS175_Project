Another man, a 22-year-old taxi-driver, told HRW last year about his detention by Egyptian police: "They had whips and hit me on the legs, on the bottom of my feet, and on my back. One case highlighted by HRW is that of Khaled Said, a young businessman in Alexandria whose death prompted street protests last year against police brutality and has been a rallying cry in the current protests. The words are those of one Egyptian speaking to Human Rights Watch - and alleging torture by Egypt's security services against his fellow detainees. " The report, which was published Monday but compiled before the current unrest, concludes that the Egyptian security forces carry out torture and ill-treatment of detainees with impunity and the "government is failing miserably to provide victims of torture and ill-treatment effective remedy." The Egyptian government told a U.N. panel in November 2009 that "the Office of the Public Prosecutor investigates every complaint it receives about torture or cruel treatment." CNN was unable to get a response from the Egyptian government on the report.
