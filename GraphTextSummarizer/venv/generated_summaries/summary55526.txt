Rui's reported detention is but the latest twist in an intensifying campaign launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping against official corruption, a lightning rod for mass discontent. "Considering Rui hasn't really hurt anyone, it's impressive to see how many people he has disgusted or offended," tweeted Michael Anti, a leading Chinese commentator. On Sina Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- Rui commands more than 10 million followers, making him the most popular CCTV personality in social media. State media have said his detention is closely linked to Guo's case, as well as an investigation into his own possible profiting from using CCTV resources. The more prevailing sentiment in Chinese cyberspace, however, appears to be one of schadenfreude with many "netizens" cheering Rui's downfall.
