"Previous  attempts  to enter Gaza by sea have been stopped by Israeli  naval  vessels and resulted in the injury, death, arrest, and deportation of   U.S. citizens," the State Department statement said. Last May, the Mavi Marmara -- owned by the Turkish  Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH -- and five other ships were on  their way to Gaza, carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists  from various countries, when Israeli soldiers swarmed aboard it. Despite  international condemnation, an independent Israeli commission, led by  retired judge Yaakov Turkel, later found that Israeli commandos "acted  professionally and in a measured manner in the face of unanticipated  violence" when they seized the Gaza-bound aid ship. The  protesters say  they want to "challenge U.S. foreign policy" by providing aid and   supplies directly to the citizens of Gaza, in  spite of Israel's   blockade. " Ali Abunimah, a blogger for  the Electronic Intifada and supporter of the protest, accused  Clinton  of seeming  to "lay the ground -- indeed almost provide a green light --  for an Israeli  military attack on the upcoming Gaza Freedom   Flotilla.
