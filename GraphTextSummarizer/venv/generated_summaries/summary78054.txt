Devin Rachelle Miller allegedly ran the business out of her home for at least four months, according to a sheriff's office press release, soliciting men with ads on backpage.com that showed pictures of what appeared to be underage girls and included phrases like "Hey Fellas Ready To Have the Night You've Always Dreamed Of?" and "Twice the Fun, Twice the Exitment"(sic). Investigators interviewed that teen, and according to the arrest affidavit, she claimed men responding to the ads would pay to have sex acts performed by Miller or other females, but Miller and her male associates often robbed them at gunpoint when they arrived. -- "We aim 2 Tease, Please & Satisfy," the online classified ads said, according to police, but instead a Florida prostitution business allegedly lured men with the promise of sex with underage girls and robbed them instead. She is facing five counts of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, five counts of deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution, and one count each of unlawful use of a two-way communications device, child neglect and petit theft. According to an arrest affidavit, investigators determined that one of the girls was 16 and had been reported missing on March 5 and recovered on March 24.
