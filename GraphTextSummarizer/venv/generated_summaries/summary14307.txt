"If I can train people from existing networks to dispense glasses, and they can spare one day each week or month to dispense the glasses, then they can see 50 to 100 people in a day -- and that's a way to reach a lot of people," White told CNN. That makes it incredibly difficult for ordinary people to visit an optometrist, without which it's impossible for them to get glasses. But for the program to be sustainable, White says the next step is to train his dispensers to become trainers themselves, so that he builds a growing network of people in developing countries who can distribute the glasses. Silver estimates that one billion people in the developing world don't have access to the glasses they need, and he has said that he would like to see all of them wearing glasses by 2020. But a pair of glasses developed by Joshua Silver, a physics professor at the University of Oxford, offers an affordable solution.
