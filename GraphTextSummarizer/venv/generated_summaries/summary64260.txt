The FBI said Friday that white powder found at New Jersey hotels near the site of the Super Bowl and at the Manhattan office of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani proved to be non-hazardous. The FBI In New York tweeted Friday afternoon: "Substances in suspicious letters in New York and New Jersey deemed non hazardous. More air marshals and behavioral detection officers, radiological detection teams and random baggage checks at transit hubs are among the security measures the federal Homeland Security Department deployed to help local police in New Jersey and New York secure the Super Bowl. Hazardous materials teams and bomb squads responded after white powder was found at several hotels near New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, authorities said. New York law enforcement authorities were in touch with Canadian authorities to pursue the source of the letter, police said.
