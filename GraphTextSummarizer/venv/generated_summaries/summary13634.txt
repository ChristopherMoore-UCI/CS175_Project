The Arabic Network humans rights organization said the threat of flogging was retaliation for Hussein writing critically about the Sudanese regime. The indecent clothing charge has only one punishment under Sudanese law -- 40 lashes in public, according to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information. " Lubna Al Hussein -- who writes for a newspaper and, until recently, worked for the media department of the U.N. mission in Sudan -- was arrested, along with 18 other women on July 3. However, Hussein resigned from her position with the United Nations to avoid the immunity she would have received, Adib said. Police accused Hussein of wearing trousers that were too tight and a blouse that was too sheer, she said.
