Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted in the U.S. for the torture and killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, has been ordered released from a Mexican prison because of procedural errors in his case. It was unclear if U.S. efforts to extradite Caro Quintero would be considered legal impediments to his release. In the eyes of the U.S. justice system, Caro Quintero remains an international fugitive, and his release would sting U.S. authorities. Caro Quintero, who was arrested when he was 33, has spent the last 28 years in prison. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration issued a statement Friday saying it was "deeply troubled" by the apparently impending release of Caro Quintero, who the DEA called the "mastermind and organizer" of its agent's death.
