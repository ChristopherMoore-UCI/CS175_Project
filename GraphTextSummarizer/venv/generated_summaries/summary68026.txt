Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980, at the entrance to his New York apartment building, the Dakota. Thirty-four years after his friend and songwriting partner John Lennon was shot and killed, Paul McCartney still remembers the jolt of his death. " McCartney takes some comfort in the knowledge that he and Lennon, who had sniped at each other following the Beatles' split in 1970, had gotten to be friends again before Lennon's death. He was 40 years old and had just released "Double Fantasy," an album with wife Yoko Ono, after five years away from the spotlight. He had known Lennon since 1957, when both were teenagers, and thought of them like brothers -- a comparison Lennon agreed with.
