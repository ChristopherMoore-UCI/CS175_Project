Report: No problem with Secret Service response to Colombia scandal "Mark Sullivan epitomizes the term 'public service,' and has devoted his life to the safety of our first families, our nation's leaders, and the public at large," she said in a statement. -- U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan will step down this month, concluding a long career that was clouded last year by a scandal at the agency involving agents and prostitutes ahead of a presidential summit in Colombia. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano praised Sullivan career. Spokesman Brian Leary said on Friday that Sullivan would retire on February 22 after leading the agency that protects presidents and fights financial crime since 2006. Sullivan told Congress in May that such behavior was not routine when agents traveled on official business.
