The WEF's own Global Risks 2013 report -- compiled from an annual survey of more than 1,000 experts and industry leaders -- offers a pessimistic outlook, saying the global community's ability to address significant challenges, such as global warming, is undermined by the continuing economic weakness plaguing major economies.
