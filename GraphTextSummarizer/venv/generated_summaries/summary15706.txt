But as same-sex marriage is becoming legalized in places like New York and beyond, many of us suddenly have to face the reality and the question that many of our straight friends have always faced: "When are you going to settle down and get married?" More and more these days, I hear gay couples lamenting over it in restaurants, at work and at dinner parties. and I got the news in an e-mail that my colleague Joy Behar had tied the knot with her long-time boyfriend, Steve Janowitz. Maybe it had something to do with her new grandson and her public support of gay marriage. Here's the exchange: So there we were, chatting with newly out CNN anchor Don Lemon at Monday's Trevor Live event, and just like annoying Aunt Sadie, we asked if he and his partner of four years are planning on tying the knot. Though it wasn't celebrated by larger society, it used to be that gay men once enjoyed that same freedom to play the field.
