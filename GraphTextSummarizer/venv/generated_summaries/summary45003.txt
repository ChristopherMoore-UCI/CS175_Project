Who is Officer Slager? "People are upset, people are pointing out how wrong the officer was for gunning down Mr. Scott," South Carolina State Rep. Justin Bamberg said as he stood alongside Anthony Scott on Wednesday. When asked how he felt about the fact that Slager has been charged with murder, Santana said that "no one can feel happy." "He has his family and Mr. Scott also has his family. "Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. A video shows Officer Michael Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at 50-year-old Walter Scott as Scott has his back to him and is running away. "We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that," Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said.
