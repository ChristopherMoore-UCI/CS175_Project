"We were stranded and had to be rescued ourselves," said Charleston County spokeswoman Tracey Amick. Hurricane Isaac contributed to a moist air mass that brought torrential rainfall and street flooding Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina, officials said. Senior forecaster Steven Taylor said most of the rain Tuesday afternoon fell during low tide. Winds were pushing slightly above normal tides in downtown Charleston. The College of Charleston reported 5 inches of rainfall by 7 p.m. Tuesday.
