She has landed in the same quarter as French Open winner Maria Sharapova and French Open semifinalists Eugenie Bouchard and Andrea Petkovic. Nadal, coming off a record-extending ninth French Open title and 14th major overall, begins with dangerous Slovak left-hander Martin Klizan and then could face the man who beat him in 2012 in the second round, Lukas Rosol. Federer -- ousted prior to the quarterfinals in three of his last four majors -- starts against Italian Paolo Lorenzi before potentially meeting Julien Benneteau. Benneteau stretched Federer to five sets at Wimbledon in 2012. It was 10 years ago that a 17-year-old Sharapova stunned the tennis world by opening her grand slam account at Wimbledon.
