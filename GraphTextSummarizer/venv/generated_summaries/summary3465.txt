-- The University of Kansas men's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night, setting up a NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky. On Saturday night, Ohio State jumped ahead early, carrying a 34-25 advantage into the half. Ohio State and Kansas entered the night's second tilt as No. 2 seeds, having both defeated the top seeds in their brackets -- Syracuse and North Carolina, respectively -- during the Elite 8. The Cardinals, for one, had a head coach with a national title to his credits -- Rick Pitino, who ironically won that distinction in 1996 as head coach at Kentucky. Kansas edged ahead with just over a minute to go and held on, thanks to some pivotal free throws and an Ohio State lane violation call, for a 64-62 victory.
