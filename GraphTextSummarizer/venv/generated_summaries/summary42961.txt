Separate caucuses are held across Iowa as neighbors debate the pros and cons of candidates with each other before they vote among themselves, and that result then gets totted up with the other caucuses statewide to decide the winner. But Iowa caucuses are different and the rules vary in the roughly 1,800 state precincts that hold them. Candidates have spoken at rallies, debated each other on TV and opinion polls are released at least weekly. The media started paying attention and candidates learned that a strong showing could generate headlines nationwide. This year, the Republican race is so unsettled, with so many candidates trading the top spots in public opinion polls, that Iowa could be unusually close and confusing.
