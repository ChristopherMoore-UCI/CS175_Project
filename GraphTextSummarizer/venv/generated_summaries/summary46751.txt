State-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that prominent gay rights activist Nikolai Alexeyev and several others were among those detained during an authorized picket near Moscow's city hall. Incumbent Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and his predecessor, Yury Luzhkov, have both spoken against public gay-rights rallies, with Luzhkov calling them "Satanic," according to RIA Novosti. Activists have held similar gay pride demonstrations in previous years, but usually disperse before police arrive, according to the news agency. One activist was detained, but RIA Novosti said there were no serious injuries or damages from the incident. -- Police detained about 40 gay-rights activists in Moscow on Sunday, alleging they attempted to hold an unauthorized demonstration during Moscow gay pride events, the police press service said.
