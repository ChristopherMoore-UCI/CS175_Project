" McIlroy won by eight shots at Congressional, setting the lowest score in U.S. Open history as he smashed the previous best total set by Nicklaus, Woods, Lee Janzen and Jim Furyk. But it was Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 major titles and joined by Tiger Woods on Sunday in second place on the PGA Tour roll of honor with 73 victories, pointed him in the right direction. Now, having missed three cuts in a row ahead of his U.S. Open title defense next week, the world No. 2 has again acted on the wisdom of one of golf's greatest champions. They do remember who won last year's U.S. Open. "I know that there were times when I wasn't prepared and I got exactly what I deserved -- nothing." Woods revealed after his victory on Sunday that he had visited Olympic before the Memorial, and that it had been perfect preparation.
