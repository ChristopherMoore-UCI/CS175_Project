Anti-Filner protesters speak Filner, 70, was elected mayor in 2012 after 20 years in Congress. -- Embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner and his representatives were in a closed door mediation with representatives from the city on Monday, while volunteers hoping to oust the mayor continued to collect signatures for a possible recall. "Mayor Filner is taking personal time this week and is unavailable for comment, and we do not have information as to when he will be available for comment," said last week's statement from Payne's office, adding that it was not able to comment on the recall effort or other allegations leveled against the mayor. Another affilaite, KFMB, reported local radio hosts hired skywriters to spell out "Surrender Bob" over areas of the city last week. "Every day that I went to work, I had butterflies in my stomach because I did not know what was going to happen the next time the mayor came by my desk," she told reporters last week.
