Chuck Norris counted to infinity. Chuck Norris is celebrating his 75th birthday -- but the calendar is only allowed to turn 39. Death once had a near-Chuck Norris experience. There was a street named after Chuck Norris, but they had to change the name because nobody crosses Chuck Norris and lives. Because maybe YOU can't beat time, but Chuck Norris can beat anything.
