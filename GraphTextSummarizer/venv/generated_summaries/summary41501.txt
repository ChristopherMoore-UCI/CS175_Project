" Speaking Thursday at the annual TEDMED conference in Washington, Brilliant made the case that several key actions will stop pandemics: early detection, early response and better cooperation among governments. Innovations in early detection, early response and global cooperation can put an end to pandemics. Dr. Larry Brilliant is confident that doesn't have to happen. "We can find cases earlier with digital detection -- Web self-reporting, SMS, Twitter, social networking, blogging, Internet searches, online news and health reporting," said Brilliant, who was previously executive director of Google.org. Through the recent launch of CORDS, a new entity bringing together regional disease surveillance networks, 28 different countries officially cooperate, sharing information to curb epidemics before they become pandemics.
