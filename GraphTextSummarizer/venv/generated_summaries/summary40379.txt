We're in the business of deciphering what women want, and when you know what women want, you can actually change all of shopping. -- It's a woman's most intimate piece of apparel and many women will admit that shopping for one can be a nightmare. The fit quiz is our way to size women into the perfect bra for them, without any measuring tape, any photos, or any fitting rooms. We translate the data into a 'true spectrum' -- a way for women to understand the results of their quiz. As soon as she reaches what we call her 'personal shop', all she sees are the sizes and styles of bras that are the best match for her.
