The development of the South Korean rocket program, using Russian technology for the first-stage launcher, began in 2002. Despite that, North Korea is likely to "insist that a South Korean rocket launch should also be resisted by the international community," Lee said. South Korean authorities say their latest launch efforts are a crucial step for the development of the country's civilian space program. But the United States and other countries called it a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency has not published any reports so far mentioning the planned South Korean launch.
