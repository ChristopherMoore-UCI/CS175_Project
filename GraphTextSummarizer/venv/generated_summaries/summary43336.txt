Khalil Younes, the painter, illustrator and video artist behind the portrait of Qashoush, believes the relative absence of journalists in Syria makes it incumbent on artists to capture the unfolding events. The leader of group -- drawn from theater, art, film-making and journalism backgrounds -- said he settled on finger puppets for their depiction of Assad and his regime because they were easy to smuggle through checkpoints, and because doing so removed the "godlike aura" around Assad. Syria explained: What you need to know Documentary through art For other artists, their work has also played an important role in documenting a conflict that has largely been shielded from the world's media by the regime. Writing a call to arms on his website -- "We have to break the barrier of fear that is 50 years old" -- he began drawing senior regime figures, before breaking the final taboo by depicting Assad himself. With works spanning from painting to song to cartoons, puppet theater to graffiti to plays, the exhibition traces the way that Syrian artists have used a range of creative techniques within traditional and new media to create political, populist art that that both brooks "the red line" of dissent and engages the public in unprecedented ways.
