"We've really seen a revolution in our understanding of earthquakes in the last 10 years because of these earthquakes," he said, adding that new technology and the speed with which information was shared had changed the landscape in understanding earthquakes. Secondly, that big earthquakes of this type could run as deep as the Earth's mantle, the viscous layer beneath the Earth's crust. He said the past 10 years had been particularly seismically active, providing invaluable information to seismologists. The undersea earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday was the largest earthquake of its type ever recorded and has increased the risk of more powerful quakes in the region, a leading expert has said. He said that Wednesday's earthquake was likely to have increased the stress on the plate boundaries near Aceh, increasing the risks of another major earthquake in the same area as the 2004 disaster.
