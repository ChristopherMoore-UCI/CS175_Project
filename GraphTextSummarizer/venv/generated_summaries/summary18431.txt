More women than men say they believe measles might infect someone in their community (43% vs. 33%) and Democrats see it as more likely than Republicans (45% vs. 36%). Nearly 6 in 10 Americans believe that children should be barred from public school and day care activities if they are not vaccinated (58% say a child should not be allowed to participate in public school; 61% daycare). Health officials say the rise in measles and other vaccine preventable diseases is being fueled by people who opt not to vaccinate. A new CNN/ORC poll shows nearly 8 of 10 Americans believe parents should be required to vaccinate their healthy children against preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and polio. If the children are not vaccinated, most agree the child should not be allowed to attend public school or day care.
