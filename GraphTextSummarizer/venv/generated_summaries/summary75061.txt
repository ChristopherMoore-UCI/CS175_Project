Another free kick caused chaos in the Costa Rica box and the ball dropped to Van Persie, who fired in a shot that Navas again did well to block. As the clock struck 90 minutes the Dutch had their best chance of all as Daley Blind's low cross evaded everyone until it landed at the feet of captain Van Persie at the back post. Moments later Navas was at it again, saving low from Depay who had been set up by Van Persie. In Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador, the Oranje was faced with another Latin American opponent -- a Costa Rica team which was only the fourth side from the CONCACAF region to reach a World Cup quarterfinal. Likewise, there was little that was obviously special about the Dutch against Costa Rica -- but Van Gaal's players have recorded some impressive results at this World Cup so far.
