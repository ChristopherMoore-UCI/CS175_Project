Mars, the greatest show on Earth Mars One plans to fund the mission partly from the sale of technology developed during the mission, Lansdorp said. "Not unlike the televised events of the Olympic Games, Mars One intends to maintain an ongoing, global media event, from astronaut selection to training, from liftoff to landing," it says. A Dutch company called Mars One began looking Monday for volunteer astronauts to fly to Mars. If they get there, Mars astronauts will face a lonely life of danger, subsisting for extended periods on dried and canned food. Lansdorp said that after consulting with media experts and ad agencies, he's confident life on Mars will remain a hit for decades on Earth and will be able to weather any financial crisis or war on Earth.
