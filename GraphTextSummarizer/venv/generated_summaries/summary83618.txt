Alessandro Nesta put Milan ahead in the 29th minute with Ronaldinho adding a 72nd minute second as Juve struggled to produce a display that would ease the calls for Ferrara's head. Genoa went ahead through Giandomenico Mesto in the 36th minute with Giuseppe Sculli sealing their win in the 71st minute before Catania coach Sinisa Mihajlovic was also sent to the stands. The home side struggled to get into the game until Giuseppe Bellusci was sent off for the visitors in the 28th minute.
