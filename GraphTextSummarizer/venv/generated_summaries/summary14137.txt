NATO admits killing civilians in Afghan strike Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and third in line to the British throne, "was in no way in any danger" during the latest attack, ISAF spokesman Maj. Martin Crighton said earlier. Officials discovered the hole after the attack, the source said, adding that the attackers -- daringly disguised in U.S. Army uniforms -- also tried to blow up parked NATO aircraft with hand-held improvised explosive devices. It is too soon to say whether the attackers had "inside knowledge," ISAF spokesman James Graybeal said. It's extremely rare for Afghan insurgents to use U.S. uniforms in their attacks. There has been at least one other case of Afghan insurgents wearing U.S. uniforms, in May 2010.
