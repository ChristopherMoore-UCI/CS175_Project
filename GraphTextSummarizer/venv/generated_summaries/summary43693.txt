While even his critics would admit Obama wrought significant political change, he has often fallen short of his rarefied goals, running up against a system of governance set up by America's founders to resist sharp change of political direction. With the certainty of a yet untested politician, he cited the example of Lincoln's "House Divided" speech and subsequent presidency to argue political change was possible. On that Saturday morning in 2007, from behind a podium bearing his new campaign logo, a rising sun symbolizing new hope, Obama -- with not a gray hair in his head -- rattled off a list of how he would change the nation. From Tuesday, Obama's time left in the White House will be shorter than the time it took him to win the presidency, and his 2007 speech has become a cautionary tale of the gulf between powerful campaign rhetoric and reality. The situation isn't much better on the global front, where Obama continues to grapple with all-too-familiar foreign policy challenges in Iraq and Afghanistan along with new threats from Russia.
