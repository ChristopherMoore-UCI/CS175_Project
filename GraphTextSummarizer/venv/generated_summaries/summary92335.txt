It was only a few days ago that his top political adviser, Doug Stafford, reacted to the Romney news by telling reporters: "As Senator Paul has said previously, the more the merrier." Sen. Rand Paul resumes the campaign trail Wednesday, returning to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire for a full day of events. In New Hampshire Wednesday, Paul started by meeting with local elected officials for breakfast in Manchester at Murphy's Diner, a local hot spot known for its Captain Crunch French Toast. His father, former Rep. Ron Paul, had a solid block of support in Nevada as a presidential candidate in 2012. Paul is bypassing the congressional GOP retreat in Pennsylvania on Thursday to fly out West and meet with business leaders and activists in Phoenix behind closed doors.
