Top military commander Ali Mohsen, who led the 2011 uprising against former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, evacuated the 1st Division Brigade after hundreds of Houthi fighters raided the compound in northern Sanaa, backed by heavy artillery. Over the past 24 hours, at least 35 people have been killed, the majority of whom were government troops or Sanaa civilians. The headquarters, located in the northern region of Sanaa, has been one of numerous sites targeted by the fighters, who, as of Sunday, control the majority of districts in north Sanaa. "It also calls for the formation of a technocratic national government, which will work to enhance government transparency, implement economic reforms, in addition to continuing military and security reforms." The government cut off all phone and Internet lines nationwide for 12 hours Friday morning, complicating communication between Houthi fighters.
