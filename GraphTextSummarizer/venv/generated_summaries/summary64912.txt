Technology and intelligence helped lead authorities to Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman over the weekend, President Enrique Peña Nieto said at an event marking Flag Day in Mexico. When the 47-year-old won Mexico's 2012 presidential vote, critics expressed concerns that cracking down on organized crime wouldn't be a priority for his administration and suggested negotiating with drug cartels might be on the table once he took office. " Peña Nieto praised collaborations between the military and different parts of Mexico's federal government. But Guzman's arrest Saturday was a sign that taking down drug lords is still on Mexico's a agenda. Since taking office in December 2012, Peña Nieto has talked about fighting cartels significantly less than his predecessor, Felipe Calderon.
