An initial decision not to pursue charges against Zimmerman led to the dismissal of the town's police chief and the appointment of a special prosecutor, who accused the neighborhood watch volunteer of unjustly profiling and killing Martin. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family, has gone further, accusing Zimmerman of murdering Martin "in cold blood." Experts: Can't tell who is screaming in 911 calls "In the fight of his life" That's the question at the heart of the trial of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman is Hispanic; Martin was African-American. His family has said Zimmerman profiled the teen and crossed the line from neighborhood watch volunteer to vigilante.
