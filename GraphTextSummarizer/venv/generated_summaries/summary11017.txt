The government hopes the measure, which will send most Americans tax rebate checks by May, will either prevent a recession or make one relatively brief. "My guess is that of the $110 billion to $120 billion of tax rebates, about half will go to U.S. products and services," said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's. "In the past seven years, the system has absorbed shocks: recession, corporate scandals, terror attacks, global war; yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger," he said. And so we're going to move quickly and make a difference," he said Bush praised the quick work of the House and Senate and urged Americans not to "overreact" to the current economic troubles. The rebates will put about $120 billion in the hands of individuals in the hope that they will spend it and boost a faltering U.S. economy.
