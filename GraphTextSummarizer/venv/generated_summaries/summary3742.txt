-- A day after North Korea test-fired two missiles, South Korea captured a fishing boat from the North that had crossed into South Korean waters, officials say. "The puppet military gangsters perpetrated such provocations as firing bullets and shells from the areas around the five islands including Paekryong and Big Yonphyong islands and scattering leaflets hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK on March 24," the North Korean news agency KCNA reported. South Korea says it believes the missile tests are a reaction to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills.
