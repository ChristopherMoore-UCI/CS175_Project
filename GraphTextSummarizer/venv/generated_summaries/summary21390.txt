-- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning. They established a scent trail by late afternoon, said spokesman Randy Hampton of Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site. "We manage wild bears for a healthy and thriving population," said Dan Prenzlow, regional manager for wildlife with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.
