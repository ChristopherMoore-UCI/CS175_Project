Police officers guard a house in Manchester, England, following raids and arrests of terror suspects. Police said that at the time of the arrests, their investigation compelled them to take action, even without the blunder made by Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick. -- Nine of the 11 Pakistani nationals being held in an alleged terror plot in northern England were released Tuesday, according to police. Britain's Greater Manchester Police said the men were released into the custody of the U.K.'s border agency, which will determine whether they can legally remain in England. Police and the border agency said they want the men deported, even though investigators apparently were unable to find enough evidence to charge them with crimes.
