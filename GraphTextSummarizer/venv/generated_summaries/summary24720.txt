Throughout the trial, Bulger's lawyers have tried to show that as FBI informants, Bulger and Flemmi were protected by rogue FBI agents up and down the chain of command. It's 'Whitey' vs. 'The Rifleman' as Bulger defense goes for top witness Flemmi pleaded guilty in 2003 to 10 murders. Bulger attorney Hank Brennan asked Steven Flemmi. When asked whether the FBI agent Connolly ever suggested someone be killed, Flemmi answered, "He gave us information and we acted on it." U.S. District Judge Denise Casper is reviewing the 30-person witness list submitted by Bulger's attorneys. After he was arrested in January 1995, Flemmi tried arguing he had been given immunity for his criminal activity by FBI agents who looked the other way.
