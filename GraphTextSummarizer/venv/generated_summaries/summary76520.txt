Clint Dempsey had given the United States a 1-0 lead with the quickest goal ever for the U.S. in a World Cup match. It was the fifth fastest goal in World Cup history. The 2-1 scoreline was familiar but a turnaround from the 2006 and 2010 World Cups when Ghana eliminated the United States each time by the same score.
