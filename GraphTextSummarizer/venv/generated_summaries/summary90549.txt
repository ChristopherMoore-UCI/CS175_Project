Last week, three men who were laying electrical cable in the turbine building of the No. 3 reactor stepped in tainted water, exposing themselves to high levels of radiation. They've been hailed as heroes risking their lives by braving high levels of radiation as they work to avert a nuclear meltdown. They were hospitalized after it was determined they had been exposed to 173 to 181 millisieverts of radiation -- two of them with direct exposure on their skin. Radiation alarms went off while the three men were working, but they continued with their mission for 40 to 50 minutes after assuming it was a false alarm. Tokyo Electric apologized and said their exposure might have been avoided with better communication.
