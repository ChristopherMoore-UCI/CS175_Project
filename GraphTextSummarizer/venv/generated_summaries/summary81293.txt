-- No final decision had been made regarding whether embattled CEO Tony Hayward will leave BP "Tony Hayward remains our chief executive and has the full support of the board and senior management," company spokesman Mark Salt told CNN. The statement, which did not mention Hayward by name, said "any decisions will be announced as appropriate," noting that BP's board would meet Monday night ahead of the announcement of its second quarter earnings. "So we welcome a positive attitude and a constructive attitude from BP, and we hope, in the future, that we get it." And Rep. Ed Markey, one of the company's leading critics on Capitol Hill, said the Gulf will spend years recovering from Hayward's "failed leadership. " "The new leaders of BP will have an uphill climb to correct the legacy left by Hayward, indelibly inked by the disaster in the Gulf," Markey, D-Massachusetts, said in a written statement on the reported-but-still-unconfirmed ouster.
