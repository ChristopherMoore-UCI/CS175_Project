In the U.S. and Western countries, patients usually seek medical treatment in one place and counseling in another place. In Iran, there's also a stigma (against people with HIV and the condition it causes, AIDS). -- Dr. Kamiar Alaei and his brother, Dr. Arash Alaei, have been called pioneers for their community-based approach to HIV and AIDS in Iran. The "a-ha" moment for me came in 1997 when I met a 19-year-old patient from Azerbaijan seeking treatment in Iran. Alaei: We had the support of the president of a medical university because in Iran, the system of public health care is part of the medical university system.
