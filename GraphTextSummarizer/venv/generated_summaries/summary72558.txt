-- A protester opposed to the expansion of Heathrow Airport threw green custard in the face of British Business Secretary Peter Mandelson on Friday. "It was a grave decision that I had to take to highlight this, but we cannot have people like Peter Mandelson standing by and being applauded for his actions on climate change when he's agreed to the third runway and bullied others into that," she added. " Plane Stupid, a group that opposes airport expansion and aviation-related climate change, identified the protester as Leila Deen, 29. The British government voted in January to approve a controversial third runway at Heathrow, saying it will increase airport capacity and is essential for British business. " Mandelson said he wanted to get on with his meeting "and not bother too much with adolescent protests."
