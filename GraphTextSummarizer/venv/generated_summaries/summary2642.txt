Across town are other Incan sites, also visible from the town's cobblestone corners, where you can hike up to the ruins free of charge. From down the street, you can see the tourists climbing the many terraces that, during Incan times, were used for agriculture and decorative purposes. Ollantaytambo offers spectacular views of a charming village, ancient ruins and magnificent mountains. When planning a trip to the area's star attraction -- the mountaintop Incan ruins of Machu Picchu -- this gem of a town in Peru's Sacred Valley is not to be missed. The main attraction, the Ollantaytambo Ruins, a former Incan fortress, attracts busloads of day trippers that unload by the market.
