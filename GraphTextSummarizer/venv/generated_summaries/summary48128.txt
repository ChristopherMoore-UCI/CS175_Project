On Thursday, Villescas added that the husband -- identified as Sam Davis by family friends -- told authorities "the men in the black truck were working with two light-colored trucks that paralleled them (and were) trying to pull them over," the Pharr police statement said. An autopsy detailed Thursday indicated that Nancy Davis, 59, died a day earlier from a single gunshot wound to the back of her head, according to a statement from Pharr, Texas, Police Chief Ruben Villescas, who is working with U.S. and Mexican authorities on the case. Earlier, police said that Davis and her husband were traveling in a truck on a Mexican highway near the city of San Fernando, Mexico, when they were confronted by gunmen in a black pickup. -- Occupants of three trucks were working together in northern Mexico trying to pull over a vehicle carrying an American missionary before one of them shot the woman in the head, police said Thursday. In Wednesday's incident, at least one other gunshot hit the victim's vehicle, which is now in the custody of Pharr police.
