Republicans for years have successfully labeled Democratic presidential candidates as the liberal elite. -- Sen. Barack Obama is saddled with a potentially toxic image problem: that he has an elitist attitude. It has made him a target of attacks from Democratic rival Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee. It's ironic that one presidential candidate could hang that label on another, said Dr. Drew Westen, professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and author of "The Political Brain." Clinton, 60, went to Wellesley College before attending law school at Yale.
