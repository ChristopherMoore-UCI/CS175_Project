It all appears to have started when model Rose appeared on New York's Power 105.1 morning show and was asked about a reported relationship between reality star Kardashian's younger sister Kylie Jenner and rapper Tyga. Rose, who is the ex-girlfriend of Kardashian's now-brother-in-law Kanye West, said she believes Jenner, 17, is too young for the 25-year-old rapper. She needs to go to bed at 7 o'clock and relax," said Rose, who is also good friends with the mother of Tyga's infant son. That's when Rose unleashed the shade by pointing out that although she may have stripped, West's wife, Kim Kardashian, is well-known for having a sex tape. Kardashian then took to Twitter to point out that Rose said during the interview that she started stripping at the age of 15 and to request that Rose stop talking about her family.
