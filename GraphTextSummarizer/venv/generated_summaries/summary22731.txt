-- Jury selection begins Thursday in a Greensboro, North Carolina, federal courtroom in the trial of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards. Edwards is accused of conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. Elizabeth and John Edwards separated that year, shortly after he admitted that he had fathered a daughter with Hunter, who was hired to make documentary videos for his 2008 campaign. Edwards' attorneys have claimed the investigation and prosecution are politically motivated, and the charges do not clearly establish any violation of election law. Edwards was Sen. John Kerry's running mate on the 2004 Democratic presidential ticket.
