Here's how we see the show's biggest survivors 10 years from now: Badger and Skinny Pete: After burning through almost all of the money that Walt gave them for correctly using laser pointers, Badger and Skinny Pete decided that their drug days were behind them. Gretchen and Elliott: They gave Walt's money to Flynn, and now, they keep busy doing what they do best â€” being rich and therefore throwing elaborate birthday celebrations. Skinny Pete, after getting clean, replaced drugs with food and now weighs more than 300 lbs ... but his friends still call him Skinny Pete. EW: 'Breaking Bad' - 10 questions we'll never see resolved Walt Jr. and Saul: Now living on his own after college (he inherited a ton of money on his 18th birthday), Flynn has taken up residence with his girlfriend in Nebraska, where he works as a lawyer. And while he was at the police station, he got Badger and Skinny Pete to move his money to a safe location.
