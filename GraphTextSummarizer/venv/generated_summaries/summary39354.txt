The Elephant Parade, created by Marc Spits in 2006, invites artists and celebrities to design and decorate large elephant statues to be displayed in public spaces. -- Designer elephants have invaded Hong Kong's Pacific Place mall, attracting a stampede of photographers and tourists. Spits says humans are the biggest threat to elephants. "The speed of human development, particularly in this part of the world, leads to a fight for space," says Spits. This year's collection includes pieces from fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and local actor Donnie Yen.
