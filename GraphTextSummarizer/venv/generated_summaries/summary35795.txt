Geyser and Weier had concocted a plan to kill their friend so that they could impress a ghoulish character called Slenderman, according to authorities. " "She loved Creepypasta, she loved the Slenderman stories, just anything a bit creepy," William Weier reportedly said. They were her friends, authorities say, two other 12-year-olds: Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier. Geyser and Weier were arrested hours after the victim was discovered, according to the complaint. "But I don't see why it changed from dream to reality." Planning an attack Weier and Geyser attended the same middle school as the victim and had a sleepover at the home of one of the suspects Friday night, according to the police chief.
