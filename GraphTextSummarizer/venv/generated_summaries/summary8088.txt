According to Navarro, the Flores family's lawyer Edward Alvarez Yrala asked the court to charge van der Sloot with a charge similar to aggravated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before he resigned as van der Sloot's lawyer this year, Maximo Altez told In Session that his client attacked Flores after she found something on his computer that tied him to the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005. In it, an interrogator twice asks van der Sloot in Spanish whether he killed Stephany Flores. In a videotaped interrogation with Peruvian police broadcast Monday, Joran van der Sloot admitted that he hit, strangled and ultimately killed a 21-year-old woman last year in his Lima hotel room. In a September 2010 jailhouse interview with a Dutch television station, van der Sloot refused to answer questions about the Flores case, saying it is "not in my best interest to talk about it at all."
