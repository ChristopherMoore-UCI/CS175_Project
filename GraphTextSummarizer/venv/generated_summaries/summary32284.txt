-- Suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein appears to have left handwritten notes in the Pennsylvania woods in which he chillingly describes his ambush of two state troopers last month, State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Wednesday. Bivens said the handwritten notes were discovered among items left behind at a campsite located by law enforcement agents on September 29. Bivens said Frein faces two additional counts of possession of a weapon of mass destruction after two booby trapped pipe bombs were discovered in the Pocono Mountains search area last week. In the search of his bedroom, investigators also found galvanized steel pipes drilled out to accept fusing material, end caps, pyrotechnic fuse and improvised explosive initiators. Bivens quoted the suspect as writing that he "did a k turn a quarter mile from them and pulled into a development I knew had unfinished access road.
