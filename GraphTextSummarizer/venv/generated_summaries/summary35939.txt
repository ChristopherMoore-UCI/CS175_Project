Changing perceptions about older workers will take time, but a great step forward would be for Congress to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to make it clear that age discrimination in all professions will no longer be tolerated in the United States of America. The concept that a person should be let go solely because of age is just as wrong as discrimination based on race, gender or ethnicity. Just so it's clear, age discrimination in most fields is prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act passed by Congress in 1967. This law protects workers between 40 and 70 from age discrimination. Plus, legally sanctioned age discrimination sends a horrible message that older workers are inherently less valuable than younger ones.
