The 29-year-old revealed last year -- on the same day former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell of Jamaica and former world champion Tyson Gay of the U.S. said they had tested positive for banned substances -- that she would never "intentionally take an illegal substance of any form" but Jamaica's anti-doping disciplinary panel Tuesday claimed she was "negligent," The Jamaican Gleaner newspaper reported. -- Olympic gold medalist Sherone Simpson of Jamaica plans to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after receiving an 18-month doping suspension Tuesday, with her agent calling the ban "incredibly unjust." Simpson, who won gold at the 2004 Olympics in the 4x100-meter relay, silver in the 100 meters at the 2008 Games and silver in the 4x100-meter relay at the 2012 Olympics, tested positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine at last year's Jamaican national championships. "The panel has given no written explanation as to how or why they came to this decision," Simpson's agent, Paul Doyle, said in a statement sent to CNN. " It was a double blow Tuesday for Jamaican athletes, since discus thrower Allison Randall received a two-year doping suspension, The Gleaner said. Simpson and Powell share the same physical trainer, according to The Gleaner.
