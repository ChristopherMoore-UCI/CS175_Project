-- Unsolicited text messages from scammers, companies and political campaigns are illegal and annoying. But many text-spam messages are sent from regular phone numbers, not shortcodes, precisely because shortcode use is so tightly monitored and regulated. According to GSMA, one feature of the new spam-reporting service is that it generates a data feed of spam reports that carriers can integrate into their network security measures. Also, this service is new, so it's unclear so far what kind of difference it might make in the fight against spam texts. However, forwarding spam texts to an easy-to-remember shortcode is a simple thing to do.
