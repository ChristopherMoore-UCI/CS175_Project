A little background: I went to elementary school about 40 minutes south of Ferguson, in the St. Louis military suburb of O'Fallon. The narrative that has been presented about Ferguson -- that it's about poor black folks rising up against the evil white oppressor -- may be sexy and make for good TV, but that's not the reality on the ground. Ferguson, O'Fallon, Florissant -- all of the small suburbs outside of St. Louis proper are where black folks moved to in the 1990s and 2000s to get away from violence and poverty in the city. While that won't get you a monthly parking space in Los Angeles, it doesn't mean the people of Ferguson are in the ghettos of America's declining Rust Belt. This is the St. Louis area in a nutshell, black suburban expansion, slow white acceptance and a dull Midwestern peace as the first integrated generations live together.
