To tackle chronic water shortages, Spain in recent years has also invested heavily in desalination plants, which take the salt of sea water to make it drinkable -- but several are not yet finished, including one that would serve Barcelona. The worst-hit areas are the Catalonia region -- whose capital, Barcelona, is the nation's second-largest city -- and central Spain in the Castilla-La Mancha region near Madrid, according to Antonio Mestre, a climate specialist at the State Meteorological Agency in Madrid. The government has decided to quickly build a water pipeline for 60 kilometers (37 miles) along the major AP-7 highway, to pump water in to Barcelona, if necessary by the autumn and depending on reservoir levels at that time. The latest drought hits Spain just after tens of thousands of new vacation homes have sprung up en masse along the coast in recent years, along with dozens of new golf courses thirsting to stay green. Some critics say that successive Spanish governments have repeatedly taken short term measures during droughts, rather than making long-term water-use plans.
