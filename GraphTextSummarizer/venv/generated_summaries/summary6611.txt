-- A wonder goal from French international Philippe Mexes helped seven-time winners AC Milan into the last 16 of the European Champions League with a 3-1 win at 10-man Anderlecht Wednesday. Borussia Dortmund have won the group after their 4-1 drubbing of Ajax Amsterdam, with Real advancing to the last 16 in second place. Real went ahead through Karim Benzema in the ninth minute, allowed time and space by City defender Maicon to convert an Angel Di Maria cross. Arsenal beat the French champions 2-0 with Jack Wilshere, returning to his best form after injury, setting them on their way just after half time. Ezekiel Lavezzi scored both goals for PSG, who are still pressing Porto for top spot in Group A. Porto thrashed bottom club Dinamo Zagreb 3-0 to stay a point clear.
