It'll be interesting to see how people's reactions in Shanghai differ from those in New York City." Futuring The surreal project is part of a growing movement in design called "Futuring" -- which as the name suggests, involves creating products for the future. The group -- comprising 33-year-olds Elliott Montgomery and Chris Woebken, who met after studying design interactions at London's Royal College of Art -- put the call out for members of the public interested in "futuring." "With massive global challenges looming, like climate change, peak oil, and economic volatility, we need to develop a cultural capacity for thinking ahead and creating options -- so we aren't just reacting to crisis after crisis." "The forecasts were from a broad spectrum -- obesity as a percentage of the UK population, robots in the homes of South Koreans, shortages of chocolate, acceptance of drug use, and technology," said Montgomery. So products like the "Grow Your Own Coral Reef" responded to those issues," said Montgomery.
