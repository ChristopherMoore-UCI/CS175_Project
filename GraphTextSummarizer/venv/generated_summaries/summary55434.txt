AIM Group's summary report on Craigslist Craigslist says any increased revenue is partly because it was required to charge more for adult ads under a 2008 agreement with government officials intended to curb the volume of online adult ads. " Craigslist spokeswoman Susan MacTavish told CNN in an e-mail that of all the websites that offer adult services ads, Craigslist is the leader in pushing users to report any suspected violation. In 2008, under pressure from state prosecutors, the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. The head of Washington's Metropolitan Police anti-prostitution unit said Craigslist "never" reports suspicious ads to his department. She said that because Craigslist follows the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's guidelines, the percentage of ads in its adult services section that are in fact children is "effectively zero."
