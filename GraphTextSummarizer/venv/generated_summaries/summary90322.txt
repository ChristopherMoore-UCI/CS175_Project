"We're offering (electricity) even cheaper than companies which supply their customers with nuclear power or with coal power," she says. " Sladek, a mother of five, established "Parents for a Nuclear Free Future" -- a regional organization aimed at promoting alternatives to nuclear energy. " Indeed, the company's shareholders receive small dividends, as well as an income from any home-generated power they put back into the grid, but the rest is reinvested into new renewable energy projects and into training and supporting communities who want to run their own green energy companies. At the time, Sladek believed that KWR, the power company responsible for providing her town with its electricity, could be persuaded to invest in sustainable supplies and even help its people reduce their reliance on the grid. Today, following the nuclear explosion in Fukushima and Germany's subsequent commitment to end its reliance on nuclear power over the next decade, EWS is enjoying rocketing demand, and expects to provide for a million homes by 2015.
