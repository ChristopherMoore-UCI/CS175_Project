State Department spokesman Ian Kelley provided further details Monday. Kelley said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will ask the department's consular division to review all processes connected with issuing visas. The next day, November 20, the U.S. embassy in Abuja sent what is called a "Visas Viper cable" to the State Department detailing the father's concerns, according to an official account by State Department spokesman Ian Kelley. -- When the father of suspected terrorist Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab visited the U.S. embassy in Nigeria in November, he told officials he believed his son was under the influence of religious extremists and had traveled from London, England, to Yemen, a senior administration official said Monday. Revealing new details, the official also denied the father told officials his son might be on a suicide mission: "There was no suggestion he was about to carry out a terrorist act," the official said.
