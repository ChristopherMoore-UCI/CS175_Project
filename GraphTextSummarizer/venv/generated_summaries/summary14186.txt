Now joining searchers on foot and driving up logging roads in and around Riddle, David Croom hopes McCandless' story may hold some answers. Johnathan's green Honda CRV was found abandoned on a lonely road in the quiet country town of Riddle, Oregon, on Wednesday, two days after he was supposed to start college at Mesa Community College. "There are plenty of wilderness areas in Douglas County, but not where he's at. David Croom has appealed to local search organizations for assistance. "It's 2Â½ miles from the major interstate; it's right in town in Riddle," Huston said of where Croom's car was found.
