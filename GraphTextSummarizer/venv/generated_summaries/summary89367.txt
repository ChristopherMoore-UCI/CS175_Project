North Korea said Sunday that it will "deal a merciless counterblow to the U.S. imperialists" and to South Korean "traitors," in response to the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise. On Monday, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak ordered his military to "thoroughly" prepare with the United States to counter threats from North Korea, the Yonhap news agency reported. On Sunday, Yonhap reported the South Korean president proposed a plan to reunite his country with North Korea and suggested a tax to prepare for the costs expected if the two countries come together. South Korea blamed North Korea for sinking a 1,200-ton warship in March, killing 46 sailors. "Inter-Korean relations demand a new paradigm," Lee said in a speech to mark the 65th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japanese colonial rule, Yonhap reported.
