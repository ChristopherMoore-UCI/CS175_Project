Health care workers are critical as they are on the front lines of this battle; WHO says 10% of the deaths during this epidemic have been health care workers. The Ebola response team in Nigeria recently saw 30 people finish the 21-day risk period -- the longest time period during which Ebola symptoms have been known to be present. And the larger response team that includes all our partners and our colleagues from Nigeria is doing important work to break the Ebola infection cycle. A Nigerian emergency operations center is up and running now, and we are about to move Ebola patients into a newly, remodeled treatment facility. The first person to die of Ebola here was an American named Patrick Sawyer, who arrived from Liberia.
