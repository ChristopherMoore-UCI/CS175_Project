Vice President Dick Cheney, in June with President Bush, says torture at Abu Ghraib was "the misdeeds of a few." "No nation in the world takes human rights more seriously than the United States," Cheney said at the American Legion's annual convention. -- Vice President Dick Cheney defended the Bush administration's record on prisoner interrogations, telling a veterans' group that its use of "alternative"  techniques against suspects was legal and proper. Top Bush administration officials, including Cheney lawyer David Addington, were involved in drafting the legal justification for those techniques, a former aide to Secretary of State Colin Powell told a congressional committee in June. We expect all who serve America to conduct themselves with honor, and we enforce the rules." President Bush acknowledged in 2006 that top operatives of the al Qaeda terrorist movement had been held in CIA custody and subjected to what he called "alternative" interrogation techniques. The White House has consistently denied that the United States practices torture, but CIA officials have admitted to using at least one technique -- "waterboarding" -- that has been considered a war crime in the past.
