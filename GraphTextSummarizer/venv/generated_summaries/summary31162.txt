Yes, some have done terrible things, but it is done in the name of man, never in the name of God. It is actually the case that a lot of men in France do not wish their wives to wear the full veil because when they go out, they are insulted or attacked and their husbands don't want them to be put in that situation. I obey the laws of God not the laws of man. France prides itself as a country that upholds the rights of man but where are my rights? I really believe that France is scared of Muslims, which is the motivation for this law, but people shouldn't generalize as not all Muslims are the same.
