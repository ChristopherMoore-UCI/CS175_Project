-- Twelve U.S. service members brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms in Colombia prior to an April visit by President Barack Obama, according to a U.S. Southern Command report detailing parts of the investigation into alleged misconduct by military members of the security team for the trip. "U.S. military members' interaction with the third country national females did not present a risk to the operational mission or to U.S. national security," the report said. Investigators concluded that the women had been fully vetted by Colombian officials and U.S. investigators, who confirmed they were not part of a human trafficking network or affiliated with Colombian guerillas or other terrorist or drug-trafficking groups, according to the report. The investigation of military personnel came after nine U.S. Secret Service agents were dismissed for spending time with prostitutes in Cartagena, where they had been sent to prepare for the president's trip. The report concluded that a, "combination of unstructured free time, the prevalence of legalized prostitution, and military members' individual choice to commit misconduct were the primary casual factors leading to the misconduct in question."
