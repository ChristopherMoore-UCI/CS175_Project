Naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash. Incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished, either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job, or else because magistrates stopped the work, pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement. The Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation. State of emergency means government money: â‚¬1.8 billion (more than $2.5 billion) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem. The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash.
