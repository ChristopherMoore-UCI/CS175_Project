The city of New Delhi, which is preparing to host the Commonwealth Games in October of next year, will soon be displaying large billboards along its gridlocked roads and on buses in a bid to embarrass those who urinate in public to end the practice, said Mayor Kanwar Sain. The signs will feature three characters: Mr. Thu-Thu Kumar (the spitter), Mr. Kuda Kumar (the litterbug) and Mr. Su-Su Kumar (the person who pees in public). Sain said. Urinating, spitting and littering in public are acts punishable with a fine of $10 or more in New Delhi. The government estimates that less than 30 percent of villagers have access to latrines, which poses serious health risks.
