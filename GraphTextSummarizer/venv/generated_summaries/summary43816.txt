Assuming airlines will relax their policies just for the sake of competing with their counterparts, I would advocate that they hold the line on electronic devices being used with headphones or anything else that could potentially block passengers from hearing and understanding emergency instructions from crew members. Most safety concerns focus on the effect of electronic interference to navigation systems. Now GPS and sophisticated internal navigation systems integrate VOR signals into the calculations from onboard computers. I grumble in silence but grin because I no longer have to wrestle through pages of paper charts and manuals. It comes mostly from electronic devices creating a distraction.
