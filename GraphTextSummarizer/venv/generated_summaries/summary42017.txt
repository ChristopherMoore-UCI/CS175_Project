Ryan Brunn was one of hundreds of people investigators interviewed in their search for suspects, Keenan said Wednesday. Ryan Brunn is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday at 1:30 p.m. at the Cherokee County Courthouse in Canton, Keenan said. Authorities arrested maintenance worker Ryan Brunn, 20, Wednesday afternoon. Brunn's adopted brother told CNN affiliate WXIA that the arrest was a "big mistake," and said investigators should have focused on the complex's other maintenance workers. He is charged with killing 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera, who was last seen alive Friday near a playground at the apartment complex in Canton.
