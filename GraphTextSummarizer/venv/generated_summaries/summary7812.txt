According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss. Conversely, just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction. Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules. Protecting shift workers is likewise good for business. They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.
