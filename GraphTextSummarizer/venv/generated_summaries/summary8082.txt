Virginia Tech police Chief Wendell Flinchum talks about the first slaying on campus since the 2007 shootings. Yang, 22, from Beijing, China, was killed at the Au Bon Pain restaurant in the Graduate Life Center at around 7 p.m., school spokesman Larry Hincker said in a written statement. Zhu did not say anything to the arresting officers, said campus police Chief Wendell Flinchum. Virginia Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said Thursday that Xin Yang's killing was the first on the campus since April 16, 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people before turning a gun on himself. The Ningbo, China, native has been charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bail at a local jail, Hincker said.
