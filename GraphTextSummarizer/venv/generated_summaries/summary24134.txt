He said he launched the site to "de-lamilfy spirituality," to promote conversations and to bring people together about metaphysical topics. Users can read original content while posing questions, engaging in discussions and undertaking creative activities such as writing exercises. But then Wilson shifted gears, turned earnest and devoted the rest of his session to Soul Pancake, the website he co-founded to help people explore life's big questions. Launched in 2009, the site encourages users to post thought-provoking musings about spirituality, philosophy, creativity and other meaty topics. Wilson said Soul Pancake has evolved into a media-production company that is launching a YouTube channel and creating programming for Oprah Winfrey's TV network.
