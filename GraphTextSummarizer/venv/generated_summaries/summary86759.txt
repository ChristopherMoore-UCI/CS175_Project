Jodi Newbern, author of "Regifting Revival: A Guide to Reusing Gifts Graciously" This probably happens to almost everyone, every year. Aren't the holidays stressful enough without having to buy gifts for people you hardly talk to? Reddyh: Instead of exchanging gifts, next year you all go out for an inexpensive lunch or dinner... or have a potluck in the lunchroom at work. Jabbes: I keep a few food, restaurant or gas gift cards on hand for these incidents, especially during the holidays. Sherri Athay, author of "Present Perfect: Unforgettable Gifts for Every Occasion" First, thank the giver for the gift.
