The report concluded that a pattern of accommodation to Lanza's mental health conditions -- rather than addressing his underlying needs -- by Nancy Lanza and certain health care providers, exacerbated Lanza's mental status. In an email dated December 11, 2012,  three days before his attack, Lanza wrote to an unnamed chatter: "The inexplicable mystery to me isn't how there are massacres, but rather how there aren't 100,000 of them every year." Despite sharing her worries about her son's condition with friends, the report said it does not appear Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, communicated any concerns to mental health or medical professionals in her final months. Newtown shooter Adam Lanza was an isolated young man with deteriorating mental health and a fascination for mass violence whose problems were not ignored but misunderstood and mistreated, according to a report released Friday by a Connecticut state agency. The report ultimately determines that Lanza's mental health issues may have extended past autism to include anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and suicidal disorder. " "The record seems to indicate that they cared deeply, that they tried," Dr. Harold Schwartz, a Hartford psychiatrist who co-wrote the report, told reporters in a teleconference, "but it's not clear that the depth of the issues were recognized and so their response, especially the response of Mrs. Lanza, could appear like denial."
