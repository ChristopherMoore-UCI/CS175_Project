-- There will be more than enough doses of the H1N1 vaccine to go around in the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Thursday. " Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of the WHO's Initiative for Vaccine Research, said that nine countries, including the United States, have offered to donate vaccines for use in developing countries and that the WHO will be coordinating the distribution. Most of the initial doses available in October will be FluMist nasal spray. Pregnant women are not allowed to get this type of vaccine because it contains a live virus. According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll in August, 66 percent of Americans plan to get H1N1 vaccine.
