The reality is that I am still saddened that Marley has Down syndrome, but I am beginning to realize that God can bless us regardless of our circumstances. In my opinion, these limitations we put on children with Down syndrome are outdated and lead to a lack of acceptance in our society. Three days later, before we left the hospital, the pediatric doctor told us she thought Marley might have Down syndrome. I will never be able to fully understand why Marley has Down syndrome, but I do know she has made a difference in my life, my wife's life, and in the lives of so many in our community. Marley smiles, laughs, plays, is able to meet many developmental milestones (albeit her own pace, with her own style), makes mistakes, and, most importantly, completes our family.
