"The high-resolution screen of the new iPad establishes a new benchmark in excellence, providing the best rendering of detail and color accuracy we've ever seen on a tablet display," reviewer Donna L. Tapellini wrote on the Consumer Reports site. Less than two weeks after Consumer Reports engineers found that Apple's new tablet can get as hot as 116 degrees while running games, the magazine has declared it the best in breed, placing it at the top of its tablet-computer rankings on Monday. In an earlier test using a thermal-imaging camera, Consumer Reports engineers recorded temperatures up to 13 degrees higher than the iPad 2 on the new iPad while playing a video game, "Infinity Blade II. The review called the iPad "superb in virtually every other way as well," noting a vastly improved camera, a fast, dependable connection (on Verizon's 4G network), and longer battery life than any other tablet tested by the product-review group. But Consumer Reports did have some praise Monday for some of the Apple juggernaut's competitors.
