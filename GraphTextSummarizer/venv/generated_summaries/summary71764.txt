There it was, I was a white American, or technically a white American Permanent Resident. And this is true to the letter of the law, but if we consider the popular perception of immigration and the American dream, to say that white skin has nothing to do with it would be complete folly. The census meant I was going to be counted, I was going to be a part of American history. What I hope this census will force the country to deal with is the fact that white immigrants like me will never again make up the majority of people that come to this country. They move to the Lower East Side or some other suitably "ethnic" community, they change a last name, they learn English and within one generation they are welcomed into the country as ethnic Americans and granted that wonderful privilege of checking the white box on the census.
