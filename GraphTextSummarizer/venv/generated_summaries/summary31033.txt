For what it's worth, TV critic and author Alan Sepinwall believes "Brian will stay dead just like Superman did," as does the New York Times' Dave Itzkoff, who speculated on Monday, "Everyone will cover Family Guy just as fervently when the 'dead character' comes back in a week or two, right?" Adding to hopes that Brian isn't gone for good is a website called BriansAnnouncement.com, spotted by Deadline Hollywood and Variety. After the Fox animated comedy killed the character in Sunday's episode, several fans have signed a Change.org petition pleading with creator Seth MacFarlane and Fox Broadcasting to bring Brian back. 'Family Guy' and Fox Broadcasting will lose viewers if Brian Griffin is not brought back to the show. "Wilfred" executive producer David Zuckerman tweeted Monday that although he's no longer involved with "Family Guy" and knows "the show's in good hands," he still hopes "Brian isn't really dead." Along with a road sign welcoming visitors to the Griffin family's hometown of Quahog, Rhode Island, there's a countdown clock for a "special announcement from Brian" in 10 days.
