Last year, Pennsylvania prosecutors alleged a group of teens including Donchak and Piekarsky baited Ramirez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, into a confrontation following a night of drinking. According to the federal indictment, Donchak and Piekarsky were walking home from a local festival when they encountered Ramirez, and attacked him on a street "by striking and kicking him while members of the group yelled racial slurs at him," the Justice Department said. An all-white jury last year convicted Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak of misdemeanor simple assault, but acquitted them of felony counts including aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension. After the verdict, Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending the Justice Department pursue civil rights charges. "Violence motivated by bigotry and hate has no place in America, and yet it remains all too prevalent in many of our communities," said Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez in the Justice Department statement announcing their indictment last year.
