"Our priority is finding Lana," Sheriff Jeff Richards said Wednesday. Investigators have multiple leads, the sheriff said, adding that deputies have interviewed a person of interest. The Franklin County Sheriff's Office confirmed that one of the victims, 21-year-old Kaylie Bailey, had been reported missing last week along with her daughter, whose whereabouts remain unknown. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation released conflicting information, saying the mother and daughter were last seen on May 1 on the way to the farm. Three homicide victims were found at a farm in Ottawa, Kansas, on Monday, but they were not identified until Wednesday.
