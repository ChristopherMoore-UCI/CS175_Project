They argue that any tax increase would harm economic growth and job creation, while Obama and Democrats contend that the president's package ensures immediate job growth. Among other things, Obama's overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters. " Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused Obama of using his bus trip for political campaigning instead of working with Republicans on jobs legislation that can pass with support from both parties. "But for some reason, he's determined to keep trying anyway, and Republicans aren't about to go along with it." Calling Obama "completely out of touch," McConnell said the White House and Congress should "forget about the tax hikes, let's drop the talking points about millionaires and billionaires, and let's work together on bipartisan jobs legislation that's designed to pass, not designed to fail." Obama, however, continued to push for a public campaign to pressure Republicans to pass his plan. Asked by CNN why Obama kept pushing a tax hike that Republicans continually reject, Biden said the debate exposed GOP reluctance to work with the White House and Democrats on an agreement.
