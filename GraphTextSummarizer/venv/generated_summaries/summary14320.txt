Iran's Judiciary High Council of Human Rights said in a communique Saturday that evidence shows the allegations against Ashtiani "have been proved right" and that Iran's judiciary operates independently, as other justice systems do, the semi-official Iranian Student's News Agency reported. Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner raised the issue Wednesday with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, asking that measures be studied to  stop Iran from violating human rights. Another attorney who represents Ashtiani, Mohammed Mostafaei, fled Iran earlier this month after members of his family, including his wife, were arrested and authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. Iranian judicial authorities say a final verdict in Ashtiani's case has not yet been made, ISNA news agency reported Saturday. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups.
