Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said in a statement. "Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state," said Marty Carpenter, a spokesman for Herbert. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch," he said.
