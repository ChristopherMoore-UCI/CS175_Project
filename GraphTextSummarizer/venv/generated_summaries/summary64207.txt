New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defense and Emergency Management said it was keeping a marine threat warning in place throughout Thursday for waters off northern New Zealand. -- The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center canceled a tsunami warning less than an hour after it was issued Wednesday for Kermadec Island, Tonga and New Zealand. A 1-meter-high tsunami washed ashore at Raoul Island, the largest and northernmost of the main Kermadec Islands, said Vinhlu Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii. The tsunami formed after an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 shook the Kermadec Islands at 7:03 a.m. Thursday (3:03 p.m. ET Wednesday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake was centered 163 kilometers (101 miles) east of Raoul Island, and 913 kilometers (567 miles) south of Nuku'alofa, Tonga, the survey said.
