A federal indictment unsealed Monday charged Miguel Trevino Morales, a leader of the northern Mexico-based Gulf Cartel, of operating a criminal enterprise, cocaine distribution and firearms violations. The Gulf Cartel and Zetas, nicknamed collectively as "The Company," are among the major drug cartels that are behind the drug-related violence that has swept Mexico in recent years, according to authorities. Concurrently, prosecutors updated a separate indictment against three other top leaders of the Gulf Cartel: Antonio Cardenas Guillen, Jorge Eduardo Costilla and Heriberto Lazcano, for drug trafficking related crimes, all believed to be at large in Mexico. These are weapons that the Mexican army said it seized from the ruthless Gulf Cartel in 2008. "These indictments allege a stunning and sophisticated operation by 'The Company' to move illegal drugs into our communities and cash back to Mexico," Breuer said.
