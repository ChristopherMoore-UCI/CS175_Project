If they do it, I think it would be a monumental feat, but I think Champions League football would be incredible this year. So with 10 games to go of the 2013-14 season, Liverpool fans are daring to hope. The team's recent positive results have been a source of encouragement for former Liverpool stalwart Jamie Carragher, who made over 500 appearances for The Reds before calling time on his career at the end of the 2012-13 season. After sealing a then record 18th English title in 1990, Liverpool has only sporadically shown signs of mounting a genuine Premier League challenge -- until this season as the club makes an unlikely bid to win the league. Uruguay's Suarez and England international Sturridge, dubbed the "SAS" by the British media, have scored 24 and 18 Premier League goals respectively, rocketing Liverpool towards the top of the table.
