A diverse group of faith leaders gathered at the Vatican on Tuesday to sign a declaration pledging to "inspire spiritual and practical action by all global faiths and people of good will everywhere" to eradicate slavery by the year 2020. Pope Francis said on Tuesday that modern slavery is a "crime against humanity" and is "unfortunately becoming worse and worse every day. CNN has championed the cause of eradicating slavery, having launched its Freedom Project in March 2011. " "This takes place in hiding, behind closed doors, in private homes, in the streets, in the cars, in factories, in the fields, in fishing boats, and in so many other places," the Pope said through an interpreter during a panel discussion Tuesday led by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Most victims in Europe and Central Asia are forced into sexual exploitation, the United Nations says; in East Asia and the Pacific region, most are used for forced labor.
