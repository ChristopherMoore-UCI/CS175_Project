Two men, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, were found guilty Thursday of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby near a military barracks in southeast London in May. Their slaying of Rigby, whom they mowed down and hacked to death in the full view of horrified onlookers in the capital's Woolwich neighborhood, shocked the nation. Like attacks on U.S. soldiers by Islamist extremists on American soil, the attack on Rigby caused political concern about the implications of domestic terrorism in a country that has fought al Qaeda and Islamic terrorism and also has a significant Muslim population. The judge also cited details of Adebolajo's police interview and witness testimony, including that he loved al Qaeda, and that he had tried to cut off Rigby's head because it was the proper method under Allah. Cellphone footage replayed in court at the trial showed Adebolajo, still clutching a meat cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" for British soldiers killing Muslims overseas. The prosecution had argued that when they ran toward the police vehicle that responded after Rigby's murder -- with Adebolajo holding a knife and Adebowale a gun -- they intended to kill a police officer.
