"The classic is a holdover from 10 years of iPod existence, bearing many similarities to the original iPod," wrote blog editor Victor Agreda, Jr. -- The iPod classic, a venerable stalwart in the world of consumer technology, may be getting the axe along with its cousin, the iPod shuffle, according to a blog that focuses on Apple news. Citing an unnamed source, The Unofficial Apple Weblog is reporting that, in addition to unveiling the iPhone 5 next week, Apple plans to discontinue the more dated versions of its music player in favor of sleeker models like the iPod Nano and iPod Touch. A groundbreaking device in personal tech, credited with reinvigorating Apple a decade ago, the iPod line now accounts for just about 7 percent of Apple's overall revenues. Last year, Apple made what then-CEO Steve Jobs called "the biggest change in the iPod lineup ever."
