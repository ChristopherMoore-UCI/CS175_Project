Shellie Zimmerman called 911 just days after filing for divorce, claiming her estranged husband punched her father in the nose, took her iPad out of her hands, smashed it and cut it with a pocket knife. "His shirt was halfway unbuttoned and he was putting his hand in his shirt and saying, 'Please step closer, please step closer,' so I think that logically I assumed he had a gun on him." Shellie Zimmerman has not pressed charges but police are still investigating the case. They say it could take months to recover video evidence from the damaged iPad. "I believe the evidence, but this revelation in my life has really helped me to take the blinders off and start to see things differently," Shellie Zimmerman told NBC's Matt Lauer on the "Today" show. George Zimmerman was acquitted on July 13 in the death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
