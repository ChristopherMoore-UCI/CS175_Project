Hollywood analysts say they aren't surprised at how the Walk lacks minorities, though its sponsor and operator, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, says it has been working hard to improve diversity in an attraction that stretches for blocks throughout Hollywood. "One of the ways to get Latinos into the movie theaters is getting Latino stars," said Steven Ross, a University of Southern California history professor and author of "Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics. A majority of Hollywood revenue is coming from international revenue. The 2,354 stars on the Walk line both sides of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street -- the heart of Hollywood -- and the chamber's annual 24 or so induction ceremonies are broadcast around the world. In fact, of the 2,354 stars on Hollywood sidewalks, only 3.4% of them belong to Hispanics such as Shakira, a CNN analysis shows.
