As the world reels from its worst Ebola outbreak, the nation hardest hit is declaring a shortage of body bags, which are crucial to preventing the spread of the deadly virus. Items scheduled to arrive don't include body bags. A grim inventory of supplies shows body bags were not the only items lacking. Liberia is also experiencing a shortage of other supplies needed to fight the virus, including protective suits, face masks, gloves and goggles. Liberia said it needs 2.4 million boxes of gloves in the next six months, but it has only 18,000 boxes.
