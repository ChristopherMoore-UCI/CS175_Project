" Giordano was asked about a $1.5 million life insurance policy he took out on Gardner days before they traveled to Aruba. Responding to a question about whether Giordano was a swinger, Baez said, "Gary has a different lifestyle than perhaps you and I." "These were things that the this couple did, and they did not only with each other but with other individuals," the lawyer added, referring to what transpired involving Giordano and Gardner before she went missing. Giordano vehemently denied any involvement in Gardner's disappearance. Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling on August 2 when he signaled to Gardner to swim back. The unresolved case has raised a host of questions, including the nature of the relationship between Gardner and Giordano.
