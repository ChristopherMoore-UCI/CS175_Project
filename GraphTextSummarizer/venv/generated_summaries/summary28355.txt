-- Manchester United and Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov has announced his retirement from international football with immediate effect. He has struggled to make an impact since his big-money move from Tottenham in August 2008 and was overshadowed by strike partner Wayne Rooney as United failed to retain their English Premier League title. " Berbatov, who overtook Hristo Stoichkov's scoring record in a friendly match against Malta last year, has endured a troubled season at Manchester United. However, Bulgaria flopped in their World Cup qualifying group -- failing to reach the finals in South Africa -- and the former Tottenham's star's performances drew widespread criticism from within his own country. The 29-year-old was captain of his country and scored a national record 48 goals in just 74 matches.
