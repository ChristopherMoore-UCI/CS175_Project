Violence, looters and fear of the rebels are preventing critically injured patients from going to health facilities in the capital of Bangui, said French medical aid group, Medecins Sans Frontieres. "MSF condemns the looting and robberies of our facilities and reminds all parties that medical personnel must be respected and protected and must be granted all available help in the performance of their duties," said Serge St. Louis, MSF head of mission in Bangui. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from its base in the north toward Bangui, seizing towns along the way. Rebel groups have operated for years, especially in rural areas. The United Nations, which also said its offices were looted, urged safe and unhindered humanitarian access to victims of violence.
