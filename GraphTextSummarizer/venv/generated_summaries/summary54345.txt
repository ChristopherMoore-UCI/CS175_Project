By gaining access to the Arizona data center, hackers were able to install "phishing" software on numerous Wyndham servers around the world and gain access to customer data, the FTC's lawsuit alleges. The federal government filed suit Tuesday against Wyndham Hotels after sensitive customer data, including credit card numbers and personal information, allegedly were stolen three times in less than two years. But according to Kristen Cohen, an attorney in the FTC's privacy and identity protection division, the agency is seeking a permanent injunction that would force Wyndham to implement what the agency considers reasonable and appropriate security measures for customer information. The company operates hotels and resorts under the Wyndham brand, and includes Ramada, Super 8, Days Inn and Howard Johnson and several other hotel companies among its affiliates. The security breaches involved Wyndham's Phoenix, Arizona, data center, the main hub where the company stores and transfers data between its corporate headquarters and affiliates.
