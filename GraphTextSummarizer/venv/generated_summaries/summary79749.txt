"The police have a difficult job to do balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders and sometimes they get it wrong," Prince Andrew -- brother of Prince Charles and former husband of Sarah "Fergie" Ferguson -- said in a statement. Andrew, the son of Queen Elizabeth II, was born in the palace in 1960, has offices there, and spends much of his time there. The man in question: Prince Andrew, Duke of York. As for Prince Andrew, the garden incident wasn't his first brush with security gone wrong. A year earlier, another royal residence, Windsor Castle, had an uninvited guest: someone dressed as Osama bin Laden showed up at Prince William's birthday party.
