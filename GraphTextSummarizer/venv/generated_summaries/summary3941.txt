Given previous experiences, the odds of a cease-fire between Syrian government forces and rebels are stacked against Brahimi. Embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told the United Nations-Arab League envoy on Sunday that countries must stop supporting, arming and providing protection to terrorists -- the government's term for rebels. Syrian forces "continued cleansing neighborhoods in Aleppo and its countryside of terrorists," SANA reported. The president "stressed that Syria supports the efforts of the U.N. envoy to Syria and is open to any sincere efforts seeking to find a political solution to the crisis based on respecting Syria's sovereignty and rejecting any foreign interference," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported. The opposition group also reported an "exchange of intense gunfire" between a Jordanian border patrol and Syrian security forces.
