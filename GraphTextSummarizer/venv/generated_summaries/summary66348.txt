On Monday it was confirmed that the World Skating Championships, scheduled to take place in Tokyo this month, had been postponed until further notice. The season-opener in Bahrain was called-off amid ongoing political unrest and protests in the country, and the first grand prix will now take place in Melbourne on March 26. The Japanese Football Association, meanwhile, said that no J-League football matches would take place in March, and added that the national team's upcoming friendly games could also be abandoned. The 9.0-magnitude quake caused cracks on the track and damaged spectator seats at the circuit in Motegi, to the north of Tokyo. The 2010 race was also postponed from April to October following the volcanic ash crisis in Iceland that prevented competitors and spectators from flying to the Far East.
