The end goal of the first line was to sell computer users fake antivirus software, said Morganelli. DeBolt said security researchers are looking through old programs to see if their programming styles are similar to that of Conficker C. Computer users will not know that Conficker.c has infected their machine. Experts said computer hackers largely have moved away from showboating and causing random trouble.
