-- Saturday's funeral for legendary pop singer Whitney Houston is expected to be made available for television and web streaming from the New Jersey church where she grew up, Houston's publicist said Wednesday. Houston and Brown had a daughter, Bobbi Christina Brown, who is now 18. Winans officiated at Houston's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown. Houston's cousin, singer Dionne Warwick, was in New Jersey helping the family with funeral arrangements, Warwick's publicist said Chaka Khan was a close friend of Houston. Although the family is not commenting on Houston's burial location, her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey.
