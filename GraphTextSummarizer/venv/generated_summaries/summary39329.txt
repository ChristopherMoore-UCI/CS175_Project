"This raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS' debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian jihadis for maximum impact," CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. But analysts say Wednesday's attack could have been carried out by people who care more about fomenting terror or establishing a strict Islamic caliphate -- ISIS' aim -- than Tunisian politics. But it happened just days after a Tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was coming soon, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. While it has been more peaceful than other countries, Tunisia has seen its share of violence and political turmoil. "There are hundreds that have returned from the battlefield, yet we haven't seen this kind of activity in Tunisia yet," said Rick Francona, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer and CNN military analyst.
