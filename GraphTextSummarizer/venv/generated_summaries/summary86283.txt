The UCI revealed Friday that some of the evidence it had been provided with by the Italian authorities "concerns Astana Pro Team members" and this will also be passed on to its License Commission, which is an independent four-man body, headed by a Swiss judge. Astana has still to make a formal response to the UCI decision, but if it is stripped of its license to race at the highest level of professional cycling it would be a serious blow to Nibali and other star riders like Italian Fabio Aru. It led to widespread calls for the UCI, under the new leadership of Briton Brian Cookson, to take firm action and Astana was only granted its temporary license under condition that its management and anti-doping policies would face further scrutiny. Astana has also been caught up in the Padova investigation by Italian police into links between professional cyclists and banned doctor Michele Ferrari, who was Lance Armstrong's personal trainer. Vincenzo Nibali's defense of his Tour de France crown is in doubt after the UCI requested Friday that the Italian's Astana team has its WorldTour license withdrawn.
