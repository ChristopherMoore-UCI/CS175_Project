" Hayes' trailer in Bogota is about seven miles from the Mississippi River. To get to dry ground, Hayes paddles a small boat about 50 yards to Highway 78. Since the waters began to rise, Hayes said, all manner of animals have swum by the trailer, looking for higher ground. The nine-shot revolver with a long barrel that Hayes keeps close also works to ward off other predators. The homes around Hayes' trailer sit empty, but as he waits out the flood, he is hardly alone.
