As the late, great political scientist, James Q. Wilson, put it, "The central problem with legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption." From 2000 to 2010, current marijuana use by teens has dropped 9%, methamphetamine use by teens has plummeted 60%, LSD use has dropped 50%, and current cocaine use among high school seniors has dropped 38%. "I've never used marijuana and I don't intend to, but it's just one of those things that I think: this war on drugs just hasn't succeeded. Through movies, television, mass media, and, yes, sermons, America sent a message: Drug use is not culturally or morally acceptable and it will not be tolerated. It's time for a new bipartisan coalition committed to defending our children and our future from the dangers of drug abuse and addiction.
