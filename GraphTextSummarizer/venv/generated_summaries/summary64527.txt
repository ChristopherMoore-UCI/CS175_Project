Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert was at his residence at the Yard on Monday and was evacuated, CNN's Barbara Starr said. It's the headquarters for the Naval Sea Systems Command, where police said shots were fired Monday. During the War of 1812, Robert Fulton conducted research and testing on his clockwork torpedo, and in 1822, Commodore John Rodgers built the United States' first marine railway for the overhaul of large vessels at the Yard, according to its site. Amid World War I, the Yard made Navy ordnance, including the 14-inch naval railway guns used in France in the war. The Navy Museum at the Yard is open to the public.
