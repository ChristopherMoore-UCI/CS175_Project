New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin attends a ceremony Friday honoring Hurricane Katrina victims. In New Orleans, which has yet to fully recover from Hurricane Katrina, Mayor Ray Nagin on Thursday urged residents living in FEMA units to make evacuation plans in case city officials order them to leave. During Katrina, many New Orleans officers were accused of leaving their posts as widespread crime and looting permeated the city. In addition to the police department's actions, at least 1,500 Louisiana National Guard members arrived in New Orleans on Friday. New Orleans Police Chief Warren Riley said this week that hundreds of officers will be posted in the uptown, downtown, Central City and West Bank areas to ensure an adequate law enforcement presence in the event of an emergency.
