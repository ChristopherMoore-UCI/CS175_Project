"We often see outbreaks of the Coxsackie virus in day camps during the summer," says Robert Fink, M.D., an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Eastern Virginia Medical School, in Norfolk. "The majority of children who get this virus have no symptoms -- or they get aches, pains, and fever that go away within a few days," says Robert Frenck, Jr., M.D., professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics's (AAP) committee on infectious diseases. That's because bacteria can be spread from animal products to fruits and vegetables through contaminated water or soil -- and, of course, there can be cross-contamination in the kitchen. This is because it can be caught from hand-to-hand contact (for instance, when kids are in close quarters at camp) and from saliva, which kids are exposed to when playing together in the pool or with water toys. If the infection is extensive, has already spread, or doesn't respond to the topical ointment, oral antibiotics are used for seven to10 days.
