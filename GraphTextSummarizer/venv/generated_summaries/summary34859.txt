Led by Britain's four time Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie, who replaced John Kostecki as the team tactician with the score at 4-1, Oracle roared back in dramatic fashion. Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker was left inconsolable at the conclusion of the titanic tussle. The team was given a two point penalty and fined $250,000 after illegally placing lead pellets in their catamarans to gain extra weight. Only last March, British sailor Andrew Simpson died after being trapped under a catamaran in an America's Cup training session with Swedish team Artemis. As the stars and stripes billowed in the San Francisco wind, Oracle Team USA produced one of the most monumental triumphs in sporting history.
