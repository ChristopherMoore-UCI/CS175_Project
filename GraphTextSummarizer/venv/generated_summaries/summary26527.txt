Lung cancer receives just $1,442 in federal research funds per death, compared with $26,398 for breast cancer and $13,419 for prostate cancer according to an NIH study. While lung cancer robbed my family of an unbelievably special mom and spouse, there is so much we can do to ensure happier endings for other lung cancer patients and their families. Lung cancer kills nearly twice as many women as breast cancer. For the 108,000 women who are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, Lung Cancer Awareness Month can be a lonely time of year. An indiscriminate killer, lung cancer takes more lives annually than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined.
