Italian fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana lost the appeal of their jail sentence for tax convictions in Italy, their lawyer said Wednesday. The case will now be appealed to Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation, attorney Armando Simbari told CNN. CNN's Livia Borghese in Rome contributed to this report. The Dolce & Gabbana label is a popular brand on luxury clothing and accessories. The men were sentenced to 18 months in prison by a lower court after being found guilty of failing to pay 40 million euros in taxes owed to the Italian government last year.
