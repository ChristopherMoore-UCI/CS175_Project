Bush told Obama he was about to begin one of the great journeys of his life, and invited him to visit the White House as soon as it could be arranged, according to White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. Obama had an overwhelming victory over Sen. John McCain, who pledged Tuesday night to help Obama lead. Together, under the leadership of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and a Democratic Congress, we will chart a better course to build a new economy and rebuild our leadership in the world. Sen. Barack Obama addresses a crowd of 125,000 people in Chicago, Illinois. With Obama's projected win, he will become the first African-American to win the White House.
