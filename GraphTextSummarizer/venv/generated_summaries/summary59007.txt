Eyewitnesses claim police fired on unarmed striking oil workers in the western town of Zhanaozen on Friday, a charge denied by the authorities. The clashes, which injured police officers and involved looting and burning, occurred Friday as the former Soviet state celebrated its 20th anniversary of independence, according to Russian and Kazakh state-run media. The opposition Social Democratic Party (OSDP) called for an emergency panel to investigate, and the commission should be made up of "senior officials, striking oil workers, and representatives of the public and press," the Russian news agency reported.
