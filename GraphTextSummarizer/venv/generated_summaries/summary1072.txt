"The vast majority of passengers have no nefarious intent but forgot their firearm in their carry-on bag," TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in an email. The TSA doesn't want you to attempt bring your firearm replicas, special gravy, cranberry sauce or super-special snow globes through passenger screening this December. Pies and cakes can go through passenger screening but may be subject to secondary screening. Passengers whose guns are spotted by TSA security during the screening process can be arrested by airport or local police and face criminal charges, and the TSA can impose civil penalties. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security has seized the most guns this year, with 109 guns as of December 1.
