Prosper said Afar provided him with information he shared with the Iranian government that proved that Taghavi was not part of Tondar, which seeks to restore the monarchy in Iran. Prosper, who served as the ambassador-at-large for war crimes under the Bush administration and as a prosecutor for the Rwanda tribunal at the Hague, said he kept the State Department informed about the case, but did not ask for U.S. intervention out of fear Taghavi would become a political pawn by Iran in its standoff with the United States over Tehran's nuclear program. "They finally got to the point where they realized he was used by this organization and he does not pose a threat to them." Prosper said Taghavi's case has thus far been "suspended," but that he hopes after working out "some final details" with Iranian authorities the case will be dismissed outright. " Taghavi, 71, traveled frequently to Iran to visit family and friends without incident, according to Prosper. Saturday's release was the product of three trips to Iran, meetings with Iranian officials in New York and Europe and close to 300 e-mails with Iranian officials, he said.
