Workers loaded bodies -- piled on the sides of roads -- into the basket of a front-loader tractor, which then deposited them into blood-stained dump trucks, according to CNN correspondents. In the days after the January 12 quake, Haitians and rescue and relief crews have struggled to find proper disposal methods for bodies. Bodies have been bulldozed and dumped into open pits. The foul smell prompted people to dig the car out of the rubble, but those living on the street in the area said disposal trucks never arrived to take the bodies away. It highlighted one of Haiti's many quandaries: how to dispose of bodies.
