The age rating for new mobile video-sharing app Vine has been raised to 17+, meaning appropriate for users 17 and older, after it was flooded with pornographic images. The issue made headlines January 28 when Vine users noticed a video of what was described as hardcore pornography showcased in the prominent Editor's Picks section of the mobile app. The new rating, for such criteria as "frequent/intense sexual content or nudity," means users wishing to download Vine must click on a window promising that they are over 17. The changes are part of an update to Vine, announced Wednesday, that also allow users to block or report a profile they find offensive. Since its launch two weeks ago, the Twitter-owned Vine had been rated 12+ in Apple's App Store, the only place it is currently available.
