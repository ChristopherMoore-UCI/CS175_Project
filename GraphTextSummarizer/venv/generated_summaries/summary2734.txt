He said the protests have cost workers their wages, cost the city and region some revenue and could cause shipping firms to divert vessels to other ports. In Long Beach, California, protests caused isolated traffic delays but did not hinder port operations, according to Police Chief Jim McDonnell. "Protesters wanted to send a message to the 1% but they are impacting the 99%," said Portland port spokesman Josh Thomas. -- Occupy protesters succeeded in shutting down overnight operations at California's port of Oakland on Monday night after a day of similar protests in several other U.S. cities. Organizers said the goal was to shut down ports in an effort to "disrupt the economic machine that benefits the wealthiest individuals and corporations."
