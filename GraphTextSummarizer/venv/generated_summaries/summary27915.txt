In other words, 80 percent of women change their identities -- I mean, names -- upon getting married. Names are our identity. They call that "the sports section for women," which is annoying, because it presupposes that, because I'm a chick, (a) I don't like sports and (b) I love weddings. They make you keep your first name and change your last name. Today only about 20 percent of American women are Stoners.
