These same husbands often threaten deportation and separation from children if their wives seek help or report abuse. The reforms in the Senate bill that seek to right these devastating and rampant wrongs are modest and simple: Tribal authorities can prosecute offenses on reservations when state and federal prosecutors fail to do so, the government can issue a visa to abuse victims to halt deportation if they agree to testify against their abusers and shelters that receive federal grants are prohibited from discriminating against LGBT abuse victims who seek their services. Before VAWA, women saw little incentive and an ominous downside to reporting abuse. Drafted in the mid-'90s by then-Sen. Joe Biden, VAWA provided greater authority to investigate and prosecute domestic violence cases. Even better, the more robust reporting incentives and mechanisms illuminated societal blind spots where abuse still occurs.
