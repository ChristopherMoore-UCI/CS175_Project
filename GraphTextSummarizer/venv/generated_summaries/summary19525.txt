So long after Election Day, we can keep (legally) decorating our dollars to help build a nationwide, grassroots movement to get big money out of politics. Big money has diminished our most important and fundamental right as American citizens: the right to vote. That's just about the amount candidates and special interest groups backed by global corporations, billionaires and millionaires will spend on political ads before Election Day in an attempt to sell you America's Next Top Congressman. On Election Day, nearly 1,000 volunteers will staff polling places across the state to collect the necessary signatures from fellow Mainers to ensure that they have the opportunity to demand Clean Elections from the voting booth next year. Publicly funded candidates could no longer compete against opponents who were backed by big donors and special interest groups.
