Cau's attorneys, John Duran and Craig Charles, said he worked at United for 15 years as a purser, or flight attendant supervisor. They confirmed that many of the threats involved Cau's old London to Los Angeles route. In each case, the caller claimed explosives had been placed on United flights. Patrick Cau, 40, a German citizen living in Los Angeles, was arrested in January while training for a flight attendant job at another airline -- American. In a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Cau admitted to making eight bomb threats between Oct. 4, 2012, and January 2, 2013, from pay phones in Los Angeles, New York City, Las Vegas and Seattle.
