But McConnell, who led repeated filibusters of Obama administration efforts in the Senate over the past two years, told reporters that voters were rewarding GOP opposition. Tea Party-backed Republicans Rand Paul in Kentucky and Marco Rubio in Florida won their Senate races, according to the projections, but other candidates backed by the group lost key Senate races, including Sharron Angle to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada, Buck to Bennet in Colorado and Christine O'Donnell to previously unknown Democrat Chris Coons in Delaware. Obama has led Democrats in defending his record, saying that steps such as the economic stimulus bill and auto industry bailout were necessary to prevent a depression, while health care reform and Wall Street reform will lay the foundation for sustainable future growth. At the same time, Obama said, it would be a "misreading" of the election results if anyone believed that the American people want to spend the next two years trying to "relitigate" his administration's overhaul of health care or other major legislation of his first two years in office. More likely is legislative gridlock on health care and other issues, with the GOP-led House pushing for spending cuts, deregulation and other measures that will die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
