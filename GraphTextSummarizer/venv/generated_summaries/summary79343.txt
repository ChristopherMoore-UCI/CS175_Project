The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleged that employees at Eden Memorial Park, in Mission Hills, California, "intentionally, willfully and secretly desecrated the remains of deceased individuals," often moving them to make room for new remains. "This settlement is a testament to the thousands of Jewish families who have been traumatized because of the conduct of Eden Memorial Park and SCI," lead attorney Michael Avenatti said in a statement. This is not the first time Service Corporation International has faced allegations of digging up graves and moving bodies to make room for new remains. -- One of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the Los Angeles area has agreed to an $80.5 million settlement of a lawsuit that accused it of desecrating remains, according to court documents. It reached a $100 million settlement with families of victims whose remains were desecrated at Menorah Gardens in Florida.
