The Malaysian Boeing 777, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, crashed in the Donetsk region of war torn eastern Ukraine, in an area controlled by anti-government forces, known as "pro-Russian separatists" in the West. The most amazing part of this whole dramatic saga came when Russian President Vladimir Putin held a "scheduled," as we were assured, phone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama, which, as fate would have it, actually took place when the wreckage of flight MH17 was still burning on the ground in a field not far from the town of Shahtersk. Handily, a recording of a supposed phone conversation between two "Russian officers," one in eastern Ukraine and the other in Russia, was produced, intended to prove that they were discussing the downing of the plane. Did you have a Franz Ferdinand moment when you first heard about Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 crashing in eastern Ukraine? Nevertheless, Putin will have a very tough time convincing the world that Russia had nothing to do with the downing of flight MH17.
