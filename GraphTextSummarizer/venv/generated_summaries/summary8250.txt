The report, which was signed by U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and sent to senators and U.S. representatives on defense committees, said Iran is continuing to develop other missiles that can hit Israel and Eastern Europe, including an extended-range Shabab-3 and a medium-range ballistic missile called the Ashura that can fly more than 1,200 miles. "Iran has boosted the lethality and effectiveness of existing systems with accuracy improvements and new submunition payloads," which allow missiles to drop explosives over a wider area thus causing more destruction, according to the Pentagon report. Iran's developing missile program has been a hot topic in Washington and elsewhere in recent months, with a new Pentagon report last month finding that Tehran may test a missile that could reach the U.S. mainland within three years. "Iran is among few ... countries capable of producing such missiles," the minister said in the IRNA report. Washington has led international efforts aimed at stymieing Tehran's nuclear program, as well as its ballistic missile proliferation activities.
