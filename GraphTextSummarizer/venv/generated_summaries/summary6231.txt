Clinton said she wanted to use to data to build a case strong enough "to convince the skeptics, based on hard data and clear-eyed analysis, that creating opportunities for women and girls across the world directly supports everyone's security and prosperity, and therefore should be an enduring part of our diplomacy and development work. She and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, have targeted their efforts through a Clinton Foundation initiative known as the "No Ceilings" project. Clinton noted that her quest to improve the data about the status of women around the world stemmed from her years as Secretary of State when she would try to broach those topics with other world leaders, who would "smile and nod" but often not take the topic seriously. It was at the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 that Clinton famously declared that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights" -- setting the course for her advocacy as a U.S. Senator from New York and later as Secretary of State. At an event in February with her daughter Chelsea and philanthropist Melinda Gates, Clinton announced that the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were embarking on a global review to track women's progress across the globe since the 1995 conference.
