-- Hurricane Irene lashed coastal North Carolina late Friday and had metropolitan New York in its sights, staying on an unusual track that could bring deadly storm surge, heavy rainfall and misery to millions. US Airways is planning "significant flight schedule reductions" at a number of airports, including Reagan Washington National, John F. Kennedy International and Newark International. An ocean surge of up to 11 feet is possible in coastal North Carolina, tearing away beaches and probably damaging homes, businesses and other structures before sliding up the East Coast to New England, Hurricane Center Director Bill Read said. "We're going to see tropical storm-force winds for as much as 24 hours in some places and, in North Carolina, near and to the east of the center, they could experience hurricane force winds for as much as 10 hours," Ed Rappaport of the National Hurricane Center told CNN. "This could still be a large and powerful storm," North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue said.
