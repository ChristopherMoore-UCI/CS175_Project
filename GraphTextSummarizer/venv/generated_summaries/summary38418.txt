Evelyn Miller, 5, was found floating in the Cedar River a mile from her home in July 2005. " "This is definitely a homicide," said Floyd County Attorney Jesse Marzen. "That area was completely covered," Floyd County Sheriff Rick Lynch said. Some 1,500 volunteers joined the six-day search for Evelyn Miller, but it ended tragically. The little girl was found floating in the Cedar River near rural Floyd, Iowa.
