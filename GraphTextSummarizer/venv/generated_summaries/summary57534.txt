Bob Konrardy says the fallen soldier monument outside his home honors soldiers killed in Iraq like Dave Behrle. " Two years ago, Konrardy got to thinking: He'd be a Santa of sorts for soldiers in Iraq as a way to help him deal with his conscience. A few weeks after he left Iraq, soldiers he befriended were riding in a Bradley Fighting Vehicle on patrol around Baghdad. " Quizzed about why a man who was held in a VA facility a couple years earlier was cleared to travel to Iraq, Konrardy laughs. Konrardy was officially in Iraq as an embedded journalist to file blog posts for "The Quad-City Times."
