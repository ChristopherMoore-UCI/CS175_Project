Canadian authorities approved the mission over the town of North Battleford, in sparsely populated Saskatchewan. Tuesday's attempt was thwarted when an electrical charge broke the cable connecting the balloon to the gondola, causing it to slip away from his ground crew and rise into the Saskatchewan skies over North Battleford. -- French parachutist Michel Fournier vowed Tuesday to try again to launch a record-breaking skydive in August, hours after a "freak" accident over Canada aborted his second attempt to do so. Fournier says he spent nearly 12.7 million euros ($20 million) on his quest, a risky endeavor that French authorities refused to allow him to attempt over France. "The question is, why was it electrically activated?" said Michel Chevalet, a balloon expert working on Fournier's technical team.
