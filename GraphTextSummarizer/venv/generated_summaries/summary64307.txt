It's fair to say that more people have health insurance, whether that's because of premium subsidies or prohibitions against discrimination against preexisting conditions or the fact that those under 26 can stay on their parents' health insurance or from the expansion of Medicaid. But Altman says Obamcare can't really be compared to other programs because the number of people who benefit from other government health programs are more uniform: Medicare benefits seniors, Medicaid the poor, CHIP is for children. More than a decade later, more than 7 million children receive health benefits through CHIP and every senior over the age of 65 has access to Medicare and more than 66 million people were enrolled in Medicaid in 2010 -- a number that has increased with the expansion of Medicaid in Obamacare. Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius predicted recently that premiums would rise, but at a lower rate than recent history. "When they set their premiums for 2015, they'll be looking at who actually signed up compared to what they expected." If premiums go up, it will signal insurance companies feel the customers who've enrolled are sicker -- and thus more expensive -- than expected.
