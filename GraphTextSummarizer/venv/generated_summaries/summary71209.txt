While Like buttons connect Facebook users to their interests, Dislike buttons serve no such purpose. In short, Facebook will never add a Dislike button because it would damage the company's relationships with brands, businesses and web publishers -- these groups are essential for building both web traffic and ad revenue. Like buttons are about connection; Dislike buttons are about division. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told ABC's Diane Sawyer this week that Facebook would "definitely think about" adding a Dislike button to the site, allowing users to express distaste for updates or pages on Facebook. Like it or not, Dislike buttons aren't coming to Facebook anytime soon.
