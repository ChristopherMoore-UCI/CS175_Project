Tacloban City Stadium was one of just a handful of structures in the area to withstand the storm, despite its coastal location. The capital city of Leyte province, nearly 400 miles south-east of Manila, was one of the first places hit by the storm. -- One of the worst-hit cities in the Philippines, Tacloban, has been completely devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. Around 200,000 people were made homeless in a matter of hours as a wall of ocean water flattened their houses. It is now being used as a refugee center where thousands of people have taken shelter.
