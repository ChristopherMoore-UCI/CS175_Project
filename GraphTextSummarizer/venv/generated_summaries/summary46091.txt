"I don't know why they f***ing needed a new Dylan." Springsteen went on to cite his love of '60s and '70s soul singers such as James Brown and Curtis Mayfield, who played "music of gritty determination, of the blues, of the earth." Instead, Springsteen delivered a rousing, witty and personal history of his varied music influences -- from Elvis Presley to Bob Dylan to James Brown to Hank Williams -- punctuating his points by playing snippets of songs on a guitar. He also drew inspiration from the lonesome-blues songs of country icon Hank Williams, which he said reduced him to tears. When it came to songwriting, Springsteen acknowledged he owes a huge debt to Dylan, whose lyrics gave voice to the turbulent '60s and who he called "the father of my musical country, now and forever." Anyone expecting outspoken rocker Bruce Springsteen to spend his keynote address here at the South by Southwest music conference talking about his new No. 1 album or the politically divided state of the country may have gotten a surprise.
