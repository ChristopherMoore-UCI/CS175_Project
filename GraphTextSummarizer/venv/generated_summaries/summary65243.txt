-- Hated by the English Premier League champions, chastised by the UK's Prime Minister and even lampooned by a pizza company -- is Luis Suarez the number one enemy to English football? Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre told the club's official site: "Both the club and player are shocked and disappointed at the severity of today's Independent Regulatory Commission decision. No doubt he deserves to be punished, but the FA is too happy to demonstrate it has double standards for players like Suarez." But others disagreed with Moustafa Ali adding: I think they gave him the right punishment , especially he has blemish record against other players like Evra and Bakkal." Di Canio, Ferdinand and Cantona all went on to enjoy successful Premier League careers, despite their off-field problems.
