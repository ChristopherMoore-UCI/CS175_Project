Many in the travel industry admit bookings to Greece are lower than in previous years, with other countries benefiting. While traders sort themselves out, and before a market in the Greek currency begins, tourists are likely to pay in euros but be given change in new money.

Travel experts say that whatever happens with Greece and the euro this summer, tourists visiting economically troubled European countries, such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal -- all major tourist destinations -- are unlikely to lose out.
