The number of aircraft near misses more than doubled last year, but U.S. aviation officials tied the increase to new systems that report mistakes not caught previously. With commercial aircraft accidents  rare -- or non-existent in some recent years -- it is difficult to use accident data to identify trends. Officials said the new system makes comparisons with previous years misleading. FAA has various separation standards, depending on air space and aircraft. Under the new non-punitive reporting system, controllers are encouraged to voluntarily report mistakes and problems.
