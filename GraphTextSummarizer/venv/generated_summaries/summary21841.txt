How maybe they think it's fine to defer the advances of the fabulous women they know will always be there, while they dreamily pursue creative endeavors and dabble with other contenders. People have worse lives than you. It's a chilling book but showcases the resilience of women, even those trapped in unbearable circumstances, in a really powerful way. Realizing that the guy you've wasted time on for years is a vacuous, pretentious douche nugget is actually kind of funny, and Marx proves it. You might feel like it's confusing that this book is on the list, but not only is it "Scandal"-level entertainment (and real life!), you also look back at the 1998 scandal in a totally different way than you might have.
