"They wanted to domesticate Christmas, bring it indoors, and focus it on children," says Gerry Bowler, author of "Santa Claus: A History," and professor of history at the University of Manitoba in Canada. In some early depictions, Santa Claus looks like an overgrown elf; in others, he looks kind of scary, as American artists merged St. Nicholas with European traditions such as the German Krampus, who punishes bad children. Nicholas wears a fur suit, clambers down chimneys and gives presents to good children. As they sought to make Christmas more family friendly, the Saint Nicholas Society found the perfect front man in their namesake, who, after all, was known for being nice to children. Being crafty codgers, we ducked Santa's surveillance, turning the spotlight on kids and dramatically changing Christmas celebrations.
