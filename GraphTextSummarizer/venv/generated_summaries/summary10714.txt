Montreal police see no hurry in getting Magnotta back to Canada, Lafreniere said. In addition to the video posted to the Internet, Lafreniere said investigators have reviewed surveillance video from Magnotta's apartment building showing him carrying numerous bags downstairs. The Magnotta case began last week when a caller complaining of a strong smell coming from an alley behind Magnotta's Montreal apartment building summoned police, Lafreniere said. While Lafreniere did not name that person, several Canadian newspapers have reported on rumors that Magnotta had dated notorious Canadian killer Karla Homolka. In the end, it was the keen eye of an employee at the Internet cafe in Berlin that helped police nab Magnotta.
