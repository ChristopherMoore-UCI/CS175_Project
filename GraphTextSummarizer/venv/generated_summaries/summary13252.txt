Basketball star Lamar Odom was arrested early Friday on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the California Highway Patrol said. Odom is a free agent who has played in the NBA for 14 years, for the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers. Khloe Kardashian, who married Odom in 2009 after a 30-day courtship, tweeted about her frustrations last weekend after rumors surfaced that her husband was addicted to pain medications. Odom "showed objective signs of intoxication and he was unable to perform his field sobriety tests," police said in a news release. In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice.
