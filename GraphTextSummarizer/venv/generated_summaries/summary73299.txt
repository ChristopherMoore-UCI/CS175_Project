But reports of violence can be overblown, the leader of an expatriate group in Mexico said, describing his trip last month to a butterfly sanctuary in Michoacan, a stronghold of Mexico's La Familia cartel. The State Department notes that millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico every year. But it also says Mexico's ongoing violence and security concerns pose "serious risks" for U.S. citizens, and urges travelers to take precautions. "To reduce risk, you are strongly urged to travel only during daylight hours throughout Mexico, to avoid isolated roads and to use toll roads whenever possible," the advisory says. The number of U.S. citizens killed in Mexico increased from 35 in 2007 to 111 in 2010, the State Department said. Tourism officials have repeatedly stressed that violence occurs mostly in areas along the border that are far from Mexico's popular landmarks and beaches.
