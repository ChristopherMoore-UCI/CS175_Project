Dexter King and Martin Luther King III succeeded last year in getting Bernice King to hand over the relics. The children of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. will be in an Atlanta court Tuesday in the latest chapter of an ugly legal fight pitting the two brothers against their sister. The Bible, which King took on the road with him, was used to swear in President Barack Obama for his second term. At issue: control over two precious items that belonged to their father, his Bible and his Nobel Peace Prize. Bernice King contends her brothers aim to sell them, something she robustly opposes.
