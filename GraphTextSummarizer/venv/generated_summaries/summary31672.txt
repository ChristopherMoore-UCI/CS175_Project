New life engineered with artificial DNA Watson and Crick worked together on the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in the early 1950s. DNA pioneer James Watson is to sell the Nobel Prize he won for his co-discovery of the double helix structure, the building block of life. Announcing the sale, Christie's auction house said Watson's work was "On a par with Newton, Darwin and Einstein, (and his) unyielding quest for knowledge led to discoveries that forever altered human history. Watson, now 85, was awarded the medal for work in the field of physiology or medicine alongside fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins in 1962. "Everything we do since then is more or less based on that structure," Mario Capecchi, professor of genetics and human biology at the University of Utah and a former graduate student of Watson's, said last year.
