For Katherine, less food stamp benefits meant collecting more cans on the street and from friends. And when I saw Katherine M. pick up aluminum cans while walking her granddaughter home from school, I couldn't stop the rush of emotions. While many American children are thinking about the latest version of their favorite smartphone or tablet this season, millions of children across the country, like little Katherine, don't know where their next meal will come from. After Katherine's story aired, a generous viewer from Florida helped her shop for groceries so that this Thanksgiving, she doesn't have to sell cans to put food on the table. "I don't want her to feel ashamed because she have to pick up cans to eat or get the things that she needs," Katherine said as she looked in every direction for plastic or aluminum.
