The incident echoed a 1994 Vancouver riot after a Stanley Cup loss to the New York Rangers, causing widespread damage that resulted in hundreds of arrests. Speaking in June, Chu blamed "criminals and anarchists" who, he said, disguised themselves as Canucks fans for the riots. Thousands of angry fans, fuming over their team's loss, wreaked havoc across downtown sections of the Canadian city in June. "This is just the beginning as we expect to announce more arrests in the weeks and months ahead," he said. Footage from the riot showed city police wading into an unruly crowd that taunted and threw debris at the officers.
