When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer about how much coordination the United States would need to do with Syria to strike ISIS, Kirby said, "Not getting into the hypothetical operations, there's no intention to coordinate with Syrian authorities." It said ISIS fighters were seen carrying the heads of Syrian regime soldiers. The Syrian regime says it's ready to accept support from the United States and others working under the U.N. umbrella to fight "terrorists." The comments, by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem, were made Monday as ISIS fighters seized control of a strategically important air base in the country. Syrian state television reported that the Syrian military had evacuated the air base in Raqqa province to regroup and was still carrying out strikes against ISIS fighters in the area. Senior U.S. defense officials said last week that they hadn't ruled out extending airstrikes against ISIS into Syria.
