Texas Gov. Rick Perry struck a moderate tone in a farewell address to the Texas legislature that could very well double as a presidential stump speech if the potential 2016 contender eventually decides to jump in the race. Perry, a conservative favorite that fell largely off the map following his failed and blundering 2012 presidential run, mixed concrete details on Texas' economic strength under his watch with sweeping comments about the "endless possibilities" in his state. Perry also outlined economic accomplishments under his watch, including a budget surplus and billions left in a rainy day fund, and touted his efforts to make Texas a cultural hub. With 14 years under his belt, Perry leaves office the state's longest-serving governor, and Texas' economic and cultural strength under his watch would be a key factor in his presidential pitch if he decides to make another bid for the White House. " "As long as there has been a Texas, there has existed a people whose character has been refined by fire, whose souls are resilient, who respond to tragedy with grace, who look to the future with hope â€” what we have done together is preserve Texas as a land of opportunity," Perry added.
