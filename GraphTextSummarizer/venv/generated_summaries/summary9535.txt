-- Icelandic volcano ash is affecting flights in European airspace, but authorities say it is unlikely to cause the same levels of disruption triggered by a similar eruption last year. Changes in flight safety regulations also mean fewer flights will be affected. Last year, 200 micrograms of ash per cubic meter was seen as the maximum, this year it has been raised to 4,000 micrograms per cubic meter. It said it has successfully piloted a test flight into an area of high ash density, with no adverse affects. According to a study by the Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland, ash particles from Eyjafjallajokull were unusually fine and angular due to the higher silica content of the magma produced in the eruption.
