President Barack Obama telephoned Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday and said his administration is already making personnel, equipment and federal grants available to the state, said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. The department does have special teams to go into evacuated areas -- when there is no eminent danger -- to retrieve livestock or essential items like medication that have been left behind, he said. A pre-evacuation is under way in an area covering at least 89 more homes, said Nick Christensen, executive officer of the sheriff's office. "We're not going to force you to leave, but once you're out you're not getting back in because we believe that area is unsafe."
