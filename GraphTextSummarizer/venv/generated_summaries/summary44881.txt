The suit -- filed in U.S. District Court in Austin on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas -- alleges that the abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions. Since the decision, more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas have stopped providing abortions, Louise Melling, a deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, told reporters in a conference call Monday. "A dozen abortion providers were forced to cancel appointments immediately," said Kenneth Lambrecht, director and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. On Monday abortion-rights groups filed an emergency motion asking the Supreme Court to block Texas from enforcing part of the law, which is considered among the most restrictive in the country. The next stop in a legal battle over a controversial new abortion law in Texas could be the U.S. Supreme Court.
