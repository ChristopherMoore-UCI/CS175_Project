Forced to choose between the U.S. line and Iran's support for Damascus, Iraq opted for aligning with the mullahs in Tehran. Most importantly, what is it about U.S. foreign policy aims that make them so toxic for Iraq? If after so much sacrifice, the United States cannot create an ally in Iraq, then is it realistic to expect that U.S. involvement in other nations (Syria, for example) will create U.S.-friendly regimes? Iraq, under al-Maliki, is keen to receive U.S. help in countering terrorism and developing its economy. Unless political will in Iraq exists to align with the United States, U.S. civilian contractors and a large embassy, much like in Pakistan, cannot create allies.
