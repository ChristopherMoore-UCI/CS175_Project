The last of the women arrived Friday night in Kano, Nigeria, after being stranded for four to five days at Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport, Nigeria's state-run News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported, quoting several women. "This rule is applied to all women in general who want to get an entry visa to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj," pilgrimage ministry spokesman Hatim bin Hassan Qadhi said in the statement. Alhaji Hamman-Adama Tukur, one of the Nigerian clerics who helped the stranded women in Jeddah, told NAN that the women were actually accompanied by male escorts, but that the checking system at the Jeddah airport was such that men were checked, cleared and asked to proceed. Saudi officials normally separate men and women upon arrival as they check passports and paperwork. -- Saudi Arabia this week turned back more than 1,000 Nigerian women pilgrims who were not accompanied by male guardians or "mahram."
