Hewitt beat top Russian duo Mikhail Youzhny and Nikolay Davydenko before meeting Monfils, and feels ready for his opening match in Melbourne against former No. 3 David Nalbandian -- who lost to Spanish top seed David Ferrer in the final of New Zealand's Auckland Open on Saturday. Third seed and 2004 runner-up Kim Clijsters faces Russia's former No. 1 Dinara Safina in perhaps the highlight of the first round, and fourth seed Venus Williams -- the 2003 losing finalist -- takes on Italy's Sara Errani. Third seed Novak Djokovic plays Spain's world No. 42 Marcel Granollers, fourth seed Robin Soderling is up against Italy's 47th-ranked Potito Starace and fifth seed Andy Murray faces Slovakian No. 104 Karol Beck. Groth, who knocked out Australian No. 1 Sam Stosur in Brisbane, won her second WTA Tour title ahead of her opening match against Belgian 21st seed Yanina Wickmayer in Melbourne. At the Sydney Invitational, Gilles Simon became the first Frenchman to win the men's title in 20 years as he beat Serbian fourth seed Viktor Troicki 7-5 7-6 (7-4) in just under two hours.
