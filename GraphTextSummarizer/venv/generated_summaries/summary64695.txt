Christopher Tetrault, a conservation officer for the area with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, said the weather event works like this: Strong winds blow heavy chunks of ice out in the lake toward the shore. The same phenomenon was seen Friday on Dauphin Lake in Manitoba, about 75 miles northwest of Winnipeg, where a wall of ice up to 30 feet high destroyed six homes and damaged 14 others, according to a report from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Still, that ice mass was about 16 inches thick Monday, and the weather can change quickly in Minnesota. Those chunks heave up bits of lighter, melting ice closer to shore up on the land. Same premise: A chunk of ice (relatively shallow) was pushed by a strong, sustained wind.
