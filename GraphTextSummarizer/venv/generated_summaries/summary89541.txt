Look for sites that offer ways to import your old data, and if you crave stability, for companies that are profitable and still growing. When a major site announces it is closing, competing sites often step up and offer ways to transfer content directly to a new blog, RSS feeder, album or other service. Any information left on the service can linger on the Internet for years, and personal information might even be sold off to other companies. It's a reality of the Internet that sites are constantly starting up, shutting down or getting acquired. Pay attention to warnings Most sites won't shutter without giving their users official notice.
