"South Korea is always dealing with North Korea, there are always reports in the South Korean media that North Korea is threatening this and that," said Karl Friedhoff, program officer of the Public Opinion Studies Center at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies based in Seoul. "There's some difference between other countries views and Koreans' view about this recent North Korea nuclear provocation," said Yoon Dong Keun, a college student living near Seoul, who described heightened global concern outside of Korea. " The institute's polls in South Korea indicate domestic concerns such as the economy and job creation heavily outweigh concerns about North Korea, even after a controversial rocket launch by Pyongyang in December that drew international condemnation. Even if North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, Friedhoff does not expect it to raise concerns in South Korea. That same year, North Korea was also accused of sinking a South Korean warship, killing more than 40 sailors.
