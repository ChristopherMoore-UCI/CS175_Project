The defense attorney said he and other attorneys on the team knew Gerhartsreiter as "Mr. Rockefeller." Gerhartsreiter, who has led a life of multiple identities, has denied involvement in the Sohus case. At the time of Sohus' disappearance, Gerhartsreiter had been renting a guesthouse from Sohus' mother, Robison said. During the preliminary hearing, Moses rejected a defense request that Gerhartsreiter be referred to as "Mr. Rockefeller" in court. Her son John and his wife, Linda, came to live with Didi Sohus during the time Gerhartsreiter lived in the guest quarters. At one point in his life, Gerhartsreiter assumed the identity of "Clark Rockefeller," a cultured poseur who never seemed to have a job.
