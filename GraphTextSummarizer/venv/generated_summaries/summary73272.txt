"Jolly's win means it's all about Obamacare for the GOP." Outside money really mattered: In Sink, national Democrats landed the high-profile and well-known candidate they wanted in this race, and she faced nominal opposition in January's Democratic primary. "We've been trying to tell people this is a referendum election, Obamacare is not helping people the way it was promised, and Democrats are going to have a lot of answering to do," Walden added. GOP's convinced Obamacare's bad medicine for Democrats: While the candidates and local matters weighed heavily in the race, Obamacare was also a key issue. "His (Jolly's) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare," Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day said in an email blast to reporters. With Jolly's win keeping the congressional seat in GOP hands, the Democrats still need win 17 seats in the midterms to regain control of the chamber.
