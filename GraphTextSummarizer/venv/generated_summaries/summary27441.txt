At SETI -- which stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence -- scientists search the heavens for signs of extraterrestrial life by "listening" with an array of small satellite dishes. "We can't listen when all that is down," said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer and director of SETI Research. The search for life can continue at SETI's telescope array. The Eiler Fire, burning some 200 miles north of Sacramento, forced employees at the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to evacuate and temporarily shut down all of their computers, Internet and power. The blaze came within a mile of the facility, located near Hat Creek, California, on both the east and west, according to Shostak.
