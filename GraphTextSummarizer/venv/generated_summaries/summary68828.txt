The buildings were evacuated and swept by bomb technicians and hazardous materials officers, and access to Harvard Yard was restricted to students with Harvard IDs, according to the Harvard Gazette, the school's official news website. "Harvard University was able to determine that, in the several hours leading up to the receipt of the e-mail messages described above, Eldo Kim accessed TOR using Harvard's wireless network," it said. -- A Harvard University student charged with making bomb threats that led school officials to delay some final exams, including his, was released Wednesday with bail set at $100,000. Eldo Kim, 20, of Cambridge, allegedly e-mailed bomb threats at about 8:30 a.m. Monday to offices associated with Harvard, including the Harvard University Police Department and the Harvard Crimson, the student-run daily newspaper. An FBI agent and an officer with the Harvard University Police Department interviewed Kim Monday night at his campus residence, where he "stated that he authored the bomb threat e-mails" and said he had acted alone, the complaint says.
