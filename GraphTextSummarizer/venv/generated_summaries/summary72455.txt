Despite the consensus view that Darwin showed that "design could arise without a designer" there is now compelling scientific evidence of actual intelligent design in even the simplest living cells. Instead, the digital code and information processing systems that run the show in living cells point decisively toward prior intelligent design. Instead, living systems display telltale signs of actual or "intelligent" design such as the presence of complex circuits, miniature motors and digital information in living cells.

The atheists claim that Darwin disproved once and for all the argument for intelligent design from nature.
