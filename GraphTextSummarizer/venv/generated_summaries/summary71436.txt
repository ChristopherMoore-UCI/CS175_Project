There are some things that have nothing to do with skill that NFL scouts look for in a prospect, be they from big schools or little schools. "I'm small school, he's big school. It is not only North vs. South in the game, but it is big school vs. small school, big name vs. no name. Once here, small school can make plays over big school. NFL teams have their own scouts who endure plenty of windshield time driving to small schools spread around the country to get a peek at a player.
