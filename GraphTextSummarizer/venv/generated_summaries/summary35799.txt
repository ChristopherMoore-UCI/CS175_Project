Mujahid said the two Americans were driving in a civilian vehicle in the village of Dasht, in Charkh district. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said Monday that one American died in a firefight and the other is being held by the group. The Taliban wanted to take both men alive, but the firefight broke out, killing one of the Americans, Mujahid said. There were no immediate demands from the Taliban for the return of the Americans because the group was still deliberating what its demands would be, Mujahid said. He said the body was found in the Patanak Mountains of Charkh district.
