U.S. officials believe Mehsud was working with al-Balawi in planning the attack as well as planning the failed bombing attack in Times Square in May. It is believed that al-Balawi was working with Jordanian intelligence as a double agent, offering information to Jordanian and U.S. intelligence officials on the aftermath of drone attacks while garnering enough support and trust to carry out the suicide attack. "We have no higher priority than bringing to justice terrorists who kill Americans serving and working abroad," said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen, Jr. in a news release. A criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday details the U.S. government's case against Mehsud. A $5 million reward is being offered for information leading to the capture of Mehsud and another top Pakistani Taliban leader, Wali Ur Rehman, U.S. officials announced.
