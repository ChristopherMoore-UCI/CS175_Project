"Entrapment and strangulation can occur, especially to infants younger than 12 months of age, when a child is not harnessed," the CPSC said. "An infant can pass through the opening between the stroller tray and seat bottom, but his/her head and neck can become entrapped by the tray. Because used strollers are a popular item on many auction and aftermarket websites, customers are advised to check the model number used stroller they buy to make sure it isn't part of a recall. Infants who become entrapped at the neck are at risk of strangulation." "This recall is part of a larger effort by CPSC to address fatalities that occurred prior to new and better stroller standards being in place," CPSC spokesperson Patty Davis told CNN.
