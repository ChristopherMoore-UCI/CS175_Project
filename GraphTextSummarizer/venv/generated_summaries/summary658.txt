Obama's visit to Africa's biggest economy was part of a three-nation trip that began last week and included stops in Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania. Still, Obama promoted sound business practices and his own initiatives, the previously announced Power Africa, aimed at improving the continent's power grid and the recently announced Trade Africa. Obama wrapped up his trip to South Africa on Sunday with a visit to the prison cell where anti-apartheid leader and later South African President Nelson Mandela was held and called on students to help build a new Africa. I see Africa as the world's next major economic success story and the United States wants to be a partner in that success," Obama told a roundtable of some 20 U.S., African and other international corporate chief executives before addressing a larger group of business leaders. At the State House in Tanzania there was a celebratory greeting for the president and first lady Michelle Obama with a band, dancers and a mass of applauding, whooping crowds lining the red carpet as the Obamas shook hands making their way to the whitewashed building.
