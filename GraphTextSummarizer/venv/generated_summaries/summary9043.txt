Unbeaten Frankel cruises to Ascot success "Horse racing's roots as the 'sport of kings' obviously suggest a pleasure pastime for the elite," Willie Walters, the fashion course director at London's Central Saint Martins college of art and design, told CNN. Finery and high fashion have long been synonymous with the Royal Ascot race meeting, and this year patrons are being scrutinized to a level which is almost unparalleled in the world of sport. Ascot takes fashion so seriously there are even dress code administrators on hand to assess the thousands of people who descend upon the Berkshire venue, with a strict list of dos and don'ts issued to prevent standards slipping. "Any prestigious occasion will have a code to reflect the status of the racegoers regardless of which country it is held," said Walters. Our dress is a key signifier of class or our clan, very much so in the UK." Walters also argued Royal Ascot's 2012 dress code could be a not-so-subtle hint aimed at encouraging certain punters to cover up.
