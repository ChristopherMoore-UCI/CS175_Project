Prosecutors are arguing that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, according to CNN Legal Analyst Kelly Phelps. South African prosecutors say Oscar Pistorius' sentence of five years in prison for shooting dead his girlfriend is nowhere near enough punishment. Under South African law, Pistorius has to serve at least one-sixth of his sentence -- 10 months, as things stand -- before asking to be placed under correctional supervision. In their appeal of the sentence, prosecutors will have to prove the five years given by Masipa is inappropriate in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases, according to Phelps. But critics of the verdict have argued that Masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation, Phelps says.
