The mood of "Memrise" feels similar to some of Ocean's work on "Channel Orange," but it's experimental in his delivery. Rather than simply singing all of the song's lines, Ocean employs a more staccato, spoken-word delivery, saving his distinct vocals to close out the song. While many musicians would roll out the PR red carpet for a new track, Ocean unveiled the meditative "Memrise" without any fanfare on his Tumblr. In 2012, "Channel Orange" was a critical success, winning the Grammy for best urban contemporary album, and rumors of what's to come from the artist have been circling ever since. What we do know is that Ocean has been hard at work.
