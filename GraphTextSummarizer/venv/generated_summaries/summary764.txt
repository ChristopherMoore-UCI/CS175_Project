Lt. Timothy Breen flies missions close to Iranian air space almost every day in his U.S. Navy F-18 Hornet, often encountering Iranian military aircraft over the strategic waters of the Strait of Hormuz. "We've heard the rhetoric about them possibly closing the Strait of Hormuz and we just remain vigilant as we come through," said Rear Admiral Troy Shoemaker, who led a carrier strike group that this week escorted the Abraham Lincoln as the carrier on its second passage through the Strait this year. He is referring to Iran's repeated threats to close the Strait of Hormuz as Tehran steps up its defiance in response to international sanctions. The carrier is now on its way to new mission to support NATO forces in Afghanistan, but as international concerns over Iran persist, America's presence in the Persian Gulf will remain. The U.S. believes any attempt by Iran to shut down the Hormuz waterway might involve missile or sea mine attacks on merchant vessels.
