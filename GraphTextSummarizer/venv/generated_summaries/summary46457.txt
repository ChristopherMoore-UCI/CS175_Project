Fifteen people were in the minivan, said Trooper Russell Graham, and only two were wearing seat belts. Alcohol and drugs were not suspected factors in the crash, but blood was drawn from the driver -- one of the fatalities -- to confirm, Graham said. The vehicle "sideswiped a box truck and then ran off the road into the left median, overturned multiple times and finally came to rest upright on the eastbound side of I-10," Graham said. "The minivan blew out a tire and the driver lost control," Graham said. "This is an example of why we implemented that law," Graham said.
