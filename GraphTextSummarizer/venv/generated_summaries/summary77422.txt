"Even now, people look back at them and say, 'That was a great time to be doing posters.'" Alan Kitching will be speaking about the designers at Five Lives in Posters: A Panel Discussion at the London College of Communication on September 18, 2014. The results: a series of posters fusing each designer's style with Kitching's, and "Alan Kitching and Monotype: Celebrating the centenary of five pioneers of the poster," an exhibition at the London College of Communication for the London Design Festival, that will showcase Kitching's work alongside posters from each designers' estate. And to Kitching and other designers, they are a vestige of another time when a handful of great designers ruled supreme. "It was a sort of Golden Age of the poster," says legendary letterpress designer Alan Kitching. Posters, now and then Kitching is quick to distinguish his posters from those being commemorated.
