"They were inside the wreckage when we pulled it up," said New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. The Piper took off from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport and was bound for Ocean City, New Jersey. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the collision, which occurred shortly after the helicopter took off from a heliport in Midtown Manhattan on what was to have been a 12-minute sightseeing tour around New York. The wreckage of the helicopter, operated by Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours, was lifted Sunday nearly intact from the Hudson. -- Divers on Tuesday recovered the bodies of the final two of nine victims of Saturday's collision between a helicopter and small plane over the Hudson River, police said.
