In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. If Chinese government wants to serious tackle the income inequality while helping boost consumption of the country, they have to work on a much larger scale. An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption, however, is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment and income transfer programs. Studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance.
