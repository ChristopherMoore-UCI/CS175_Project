Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Republican Party of Orange County, said she felt the email was a joke, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. -- A California Republican official has apologized for sending an email that depicts President Barack Obama as a young chimpanzee. "To my fellow Americans and to everyone else who has seen the email I forwarded and was offended by my action, I humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness of my unwise behavior," Marilyn Davenport said in a statement obtained by CNN. Scott Baugh, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County, said he was surprised by the e-mail. Despite criticism, Davenport told the affiliate that she does not need to resign her position because of the e-mail. But I don't think there's anybody on her committee or anybody in the world really that doesn't see it as a racist," Baugh said on CNN's "AC360."
