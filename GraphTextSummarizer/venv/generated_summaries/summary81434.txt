"Higher crude oil prices, higher corn-based ethanol prices, plus a spate of refinery and pipeline problems around the country combined" are behind the spike, said publisher Trilby Lundberg. Here are average prices in some other cities: - Boston, Massachusetts - $3.74 - Charleston, South Carolina - $3.43 - Atlanta, Georgia - $3.64 - Indianapolis, Indiana - $3.84 - Denver, Colorado - $3.45 - Tulsa, Oklahoma - $3.54 - Portland, Oregon - $3.74 - San Francisco, California - $4.06 It's impossible to predict what will happen with gas prices in the near future, Lundberg said. But, Lundberg said, she doubts prices will jump this quickly in the near future because many of the refinery issues are being resolved. -- Gas prices jumped 18 cents over the past two weeks, the biggest jump of the year, according to a survey published Sunday.
