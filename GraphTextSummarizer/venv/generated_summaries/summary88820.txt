-- The New England Patriots are refusing to voluntarily turn over scouting reports and psychological tests to the defense team of former star tight end Aaron Hernandez. The Patriots argue that psychological tests done before the 2010 NFL draft and scouting reports that can go as far back as the childhood of a prospective player don't have a proven role in Hernandez's case because they were conducted three years before Lloyd's death. The Patriots cut Hernandez loose on June 26, 2013, the same day he was arrested in the slaying of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. "The judge has an incentive to be fairly permissive in allowing Hernandez access to these reports since denial would be grounds for a Hernandez appeal should he be convicted."
