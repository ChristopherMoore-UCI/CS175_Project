More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern Nigeria in April by Boko Haram, in an act that drew international condemnation. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. Commissioner Joseph Mbu said the proliferation of such protests "is now posing a serious security threat" to those living around, and driving through, demonstration sites in the capital city of Abuja. -- Police in Nigeria's capital have banned all protests planned in support of the more than 200 girls kidnapped in April.
