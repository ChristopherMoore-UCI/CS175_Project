It's hosted on Angelfire's "ny" subdomain for sites in New York state, where Zuckerberg grew up in suburban Westchester County. Mark describes himself as 15 years old, having just completed his freshman year of high school in "a small town near the massive city of New York." All those details match up with Facebook's billionaire CEO, as does the source code on the site's main page that lists "Mark Zuckerberg" as its creator. Some online sleuths think so, saying that a newly unearthed Angelfire page from 1999 appears to be the first website ever created by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The folks at Motherboard, a tech and science site launched by VICE, tracked the e-mail address listed on the site -- Themarke51@aol.com -- back to an account holder with the same screen name that Dr. Edward Zuckerberg, Mark's father, uses frequently. A crude effort at connecting friends and "friends of friends."
