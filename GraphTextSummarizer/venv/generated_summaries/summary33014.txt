-- A story about Pope Francis allegedly saying animals can go to heaven went viral late last week. Pope Francis leaves Pearly Gates open," news organizations that ran the erroneous account really should hold fact checking to a higher standard. But neither he nor Pope Paul VI went so far as to ascribe eternal souls to animals that would be comparable to humans. In his two years as the leader of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, Francis (who took the name of St. Francis, the church's patron saint of animals) has prioritized the lowly. According to Vatican Radio, Francis said: 'The Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us,' which was interpreted to mean he believes animals go to heaven."' So: Wrong and wrong again.
