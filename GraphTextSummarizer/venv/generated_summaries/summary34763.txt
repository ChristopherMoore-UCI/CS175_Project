"Mali needs a political transition through transparent elections within 12 months, functioning institutions and an immediate deployment of international troops," said Daniel Kablan, chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). And we need international help to fight the Islamists, to organize free and fair elections, and to help restore our country," interim Malian President Dioncounda Traore said. Two groups with ties to al Qaeda later toppled the Tuareg movement, and now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. ECOWAS can provide military training, logistics and reinforcement of Mali's own forces, Kablan said. In addition to human rights violations, Islamists razed tombs near the desert city of Timbuktu on Thursday -- the latest attacks targeting cultural heritage sites in the north.
