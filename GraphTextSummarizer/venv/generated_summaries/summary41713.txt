The Page, a collaborative effort between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the Royal Collection, will feature a mix of news, links, videos and photographs of various members -- primarily Queen Elizabeth, and Princes Charles, William and Harry. Those who "Like" the Page will be able to receive updates about the Royal Family's doings through their Facebook News Feed. This is the fourth profile Britain's royal family will have set up on a social networking site, having established a channel on video-sharing site YouTube in 2007, a profile on microblogging service Twitter in 2009 and an official photostream on photo-sharing site Flickr earlier this year. Before you rush off to friend -- or, even more boldly, poke -- your favorite queen or heir to the throne, note that it's only an official Page that will go live Monday morning, rather than individual profiles for each member of the monarchy. It's official: the British Monarchy has decided to join Facebook.
