An advocate for veterans, Jackson said he's traveled to Albany numerous times after former New York City Mayor David Dinkins fought to amend a law that would have ended up affecting the businesses of disabled street vendors. Spokesman Josh Schwerin for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not directly comment on Jackson's potential run, but stated that "New York voters are looking for a representative who will fight for middle class jobs and protect seniors from the devastating cuts to Medicare being pushed by Congresswoman Hayworth and Washington Republicans." Duane Jackson, a registered Democrat and Vietnam veteran, told CNN Wednesday he plans to face off against Republican Representative Nan Hayworth in New York's 19th district in the November election. National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Nat Sillin said the potential race between Jackson and the other Democratic candidates running against him will make "great theater for political junkies" as they vie to be the most liberal candidate. In May, 2010, Jackson and another vendor noticed black smoke coming out of a Nissan Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle illegally parked in a bus lane in Times Square, with the keys still in the ignition.
