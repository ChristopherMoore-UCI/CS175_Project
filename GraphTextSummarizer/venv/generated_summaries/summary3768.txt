-- A Florida court technician has the job of blurring Justin Bieber's private parts on jail video before you can see it. It's part of several hours of video captured by surveillance cameras inside the Miami Beach Police Department's jail, where Bieber was held after his arrest on DUI charges on January 23. Several photographs taken by police of Bieber showing his tattoos were given to the media Tuesday. Miami-Dade County Judge William Altfield rejected arguments from Bieber's lawyer that the video should be kept private. Video showing Bieber doing push-ups in a jail cell and attempting a sobriety test in a hallway were released last month.
