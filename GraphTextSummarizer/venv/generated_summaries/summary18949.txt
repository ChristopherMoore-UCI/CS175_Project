This constitution will determine the balance of powers between the executive branch and legislative branches. This new phase will be defined by a precarious balancing act between different power centers, each with its own distinct sources of legitimacy. On Monday and Tuesday, millions of Egyptians spent hours in long, looping lines, waiting to cast ballots in the country's first elections since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. The ruling military council is hoping for a weak Parliament; Egypt's political parties, however, may have other plans. This struggle for power will be just as meaningful -- and likely much more contentious -- than the elections that preceded it.
