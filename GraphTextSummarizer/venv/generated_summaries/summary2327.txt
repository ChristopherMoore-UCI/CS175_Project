The work by artist Brett Murray was removed from public show after it was defaced by protesters last week amid a storm of protests and condemnation, the South African Broadcasting Corporation said. The announcement was made by ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu at Johannesburg's Goodman Gallery, where the controversial portrait was initially displayed. -- South Africa's ruling African National Congress said Wednesday the party would drop the lawsuit it filed over a portrait of President Jacob Zuma that shows his genitals. Speaking alongside Goodman Gallery director Liza Essers, Mthembu expressed a wish for unity. A statement on the ANC website Wednesday said: "The pain and the hurt of the past two weeks caused by the Spear portrait as expressed above is now fully appreciated by the Goodman Gallery and the Artist, Brett Murray.
