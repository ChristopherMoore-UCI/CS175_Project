The majority of tables at the Monaco event are reserved for Billionaire Club members and returning guests with 10% held back for what Briatore describes as "last-minute friends. "Billionaires and the ultra-wealthy cross the globe like migratory birds and Monaco is one of the key events," David Friedman, president of wealth intelligence firm Wealth-X, explained to CNN. The club, presided over by former Benetton and Renault team boss Flavio Briatore, is designed to serve up a neat cocktail of all that the Monte Carlo race weekend has come to represent -- racing, glamor, hedonism and wealth. After attending Sunday's royal grand prix gala dinner, hosted by Monaco's Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene, Rosberg, who was raised in Monaco, might have opted to head home to his Monte Carlo pad for an early night. For the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix, he launched Twiga Monte Carlo, a lounge bar, club and restaurant, with an open door policy and free entry to most of its events.
