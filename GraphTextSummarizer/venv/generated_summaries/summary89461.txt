-- A superb goal from Mesut Ozil on the hour mark saw Germany go through to the last 16 of the World Cup with a 1-0 win over Ghana at Soccer City on Wednesday night. In the first half, Andre Ayew looked set to score as he burst into the Germany penalty area, but he took one touch too many, then Ozil was one-on-one with Richard Kingson, but was denied. They are the first African team into the the knockout stages and will face Group C winners the United States on Saturday in Rustenberg. The victory also secures Germany's passage as Group D winners and they will now play England on Sunday in Bloemfontien for a place in the quarterfinals. Two goals in four minutes midway through the second half from Everton midfelder Tim Cahill and substitute Brett Holman gave Australia hope they they could also qualify.
