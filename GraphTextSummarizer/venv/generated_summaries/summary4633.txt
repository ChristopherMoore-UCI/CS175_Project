The popularity of apps like Messenger and WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased in February, are helping change the rules for texting. "As we've said, our goal is to focus development efforts on making Messenger the best mobile messaging experience possible and avoid the confusion of having separate Facebook mobile messaging experiences," a Facebook spokeswoman said Tuesday in a written statement. Wireless plans that charge for texting are becoming a thing of the past in the United States, though they remain the norm in places like India, South America and Africa, where WhatsApp has become a popular, nearly free alternative. In November, after Facebook launched Messenger 3.0, the company discontinued messaging in the core Facebook app for people who already had Messenger. Facebook says that, for the next few days, it will be notifying people that if they want to continue sending mobile message, they'll need to download the Messenger app.
