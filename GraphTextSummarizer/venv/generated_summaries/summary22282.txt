In the old days of television or desktop Internet advertising, advertising was like a painting that we could all admire without seeing ourselves. It was no surprise, therefore, that one of the major themes his weekend at Stream, the annual WPP "unconference" about digital advertising and marketing, was the growing importance of mobile. So, while - to borrow some words of wisdom from WPP's Martin Sorrell - "we don't know the answer" to how exactly the small screen revolution will change advertising, mobile probably won't radically alter the size of the industry. And as Amy Gershkoff, the Global Director of Analytics at the PR agency Burston-Marsteller, told me, mobile will only successfully monetized when the advertising industry understand that mobile isn't just a smaller screen version of traditional Internet media. No event like Stream would, of course, be complete without the radical optimists -- the "Unlocking $50 billion in digital brand spend" crowd - who believe that mobile will trigger a unique cornucopia of opportunities for the advertising industry.
