Though breaking this grip has proved a difficult task in most MLS expansions across America, Seattle is one of the few towns where the tide for the affection of the city's sports fans seems to be turning. The NASL, which collapsed in 1984, favored big names and an adaptation of the rules, while the MLS has tried to supplement home-grown talent with foreign stars such as David Beckham, capable of taking the game's reach to more fans. The Sounders will be absent from Sunday's MLS Cup final, held at Qwest Field, but Seattle's soccer fans will surely echo Schmid's sentiment. Seattle first put itself forward as an MLS franchise at the league's inception in 1994 and, after several attempts, in 2007 the city was awarded a team thanks to the combined efforts of high-profile backers. Despite this there is a confidence that MLS in Seattle is advancing well.
