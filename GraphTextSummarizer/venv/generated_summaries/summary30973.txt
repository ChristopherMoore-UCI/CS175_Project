McCain apparently is making a concerted effort to reach out to former supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton who may be unhappy with the choice of Sen. Barack Obama as the Democratic nominee. Watch Palin say she's honored to be picked Â» Palin is a first-term governor who unseated incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006 and went on to defeat former Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, in the general election. Democratic leaders, including the party's presidential nominee Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, also issued mixed reactions to Palin's announcement. While their policies would take America in the wrong direction, Gov. Palin will add an important new voice to the debate," Clinton said.
