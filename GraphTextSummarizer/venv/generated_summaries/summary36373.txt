Two women, dressed in skimpy, "sexy" police officer costumes, allegedly showed up at a prison in Brazil's interior Mato Grosso state on Thursday, according to local media reports. A spokesman for the Justice Secretariat of Mato Grosso, which oversees prisons, confirmed to CNN that officials found bottles of spiked whiskey and a pair of provocative, police-themed costumes next to the handcuffed guards, who were passed out. The women talked guards into letting them inside and seduced them, spiking their drinks in the process, according to reports. "We assume that is what the women were wearing when they seduced the guards," spokesman Willian Fidelis said. The spokesman said he did not know who was behind the prison break, saying that civil police were handling the investigation.
