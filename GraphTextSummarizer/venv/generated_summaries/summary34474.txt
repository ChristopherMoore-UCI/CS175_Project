'Hollywood' raid In January 2012, New Zealand police, acting in conjunction with the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice, launched a Hollywood-worthy raid on the sprawling property Dotcom was leasing in Auckland, New Zealand. "I apologise to Mr Dotcom, I apologise to New Zealanders because every New Zealander that sits within the category of having permanent residency or is a New Zealand citizen is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the GCSB, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him," Key said. Where's the guy who says "You've been punk'd?" Anti-establishment The 2012 raid on Dotcom's property set off a wave of legal proceedings, pitting the entrepreneur against New Zealand authorities, who had responded to a U.S. call for help to find the alleged fugitive. Dotcom: Why New Zealand is a slave to U.S. interests The Internet Party Earlier this year, Dotcom launched his own political party, the Internet Party, which aims to "modernize New Zealand, give the Internet generation a voice in politics, become a leader in the Internet economy and fight for Internet Freedom," he said.
