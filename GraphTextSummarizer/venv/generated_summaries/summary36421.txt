-- LeBron James and Dwyane Wade combined for 53 points to lead the defending NBA champion Miami Heat back to the finals with a 99-76 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night. Last year, the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win their second NBA championship. The Heat will face the well-rested San Antonio Spurs, who swept the Memphis Grizzlies four games to none, and haven't played since May 27. Kidd, a 10-time all-star, helped Dallas win its first NBA title in 2011. The NBA Finals begin Thursday in Miami.
