Promposals can add to the pressure, becoming almost as important as prom itself and raising expectations for young men and women, especially when they get posted on social media for all to see. "As promposals have become more elaborate and public, so, too, does the potential for increased humiliation and social pressure," said Jarrod Chin, director of training and curriculum of Northeastern University Sport in Society, a nationwide youth mentoring program that focuses on violence prevention and healthy relationships. Further raising the stakes, though, is the "necessity" of capturing the event as a picture or video so it can be shared on social media, said Ohio State University freshman Melinda Vercollone, whose 2013 promposal came in the form of a "prom" sign underneath the hood of a friend's car. Friends in relationships have staged promposals for the fun of it. The pressure to couple up Rodgers, the suburban Philadelphia teen, has nothing against promposals, especially among friends and couples.
