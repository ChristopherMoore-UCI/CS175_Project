The Massachusetts twentysomethings got married in October and spent five days volunteering at an orphanage in southern Thailand before exploring Bangkok, northern Thailand and Cambodia. " The two are examples of what some call "honeyteers" --Â­ newlyweds whose honeymoons double as volunteer projects. There, they taught English and French to teenagers in a boys' home through a Cross-Cultural Solutions volunteer program. -- It's common for newlyweds to honeymoon abroad. The next group of volunteers moves the project forward.
