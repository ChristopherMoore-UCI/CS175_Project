They recorded Koshik repeating certain words his keeper said and then played them for native Korean speakers to see, if they were recognizable. Koshik, a 22-year-old Asian elephant has stunned experts and his keepers at Everland Zoo near Seoul by imitating human speech. The researchers believe Koshik may have learned certain words out of necessity "to cement social bonds." She traveled with fellow expert Dr. Daniel Mietchen to South Korea in 2010 to test the elephant's ability. Koshik can say the Korean words for "hello," "sit down," "no," "lie down" and "good."
