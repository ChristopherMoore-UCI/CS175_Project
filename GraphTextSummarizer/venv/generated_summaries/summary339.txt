Warner Bros. and DC Comics, the publisher of "Superman" titles, are both units of Time Warner, CNN's parent company. "Superman and Batman together on the big screen is a dream come true for DC (Comics) fans everywhere," said Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment. "Man of Steel" director Zack Snyder will direct the film, and current Superman Henry Cavill will star, Warner Bros. said. Warner Bros. Pictures announced Saturday at Comic-Con that Superman will pair with his fellow Justice League hero Batman in the upcoming yet-to-be-named film, expected to begin production in 2014. Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne and Diane Lane also return for the new film, Warner Bros. said.
