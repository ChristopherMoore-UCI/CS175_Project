But in the exchange, Congress acts as a small business and insurers view it more by individual health needs, charging different premiums for higher-risk staff, like older employees. Example: Under one BlueCross BlueShield plan available to congressional staff, the premium for a 20-year-old is $262.48 a month, versus $842.41 a month for a 60-year-old. More than 100 plans in total are offered to congressional staff. Of course it also means lower relative premiums for younger workers. It was one of many sharp moments of concern at the two information sessions set up by House administrators Thursday.
