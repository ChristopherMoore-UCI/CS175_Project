The first officer was Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, who with his partner engaged the male and female suspects in a Motel 6 parking lot in Sacramento, said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. Before heading to Placer County, one of the suspects shot a motorist in the head while the pair tried to hijack his car, Jones said. The suspects fled to nearby Placer County, where two deputies were shot, authorities said. KCRA identified the male suspect as 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez, citing Placer County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Dena Erwin. Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner said it was "an incredibly difficult day" as he identified the deceased deputy as 42-year-old Michael David Davis Jr., who had served in law enforcement since 1996 -- the last 10 years as a homicide investigator.
