-- The Peace Corps is slashing operations in Honduras and scaling back in El Salvador and Guatemala, citing security concerns in a region beset by violence linked to the lucrative drug trade. "The safety and security of all Peace Corps volunteers is the agency's highest priority," said Peace Corps Director Aaron S. Williams. In a similar but less severe move, the Peace Corps canceled its January training classes for new volunteers in El Salvador and Guatemala. They are all scheduled to come home early next year on administrative leave, and the Peace Corps "will review the safety and security climate in Honduras before continuing with volunteer operations," the agency said in a statement issued this week. Drug cartels use the region as a strategic way station between South America, where most of the world's coca is grown, and North America, a major cocaine market.
