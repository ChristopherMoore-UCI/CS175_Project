-- U.S. and Iraqi negotiators have agreed on a draft of a status-of-forces agreement authorizing U.S. troop presence in Iraq A U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires December 31, and U.S. officials are examining "contingencies" in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status-of-forces deal to the country's various factions, a senior U.S. official said earlier this week. The U.S. wants troops in Iraq to be immune from Iraqi law. The United States' insistence that its troops and contractors remain immune from Iraqi law has been a key obstacle to reaching an agreement, U.S. and Iraqi officials have said. Meanwhile, Iraq's Political Committee on National Security is also reviewing the draft, Morrell said, citing Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh.
