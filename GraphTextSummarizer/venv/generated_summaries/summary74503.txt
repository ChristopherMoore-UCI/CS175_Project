-- Embattled Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker, an anti-union darling of the tea party and other fiscal conservatives, faces off Tuesday against Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett in a high-stakes recall election that politicos say could foreshadow the contentious November general contest. Meet Scott Walker: From the archives, watch Gov. Walker in 2011 make his case: "we don't have any more money.' Unions and their supporters counter that collective bargaining has helped ensure safe working conditions, fair treatment and wages and adequate health care. The deeply polarized Wisconsin recall race also pits Democrats and their Big Labor allies against Republicans and impassioned tea party supporters in a multi-million dollar showdown that's drawn such political stars as former President Bill Clinton and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, into the fray. Recall vote is judgment day for Wisconsin governor The fight to recall Walker after only an 18-month tenure in office speaks to some in the blue-leaning state's frustration over Republican-led efforts to keep unions in check.
