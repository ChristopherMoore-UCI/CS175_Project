Milwaukee County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to General Mitchell International Airport last week after an AirTran Airways manager complained that he saw a maintenance worker take wine bottles from a plane and put them in his jacket pocket. -- Hungry air travelers know that all those onboard snacks and spirits reserved for premium-class passengers or available only for a fee look mighty tempting, but airport workers apparently give them a second look as well. The worker was identified as Jesse Repetti, 28, an employee with PrimeFlight Aviation Services who was responsible for cleaning the plane, according to a complaint filed in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. When they arrived, the deputies found Repetti in a jetway, eating a bag of chips, "which belonged to AirTran," the court papers say. When the deputies searched Repetti, they found a small bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, a small bottle of Chardonnay, three small bottles of whiskey, three small bottles of rum, a can of beer, two bags of chips and two bags of pretzels.
