The Statue of Liberty will be open for the next two years, then closed again for "work on a long-term solution that will improve safety and security permanently," according to the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Statue of Liberty welcomes visitors, immigrants, and returning Americans. "We are once again inviting the public to celebrate our great nation and the hope and opportunity it symbolizes by climbing to Lady Liberty's crown for a unique view of New York Harbor, where the forebears of millions of American families first saw the world," he said in a statement. The measures include raising the handrails on the spiral staircase and stationing rangers throughout the Statue to help visitors.
