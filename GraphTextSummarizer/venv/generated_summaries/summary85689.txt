Eva Rausing had struggled with drug addiction for years, an acquaintance said. Eva Rausing gave more than 500,000 pounds ($778,000) to Mentor, said the charity, which runs programs "to protect children from alcohol and drugs. "It's very clear to us Eva had her own problems with drugs and drugs misuse," the head of an anti-drug organization told CNN Wednesday. She knew how hard it was to get off drugs once you are on drugs," said Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Mentor. Her husband is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family's connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval.
