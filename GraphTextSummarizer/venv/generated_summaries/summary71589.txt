The Iranian officials should know that the activities of Mourning Mothers will not stop until their legitimate grievances are properly addressed." Mourning Mothers was formed after the violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrators following the disputed June 12 presidential vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Since then, opposition activists and mothers whose children have disappeared or have been executed or detained have also joined the group. The group, formed by women whose children have been killed in recent anti-government protests, gathers every weekend at the park to call attention to the deaths. "No culture permits such violence to be unleashed against mothers," Ghaemi said in a news release posted on the campaign's Web site. Among its members is the mother of 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan, whose chilling death in post-election protests was caught on video and became a powerful symbol for the opposition.
