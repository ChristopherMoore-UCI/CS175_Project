"If you would like to speak to Sir Alex about recent football results we here at GMP Manchester North can only suggest you try ringing Manchester United FC directly as you will probably (not definitely) have a much better chance of getting through to him there rather than ringing the police." "A man from the Crumpsall area of North Manchester rang 999 in a drunken state demanding to speak to Sir Alex Ferguson about last night's result," read a GMP statement posted on its Facebook page. In the case of one disgruntled Manchester United his first port of call was to British police demanding to speak with the team's former manager Alex Ferguson. The desperate plea was revealed on Wednesday by Great Manchester Police (GMP), who advised against such calls being made to the emergency services. GMP suggested that any fan wishing to get hold of Ferguson, who has frequently attended United matches since retiring in May, should contact the club directly.
