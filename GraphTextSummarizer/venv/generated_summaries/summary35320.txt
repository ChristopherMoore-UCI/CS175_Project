Sherry Fletcher, a spokeswoman for the city of Stillwater, said no one else was injured in the shooting at Stillwater Junior High School. Stillwater school Superintendent Ann Caine said there was nothing in school computer records to indicate the teenager had been bullied. Stillwater is about 70 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. Other students likely witnessed the shooting, which was in a hallway near lockers and classrooms, Dickerson said. -- A 13-year-old student died of a self-inflicted gun shot wound Wednesday morning at a junior high school in Stillwater, Oklahoma
