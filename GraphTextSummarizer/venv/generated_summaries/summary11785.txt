Frustrated by his inability to move around as freely as he liked, DaSilva developed AXS Map â€” a crowdsourcing platform that allows people around the world to rate businesses for accessibility and, most important, to share that information. AXS Map isn't intended to rate the extent to which a structure is ADA-compliant; it simply serves as a tool for people with mobility issues to find out which businesses in their community are actually accessible, and to what degree. A filmmaker with multiple sclerosis hopes an app he developed will help fellow wheelchair users make cities like New York more accessible. Disabled kids get in the game Instead of leaving the ratings for AXS Map up to specialists, DaSilva wanted members of the disabled community to inform and empower themselves, with the help of friends, family and neighbors, by pooling their evaluations of how accessible facilities really are. DaSilva and his wife Alice Cook, whom he met while developing the product, have started hosting Mapping Days across the U.S., bringing together volunteers from the community to map entire neighborhoods in AXS Map.
