Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, argued earlier Tuesday that removing non-U.S. citizens from lists of registered voters was a legal necessity. -- The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to stop the state of Florida from purging voters from registration rolls. Using information from Florida's Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the state identified more than 100,000 names of non-eligible voters that could potentially be on the lists illegally. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Florida program clearly violated voter registration laws. Appearing on CNN's "Starting Point," Scott said the state had identified "almost 100 individuals" who had registered to vote but weren't U.S. citizens.
