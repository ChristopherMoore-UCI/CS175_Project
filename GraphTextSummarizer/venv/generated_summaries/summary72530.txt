All the talk beforehand was of Milan midfielder David Beckham's return to Old Trafford for the first time since United sold him to Real Madrid in 2003. Park Ji-sung and Darren Fletcher were also on target for the English Premier League champions as United secured a convincing 7-2 aggregate success. -- In-form England striker Wayne Rooney scored the opening two goals as Manchester United crushed AC Milan 4-0 to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League. However, Milan were already 3-0 behind when Beckham was introduced by Milan coach Leonardo and, despite some nice touches and a couple of dangerous crosses, was powerless to help Milan back into the match. The opener came in the 13th minute when Rooney rose between two Milan defenders to head home a Gary Neville right-wing cross.
