-- A new, high-definition Kindle with a lighting system and a bigger Kindle Fire tablet topped the list of gadgets rolled out by Amazon on Thursday at a splashy event in an aircraft hangar. Bezos also rolled out new Kindle Fires: a new version of the current tablet, which he says is 40 percent faster and has a longer battery life; and two sizes of a fancier Kindle Fire HD.

Bezos has called the original Kindle Fire Amazon's most successful product launch and, in a press release last week, said it accounts for 22% of tablet sales in the United States. The original style, non-touchscreen Kindle also will remain available, with its price dropping to $69 for the ad-supported version.
