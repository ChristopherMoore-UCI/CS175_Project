-- With a daring move in the last few laps, Tony Kanaan of Brazil passed American Ryan Hunter-Reay and won the 97th Indianapolis 500 under a yellow caution flag. It was the second of two caution flags precipitated by crashes in the final eight laps of the 200-lap, 500-mile race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Kanaan was a sentimental favorite after several near-misses in his 11 previous Indy 500s. No driver is allowed to pass another car while the caution flag is posted, so at that point, to win, all Kanaan needed to do was finish without crashing. "I got a little bit of luck today," Kanaan said in a post-race interview.
