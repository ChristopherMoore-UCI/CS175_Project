He had an extensive criminal record, including at least 19 arrests, a two-year prison term and several stints in Georgia jails, said New York Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce. The families of police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos are "suffering unspeakable pain," New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. The mother of the man who killed two New York police officers has spoken out, apologizing for the horror her son Ismaaiyl Brinsley caused before taking his own life. " Lucy Ramos, aunt of Rafael Ramos, thanked "all those who have shared their sympathy and support." "They kept releasing him into the streets," Jalaa'a Brinsley said, "so isn't that a problem that the justice system should be asking, not us?" Authorities are investigating how Brinsley got the gun he used in the attack.
