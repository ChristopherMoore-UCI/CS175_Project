For about a year, the masked Jones has patrolled the streets of Seattle, often with a film crew in tow, looking for crime and generating international headlines. "He inserted himself and sprayed them with pepper spray," Seattle Police spokesman Mark Jamieson told CNN. Tangen said Jones was shoved but was not seriously hurt and plans to keep fighting crime despite his run-in with police. Jamieson said it is unclear how many -- if any -- crimes Jones has assisted police with. The spokesman said Jones was wearing his costume but police had taken away his mask.
