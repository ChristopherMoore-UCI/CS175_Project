" Els, another of Leadbetter's success stories, is also helping to teach young players in his native South Africa. "Most people grip the club too much in the palm of the hand, which creates tremendous tension and doesn't allow the wrist to work correctly," says Leadbetter, who helped Nick Faldo go from a nearly man to the winner of six major titles between 1987-1996. Leadbetter's Florida-based academy, with 36 holes designed by former client Norman, has become the headquarters for a worldwide empire located in 13 countries including Spain and China. Their success with major champions such as Faldo, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Greg Norman, Darren Clarke, Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Louis Oosthuizen has helped them launch golf schools around the globe. They might not always be cheap, but golf academies offer training techniques that have taken the likes of Tiger Woods, Lee Westwood and Ernie Els to the top of the tree.
