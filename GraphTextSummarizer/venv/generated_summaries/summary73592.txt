In statements to the media and on his Web site, South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster has accused Craigslist's operators of not doing enough to eliminate ads soliciting prostitution in accordance with an agreement struck last November with 40 states attorney generals. Earlier this month, McMaster sent a letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster accusing the site of failing to "install sufficient safeguards" to prevent it from being used "as a vehicle to advertise or solicit prostitution." South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster has threatened criminal action against Craigslist. Craigslist's says that since November, the San Francisco, California-based company has undertaken significant good faith measures to cut back on prostitution-related ads, accounting for an 80 percent reduction in ads in its erotic services subcategory in U.S. cities. The lawsuit contends that, because the site relies on posters for content, McMaster's threats leave Craigslist with no choice other than to shut down its South Carolina section or face criminal prosecution.
