Much of this change is driven by good news -- people's desires for greater freedom and autonomy, new information technologies, etc. The United States remains economically vibrant, with a dynamic society, new technologies that dominate the world, and new sources of energy that will power it for a few generations. There are many pieces of bad news coming out of that continent -- from Ebola to Boko Haram -- but there is also good news, growing economies, a surging middle class. But again, this is a sign of people searching for greater connections with the civilized world. I'm not saying that all is well in the world -- I'm really suggesting that we are in the midst of great global change.
