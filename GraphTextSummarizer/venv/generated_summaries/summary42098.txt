"I just thought I'm going to travel around the country." After turning up at New Delhi railway station, Kher then discovered she was too afraid to travel the country alone. " Kher wanted to travel when she graduated and said she chose between New York and New Delhi with a toss of a coin. In the past year, she has had solo exhibitions in London, New York, Hong Kong and New Delhi. " Kher's solo show, "Bind the dream state to your waking life," will be at Nature Morte, New Delhi, until February 16. When did you make the work?'" In 2007, Kher had her first solo exhibition at a major international gallery, Jack Shainman Gallery in New York.
