B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, was concerned that Israeli media never mentioned the names of the Palestinian victims of Israel's offensive. Failing to make a distinction between the value of Israeli and Palestinian blood is apparently enough to contravene the values of Israeli academia and cause a public scandal in Israel in 2014. Israel likes to describe itself as "the only democracy in the Middle East," but it's really only a democracy for its Jewish citizens who are quick to fall in line with the mainstream every time Israeli tanks roll across the border. I came to this southern Israeli town, not far from Gaza, to chronicle the fear spreading throughout Israeli communities near the border. The real tale to be told is of the unprecedented cracks in Israeli democracy that have been revealed in just one month of conflict.
