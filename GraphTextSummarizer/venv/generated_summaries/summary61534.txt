Days later, Israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by Palestinians to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. In October, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. -- More than a week earlier, attackers stabbed one Israeli soldier to death in Tel Aviv and three more Israelis near a West Bank settlement, the IDF said. And, it said, in light of the bus attack, U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses throughout Israel and the West Bank. A teenage Palestinian girl with a knife stabbed an Israeli man in the West Bank, Israeli police said.
