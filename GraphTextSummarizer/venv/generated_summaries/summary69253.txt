Woods was criticized by some players after making his first statement admitting marital infidelities during the World Match Play tournament in Arizona after a controversy that emerged just before the Chevron World Challenge event last December. -- Veteran golfer Jim Furyk insists that the timing of Tiger Woods' headline-grabbing post-sex scandal interviews on Sunday did not take the gloss off his first U.S. PGA Tour victory since 2007. But Furyk was just relieved to have claimed his first victory on the world's premier golf circuit since the Canadian Open two and a half years ago. The 39-year-old was still playing out the final hole of the Transitions Championship in Florida when his fellow American was broadcast on two television channels in his first comments since announcing that he will return to action at the Masters next month. "Shoot, no-one was watching me then," he quipped on the PGA Tour Web site after completing a one-shot victory over Korea's K.J. Choi at Palm Harbor's Innisbrook course in Tampa Bay following a four-hour delay caused by a thunderstorm.
