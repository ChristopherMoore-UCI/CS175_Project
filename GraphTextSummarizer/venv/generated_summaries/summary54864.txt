The oceans do this at a range of scales, and it wouldn't surprise me if this is another one of those phenomena where water convects because of a subtle change in temperature," said Timothy Creyts, a glaciologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. "There are lots of processes in nature that involve water and convection -- sometimes salt and fresh water, sometimes cold and warm water, sometimes a bit of both. Freeze and thaw cycles common at this time of year cause warm water to rise from the bottom of the pond, disrupting ice formation because of the water's temperature and motion. Gervase posted a photograph of the pond on Facebook, with a link to CNN affiliate WGRZ's Facebook page, and it received hundreds of comments speculating about what caused the phenomenon. Pond circles are Mother Nature's artwork," Gervase said.
