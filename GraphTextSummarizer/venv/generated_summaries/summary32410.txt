" The agency cited safety issues at the production platform where the explosion occurred, at facilities in the South Marsh Island area in the Gulf of Mexico, and in an October 2011 incident in which "Black Elk operations had used an acid-based chemical for treating a well that resulted in the hospitalization of six workers. The embassy estimates there are more than 160 welders, fitters, scaffolders and riggers who were hired in the Philippines to work at offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. " "Black Elk has repeatedly failed to operate in a manner that is consistent with federal regulations," said James A. Watson, director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The embassy said Philippines citizen Ellroy Corporal also died from the incident, and Jerome Malagapo, another worker from the Philippines, has not been found. Avelino L. Tajonera died early Friday from injuries sustained in the November 16 explosion and fire on the Black Elk production platform off Louisiana, said Elmer Cato, consul at the Philippines Embassy in Washington.
