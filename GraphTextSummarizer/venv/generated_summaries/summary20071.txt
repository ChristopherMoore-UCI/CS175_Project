As part of their Hawaiian legacy, Matt and his extended family of cousins (including Cousin Hugh, Cousin Ralph, Cousin Hal, Cousin Milo, Cousin Stan, Cousin Wink, Cousin Six, Cousin Dave and Cousin Connie) own the largest remaining tract of pristine land on Kauai, which is being held in a trust. In the opening voiceover, Matt King (Clooney) attempts to dispel the idea of Hawaii as a paradise, pointing out that Hawaiians get cancer and deal with heartaches, homelessness and every other modern problem that the rest of the world has. Matt's wife, Elizabeth, is the victim of a boating accident, rendering her comatose, and he suddenly finds himself in charge of 10-year-old Scotty (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). While he has committed to living modestly ("give your kids enough money so that they can do something but not enough so that they can do nothing" is one of his mottos), Matt is as close to Hawaiian royalty as a (mostly) white man can get. However, time is running out on said trust, and Matt must decide what to do with it.
