Whittier, in his poem, wrote of the cessation of the day of darkness: "And, shore-ward, o'er the waters gleamed, From crest to crest, a line of light, Such as of old, with solemn awe, The fishers by Gennesaret saw. . . . But consider what happens when the power goes out -- when, without warning, we lose artificial light. Imagine, in the middle of a day in May, every bit of light suddenly and inexplicably disappearing from your world. Would we really be calm and unconcerned if, just as suddenly, real light -- the sun's light -- without notice went away? Or would our cherished communications tools spread rumors of conspiracies and attacks and impending doom?
