A second U.S. military official tells CNN that the US is seeing the Haqqanis increasingly turn to foreign fighters they bring into Afghanistan. Benjamin A. Stevenson, 36, was on his 10th tour of duty in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq when he was killed Thursday in a remote area of eastern Afghanistan. The camp they attacked and the fighters there were part of the so-called Haqqanni network, which is responsible for many recent attacks in Afghanistan and is closely tied to al Qaeda. Stevenson was part of a U.S. and Afghan special operations mission that went in to attack the area in Afghanistan's Paktika province. That single piece of information is a rare glimpse into the world of U.S. special operations forces who have done more tours than most in the last decade.
