There have been complaints from teams and drivers, with an official investigation also underway over a development test, while the latest twist involves Pirelli putting its plan on hold to introduce new race tires at next month's Canadian Grand Prix. Pirelli wants to introduce new tires that are not prone to dangerous delaminations as quickly as possible. A statement by the Italian manufacturer explained: "The Formula One teams will have an opportunity to test the new range of Pirelli tires during free practice at the Canadian Grand Prix, while the tires used for the actual race will remain in their original 2013 specification. "Following feedback from the teams and drivers, the new specification of tire is then set to be introduced from the British Grand Prix at the end of June, and will remain in place until the end of the year. Even prior to Monaco, tires had already been drawing plenty of heat.
