But there was to be no touchdown for Welker on English soil as his 25-1 shot -- named Undrafted -- ridden by jockey Frankie Dettori, finished fourth behind the winner and favorite Slade Power. A veteran of three Super Bowls, the 33-year-old wide receiver broke off from pre-season training to attend the Group One Darley July Cup at Newmarket -- an hour east of London -- even taking up bookmaker Paddy Power on a Â£5,000 ($8,560) Twitter charity bet. While horse racing and soccer have enjoyed a close relationship in some countries -- England internationals Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney have snapped up their own racehorses -- the bonds are less common in U.S. sport. The NFL may take over Wembley Stadium -- England's spiritual home of soccer -- every September and October but it was a racecourse that played host to one of gridiron's biggest star's Saturday as Denver Broncos Wes Welker flew in to cheer on his racehorse. "I really enjoy the racing and training aspect because they are very similar to football players," Welker told Britain's Guardian newspaper Friday.
