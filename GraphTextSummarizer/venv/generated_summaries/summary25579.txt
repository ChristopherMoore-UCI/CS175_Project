"There's been no evidence in this state -- and I'm not aware of any in the country -- that any demonstrably innocent person has been put to death," said Tommy Floyd, chairman of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia. Death penalty opponents have argued that if inmates are not given enough anesthetic, they could be conscious enough to suffer excruciating pain without being able to express it because of the paralyzer. "The application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice [Clarence] Thomas and by him referred to the court is denied," the court said. Georgia became the first state to resume executions since the court validated the lethal injection process last month with a ruling in a Kentucky case. They pointed to Friday's release in North Carolina of Levan "Bo" Jones, an African-American inmate who spent 14 years on death row before a judge said the evidence was faulty and overturned his murder conviction.
