The document lays out the singular challenge for law enforcement presented by lone wolves: "Attacks by lone offenders -- which by definition lack co-conspirators, and therefore provide fewer opportunities for detection -- may be more difficult for law enforcement and homeland security authorities to disrupt. -- U.S. officials warn the threat posed by a lone gunman or a group with small arms is a serious concern to law enforcement. The bulletin also warns terrorist groups overseas "have long favored small unit assault tactics, in which small teams of operatives storm a target using small arms to defeat security." The document says law enforcement found bomb-making materials in Abdo's hotel room but law enforcement was alerted in time to avert an attack thanks to a warning from a gun store employee who found Abdo's behavior suspicious. The memo, which was obtained by CNN, says Breivik "is believed to have acted alone and used legal methods to procure the vast majority of materials and weapons needed for his operation, successfully avoiding law enforcement suspicion."
