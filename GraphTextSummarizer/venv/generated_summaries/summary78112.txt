-- Nancy Reagan, wife of the late President Ronald Reagan, is hospitalized in California after suffering a broken pelvis, according to spokeswoman Joanne Drake. Reagan, 87, is in the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Drake said in a written statement Wednesday. The former first lady fell last week at her home, Drake said, but admitted herself to the hospital only after experiencing "persistent pain." Since his death, Nancy Reagan has remained involved with the national Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute in Chicago, Illinois. Reagan will remain hospitalized for a few days until "doctors are satisfied with her progress," Drake said.
