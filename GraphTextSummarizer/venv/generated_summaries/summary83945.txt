The floods more than a decade ago destroyed highways and bridges, and prompted fears that land mines left over from a civil war may have shifted. The United Nations warned that the amount is expected to go up as assessment teams release more information. In 2000, the southern African nation suffered devastating floods that killed at least 700 people and displaced millions. Tens of thousands fleeing affected areas remain stranded without food and water as fears of a humanitarian crisis grow. "In Chokwe, one of the hardest hit districts -- the normally vibrant streets now lie under water --all business brought to a standstill and social services shut down," the United Nations said.
