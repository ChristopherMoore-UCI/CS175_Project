Kissinger calls Thatcher a "great lady" The songs that spewed from this disgust at Thatcher's policies and personality formed a strand of the decade's best music, according to Lynskey, who says all the best music has been political in some way. "That song was our political reflection on the situation in the 1980s, which wasn't good, and that Thatcher's own policies had helped create. We did produce good designers, regardless of Thatcher." The scene mocks Thatcher's Cabinet colleagues as being weak and ineffectual, and while Law admits he was worried about glorifying Thatcher, he said he tried to be fair to both sides. "A lot of musicians were happy to put their opinions into song, for example us, Elvis Costello and The Beat, a trend that hasn't happened since the time of Thatcher.
