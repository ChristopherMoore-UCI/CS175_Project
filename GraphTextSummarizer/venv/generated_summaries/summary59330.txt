Is Beijing prepared to sacrifice Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung? Hong Kong protesters have extracted concessions from the Beijing leadership in the past. As a last resort, Beijing could deploy People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops on the streets of Hong Kong, said Lam. "The next three years could then be a test case for what a more independent-minded Hong Kong leader might mean for the island's relations with the mainland and provide guidance for further revisions to Beijing's current limited conception of universal suffrage," she wrote in a blog. He echoed previous statements released through state media, calling the protests "illegal acts" but stressing that Beijing believes Hong Kong has the capability to handle the situation.
