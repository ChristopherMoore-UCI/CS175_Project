" Chavanel came home almost four minutes clear of the bunch to take a lead of two minutes and 57 seconds into Tuesday's third stage from Wanze across the border to Arenberg Porte du Hainaut in France. -- Seven-time champion Lance Armstrong reflected ruefully on Monday's incident-packed second stage of the Tour de France, which saw Sylvain Chavanel claim the first yellow jersey of his career following a spate of crashes. The Quick Step rider was the last remaining member of an eight-man breakaway that he led at the 10-kilometer mark, with the 123-strong peloton coming home together after refusing to race further following another day of crashes in difficult conditions. Saxo Bank's brothers Andy and Franck Schleck both went down on the Stockeu climb -- also part of the Liege classic where Chavanel cracked his skull in April. Italian rider Alessandro Petacchi, who won a similarly crash-hit stage one on Sunday, was 13:37 adrift of Chavanel after finishing 157th.
