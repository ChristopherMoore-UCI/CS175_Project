Human rights groups say thousands of Brotherhood members are in jail awaiting trial; nearly 200 more have been sentenced to death. In the wake of the military takeover in Egypt, Qatar had become a sanctuary for Egyptian Brotherhood leaders. As Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste was flying to freedom Sunday after 400 days in jail, the man in charge of Egypt was making a long speech lamenting his country's many problems. Among Qatar's allies was the leader of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Morsi, who became President in June 2012 but was ousted by al-Sisi a year later. And as harrowing as the experience of the three Al Jazeera journalists has been, others have suffered worse fates, according to human rights groups.
