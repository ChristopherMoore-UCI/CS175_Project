Bjorling -- who is travelling to Shanghai this fall to promote Swedish fashion -- believes exports can be doubled by 2015, particularly if the industry can tap emerging markets. Designer and owner Marlene "Mayla" Abraham says she sold dresses to top stores in Tokyo, San Francisco and New York before branching out into other Scandinavian countries, as she was able to tap international interest in Swedish design. So what is the secret formula behind the popularity of Swedish fashion? "I think this was a perfect match for the world of blogging since it promotes individuality and helped Sweden become a mini phenomenon in fashion," Rodic says. High end brands are also thriving, with labels such as Mayla securing customers such as Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria.
