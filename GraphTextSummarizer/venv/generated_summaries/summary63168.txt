Robocalls from political campaigns or get-out-the-vote efforts are allowed (and legal) under the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule, as well as under most state robocall laws (except when made to cell phone numbers and a few other exceptions). So it's especially timely that on Thursday the U.S. Federal Trade Commission held a Robocall Summit to "explore innovations designed to trace robocalls, prevent wrongdoers from faking caller ID data, and stop unwanted calls. The FTC Robocall Challenge challenges the public to suggest plans to block illegal robocalls on landlines and mobile phones. To address the robocall problem, the FTC announced a contest at the Summit to find technological ways to curb illegal robocalls. Also, a large proportion of consumer phone spam complaints cannot be investigated because of evasion measures such as "spoofing" -- or hiding -- the originating phone number or caller ID information.
