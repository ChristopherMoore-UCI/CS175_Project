-- Australian Sam Stosur continued her giant-killing habit at the French Open by beating top seed Serena Williams to book a place in the final four. With the match locked at 6-6 Stosur rediscovered her blistering form, and fired two winners past Williams to secure a crucial break of serve. The match went with serve in the opening set until Stosur won five games in a row with some scintillating tennis, to clinch the first 6-2. The seventh seed will play Jelena Jankovic in the semifinal after the Serb beat Yaroslava Shvedova, from Kazakhstan, 7-5 6-4. Stosur, who eased past four-time champion Justine Henin in the previous round, triumphed 6-2 6-7 8-6 in two hours and 24 minutes at Roland Garros.
