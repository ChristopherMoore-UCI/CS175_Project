While other trainers usually take six to eight weeks to break in a horse, British equine expert Witheford says he can do the job in just 20 minutes, as revealed in his new book "If Horses Could Talk. "I've done four zebras," says the 54-year-old, who has also broken race horses belonging to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, Dubai ruler Sheik Mohammed, and "I threw myself into horses, and I learned to stay away from people -- people hurt you, horses don't," says Witheford. Healing horses Could Witheford's magic touch come from a deeper, spiritual connection, given the issues of childhood trauma that he reveals in his book? Little did he realize he was overheard by a woman who worked at nearby Longleat Safari Park in the south of England.
