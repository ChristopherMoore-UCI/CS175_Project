His name is Lentil, and he's a French Bulldog puppy who has made quite a name for himself in Philadelphia by helping raise awareness of children with craniofacial abnormalities affecting the head and face, such as cleft palate or cleft lip. She also started to blog about her experiences with Lentil and created a Facebook page called "My name is Lentil," figuring it would be a good way to create awareness of the problems cleft lips and palates cause in animals including dogs. He's already been the mascot for the Lentil Festival in Philadelphia to raise money for craniofacial awareness, and he just returned from a Children's Craniofacial Association kids' camp in Orlando, Florida, a gathering place for children nationwide with craniofacial conditions. Alexander Reiter and John Lewis, both with the vet school's Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, had worked on animals with cleft palates before, but Lentil's case was special because he also had the cleft lip. Lentil, the doctors felt, would be the perfect "ambassodog" for children with craniofacial issues.
