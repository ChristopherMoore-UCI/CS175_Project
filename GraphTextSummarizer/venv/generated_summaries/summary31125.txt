A few months later, in July, James Ware -- the chief federal judge for northern California, thus putting him in charge of the probation department there -- released a once-confidential report from the Administrative Office of the United States Court on Garrido's case. "We believe that the years of abuse experienced by Ms. Dugard are a direct result of the U.S. parole commission's colossal blunders in the supervision of Mr. Garrido," Dale Kinsella, part of the law firm of Kinsella, Weitzman, Iser, Kump and Aldisert, which filed the complaint on behalf of Dugard, said in a statement. The federal government oversaw Phillip Garrido's parole from when he got out of custody in 1988 through 1999 -- including the date in 1991 when Dugard was kidnapped -- after which responsibility shifted to California authorities. "The Garrido case is a significant reflection of the deficient practices in the probation office in the northern district of California," the report said. He spent 11 years of his sentence in a Leavenworth, Kansas, federal penitentiary, then went to a halfway house and eventually was allowed to live with his mother at her Antioch, California, home.
