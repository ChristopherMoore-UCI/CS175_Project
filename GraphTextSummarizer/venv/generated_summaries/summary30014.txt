-- A Justice Department lawyer testified Friday the department does not enforce certain voting law cases when the victims are white, and called the decision to drop a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party "a travesty of justice." Christopher Coates, who headed the department's Voting Rights section in 2008, said he believes some senior civil rights officials at the Justice Department enforce voting cases "in a racially selective manner." Coates testified, against the instructions of his Justice Department bosses, before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, saying he felt obligated to correct statements made by the current Voting Rights section chief that race is not a factor in deciding which cases to pursue. Coates' testimony follows that of former Justice Department attorney J. Christian Adams, who also testified there was a "pervasive hostility" in the Justice Department toward enforcing voting rights cases against African-Americans. Coates said there has been a long-held hostility by some Justice Department lawyers toward voting rights cases against African-American defendants. " The Bush-era Justice Department charged the New Black Panther Party and three of its members with voter intimidation, and a judge entered a default judgment against them the following April when they failed to appear in court. One hearing this summer erupted in shouting between commission members, with conservative commission members accusing the Justice Department of "stonewalling" the commission's investigation into the dismissed charges, and a liberal commission member, in turn, calling those complaints the "last gasps of a conservative majority of this commission."
