Oracle Team USA staged a magnificent comeback from 8-1 down to sail to a 9-8 win over Emirates New Zealand to claim the oldest trophy in sport. Australian tycoon Bob Oatley is turning from wine to water as he announced his intention to build a team to challenge defending America's Cup champions Oracle Team USA. "The recently completed America's Cup in San Francisco has revolutionized the sport for sailors and fans, and we were excited to see how many Australians played key roles on the teams and in the regatta organization. Oatley -- a man who is described as "as famous for his wine as he is for sailing" -- lodged his intent with San Francisco Golden Gate Yacht Club. Oatley said seeing what the sailors from the southern hemisphere achieved on the waters of San Francisco Bay persuaded him it was the right time to enter an Australian team to challenge Team USA.
