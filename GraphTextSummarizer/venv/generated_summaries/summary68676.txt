Desmonte Leonard, 22, turned himself in to U.S. marshals at the federal courthouse in Montgomery, said Montgomery County Sheriff D.T. Marshall. Auburn Police Chief Tommy Dawson said Leonard faces three counts of capital murder and two counts of assault. She said she returned from work to find a man who looked like the suspect sitting on her couch, said Montgomery Mayor Tommy Strange. Officers received a call reporting the shooting at the University Heights apartments clubhouse about 10:03 p.m. Saturday, Auburn Police Chief Dawson said Sunday. The man suspected of killing three people and wounding others near Auburn University turned himself in to authorities late Tuesday, authorities said.
