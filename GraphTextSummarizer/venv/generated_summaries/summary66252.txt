"I could write the book on rehab," Lohan told Morgan, although she said she approached this round with optimism. Lohan's latest rehab stint was taken as an alternative to three months of jail time for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in March. A source close to the actress confirmed to HLN that Lohan, 27, has finished a court-ordered 90-day stay in rehab. The actress has signed up to guest host E!'s "Chelsea Lately" on August 5, and her new movie, "The Canyons," will bow on Friday. The actress told Piers Morgan ahead of her treatment that she's been mandated by the court to go to rehab six times, with her previous stay occurring in 2010.
