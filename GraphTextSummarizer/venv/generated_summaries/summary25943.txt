More than half of those injured were taken to Abington Memorial Hospital, where they were diagnosed with minor to moderate injuries, Dr. John J. Kelly, the chief of staff, said. Glare from the rising sun and ice -- left over from a storm that dropped snow and freezing rain in the Philadelphia area -- might have been factors, state police Trooper Adam Reed said. Traffic was moving again in one affected section of the turnpike by 2 p.m., video from CNN affiliate KYW showed. The wrecks started around 8:25 a.m. ET with a 14- or 15-vehicle collision in southern Bucks County, not far from New Jersey state line, said Bill Capone, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Pennsylvania State Police said it hoped to have the road fully open by 5 p.m. Heather Pasco, a driver involved in one of the crashes, told KYW that she thought she was a goner.
