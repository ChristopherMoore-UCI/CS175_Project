In the final two hours of a dramatic standoff with rogue ex-Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies did not fire a single gunshot during their raid of a compound where he barricaded himself after killing one deputy and seriously wounding another, according to dispatch logs. At the height of the search for Dorner, more than 200 officers scoured Big Bear Mountain, cabin by cabin. Women wounded in manhunt to get $4.2 million When officers identified Dorner's abandoned vehicle and traced him to a vacation cabin, a barrage of gunfire erupted, and hundreds of rounds were exchanged, authorities said. In the days after the incident, authorities defended their tactical strategy of firing gas "burners" into the cabin, stating that SWAT team officers had issued several unanswered commands for Dorner to surrender. During the unprecedented manhunt that went as far as Tijuana, Mexico, the search for Dorner turned to Big Bear after his burning truck was found deserted on a local forest road.
