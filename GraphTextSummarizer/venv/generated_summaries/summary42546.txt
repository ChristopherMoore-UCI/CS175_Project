The program, when it originated, was meant to target and take money authorities believed was connected to crimes. Before that stop was over, the officers had seized $100,000, which the men said was money to play poker. The seizure is just one of thousands of highway stops that state and local authorities call "interdictions:" Roadside stops aimed at catching drug dealers or even terrorists, but which can also result in cash seizures alone with no criminal charges attached. The troopers also called ahead to California authorities, who raided the men's homes and ultimately indicted one of them, John Newmerzhycky, on a charge of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia. It's a simple premise that the government should not be taking money from people who have done nothing wrong.
