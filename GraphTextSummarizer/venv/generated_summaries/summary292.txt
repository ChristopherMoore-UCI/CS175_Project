The California Department of Public Health said Orange County had the most measles cases with 21, followed by San Diego County with 13. The number of cases has increased to 68, with 48 of those cases linked to an outbreak at Disneyland, state health officials reported Friday. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases, recommended last Wednesday that children under 12 months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues.
