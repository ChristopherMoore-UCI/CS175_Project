Zea has been on the FBI's radar since 2011, when authorities said he began plotting a trip to Yemen to "participate in violent jihad" alongside al Qaeda, a Justice Department statement says. -- A Long Island man was arrested Friday after investigators say he attempted to travel to Yemen to join al Qaeda and conspired with the terror group from the United States, according to an indictment from the U.S. Department of Justice. Customs officials in the United Kingdom detained him while he was en route to the Arabian Peninsula on January 4, 2012, and returned him to the U.S. After his failed attempt to travel to Yemen, Zea continued his involvement with al Qaeda, authorities said. "Aspirants with lethal intent who seek terror training abroad are of paramount concern," New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Marcos Alonso Zea, 25, also known as "Ali Zea," was arrested at his home in Brentwood, New York, on charges of conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country, attempting to provide material support to terrorists and obstruction and attempted obstruction of justice, the indictment says.
