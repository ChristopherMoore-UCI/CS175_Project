William Colton Millay of Owensboro, Kentucky, was arrested Friday at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, according to Col. Bill Coppernoll, the public affairs officer at the base. " Millay was hardly fitting of a spy persona, said longtime friend Drew Bramschreiber of Owensboro. "That's just not who he is." Payne, who now lives in Phoenix, Arizona, said Millay idolized his brother, who is also in the Army, and that he had been in the ROTC program in high school. There wasn't much to do in Owensboro so Millay and his high school buddies hung out at the mall or at Walmart, Payne said. Millay had been under investigation by the FBI and Army counterintelligence agents, Coppernoll said, and will face military charges sometime this week.
