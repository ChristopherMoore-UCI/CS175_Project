Mexican federal officials say Lopez Barron, also known as "El Gordo," is one of the top leaders of La Familia Michoacana, a drug cartel blamed for a rash of violence that has left at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers dead since July 11. Police escort suspected drug cartel leader Jose Alberto Lopez Barron on Wednesday in Mexico City. Lopez Barron said his direct boss was Servando Gomez, known as "La Tuta." Authorities said Gomez is La Familia Michoacana's top leader. Lopez Barron was arrested this week in connection with the torture and killings of 12 federal police agents in Michoacan state July 13. Lopez Barron said authorities have tried to capture Gomez but local residents have protected him.
