-- Court officials have released the chilling audiotapes that prosecutors say depict convicted child rapist Warren Jeffs training the girls he claimed were his "spiritual wives" to have sex with him. The tapes, that were obtained by many media outlets including the Salt Lake Tribune and CNN affiliate KSTU on Thursday, contain what prosecutors say is evidence of Jeffs instructing underage girls to have sex with him. Last week, a Texas jury sentenced Jeffs to life in prison for aggravated sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl and 20 years in prison for the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl. Jeffs talks about those desires on audiotapes that authorities seized from his car and the church's Yearning For Zion Ranch compound in Eldorado, Texas. Jeffs, 55, had perverted his position as the head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to "satisfy his own personal appetites and desires," prosecutor Eric Nichols said.
