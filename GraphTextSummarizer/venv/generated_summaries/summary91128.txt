Although a growing number of people are commuting daily by train like Biden once did, there are also those who prefer to ride trains for leisurely travel to see more of the landscape and to relax. Rediscovering freedom in travel The portrayal of trains as an old-fashioned mode of transportation isn't a realistic reflection of the hundreds of thousands of people who use them daily, according to Mathews, NARP's president. Mathews says because trains are not readily incorporated in aggregated discount travel sites like Kayak and Priceline.com, the average traveler does not realize trains are a transportation option that can be cheaper and more accommodating than taking a flight. Think again Hardison attributes the shift toward train ridership to the increase in traffic throughout many metropolitan cities in the United States. More business travelers, students and people from the Northeast, Midwest and Western United States are turning to trains for their work and vacation travels.
