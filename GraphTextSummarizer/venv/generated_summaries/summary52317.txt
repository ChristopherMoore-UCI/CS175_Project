-- American golfer Nick Watney produced a fine closing round at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Florida to secure the third PGA Tour win of his career. Tiger Woods produced a stirring final round of 66 to achieve a tie for 10th -- his first top-10 finish in an official PGA Tour event since the 2010 U.S. Open last June. By the time he arrived at the last, the 29-year-old Watney had opened up a one-shot lead over close friend Johnson -- with whom he shares a coach in Butch Harmon and regular practice rounds. The 2009 runner-up teed off two shots behind overnight leader Dustin Johnson on the Blue Monster course at Doral on Sunday, but summoned a five-under-par 67 to steal victory away from his compatriot. "But I showed positive signs for the next time I play, which is a good thing." Woods' round of 66 on Sunday was matched by his 22-year-old U.S. Ryder Cup teammate Rickie Fowler, who finished eighth to make it back-to-back top-10s in WGC events.
