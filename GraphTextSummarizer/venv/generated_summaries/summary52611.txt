In a letter that went home with students, Monfort Elementary School Principal Jennifer Sheldon emphasized the new responsibilities that Colorado parents face with the legalization of marijuana. The 10-year-old had taken the pot from his grandparents, school spokeswoman Teresa Myers said. Marijuana has been legal for recreational use since January 1, so the grandparents involved haven't broken state law, said John Gates, the school district's safety director. Legalized marijuana has found its way into playground commerce, leading to a group of Greeley, Colorado, fourth-graders being disciplined for selling and trading pot. They're guilty, at the least, of irresponsibility "for not securing their weed," Gates said.
