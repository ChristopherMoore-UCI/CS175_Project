"She's so, so sorry, and I just hope that we can all forgive her and move on," Comic and "DWTS" contestant Bill Engvall echoed others' sentiments and said Hough -- who twice won the dancing competition with her celebrity partners Apolo Anton Ohno and Helio Castroneves -- doesn't have "a mean bone in her body." "I know Julianne personally and none of the critique that she is getting at all relates to her as a person, period," dancer Val Chmerkovskiy told CNN. I just think it was a stupid mistake." Her brother, Derek Hough, who also competes on the show, told E! And (Hough) would no more make any kind of racist statements than anybody on the earth," Engvall said. Hough quickly took to Twitter to apologize once there was backlash.
