While full-blown sectarian violence had ebbed by the end of the Iraq War, Sunni extremists continued to launch attacks against Shiite pilgrims over the years. No attacks against Shiite pilgrims were reported in Baghdad and Karbala in the last several days, police officials in both cities told CNN. Pilgrims chanted, beat their breasts in penance, cut themselves with daggers or swords and whipped themselves in synchronized movements from Saturday through Sunday morning. Iraqi troops and police were deployed in the streets of Baghdad and Karbala, a holy Shiite city where 2 million Shiite pilgrims from across Iraq converged for the festival over the weekend. The first public Ashura demonstrations in Karbala after his fall, in 2004, came under attack by Sunni extremists.
