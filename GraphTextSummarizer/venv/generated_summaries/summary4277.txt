-- Libyan rebels said Monday they remain in control of a key western town they seized from Moammar Gadhafi forces Saturday, although clashes continued just east of it. Al Qassem said NATO forces had informed the rebels that the Gadhafi forces included up to 40 trucks outfitted with heavy weapons, and rebel forces had reinforced their positions Sunday and overnight into Monday. Gadhafi forces returned fire with rockets and mortars. Commanders said taking the junction where Gadhafi forces remain east of the town would provide a direct route to the coastal city of Azzawayia. Rebel commander Nasser abu al Qassem told CNN Monday that the rebels are holding firm on the town's eastern outskirts, squaring off against loyalists just a few miles away at a key road junction the rebels hope to take in the days ahead.
