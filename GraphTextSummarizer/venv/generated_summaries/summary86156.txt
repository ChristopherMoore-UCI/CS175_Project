Flight 17 came down in eastern Ukraine on July 17 in an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists. The Dutch investigators set out a list of areas that still need further investigation, including forensic examination of wreckage and any foreign objects found. Why does crash report avoid the word 'missile'? The U.S. and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile. "Anybody who's looking for blame, or somebody who says that the rebels did it or that somebody else did it, is going to be disappointed," said CNN Aviation Correspondent Richard Quest.
