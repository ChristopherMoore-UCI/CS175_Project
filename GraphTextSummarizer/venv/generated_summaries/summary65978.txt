We thought of numbers: 302 -- the number of homes that the St. Bernard Project has rebuilt; 85 -- the number of residents who utilize our free evidenced-based clinical services at our Center for Wellness and Mental Health each week. In Louisiana's recovery, finishing strong means: • Governmental leadership that makes decisions that impact residents in ways that the leaders would want their own families to be impacted. Today, nearly 900 families who own homes are still living in FEMA trailers. • Americans and corporations not viewing community as being limited by proximity and instead, like the hundreds of thousands of volunteers, working hard to help American families rebuild their homes. The New Orleans area is a wonderful place to live, and the city is, in many ways, thriving.
