Asleep next to the corpse was KARK meteorologist Brett Cummins, 33, who had arrived at Barbour's house with Williams on Sunday night, Barbour told police. On Sunday night, the three men had drunk and snorted illegal narcotics, though Barbour could not identify the drugs, according to a report by Officer Gregory Roussie. "Anyone who knew him would agree that he was easily influenced." Christopher Barbour, 36, said he awoke Monday morning in his home outside Little Rock, Arkansas, to find Williams' body at the bottom of the empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain around his neck, a Maumelle Police Department report said. " "Dex had a very loving but trusting heart," the family of victim Dexter Paul Williams, 24, said in a statement released by their lawyer, Thomas Nichols. Around 10 p.m., Cummins and Williams moved into the hot tub, where Barbour joined them later; they continued drinking until Barbour retired for the night around 11, falling asleep on his couch in the living room, the report said.
