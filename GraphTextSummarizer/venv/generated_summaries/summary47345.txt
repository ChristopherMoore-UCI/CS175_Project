The milk industry is no small cheese in France, thanks to the efforts of people like Philippe Jachnik who travels the world endlessly promoting milk products, which these days include protein supplements and milk derivatives that can go into all sorts of processed food. " Jachnik must be doing a good job as it's not just abroad that the French are selling more milk products-- cheese consumption in France has doubled from 12 to 24 kilos per person per year. -- We're up in the north central part of France -- Normandy -- to see what's happening with French cheese. But I've kept my souvenirs, you see I've kept my old milk cans so I can stay in the spirit of Camembert!" Despite those who've quit, the actual number of the variety of cheeses in France is growing. Cheese from the Camembert region now carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine.
