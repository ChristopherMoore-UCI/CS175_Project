On Sunday, a Galveston County sheriff's official said three bodies were pulled from storm wreckage in Port Bolivar, bringing to 10 the number of reported deaths in Texas linked to Ike. -- When iReporter Carlos Ortega evacuated Galveston's West End  last week, there was a road, a row of houses and about 150 feet of sand between his house and the water. Nearly 2,000 people who did not evacuate have been rescued along the southeastern Texas coast, said Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Office of Homeland Security. iReporter Carlos Ortega says there's "not an inch that isn't damaged" in his Galveston, Texas, neighborhood. Hurricane Ike devastated the Texas city over the weekend, and Gov. Rick Perry said it could be weeks before residents could return.
