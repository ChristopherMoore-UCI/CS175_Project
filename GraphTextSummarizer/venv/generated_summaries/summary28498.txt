-- Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad struggled through ocean swells, shoulder pain and asthma Monday as she attempted to become the first person to swim between Cuba and Florida without a shark cage, according to her team and a CNN staffer on a chase boat. Nyad in good spirits in 18th hour The attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida is the second for the swimmer, who said at a news conference Sunday that she is fitter today than she was in 1978, when she first attempted the crossing but was unable to finish. The shoulder pain remained an issue around 2 p.m., about 18 hours into the swim, said CNN staffer Matt Sloane -- who is following Nyad on a chase boat -- in a tweet. "I'm almost 62 years old and I'm standing here at the prime of my life," she said Sunday as she prepared to dive into the water at Havana's Marina Hemingway. She jumped into the water at 7:45 p.m. ET on Sunday and expects to swim for roughly 60 hours.
