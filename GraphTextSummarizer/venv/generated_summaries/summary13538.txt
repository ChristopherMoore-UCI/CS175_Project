Introducing new characters, weapons and enemies (including tough boss battles), this atmospheric, horror-filled tale follows a group of space colonists who vow to fight a mysterious virus spreading through the USG Ishimura and the planet Aegis VII. "Dead Space: Extraction" Serving as a prequel to last year's extraordinary "Dead Space" for the Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and PC, this new Nintendo Wii exclusive reveals what happened leading up to Isaac Clarke's deadly mission aboard the USG Ishimura mining ship in deep space. As an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST), part of an elite group of space marines dropped into hostile areas, you land in the fictional African port city of New Mombasa to ward off an invasion from the Covenant, an alliance of militaristic alien races. This is a cooperative multiplayer video game where up to four ODST fighters can take on increasingly challenging waves of Covenant invaders, similar to the celebrated "Horde" mode from "Gears of War 2." Two new sci-fi video games cast you in the futuristic role of a space marine who must face off against deadly creatures.
