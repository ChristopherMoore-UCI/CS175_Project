A roadside bomb exploded in an outdoor market in al-Mamel Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, killing five people and wounding 13 others, police officials said. A wave of attacks in Iraq killed at least 31 people and wounded nearly 100 more Saturday as Muslims marked the second day of the festival of Eid al-Adha, police said. "This is an atrocious act of violence against innocent worshipers of various faiths," said Martin Kobler, the secretary-general's special representative and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq. On Saturday evening, a roadside bomb exploded on a busy road in the al-Jihad neighborhood of western Baghdad, wounding four people. In another incident, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in Muqdadiya, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Baghdad, killing one person and wounding six others, Baquba police said.
