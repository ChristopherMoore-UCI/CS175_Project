U.S. and coalition casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq A gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training, killing three and wounding several others, ISAF said. "I am both saddened and outraged by the attacks that took place today against Coalition forces and the people of Afghanistan," Allen said in a statement. To hide the fact that they are losing territory, support, and the will to fight, our common enemy continues to employ suicide attackers to kill innocent Afghan fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, as well as the Coalition forces who have volunteered to protect them. The shooter was killed in the incident in southern Afghanistan. The attack caused a "number" of NATO and local Afghan casualties, ISAF said in a statement.
