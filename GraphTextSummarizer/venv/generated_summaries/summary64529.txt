After spending my adolescence stressing out over AP classes and college admissions, then dealing with the rigors of university course work, I doffed my graduation cap only to find that somewhere along the line a good education stopped being the finish line. In 2009, a record number of high school students enrolled in colleges. Arniece, a young woman I went to high school with, took over her family's kitchen last summer in search of the perfect pound cake recipe. While it is good news that more Americans are getting a higher education, it also means that competition among young graduates is intensifying. My friend Gabriel searched fruitlessly for a job in advertising before spending two years as a line cook, only to find himself as a visual resources coordinator in the special collections of university libraries.
