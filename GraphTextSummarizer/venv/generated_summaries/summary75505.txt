Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the United States Congress gave American citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says "Place of Birth. "There have been 50,000 Americans in the last 10 years that were born in Jerusalem, and many of them would like to have 'Israel' indicated as their place of birth in the passports," said Sarah Cleveland, a Columbia University Law School professor, and until recently a counselor on international law at the State Department. If you're born in Jerusalem, instead of saying the country, the city is listed-- just a city-- Jerusalem. Divided into East Jerusalem (populated mostly by Muslims) and West Jerusalem (populated mostly by Jews), the city spans more than 48 square miles, with about 775,000 people. Do not write Israel, Jordan or West Bank for a person born within the current municipal borders of Jerusalem.
