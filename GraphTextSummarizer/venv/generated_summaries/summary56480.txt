I'd also encourage you to consider signing up for a race -- of any length -- as part of CNN iReport's Run for Boston group. RELATED: 'Run for Boston' iReport group All of those complaints and fears seemed so childish after I e-mailed with Lee Ann Yanni, a 32-year-old who was standing near the finish line in Boston in April when the bombs went off. That was the day I had a conversation with a Boston bombing victim who, after three surgeries, ran her first marathon a few weeks ago. Yanni is a physical therapist in Boston, so she knew what she was up against. The goal is to show support for the truly brave people such as Yanni and others who are taking steps each day toward recovering from the Boston tragedy.
