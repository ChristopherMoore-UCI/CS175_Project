The case concerning Contador was due to be heard by CAS from June 6-8 in order to have the decision before the start of this year's Tour de France on July 2 -- but CAS announced last week they had postponed the hearing to allow further preparation by all parties. Team Leopard rider Weylandt dies in Giro d'Italia crash Saxo Bank rider Contador, who also has three Tour de France titles and one Tour of Spain success to his name, proved the dominant rider in the race after taking the leader's pink jersey on the ninth stage to Mount Etna. That meant the 28-year-old Spaniard finished a comfortable six minutes and 10 seconds clear of Italian Michele Scarponi in the overall classification with another Italian, Tour of Spain champion Vincenzo Nibali, back in third place a further 46 seconds behind. Contador won the Tour in 2007, 2009 and last year and was only prevented from racing in 2008 because his then team, Astana, were denied a start place by organizers due to doping infringements. Millar completed the 26km stage in 30 minutes and 13 seconds, with Contador taking third place, 36 seconds behind.
