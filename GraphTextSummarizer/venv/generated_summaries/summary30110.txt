-- Lawmakers on Monday approved legislation calling for government-funded contraception and sex education classes in the Philippines, a first in the heavily Catholic nation. Legislative leaders hope to finish their work and send the bill to Aquino by Wednesday before going on Christmas break, the official Philippines News Agency reported. More than 80% of the Philippines' 96 million residents are Catholic. We thank our senators and congressmen who voted for access to information and care," said presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda. A reconciliation committee must now work out differences in the versions of the legislation passed by each house before it is sent to President Benigno Aquino, who is expected to sign it.
