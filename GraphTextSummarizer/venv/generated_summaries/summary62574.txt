New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday started the third day of his new administration with a predawn conference call to decide whether to close public schools after a major storm walloped the city with up to 6 inches of snow. Bloomberg defended city efforts to clear snow amid a swell of frustration by some snowbound residents, particularly outside of Manhattan, who wondered why their streets were still clogged days after the massive holiday storm. He was accused of allowing snow to pile up in Queens and letting large parts of Brooklyn go unplowed for days. "I was here in 2010 and it was a disaster," Kathy Nobles, a teacher and Brooklyn resident. "We just consider him from our neighborhood and we expect he's going to keep our interests at heart," Brooklyn resident Kathleen Axen said.
