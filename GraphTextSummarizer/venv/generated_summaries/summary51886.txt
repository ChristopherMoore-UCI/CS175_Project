I teach at a college that has completely dropped requiring ACT and SAT tests for admissions. The Long Island testing scandal reflects the extent to which high school students across the country are responding to what their teachers and colleges are telling them will bring success. They bear a huge responsibility for the degree to which a high score on a standardized test has become disproportionately important for college admission. As Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford show in their study of race and class in college admissions, "No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal," selective colleges give blacks a 310-point bonus and Hispanics a 130-point bonus on the SAT test in order to achieve a measure of diversity. As education scandals go, the news that students at some of the best high schools on Long Island paid others to take their College Board tests seems mild.
