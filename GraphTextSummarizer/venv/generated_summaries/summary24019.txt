Subcommittee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, said the "Screening Partnership Program," as the privatization effort is formally known, creates jobs by replacing federal screeners with private screeners, without impacting security. On Tuesday, a House Homeland Security subcommittee will take up the question of whether airport security is best provided by government screeners or the private sector. TSA Administrator John Pistole one year ago put the brakes on the government's privatization program, saying he would approve contract security only if airports could demonstrate it would not hurt security and if there was a "clear and substantial" advantage to the federal government. Some airport executives have argued that contract security personnel are more courteous than government workers. Pistole's action demonstrated his philosophy that protecting aviation is a federal government responsibility, and that privatizing the workforce can decrease his flexibility to move screeners between airports in response to threats.
