In his guilty plea, Kodirov said that in 2011 he was communicating with a person he thought was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a designated terrorist group, and that "Kodirov interpreted these conversations to mean that he should kill President Obama," according to the Justice Department. Ulugbek Kodirov, 22, pleaded guilty in February to threatening Obama, providing material support for terrorism and for illegally possessing an automatic weapon. -- A man from Uzbekistan living in Alabama was sentenced Friday to almost 16 years in prison for threatening to kill President Barack Obama. Kodirov also admitted speaking to a different person in July 2011 about wanting to kill Obama and possible ways to carry out the act. Kodirov did not realize that person was a confidential source for law enforcement who then introduced Kodirov to someone to help him get weapons.
