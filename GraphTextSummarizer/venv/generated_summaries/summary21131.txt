"I told my caddy before that last shot, 'I'm about due to make one of these,' " said the 35-year-old, who came from four shots behind overnight leader Donald to claim his seventh PGA Tour victory. The birdie, coming after dropping a shot with a three-putt at the previous hole, earned him the $1 million first prize ahead of former world No. 1 Luke Donald, who finished with three pars. He has now finished in the top three for five of the last six years at Hilton Head's Harbour Town Golf Links. But the American golfer ended his run of final-round disappointments in spectacular style at the RBC Heritage tournament in South Carolina, holing a bunker shot at the last to clinch a one-shot victory. Ben Martin (67) and John Huh (68) tied for third on nine under, with fellow Americans Scott Brown and Brian Stuard equal fifth two shots further back.
