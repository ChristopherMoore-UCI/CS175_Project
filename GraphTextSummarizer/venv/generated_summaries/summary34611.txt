But crew members "noticed an unfamiliar smell in the cabin," said United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart. -- A United Airlines flight was diverted to Cuba on Sunday after its crew reported a strong odor in the plane, U.S. aviation and airline spokesmen said. Normally, there are tight restrictions on the travel of U.S. citizens to the Communist state of Cuba, based on federal law. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Les Dorr said United Flight 831, an Airbus A320, landed safely at Jose Marti Airport in Havana at 12:07 p.m. local time. United does not typically fly to Cuba, according to its website.
