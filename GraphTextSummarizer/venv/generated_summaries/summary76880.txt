Earlier in the championships, Russia's pole vault gold medal winner Yelena Isinbayeva defended the new legislation, speaking in English at a press conference. " She also criticized two Swedish competitors who had painted their fingernails with rainbows in support of gay rights, claiming them to be "disrespectful." Isinbayeva, an ambassador for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, later back tracked and said her comments had been "misunderstood" as English was not her first language. Kseniya Ryzhova and Yulia Gushchina were part of the Russian quartet who won the women's 4x400m relay Saturday in the Luzhniki Stadium, beating the favored United States team. Ryzhova told a media conference in Moscow that she and the three other members of the team had merely been overcome with emotion after finally topping the podium after a series of near misses. The legislation banning the promotion of "gay propaganda" among minors came on to the Russian statute book in June as Vladimir Putin embarks on his third term as president.
