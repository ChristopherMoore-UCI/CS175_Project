I don't have anybody who's in there just to accomplish certain things, to facilitate plot twists. Dick Henry is the wisecracking creation of author, P.G. Sturges and the hero of his newest novel, "Tribulations of the Shortcut Man," hitting bookstore shelves this week. He died when the author was just six years old but the two share a love of quirky characters and screwball plots. So Dick knows as much as I do but when he's wrong about things of course it's my character who's wrong and not me. When you need a solution, quick, you call Dick Henry.
