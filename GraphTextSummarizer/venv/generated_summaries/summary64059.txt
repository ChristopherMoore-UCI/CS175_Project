Several staff members were targeted after the giraffe was shot Sunday, Copenhagen Zoo spokesman Tobias Stenb√¶k Bro told CNN on Monday. He added that Bengt Holst, director of research and conservation at Copenhagen Zoo "received threats via telephone and e-mails." Copenhagen Zoo said in a Q&A about the decision on its website, "it is not possible to transfer the giraffe to another zoo as it will cause inbreeding." And to do it in front of children just desensitizes them to brutal killing of animals. He also questioned why the Copenhagen Zoo would keep breeding animals for which it didn't have room.
