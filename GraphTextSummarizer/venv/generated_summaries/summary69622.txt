At times, "Songs of Innocence" feels almost like a concept album about Bono's early years -- there's even a track named after the street where the singer grew up, "Cedarwood Road." The band made the announcement with Apple CEO Tim Cook at a Cupertino press conference for the new iPhone 6, capping the event with a performance of the album's first single, "The Miracle (of Joey Ramone). Bono said the group listened to the music they loved in the '70s, from punk rock to Bowie, glam rock, early electronica and Joy Division. "I found my voice through Joey Ramone because I wasn't the obvious punk-rock singer, or even rock singer," Bono said. "It has a lyrical cohesion that I think is unique amongst U2 albums," Bono said.
