"Iran being among the countries with the most such cases." Barely a week after arriving in Oslo under Norwegian government protection, Mostafaei appears to be very much on an emotional roller coaster, swinging rapidly from elation to despair. But according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, Iran leads the world for the number of death sentences carried out against juvenile defendants. "When they found that my husband was out of Iran and they couldn't reach him and I wouldn't be a good hostage any more, that's when they released me," Halimi said in a phone interview with CNN last week. After several surreal and sometimes dangerous weeks, Mostafaei's journey appears to finally be over. "I can imagine that with him being here and the family being there he [Mostafei] feels concerned," says Norwegian foreign minister St√∏re.
