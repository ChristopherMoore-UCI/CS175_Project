Inside North Korea's World Cup squad Brazil 2-1 North Korea Brazil, seeking a record-extending sixth title, were expected to win with ease against a side making their first appearance in the tournament since 1966, but the North Koreans made life difficult for their illustrious opponents. Earlier in Port Elizabeth, Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo struck the post with a 30-yard drive in the first-half of a cagey match, before Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba -- playing 11 days after breaking his elbow -- wasted an opportunity to win the game when he dragged his shot wide in stoppage-time. " North Korea coach Kim Jong Hun was proud of his players and saw reason for encouragement ahead of their remaining games against Portugal and Ivory Coast. "I believe the first match is always trying, there was a lot of nervousness, and anxiety," Brazil coach Dunga told AFP. Ronaldo was shown a yellow card after 20 minutes when he failed to win a free-kick and was involved in a spat with Ivory Coast defender Guy Demel, who was also booked.
