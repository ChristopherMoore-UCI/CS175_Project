Desmond Campbell, 30, was presented with charges related to seven sex crimes last week, even though he was in a hospital bed -- unresponsive and in critical condition from the wreck, Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan said. There were eight linked cases of sexual assault in Tulsa in June, according to police. "We were prepared to file 23 felony crimes against him, including rape, robbery and first degree burglary," Assistant District Attorney for Tulsa County Steve Kunzweiler said. The speeding car he was traveling in struck a light pole on an interstate early on the morning of June 29, about 10 minutes after one of his alleged sexual assaults, Jordan said earlier this month. Campbell was released from prison in late April after convictions in Oklahoma City for attempted robbery, attempted kidnapping and robbery, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, Jordan said.
