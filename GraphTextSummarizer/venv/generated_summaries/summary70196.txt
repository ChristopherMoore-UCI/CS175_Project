In Totnes, Transition have created local food guides, formed a sustainable building company, given talks and lectures to landowners and local government officials to show them how peak oil and climate change affect their management decisions. " Transition works by uniting local communities and forming groups to tackle individual areas -- energy, food, housing -- with the ultimate aim being the construction of an "Energy Descent Plan" to plot out a twenty year divorce from oil. "People have known about climate change for some time, and now the idea of peak oil is spreading fast. " Transition works by helping local people get together and find ways they can reduce their reliance on oil as a community, and cut their carbon footprint in the process. " Hopkins acknowledges that it's hard for governments to take action until they know the country is behind them, but argues again, that's where Transition comes to the rescue.
