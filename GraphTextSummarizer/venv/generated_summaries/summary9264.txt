The unlucky star going home was Olympic athlete Lolo Jones, who was part of one of the worst-performing teams during the season premiere on Monday night. " On Facebook, Jones shared with fans how disappointed she was with her "Dancing" routine and her apprehension about the criticism she felt was sure to come in light of past struggles at Olympic games. " "I know Betsey (Johnson) had a malfunction ... and that was a disadvantage for her," Jones said Tuesday. "When I was dancing last night and messed up I had flashbacks of the three Olympics ... that people constantly tease me about," Jones said. -- "Dancing with the Stars" is down from 13 competitors to 12 after season 19's first elimination on Tuesday.
