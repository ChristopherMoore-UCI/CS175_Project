Cesar Laurean is most likely in Mexico, authorities said, and the prosecutor said he has agreed not to seek the death penalty if Laurean is arrested in that country. Police also released photographs that show Laurean's living room and garage with paint cans. Investigators found the body after Laurean's wife came forward with a note her husband had written saying he had buried Lauterbach, who was eight months pregnant, after she slit her own throat during an argument. But in the note provided to police by Laurean's wife, the corporal claimed Lauterbach killed herself December 15. Investigators said they found blood in more than one room of Laurean's home, some of which was covered by fresh paint.
