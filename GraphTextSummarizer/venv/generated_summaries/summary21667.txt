Unrest has gripped Burkina Faso -- a key partner for Western countries in the campaign against Islamist militants -- since protests against Compaore's government turned violent Thursday. Upon his resignation, Compaore appealed via Twitter for "free elections to be held in Burkina Faso within 90 days at the most." France, the former colonial ruler of what is today Burkina Faso, welcomed the President's resignation and called for elections to happen quickly. -- Burkina Faso's military chief is now the head of state of the West African nation, after unrest that led to the resignation of President Blaise Compaore. Faced with violent protests demanding an end to his 27-year rule, Compaore initially dissolved the government but said he would stay in power until elections could be carried out. Compaore had been in office since he took power after a bloody coup in 1987.
