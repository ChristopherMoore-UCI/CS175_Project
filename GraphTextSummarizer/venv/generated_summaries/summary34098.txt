Thai police Wednesday linked a powerful explosion at a suburban Bangkok apartment building to anti-government protesters. The extension of the emergency rule also come after another protest in September where more than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered in the heart of Bangkok's shopping district to mark the fourth anniversary of a bloodless coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The building has been sealed off while police collect forensic evidence, but authorities have said there is evidence of an explosive material at the site. Initial forensic evidence suggests the bomb was made from about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of TNT and was being assembly at the apartment before it exploded, according to Gen. Wichean Potephosri, the national police chief, who said evidence found at the scene may link it to four other recent bombings. The emergency rule was imposed in April after anti-government protests crippled much of Thailand.
