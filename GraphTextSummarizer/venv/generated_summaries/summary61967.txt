En route from across the country, including the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq, pilgrims have been headed to the Imam Kadhim shrine in the Kadhimiya neighborhood of Baghdad. Most people in Iraq are Shiites, but under Hussein, Sunnis held a great deal of power despite their minority status. -- Casualties from Wednesday's wave of attacks across Iraq rose to 93 people dead and 312 wounded, the Interior Ministry said Thursday, making it the deadliest day in the country since the United States withdrew its troops in December. The violence sparks fears of a renewal of the fighting between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq in the last decade, a longtime animosity intensified by the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime. One of the deadliest days recently came on January 5 when at least 60 people were killed in attacks that again targeted Shiites on a pilgrimage.
