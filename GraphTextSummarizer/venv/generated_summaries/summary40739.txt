-- William Clay Ford -- grandson of automaker Henry Ford and the figurative father of the Detroit Lions' NFL franchise -- died Sunday morning after battling pneumonia. "No owner loved his team more than Mr. Ford loved the Lions," Tom Lewand, team president, said. " "Mr. Ford was a visionary that will be missed by all," said Hall of Fame former running back Barry Sanders. The news about Ford hit especially hard among those associated with the Lions, which he became president of in 1961 and purchased two years later. The Ford Motor Company -- for which Ford served for 57 years as an employee and board member -- said that Ford died at his home.
