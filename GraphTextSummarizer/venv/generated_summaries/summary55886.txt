Trainer Justin Snaith says a day at Cape Town's Muizenberg Beach provides the perfect workout for his thoroughbreds before they tough it out on the turf. He has 38 runners lining up in 12 races at the J&B Met at Cape Town's famous Kenilworth Racecourse this Saturday, with Jet Explorer his contender in the main race. "When horses pick up certain injuries, or even mentally need a break, the ocean is by far the most superior thing I've ever seen, and it just gives them that day to just get their heads together, or get a little bit of infection out of their leg," Snaith says. "This is the ultimate exercise, for both their mind and body," Snaith told CNN's Winning Post show. With 40 kilometers (25 miles) of white sand stretching along Cape Town's Atlantic peninsula, Muizenberg is popular with surfers and the odd shark as well as its equine visitors.
