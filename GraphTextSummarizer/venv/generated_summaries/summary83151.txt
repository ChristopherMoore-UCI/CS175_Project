Running two of the world's biggest car companies means splitting his time between Paris and Tokyo and fitting in meetings, visits to plants and dealerships, as well as attending car shows all over the world and catalyzing spectacular model launches. Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn smiles at the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix on May 25, 2008. Since May 2005, all the while staying at the helm of Nissan, he has taken the reins of French car company Renault, which owns 44 percent of Nissan. His career in the auto industry began in 1978 at Europe's largest tiremaker, Michelin, where he worked for 18 years, moving up the ranks from plant manager to chief operating officer. When he arrived in Tokyo in 1999 to revive the fortunes of Nissan, he took plenty of flak after slashing more than 20,000 jobs and closing assembly plants.
