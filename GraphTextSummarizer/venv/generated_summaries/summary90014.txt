" As well as drawing visitors in to the museum, Barrett said the specimen offered many interesting opportunities for research. The museum's lead dinosaur researcher, Professor Paul Barrett, said the stegosaurus was incredibly rare. While they don't actually know whether it was male or female (despite the name), they can tell the dinosaur was relatively young when it died -- adult stegosaurus are known to have measured up to 9m in length. The Natural History Museum's specimen was found at Red Canyon Ranch in Wyoming in 2003 -- it took 18 months of painstaking excavation work to free it from the ground it had lain in for so long. The first stegosaurus was discovered in Colorado in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Marsh.
