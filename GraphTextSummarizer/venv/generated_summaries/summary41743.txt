Uribe is in the final month of a presidency that has had many tensions with neighboring Venezuela, mostly over accusations that rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (also known as FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN) have camps in Venezuela. Security analysts say FARC guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador. Colombia said it had evidence that shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons recovered from FARC guerrillas were of Venezuelan origin. Chavez said that under President Alvaro Uribe, Colombia has isolated itself and become "aggressive and violent." He called Uribe "crazed" and accused the United States of using Uribe as a puppet. Venezuela recalled its ambassador to Colombia on Friday in reaction to the accusations of protecting rebels.
