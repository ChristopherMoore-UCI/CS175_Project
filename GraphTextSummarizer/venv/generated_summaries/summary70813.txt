-- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki and tournament favorite Serena Williams both came through third round matches in straight sets Saturday at the U.S .Open. If the seedings go to form, she could face Williams, who survived a second-set fightback from fourth seed Victoria Azarenka before winning  6-1 7-6 (7-5) on Arthur Ashe. Seventh seed Francesca Schiavone from Italy is also through to the fourth round after coming from a set down to beat South Africa's Chanelle Scheepers 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, while Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro beat her compatriot Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-0, 6-4. Williams, seeking a fourth U.S. Open crown, powered through the first set and looked set to complete a routine straight sets victory as she led 5-3 in the second. But 11th seed Jelena Jankovic went out, beaten by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia 6-4 6-4.
