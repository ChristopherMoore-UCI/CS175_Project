-- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged Ukrainian government forces and rebel fighters to respect a fragile ceasefire following the death of a Swiss Red Cross worker in shelling in eastern Ukraine. " The ceasefire deal was agreed upon September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, following talks between representatives of Ukraine's government, Russia and rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. Civilians in eastern Ukraine urgently need a return to peace and stability, Burkhalter said, and humanitarian agencies in the region need to be able to help them before the onset of winter. "Kiev was unwilling to recognize the evident facts -- militias have under their control the district in Donetsk that came under shelling when the fire was opened from the positions held by Ukrainian troops," the statement said. In April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from Kiev.
