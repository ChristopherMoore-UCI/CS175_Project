White was the star player at Iowa State University last season, both on and off the court. He spoke to young fans at Orchard Place, a charity for children with mental health and behavioral disorders. In a phone interview with CNN, he recounted the panic attacks he had at airports when he flew to basketball camps and skills academies during high school. Basketball analyst Nate Ross points out that the transition from college star to NBA newcomer is tough for any rookie. White speaks publicly about his anxiety, for which he takes medication but isn't currently in therapy, because he wants to boost awareness about mental illness.
