Many of the top 25 counties that showed the greatest support for HRC's campaign were home to college towns, such as Washtenaw County, home of the University of Michigan and at 6.2% the county with the largest increase in profile photo changes, as well as the home counties of the University of North Carolina, Duke University, Indiana University, the University of Colorado and the University of Texas. While the data isn't specific to users changing their profile photos to the several variations of the pink equal sign on top of a red background, variations of the Human Rights Campaign's traditionally blue-and-yellow logo, the Facebook data show that roughly 2.7 million more users updated their profile photo on Tuesday compared with the previous Tuesday, leading the researchers to conclude the HRC appeal had a lot to do with the numbers. The Human Rights Campaign started urging people on Monday to change their Facebook profile pictures to a pink-on-red equal sign to show support for same-sex marriage, and soon the top 10 terms trending on Facebook were all related to the subject. According to Facebook, users around 30 years of age changed their profile pictures the most, in response to the events surrounding the HRC campaign, about 3.5% of 30-year-old Facebook users. Facebook researchers mapped out the profile picture changes showing a fairly broad distribution throughout the country, but certain areas showed greater concentration of support than others.
