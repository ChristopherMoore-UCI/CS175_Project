Simoncelli's compatriot and close friend Valentino Rossi produced his best ride of the season to finish behind 2010 champion Lorenzo in second place. When the race eventually got underway, a nightmare Sunday for Spain's Pedrosa was completed when he was forced off the track and out of the race by Hector Barbera of the Pramac Racing Team. " It was a miserable race for Repsol Honda's Pedrosa, who had qualified for the grand prix in pole position. The first race start had been abandoned, due to Karel Abraham stalling his Ducati, before Pedrosa was forced to start from the back of the grid after experiencing a problem with his front tire. It was an emotional weekend at the track which is now named after Marco Simoncelli, the Italian who lost his life following a crash in Malaysia in October 2011.
