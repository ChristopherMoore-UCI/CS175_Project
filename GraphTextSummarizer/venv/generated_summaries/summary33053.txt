An "open-flame ignition of ordinary combustibles," such as wood or rubbish, led to Wednesday's blaze, Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said in a news release. On Wednesday, Fire Commissioner Robert Hoff said the building was boarded up in the front but the back was open, leading firefighters to think that homeless people may have sought shelter there. The casualties came after a wall and roof of the commercial building, which is on East 75th Street, collapsed without warning. Other firefighters were working the blaze from the roof. CNN affiliate WGN aired footage of a line of firefighters saluting one body as it arrived at the medical examiner's office later Wednesday.
