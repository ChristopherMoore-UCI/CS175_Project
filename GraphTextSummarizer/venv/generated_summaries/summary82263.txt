Israel intercepted a rocket fired at Tel Aviv on Tuesday and killed militants who stormed into Israeli territory, the military said, as people on both sides of the Gaza border were living under a barrage of attacks from the air. Palestinians reported 24 people in Gaza were killed and more than 150 injured in Israeli airstrikes. The possibility of an Israeli incursion into Gaza loomed, with the Cabinet authorizing the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed -- 10,000 more than were called up during Israel's offensive into Gaza in November of 2012. People in 'human shield' killed on Gaza rooftop Among the dead in Gaza was Mohammad Sha'aban, a leader of Hamas' militant wing, Palestinian sources said. Israeli aircraft hovered above and fired toward Gaza, the station said.
