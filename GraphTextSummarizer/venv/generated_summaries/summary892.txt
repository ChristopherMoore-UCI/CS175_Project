The troops died "following an insider attack involving suspected Afghan police," said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman with NATO's International Security Assistance Force. -- Four NATO troops were killed Sunday in an attack believed to involve Afghan police in southern Afghanistan, officials said, in what appears to be the latest incident of local forces turning their guns on coalition partners. "Green-on-blue" refers to a color coding system used by the military, in which blue refers to the friendly force, in this case ISAF; and green refers to allied friendly forces, in this case Afghan National Security Forces. Insurgents wore U.S. Army uniforms It is too early to conclude whether the attackers had "inside knowledge," Graybeal said. Six AV-8B Harrier jets were destroyed and two others were damaged, international forces said.
