However, all of the suspects are dead, said Alejandro Poire, the spokesman for Mexico's president on security issues. -- Six of the suspected gunmen responsible for the killings of 72 migrants in Mexico have been identified, Mexican authorities said Monday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Three were killed in a confrontation with the Mexican navy after the bodies were discovered, and three others were found dead inside a vehicle on the side of a highway, Poire said The dead suspects were identified by the survivors of last month's massacre at a ranch near the town of San Fernando in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. A seventh suspect was arrested and is being held by authorities while they investigate possible charges against him, Poire said. Mexican authorities have withheld details about survivors, citing safety concerns.
