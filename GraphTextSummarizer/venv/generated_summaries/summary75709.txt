Adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to the CDC, but the government agency must be notified of any flu deaths in children. The CDC does not have data on the number of adult flu deaths. In addition to getting the vaccine, which can prevent flu -- or at least lessen symptoms, washing your hands frequently and staying home when you're sick can help you get through the flu season. "Widespread" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. "As typical of a flu season, some areas are being harder hit than other areas," said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.
