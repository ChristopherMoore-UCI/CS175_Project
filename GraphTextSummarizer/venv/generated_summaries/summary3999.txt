"The system analyzes foods in terms of how chemical compounds interact with each other, the number of atoms in each compound, and the bonding structure and shapes of compounds," wrote IBM research scientist Lav Varshney. Watson's win doesn't make humanity obsolete -- yet Varshney and his team hope that by optimizing flavor, they will be able to reduce health issues related to nutrition. "At the end of the day, taste is about chemistry," Bernie Meyerson, vice president of innovation at IBM, told Fast Company. A person could program the computer to personalized taste (hold the mushrooms!) and medical necessities (low sodium, please). IBM's system would break down the chemical components of each meal, then collect taste data based on your feedback.
