Massachusetts authorities are reviewing the sentences of 1,140 people who are in prison after being convicted with evidence at least partly provided by Dookhan. -- A second Massachusetts state chemist in just a few months has been accused of mishandling drug evidence, the attorney general's office said Sunday. Sonja Farak, 35, who worked at the Massachusetts State Crime Laboratory in Amherst, was arrested at her Northampton home Saturday night by Massachusetts State Police and is facing two counts of tampering with evidence, one count of possession of a Class A substance, and one count of possession of a Class B Substance, according to Attorney General Martha Coakley. This arrest comes just three months after the arrest of Annie Dookhan, a former Massachusetts chemist at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory in Jamaica Plain, who is charged with obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. In a news conference Sunday regarding Farak's arrest, Coakley noted that "unlike our allegations against Annie Dookhan, this did not involve 'dry labbing' or falsification of tests.
