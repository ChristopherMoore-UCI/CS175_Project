-- The Fit Nation "6-Pack" is visiting the National Training Center in Clermont, Florida, this week to learn more about biking, swimming and running. Don't think about the second effort until you have accomplished the first. Don't get lost in the heart rate, wattage, newest gadget, latest diet plan or running shoe. It's OK not to love every training session, but I think it's important to enjoy your time swimming, biking and running. A plan will help you reach your goals, create balance in training and help prevent injury.
