Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, and Barbara Boxer, D-California, sent letters to Attorney General Eric Holder asking Holder to look into concerns that News Corp. -- the parent company of Fox News -- violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, known as the FCPA. "There does seem to be a basis for a U.S. investigation at this point," said Mike Koehler, a professor of business law at Butler University in Indianapolis, in a telephone interview Monday with CNN about whether U.S. law might apply to the hacking scandal in Britain. News Corp. encompasses not only Fox News, but also The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States. "The SEC has brought cases against U.S. companies who had no knowledge of what foreign subsidiaries were doing, but had misbooked it," he said, adding that the SEC blamed the companies for not having set up the internal controls that would have caught the illegal behavior.
