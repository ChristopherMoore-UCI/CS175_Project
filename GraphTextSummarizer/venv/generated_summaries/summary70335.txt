As the throngs congregated, Egypt's Nile TV showed live pictures of car traffic crossing a bridge over the Nile River, with bulletins announcing that a curfew would be imposed again on Tuesday starting at 3 p.m. Soldiers and plain-clothed security officers searched demonstrators and controlled access to Tahrir, or Liberation Square, which has been the focal point of protests against Egypt's embattled Mubarak, 82. He claimed Egypt's long repressed opposition parties were working together with one goal, to remove President Hosni Mubarak. "Today we are all together in Tahrir Square," said George Issac, a member of the opposition group Kefaya, which means "Enough" in English. "Mubarak has been here since Ronald Reagan," shouted one man, who held up a sign that said "Get Out Mubarak" in English. "I'd like to see change in my country," El Sisi said, as he walked slowly with hordes of people through security checkpoints towards the square.
