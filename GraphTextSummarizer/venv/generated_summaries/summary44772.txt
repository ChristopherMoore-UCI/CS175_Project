-- When John Lennon remarked in 1966 that the Beatles were then "more popular than Jesus" his comments prompted outrage in the United States. John Lennon appears with wife Yoko Ono in 1968, two years after he made his "more popular than Jesus" comments. The reason it happened that way, in America particularly, is that people thought the Beatles were getting too big, too proud and it was a way of putting them down and I think people grabbed that opportunity. The Beatles were almost becoming a religion and exerting a spiritual force over people. A: The Beatles started out as atheists and agnostics and I think as everybody knows they became more interested in spiritual things.
