German investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz this week, according to published reports. Asked by a journalist about reports of Lubitz's possible mental illness, he replied: "The elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we cannot address these matters today. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday.
