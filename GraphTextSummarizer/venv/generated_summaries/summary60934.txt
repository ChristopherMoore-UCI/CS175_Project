Tebbutt's release came after lengthy negotiations between elders in Adado and local authorities, said Omar Mohammed Diirey, a regional administration official in central Somalia. "This, however, is a time when my joy at being safe again is overwhelmed by my immense grief, shared by Ollie and the wider family, following David's passing in September last year," she said. Gunmen fatally shot her husband, David Tebbutt, when he resisted, according to Kenyan police. Tebbutt was flown out of Adado, Somalia, to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Tebbutt was abducted from a safari lodge in the popular Kenyan tourist town of Lamu in September.
