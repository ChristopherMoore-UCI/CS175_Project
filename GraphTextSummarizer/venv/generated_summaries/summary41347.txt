It wasn't just that snow fell, but the type of snow -- heavy stuff that snapped branches and weighed down power lines, especially in Durham and Wake counties. North of Atlanta, Interstate 75 was in gridlock Wednesday afternoon. By early Thursday, the storm system had largely left the Deep South behind, instead spreading a blanket of white on the Carolinas and northward. There were more snow plows, more trucks to spread brine and they were out in force ahead of the bad weather. Other parts of the South found enough snow to put together more than your basic snowman.
