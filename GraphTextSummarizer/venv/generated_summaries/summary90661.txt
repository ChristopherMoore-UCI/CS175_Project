Adler said nuisance animals in Kentucky are customarily euthanized, but the show has given hundreds of animals "a second lease on life." Those activities include sedating a zebra in violation of federal rules, directing trappers to procure animals so they could be "caught" again as part of a script and wrongly completing legal documents. The accusations were made by the magazine Mother Jones, which alleged that "Call of the Wildman" staged animal rescues and said it found "evidence of a culture that tolerated legally and ethically dubious activities." USDA spokeswoman Tanya Espinosa said the Mother Jones article prompted the review. The notion that there is a culture of 'neglect' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd.
