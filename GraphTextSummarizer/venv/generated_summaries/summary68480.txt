Van Hollen said Peterson drove "aimlessly" through three Wisconsin counties and made false calls to authorities to "throw police off his tail." "Playing dead until Peterson left, Neitzel survived," Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said. The families of the six slain young people -- all current or former graduates of Crandon High School in Crandon, Wisconsin, asked that media leave them alone in their grief, Van Hollen told reporters. "They hold no animosity toward them," Van Hollen said, conveying the families' wishes that the Peterson family be allowed space and time to heal. Peterson argued with Jordanne Murray, accusing her of dating someone else, said Van Hollen.
