This is not the same storm that blanketed the Great Plains, said CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri, although it is part of the same overall system that spans the country from north to south. "Across the Southeast, some of the rainfall totals are going to be staggering," said CNN Meteorologist Karen McGinnis. The outgoing system will have made its mark on virtually the entire country from the southwest corner of California to central Maine, leaving its deepest imprint on Kansas. The white blanket emptied the streets of Kansas City. The snow set a record at Kansas City International Airport, with 9 inches falling in a single day.
