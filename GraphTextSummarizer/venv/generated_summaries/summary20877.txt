Hours before the debate, a new Quinnipiac University poll showed Progressive candidate Bill de Blasio grabbing the support of 43% of likely Democratic primary voters, with Bill Thompson at 20%, Christine Quinn at 18%, Anthony Weiner 7% and John Liu at 4%. Other candidates stressed the importance of early education, with Thompson noting the importance of an "intensive curriculum" and help with "professional development." "This is a city which has always believed in big, bold ideas," de Blasio said in response to a question from Thompson. During the debate, de Blasio came back numerous times to his proposal to tax anyone making more than $500,000 and put the money toward education. According to a New York Daily News article on Sunday, de Blasio, who created the list in 2010 in his role as public advocate, "went to bat" for one landlord with a "rash of violations" when the landlord steered donations his way.
