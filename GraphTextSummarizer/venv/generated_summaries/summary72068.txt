There is $60 million ($52.8 mil) earmarked by the Australian government for mapping and underwater search, and Australian expenditure is to be matched by Malaysian government. The Australian government said in August that it has picked Fugro Survey, a Dutch company for the mapping and the next phase of undersea search, along with a vessel, the GO Phoenix, supplied by the Malaysian government. The latter will, weather permitting, arrive at its assigned search zone late Sunday and, will deploy towed sonar to begin the search on on Monday and will conduct search activity for 12 days before going to Fremantle, in Western Australia, for resupply. Planes and ships from 14 countries initially searched areas of the South China Sea, south of Vietnam and the Malaysian peninsula. The Australian contingent, he says, is still discussing plans with their Malaysian colleagues on how to proceed in the event of a positive identification of plane wreckage.
