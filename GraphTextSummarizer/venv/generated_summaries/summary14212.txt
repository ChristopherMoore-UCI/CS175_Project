Hofman is known for his super-sized, colorful works of art, most recently the enormous inflatable rubber duck that floated around the waters of cities like Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, Auckland and Osaka. Thanks to Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, eagle-eyed visitors to London might just spot the three humps of an enormous hippo appearing from the Thames' murky depths. "I wanted to use the hippo to get people out of their homes, away from the Internet and the TV, and to explore London with a new perspective. Earlier this year, Hofman was asked to create a piece of artwork by the organizers of Totally Thames, an annual festival that celebrates London's famous river. " Like several of Hofman's other pieces, "HippopoThames" was inspired by everyday objects -- in this case a children's book that the artist's parents gave him for their grandchild.
