Among other touted features, it's the first commercial airliner made mostly of light-weight carbon composites, requiring less fuel than conventional airliners. The first Dreamliner engine problem occurred on July 28 during a taxi test at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina. In a third related development, a similar General Electric engine on a different kind of aircraft -- a GEnx-2B on a Boeing 747 -- lost power during takeoff last September 11 at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The NTSB identified the problem as a cracked fan midshaft on a Dreamliner General Electric GEnx-1B turbofan engine, the group said in a written statement posted on its website Thursday. That incident is under investigation by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the NTSB said.
