"This new Kennedy Library digital archives includes more than 200,000 digitized documents, the drafts of every speech delivered by the president, thousands of official white House photographs, and audio of all of President Kennedy's speeches and video of press conferences during his years in office," Ferriero said. Now, with advances in critical hardware and software, the most important papers, records, photographs and recordings from Kennedy's time in office will be available online. Caroline Kennedy, who attended Thursday's unveiling, believes that the digitization of her father's records will be useful to today's youth, in particular. "As of today, anyone in the world with access to the internet can now view, download and analyze the original records of the Kennedy administration at the click of a mouse." President Kennedy's example -- his words, his spirit -- are more relevant than ever," she said, "Using today's technology, we will be able to give today's generation access to the historical record and challenge them to answer my father's call to service, to solve the problems of our own time.
