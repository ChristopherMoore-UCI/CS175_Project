Rukhsar, 4, is the final documented case of polio in India. About one-third of those who contract polio in India are left paralyzed -- as was Rukhsar. Since Rukhsar's diagnosis three years ago, India has not seen another new case of polio. She's been invited to national events by Rotary International, the organization that led the effort to rid India of polio. "I thought she would never walk again." 'Hell of a big deal' When a global effort to end polio was launched in 1988, the disease crippled more than 200,000 children every year in India.
