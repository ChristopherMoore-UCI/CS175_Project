-- Soccer stars have plenty of spare time, and plenty of money, so this week's revelations of players gambling on events during English Premier League matches should come as no surprise. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) -- the union which represents the concerns of players in England and Wales -- refers cases of addiction to Sporting Chance, which offers residential care. Many sportsmen suffering from addiction problems have turned to the Sporting Chance Clinic, a charity set up by former England captain Adams. Former Southampton player Lundekvam is the latest to talk candidly about footballers' vices, revealing that he and other top-flight stars made money out of betting on minor events in games such as the first throw-in or corner kick. Lars Bohinen was an international teammate of Lundekvam's and enjoyed an eight-year Premier League career with Blackburn Rovers, Nottingham Forest and Derby County.
