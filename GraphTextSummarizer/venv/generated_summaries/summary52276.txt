"There's been no question that President Ahmadinejad has been damaged in this apparent power struggle with Iran's supreme leader," said Scott Peterson, Istanbul-based journalist and author of "Let the Swords Encircle Me." And the president's office published the following curt statement on its website Saturday: "Regarding the false accusations and rumors about President Ahmadinejad that certain news sites have published, this news is wrong and it's hereby rejected. Ahmadinejad's trip to attend a United Nations summit of the world's poorest countries is his first overseas journey since a public spat erupted between himself and Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. And the Islamic Republic News Agency published a series of photos on Sunday, showing Ahmadinejad seated at the left hand of Supreme Leader Khamenei at a ceremony commemorating the death of the daughter of the Prophet Mohammed. -- Dignitaries, a red carpet and a child with a bouquet of flowers greeted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he landed at Istanbul airport in Turkey on Monday.
