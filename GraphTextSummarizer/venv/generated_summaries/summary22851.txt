Quidilla said ballots or electronic voting machines were provided so that everyone who wanted to could still participate in the election, but one polling place, he said, stayed open two hours and 45 minutes late to accommodate people. In all, 69 precincts in Hawaii saw ballot shortages on Election Day and 23 of those ran out of ballots entirely, according to the state election office's spokesman. " Some precincts in Hawaii that ran out of ballots were those that nonpartisan volunteers like Joe Heaukulani devoted his weekends to canvassing, encouraging people to participate. At a time when so much energy in this country is spent on trying to prevent voter fraud, we should turn more of our attention to the experience of people who want to vote, play by the rules, and can't because it's simply too difficult. There are some obvious solutions here, including bumping up the number of ballots polling places have on hand, as well as investigating what went wrong with backup plans.
