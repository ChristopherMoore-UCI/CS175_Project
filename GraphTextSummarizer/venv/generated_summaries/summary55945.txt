" In the wake of the U.N. Security Council's failure to pass a resolution, Ahmet Davutoglu says like-minded countries should look for ways outside the United Nations system to end the killing and deliver aid to civilians under artillery attack from government forces, particularly in the besieged city of Homs. The State Department is also trying to find a way to provide humanitarian aid to Syrian civilians, which Davutoglu called a "must." "It is time for humanitarian access to these cities," he said, particularly referencing cities like Homs that are being shelled by Syrian forces.

"We wanted Assad to be Gorbachev, but he chose to be Syria's Milosevic said Davutoglu, comparing the parallels between the events in Syria and the massacres carried out by the former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, in Bosnia during the '90s.
