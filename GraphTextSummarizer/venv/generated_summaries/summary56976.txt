It is a month of fasting, reduced working hours, family time and quiet religious contemplation. Time matters for Gottschalk. "It's a lot of food," says Gottschalk. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque commissions Gottschalk's kitchen to prepare meals for people to break their fast at the mosque. During the weekend up to 35,000 people join the feast, to which both Muslims and non-Muslims are welcome.
