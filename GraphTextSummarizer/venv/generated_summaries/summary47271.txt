The Ready for Hillary National Finance Council meeting -- which is being held at the Sheraton Times Square in New York City -- is part rally, part history lesson for the Clinton supporters and will bring together top flight Democratic strategists, longtime Clinton supporters and at least three people rumored to be the former secretary of state's next campaign manager. The former secretary of state's most ardent supporters and organizers will meet Friday in New York City to discuss what now looks like an all-but-certain Hillary Clinton campaign for president. Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY's List; and Ace Smith, a political operative who worked for Clinton in 2008, have all been rumored as likely picks for Clinton's top campaign job. While the group will have a presence at the Ready for Hillary event -- founder David Brock will moderate a panel -- over three dozen Correct the Record donors will meet Friday in New York to discuss Clinton and the future. Brock, according to the source, will tell attendees that he has decided his group will continue through the 2016 election and will use their rapid response and research to push the message of the eventual Clinton campaign.
