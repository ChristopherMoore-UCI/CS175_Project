The defeat, the first time Arsenal had conceded eight goals in a league game since 1896, increased the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger, with new signings expected to arrive before the deadline for trades on Wednesday. -- Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick as champions Manchester United retained their 100% English Premier League record this season with a remarkable 8-2 thumping of injury-hit Arsenal at Old Trafford. United's performance was matched by the dazzling display of big-spending rivals Manchester City, with Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko scoring four goals in their rout of Tottenham at White Hart Lane. United dominated the Gunners who suffered their worst ever Premier League defeat. And Arsenal then wasted a golden chance to level when captain Robin Van Persie's penalty was saved by United keeper David De Gea after Jonny Evans pulled back Theo Walcott.
