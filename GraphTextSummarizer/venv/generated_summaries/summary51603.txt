It appeared that the man in question was properly credentialed to be in a secure area, but was working on a plane that he wasn't supposed to, FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said. US Airways Flight 1070 -- which police said was bound for Bermuda with 102 passengers and five crew members -- was towed to a secure part of the airport, where baggage was removed from the plane to be screened by bomb-sniffing dogs. The rest of the airport was fully operational and not affected by the incident, said spokeswoman Victoria Lupica. CNN's Carol Cratty, Jeanne Meserve, Ross Levitt and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report. The passengers remained in the terminal, said Todd Lehmacher, spokesman for US Airways.
