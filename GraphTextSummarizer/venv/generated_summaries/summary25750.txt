Keeping weapons from mentally ill proves elusive Currently, federal law prevents people who are under domestic violence protection orders or have misdemeanor domestic violence convictions from accessing guns. This year alone, leaders in six states -- Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Washington and Wisconsin -- have enacted legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support that will help protect abused women from gun violence. Democrats and Republicans in state legislatures around the country recognize the problem and have come together to pass laws that better protect women from gun violence. But we urgently need stronger gun laws that protect women. On Wednesday, the Senate will hold its first-ever hearing on domestic violence homicides and the use of gun violence against America's women.
