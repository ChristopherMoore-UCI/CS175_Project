In the largely male-dominated world of the motorsport, South African super bike racer Janine Davies is an anomaly. Despite her many accomplishments, Davies' introduction to bike riding wasn't smooth. So far, Davies' ambition has served her in good stead. This year, she debuted in the SuperM championship series, and won third place at the Phakisa Freeway in March. As a result of that accident, Davies fractured her neck, ribs, sternum and hand.
