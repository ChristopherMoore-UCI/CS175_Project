If you aren't able to fully hear and appreciate George Jones' voice, you really can't fully appreciate country music. George is a member of country music's greatest generation. From time spent together backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, visits at the home of George and his wife, Nancy, dinner at his favorite O'Charley's or Logan's Roadhouse, I cherished every moment in his presence, getting to hear firsthand accounts of stories I had read, the jokes and the laughter, the love between him and Nancy. George was a friend, a country music legend, an influence to me and to countless other musicians. People will always say that "He Stopped Loving Her Today" was George's best song and perhaps the greatest country song of all time.
