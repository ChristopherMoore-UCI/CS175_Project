Searchers used the trajectory of the helicopter and cell phone signals from Ruppert's phone to narrow down the rescue area. Authorities did not say how they determined the cell phone signal, and it was not clear whether he attempted to use it or if authorities were able to track the signal another way. Two friends who shared the price of a helicopter rental with Ruppert did not see whether his parachute opened on his second jump, authorities said. Ruppert was making his second jump from a helicopter above Washington's rugged Cascade Mountains when he went missing, they said. Authorities believe Ruppert jumped from an altitude of about 6,500 feet while wearing a special jumpsuit known as a "wingsuit," which allows a person to soar and glide before deploying a parachute.
