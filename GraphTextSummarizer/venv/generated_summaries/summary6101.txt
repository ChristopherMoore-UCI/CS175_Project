In this era of streaming and downloading, when everyone functions as his or her own DJ and program director, the "tastemaking" role of music radio in the late 20th century -- the role that Kasem pretty much owned -- is almost impossible to fathom. Kasem's long-distance dedications Easily accessible and free of charge, "America's Top 40" was a gateway drug for a generation or two of budding music fanatics. Casey Kasem was neither a maverick like pioneer rock & roll disc jockey Alan Freed nor a budding multimedia entrepreneur like Dick Clark. Kasem was the patron saint of preteen pop devotees held captive to their parents' car radios. No doubt this further endears him to a generation weaned on musty anachronisms such as network television and Top 40 radio.
