Added marine biologist Jose Bacallao of the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium: "I'm not going to speculate on any wackiness, but I will say you have years of temperature changes and we have had warmer waters.... "Certainly, pollution of plastics in the ocean is a huge concern and causes I don't know the number of deaths of marine animals," Dines said. The whale, a female, apparently was barely alive when it came ashore -- a highly unusual sight because beached whales are often badly decomposed or badly eaten by marine life, a local biologist said. This time, it's a saber-toothed whale, better known to live in deep Alaskan waters than in the warm surf of tourist-choked Venice Beach in Los Angeles where it stranded Wednesday. As for the oarfish, its 18-foot length was too big for one freezer, so scientists cut it up into small pieces and froze them, said Jeff Chace, program director of Catalina Island Marine Institute.
