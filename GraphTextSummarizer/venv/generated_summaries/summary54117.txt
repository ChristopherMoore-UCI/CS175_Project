On Wednesday, an ACLU attorney described Velez, now 49, as an innocent man who was put on death row for a crime he didn't commit. Velez pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of injury to a child "rather than face a new trial that could be plagued by the same injustices that sent him to death row," the ACLU said. Velez's initial court-appointed attorneys failed to discover that evidence, and "after his conviction, Manuel received the death penalty, largely because a state prison expert presented false testimony to persuade the jury that Manuel would pose a danger to society if given life without parole instead," the ACLU said. But in his statement Wednesday, Saenz pointed out that "at no point did any court, trial or appellate, or any jury make any finding that Mr. Velez was actually innocent of murdering Angel Moreno. During the trial, Velez's court-appointed lawyer also failed to "discover and present the testimony of the many witnesses who said the girlfriend threw, hit, and dropped the baby and abused her children, while Manuel was never physically rough and always peaceful," the ACLU said.
