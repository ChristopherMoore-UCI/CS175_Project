Already, some analysts say that opposition forces may be creating some areas of de facto control, along the border with Turkey and in eastern Syria, McCain said. McCain said any military aid should not include U.S. ground forces, but should include military might from allies of the United States, such as European and Arab countries. "Inaction denies us the opportunity to have influence with forces in Syria who will one day inherit the country, ceding that to foreign states that may not always share our values. " The Obama administration and much of the rest of the world have put their hopes of ending the 15 months of bloodshed on a peace plan put forth by U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan. " Failure to act could result in Syria becoming a failed state, riven by extremist violence and sectarian conflict, he said.
