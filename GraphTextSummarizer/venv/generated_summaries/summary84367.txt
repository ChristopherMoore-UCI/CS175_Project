" Winners were listed in one of eight categories: enduring classics, beach getaways, country retreats, trips of a lifetime, all-inclusive vacations, boutique chic, small hotels and modern city hotels. "Winning hotels have to be a Fodor's Choice hotel, have been visited by our team and be the best in their respective cities," Arabella Bowen, Fodor's Travel editor in chief, told CNN. A Fodor's team of 500 global contributors and Fodor's readers nominated thousands of hotels located all over the world. The winners were chosen by Fodor's senior editorial staff, which looked over hotels already chosen as Fodor's Choice picks and the other nominations. While top hotels in 43 countries on six continents made the list, the United States had the most hotels of any country with 20 properties.
