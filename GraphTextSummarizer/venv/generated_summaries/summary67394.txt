Runners cannot take the items anywhere near the 26-mile course, organizer Boston Athletic Association said in a statement Wednesday. "We are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year's Boston Marathon as a display of support," the statement said. " On April 15 last year, double bombings hit the Boston Marathon, which attracts elite runners from all over the world. The bombs placed in backpacks exploded near the finish line last year, killing three people. -- As part of revamped security following last year's deadly bombings, the Boston Marathon has banned various items for the 2014 race, including bags and strollers.
