According to British media, 187 so-called "comfort letters" were sent to suspected IRA terrorists such as Downey -- known as "on the runs" -- who sought clarification about their status after a peace settlement in 1998, known as the Good Friday Agreement, which brought the decades-long "troubles" in Northern Ireland to an end. One of the men accused of being behind the Hyde Park attack -- believed to have been carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) -- walked free this week after it emerged in court that he had a letter from the British government from 2007 -- the 25th anniversary of the bombings -- assuring him he did not face prosecution for IRA crimes. " British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, stressed the British government "does not support amnesties for people wanted by the police in connection with terrorist offenses," and that Downey "was part of an administrative scheme for dealing with 'on-the-runs' set up by the previous government." Pro-British paramilitary groups also remain active. The letters were part of a covert deal struck between the British government and republicans -- who bitterly opposed British rule -- to ease the reconciliation process.
