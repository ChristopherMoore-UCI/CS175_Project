Wolf doesn't know how much the park's owners paid for Little Mama, who was certainly no baby when she came to Lion Country Safari 45 years ago. The owners said that Little Mama was part of the Ice Capades, a traveling variety show that performed on ice across the United States, before she was acquired by the pet dealer, Wolf said. Laboratory chimps get a new lease on life When world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall visited the theme park in 1972, Wolf was anxious to introduce her to Little Mama. "Look at Cooper," said Wolf referring to the chimpanzee in the cage next to Little Mama. "She came here when the park opened in 1967," said Lion Country Safari Wildlife Director Terry Wolf, who has been with the park just as long.
