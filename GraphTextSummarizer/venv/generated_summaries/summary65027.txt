Other networks that provide content to TV5Monde include CNN affiliates France 2 and France 3, France 24 and Radio France International. As day broke Thursday in Europe, the network had regained the use of one of its 11 channels and its Facebook page, Paul Germain, the chain's editor in chief, told BFMTV, a CNN affiliate in France. " In addition to its 11 channels, TV5Monde lost control of its social media outlets and its websites, director Yves Bigot said in a video message posted later on Facebook. Television network TV5Monde was gradually regaining control of its channels and social media outlets after suffering what the network's director called an "extremely powerful cyberattack. It functions under a partnership among the governments of France, Canada and Switzerland, as well as the Wallonia-Brussels Federation.
