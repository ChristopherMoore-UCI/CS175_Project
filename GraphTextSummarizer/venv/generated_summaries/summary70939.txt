-- Syrian tanks stormed the flashpoint city of Hama Sunday in one of several clashes that rights groups said left more than 70 people dead and more than 100 injured nationwide. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said security forces were responding to "armed groups" in Hama who blocked streets with barricades and terrorized citizens by firing from the rooftops of buildings, while human rights groups described the arrival of tanks as a raid on the city. Three members of security forces were killed in clashes in Hama and three members of the military were killed in Deir Ezzour, SANA said. He said hospitals have begun calling people to come donate blood, but security forces have blocked the roads so people cannot reach the hospital. "Hama will be very harsh to them," said al Habbal, who lives in the city.
