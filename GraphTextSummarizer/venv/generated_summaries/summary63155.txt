One of those men was Mike O'Connor, who today combines the roles of president of the Federation for International FootGolf (FIFG) and president of UK FootGolf. Such concerns have led to the introduction on golf courses of 15 inch-wide holes -- about four times the width of a standard hole -- a relaxation in the game's rules, and of course, FootGolf. "I just knew FootGolf would be a bit of a no-brainer for the amount of golf courses there are, as well as the number of golfers and footballers," O'Connor told CNN of a game that involves players kicking a football around a golf course, complete with bigger holes. "Players travel from country to country because they love FootGolf and they love trying different courses," O'Connor said. "In five years' time, every country in the world that has got golf courses will be a member of the Federation for International FootGolf," O'Connor said.
