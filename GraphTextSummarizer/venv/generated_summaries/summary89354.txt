"This is something you would envision being science fiction, but in fact, it is real -- and it is so cool," said Pettis, who described the Digitizer as a great tool for archiving or replicating prototypes, models, parts, artifacts, sculptures and other objects "If something gets broken, you can just scan it and print it again. Four years ago an unknown startup called MakerBot showed up at the South by Southwest Interactive conference here with a prototype of its first desktop 3-D printer, which spit out plastic replicas of small objects. Called a MakerBot Digitizer, it's meant to complement the company's Replicator printer by letting customers scan objects, then feed the resulting digital files to the Replicator to be printed. "I think we can safely say that if there is a 3-D printing revolution, he is the commander in chief," said SXSW Interactive Director Hugh Forrest in introducing Pettis, MakerBot's CEO, on Friday. The process of 3-D printing uses computer-created digital models to create real-world objects -- everything from simple toys or jewelry to more complex objects with moving parts.
