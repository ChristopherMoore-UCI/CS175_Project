Dickens dropped Ignorance and Want from his hugely popular public reading version of the "Carol" (performed from 1858 onward), though he never stopped calling attention to the national scandal of the scavenging hordes of starving, uncared-for street children in London and Britain's other great cities (the first Education Act, which brought in compulsory state education at the elementary level for all working-class children, was passed in the year of his death). " These fearful apparitions were products of Britain's "Hungry Forties," when there was widespread economic distress and great fear of social breakdown, but it is part of Dickens' genius that he was recognizing here a theme that plays out everywhere, in every time and in every culture. As someone who sought in his own journals to fight against the depraving effect of cheap sensational literature produced by those he called "Panders to the basest passions of the lowest natures," he would certainly have been alarmed and horrified by the level of pop culture violence and quasi-pornography -- on TV, in magazines and video games. For Dickens, building a system of national education (something frustrated in his day by bitter disputes between the different religious denominations) and reforming sanitary (or public health) laws were the two things needing urgent attention from the nation's lawmakers. As a boy, Dickens worked long hours for about a year in a small-scale factory and later drew on this experience, to him deeply degrading, in the early chapters of "David Copperfield."
