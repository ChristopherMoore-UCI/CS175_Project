But the Georgia Tech faculty members had transformed several old buildings and an "uncanny" number of automotive spaces: A carriage house-turned-art gallery, a renovated a truck depot that became the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center and their own office, which is housed within a former Atlanta auto parts shop. In architecture, it's called adaptive reuse -- remaking old buildings for new purposes. "Or Hadash," members point out, means "new light" in Hebrew. "That was the first leap of imagination someone had to make, and it's a big leap," said architect Brian Bell, whose firm, BLDGS, worked on the synagogue. "It's nice to have room to spread out." Even now, there are reminders of the building's past -- they kept the same footprint, and some of the original exterior walls, steel structure and concrete blocks remain visible.
