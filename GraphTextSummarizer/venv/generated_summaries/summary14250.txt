New Yorkers could see 3 to 5 inches of snow Saturday afternoon and evening, followed by sleet and freezing rain overnight. When Bostonians wake up Sunday morning, they may find 8 to 14 inches of snow on the ground, with the same amount forecast north and west of the city and in New Hampshire. The storm was so bad that Newark Liberty International canceled 168 outbound flights on Saturday and Chicago O'Hare, which was hit by snow earlier in the day, canceled 102, according to the website Flightaware.com. The nation's capital will see a mix of rain, snow and sleet, and further to the south, the same system will bring cold and rain. The eastward moving storm dropped snow earlier across the Midwest and western Pennsylvania, with 9 inches reported in Urbana, Illinois, and 3.9 inches at O'Hare Airport outside Chicago.
