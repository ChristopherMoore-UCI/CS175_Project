Chilean star Arturo Vidal put Juve ahead after 57 minutes before Catania defender Giovanni Marchese was sent off mid-way through the second half. -- Bayern Munich's record winning start to the Bundesliga season came to an abrupt end Sunday as they were stunned 2-1 at home by Bayer Leverkusen. But the real arguments came in the first half as Catania thought they had gone ahead when Argentine striker Ruben Bergessio tapped home a rebound. Bayern drew level with 13 minutes remaining as striker Mario Mandzukic headed home, but Leverkusen were to enjoy their first win in Munich since 1989. The referee ruled it out to the fury of the home side and their president Antonino Pulvirenti, who was sent from the bench for dissent.
