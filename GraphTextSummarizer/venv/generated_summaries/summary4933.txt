A recent renewal of violence between the Sudanese government and armed movements has sparked concern among U.N. peacekeepers, said Ibrahim Gambari, who heads the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur. "I call upon all parties to refrain from further offensive military action and respect international humanitarian law," Gambari told reporters Sunday, according to a statement released by the U.N. CNN's Yousuf Basil and Catherine E. Shoichet  contributed to this report. Darfur, in western Sudan, has been beset by conflict since 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Arab militias with ties to the Sudanese government went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. A United Nations panel has arrived in the East African nation to monitor the 17-day registration effort, which will take place at 3,000 sites across the country and in eight countries abroad, the U.N. said.
