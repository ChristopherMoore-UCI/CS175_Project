He will work on "Scarpa," based on the life of organized crime member turned FBI informant Greg Scarpa, "after LAST BLOOD RAMBO," he tweeted last week. "First Blood," the story of a Vietnam veteran on the run, and its sequel "Rambo: First Blood Part II," about his quest to rescue U.S. prisoners of war, were hugely popular in the 1980s. They spawned a cartoon series and two more films: "Rambo III" in 1988 and 2008's "Rambo." John Rambo will live to fight again. He will play boxer Rocky Balboa in the upcoming movie "Creed," the seventh in the "Rocky" film series, scheduled for release in 2016.
