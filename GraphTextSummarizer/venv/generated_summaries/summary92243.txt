If you're like my friend and her man (who, against all odds, actually left his wife), this means that instead of talking about hearts, flowers, and butterflies -- like other new couples -- you spend your nights plotting how to hide assets and whether or not your overpaid lawyer is enough of a shark. "I met my boyfriend because I was his kids' nanny and then his wife found out, which is how I got this black eye," is definitely not a tale you're going to want to share at parties. But when their mirror (aka, partner) develops a flaw (weight gain, job loss, etc.), their image of themselves reflects that. -- an Overlapper. At the very least, you will never be fully able to trust an Overlapper.
