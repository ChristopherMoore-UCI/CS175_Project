And just as the nature of "Doctor Who" is change, Smith said fans will also embrace Coleman's Clara. Coleman played a surprise role in last September's season premiere -- as Oswin, a different character from Clara, but one connected to her -- and takes on full companion duties in "The Snowmen" Christmas episode, airing December 25 at 9 p.m. ET. During a recent interview at BBC America's Manhattan offices, she offered insight about her character and her relationship with The Doctor, and weighed in on Clara's soufflÃ© obsession, driving a spaceship, her Bond Girl moment and Christmas traditions. Known to American audiences from the April 2012 ABC miniseries "Titanic," and for a brief role in 2010's "Captain America: The First Avenger," she joins "Doctor Who" as Clara/Oswin, a companion to The Doctor, a mysterious, human-looking "Time Lord." It's been interesting how it's changed Matt's Doctor.
