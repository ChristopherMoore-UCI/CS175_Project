Elliot Rodger, 22, ended the Friday night rampage near the University of California, Santa Barbara, apparently by fatally shooting himself in the head while sitting behind the wheel of his wrecked BMW, Sheriff Bill Brown said. The suspect formerly was a student at Santa Barbara City College and lived in Isla Vista, where the rampage occurred. In a statement on its website Saturday, UC Santa Barbara said several students were taken to local hospitals after the shooting. All were UC Santa Barbara students. "We know our students co-mingle with UCSB students and Isla Vista residents as part of our greater community and we all, as an extended family, are impacted by this unimaginable event."
