The United States and the European Union "stand with the people of Ukraine" in their fight for the right to choose alliances with countries other than Russia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday. He suggested European politicians were encouraging Ukraine actions that they would punish as violations of the law in their own countries. 'Time is on our side' European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also highlighted events in Ukraine as he opened the second day of the conference Saturday. " Van Rompuy said he and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso had had "a frank exchange" with Putin this week at an EU-Russia summit in Brussels, Belgium. His comments come after a week of political tumult in which Ukraine's Prime Minister and Cabinet have resigned, a controversial anti-protest law has been repealed and the President has signed off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters.
