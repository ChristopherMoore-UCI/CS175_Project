The Plains and Midwest should get ready for another big dose of cold, very much like the early winter storm that struck last week, CNN meteorologists said. The mercury will plummet on Monday and Tuesday in the Northeast and Southeast, the CNN weather team reported Saturday. While not the snow maker of this past week, the storm could drop 1-3 inches on bigger cities such as Kansas City, St. Louis and Minneapolis. The early winter storm that socked much of the United States with cold weather last week is expected to make an encore performance. The weather should head back to normal by next weekend for the South, Southeast and Rockies.
