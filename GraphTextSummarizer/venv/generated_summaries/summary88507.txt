Camara has suspended the government, constitution, political parties and trade unions and formed his own government, Africa News reporter Mamdou Dian Donghol Diallo told CNN on Wednesday. -- The leader of this week's coup in Guinea assured senior officials Thursday "they are safe," a journalist with the state-run newspaper told CNN. In effect, that makes Camara president of Guinea, which was thrown into turmoil Monday after the death of President Lansana Conte. To appease the unions and end the unrest, the Factbook says, Conte named a new prime minister in March 2007. The country did not hold democratic elections until 1993, when Conte was elected president.
