-- The governor of Cameroon's Far North Region on Thursday said threats posed by militant Islamist group Boko Haram were "very critical." Speaking in Mokolo, Gov. Joseph Beti Assomo told reporters that all senior state security officials, divisional heads and religious leaders have been put on the alert. Recent weeks have seen an escalation in clashes between Boko Haram and security forces in Nigeria's northeastern states of Borno and Yobe, as well as attacks on churches and assassinations. Boko Haram (which according to the group means "Western civilization is forbidden") is demanding the imposition of Islamic sharia law across Nigeria. The Far North Region is largely Muslim and shares a border with northern Nigeria, where the Boko Haram is based. Cameroon's regional governments have intensified rigorous checks after Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan ordered border closures with some neighboring countries, including Cameroon, due to threats from the Boko Haram.
