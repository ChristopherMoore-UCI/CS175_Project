Not only does this hope stand in the face of political history, it disregards the fact that, in politics, truths are felt as much as they're known. -- Imagine that a state creates a "ministry of truth" whose job it is to referee elections to make sure that candidates and activists didn't insinuate, exaggerate or otherwise spin their messaging. No state agency can change this fact, and any attempt to do so stifles vital political speech. Laws such as Ohio's are so absurd as to be laughable -- except that criminalizing political speech isn't funny. Yet "truthiness" -- a "truth" asserted "from the gut" or because it "feels right" -- is a key part of political discourse.
