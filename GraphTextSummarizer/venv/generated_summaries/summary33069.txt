"We knew Cubestormer 3 had the potential to beat the existing record, but with the robot performing physical operations quicker than the human eye can see, there's always an element of risk," said David Gilday, who built the robots along with co-inventor Mike Dobson. While they were at it, Gilday also set a couple of other Rubik's Cube records over the weekend. Gilday is an engineer with ARM, the company that makes the souped-up processors in the Samsung Galaxy S4 used to power Cubestormer 3. Cubestormer 3, a robot built with Legos and powered by a smartphone, shattered its predecessor's record over the weekend, solving the iconic '80s puzzle in just over 3.25 seconds. That mark narrowly bested the best human time of 5.5 seconds, set by Mats Valk of the Netherlands last year.
