Watch how the still-pungent acid destroyed Bahrami's clothes Â» Two weeks after the attack, Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court. When Bahrami stood up in class and screamed for him to stop, Movahedi just looked at her in stunned silence. "I'm doing this to prevent it from happening to someone else." Bahrami says she first crossed paths with Movahedi in 2002, when they attended the same university. Bahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi kept harassing her and making threats, even as he asked her to marry him. Bahrami's lawyer, Ali Sarrafi, said Movahedi had never shown any remorse.
