-- More than 2 feet of snow piled up at the nation's capital as a blizzard pounded mid-Atlantic states Saturday, cutting power to hundreds of thousands in the region in what the president referred to as "Snowmaggedon. About 25.5 inches of snow fell at American University in Washington over two days, inching the city toward the snowfall record. "We are getting absolutely clobbered this morning with snow," said Steven Steingard, a lawyer who lives in suburban Philadelphia. Flights were canceled at the Washington-Baltimore area's three main airports and at Philadelphia International Airport. " Snow fell from southern Indiana eastward to New York, Washington, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the New Jersey coast, gripping states and snarling traffic.
