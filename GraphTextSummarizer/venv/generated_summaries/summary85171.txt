Cameron said British combat forces would remain in Afghanistan well into 2014, when NATO's International Security and Assistance Force, or ISAF, is due to hand over security to Afghan forces and withdraw. The attack in eastern Afghanistan followed a similar shooting in December by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers' regiment. "Afghanistan because of that help is now ready to take more and more responsibility." U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Friday that France's decision to withdraw its forces early "was not precipitous" and had been worked through with its ISAF partners and the Afghan authorities. After meeting with Karzai in Paris Friday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that France would be pulling all of its combat troops out of Afghanistan in 2013, a year ahead of schedule. France, which has been involved in Afghanistan since July 2003, has 3,935 troops there now, according to ISAF.
