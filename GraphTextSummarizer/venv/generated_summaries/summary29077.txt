Bureau County Sheriff John Thompson, quoted by the Bureau County Republican newspaper, said no injuries had been reported and no homes or other structures were on fire. -- A train derailment in northern Illinois early Friday prompted the evacuation of 800 people and left several freight cars burning, authorities said. The Red Cross opened a shelter at the high school in nearby Princeton and were providing services for more than 25, agency spokeswoman Kasey Kelly said. Smoke swirled over the derailment scene in the small town of Tiskilwa as the National Transportation Safety Board formed a six-person team to investigate. Several fire departments responded, including the Ottawa Fire Department about an hour from the scene.
