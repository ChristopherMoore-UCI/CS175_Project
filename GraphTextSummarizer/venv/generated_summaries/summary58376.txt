Tremors were also felt Saturday in Kech district, Khuzdar, Kalat and other towns of Balochistan province. The 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck in Balochistan province Saturday about 96 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Awaran, the United States Geological Survey said. Militants fighting for a separate state in Balochistan operate out of part of Awaran district, which has been the site of bombings. But Rasheed Baloch, deputy commissioner for Awaran district, told CNN more than 60 mud-walled buildings had collapsed in the Nok Jo area of the district. "More than 100 injured are now outside Awaran hospital," local journalist Muhammad Tariq told CNN.
