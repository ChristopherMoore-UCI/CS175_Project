This training can teach freelancers how to assess risk and spot danger, handle a crisis, support others and give vital first aid. Although our focus is specifically on freelancers, we are only one of the many organizations that exist to support journalists worldwide. Our Trust works with freelancers on a daily basis -- helping them, helping their families, and sometimes working with them to help other freelancers. We offer online resources on safety & security for those reporting from dangerous environments, and run a Training Fund that provides bursaries for freelancers to enable them to undergo hostile environments training before travelling to a conflict zone. Over the past two years, around 70 journalists have been killed covering the conflict in Syria, and a further 20 journalists currently remain missing, including freelancer Austin Tice.
