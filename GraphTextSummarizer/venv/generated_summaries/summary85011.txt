A 2012 survey of the prison population by the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in eight of Mexico's federal prisons found that the majority of the prisoners, 60%, were in jail for drug crimes. In support, the United States has  provided more than  $100 million to help Mexico fully adopt the adversarial justice system and to address weaknesses in criminal justice institutions. As the Mexican government has stepped up its efforts to combat drug trafficking, the number of people who have been detained and accused of crimes related to drugs has dramatically increased. Mexico's justice system has a reputation for being rife with corruption -- with officials too often accused of negotiating with criminals or demanding or accepting bribes to set someone free. The Washington Office on Latin America and Transnational Institute did a study on drug laws in Latin America, including Mexico.
