-- A Manhattan grand jury is investigating the beating death of a man in New York's Union Square as a possible hate crime, New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner John McCarthy told CNN Tuesday. Redrick, who police say uses several aliases, including Lashawn Marten, has been charged with three counts of assault -- one of them a felony. Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, was pronounced dead Monday, five days after being beaten by a man who allegedly said, "I'm gonna punch out the first white guy I see," according to police commissioner Ray Kelly. He told CNN Redrick has not had a psychiatric evaluation and has not been asked to undergo such an examination. Redrick has been arrested and charged with aggravated harassment, assault, trespass and drug possession, a law enforcement source told CNN, but the outcomes of those cases were unclear.
