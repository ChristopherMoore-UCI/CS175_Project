State-run TV also said Morsy supporters were attacking police stations, hospitals and government buildings in areas outside Cairo, despite a state of emergency declared Wednesday by the military-backed interim government that limits public gatherings and gives more power to security forces to make arrests. "The protests never stopped throughout the night and we will continue our sit-ins and demonstrations all over the country until democracy and the legitimate rule are restored in Egypt," Muslim Brotherhood leader Essam Elerian said Thursday. Adding to the tension, the Interior Ministry announced that police would be using live ammunition to fend off any further attacks on government buildings or security forces. -- A day after at least 580 died amid ferocious clashes between protesters and security forces, Egypt's government defended its actions in the face of sweeping condemnation -- insisting its troops fired in self-defense and weren't even responsible for many of the deaths. In addition to the hundreds killed, the Egyptian Health Ministry reports more than 4,000 were injured Wednesday in clashes that began when security forces moved in to break up protesters demonstrating in support of Morsy, according to state TV.
