Approximately 10 militants charged the police station, tossed grenades and then opened fire in the predawn attack, said senior police official Sohail Khalid. Wednesday morning's attack was proof that reports of the cease-fire were false, Ehsan told CNN by phone. It comes one day after Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan denied reports that the militant group had declared a cease-fire while holding peace talks with the government. The militants escaped after an hour-long firefight with police, Khalid said. The attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan, a district that sits next to Pakistan's militant-plagued tribal region along the Afghan border.
