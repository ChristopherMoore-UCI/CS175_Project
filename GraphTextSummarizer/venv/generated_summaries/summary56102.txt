There's something oddly inspiring about seeing someone who was crushed on "The Bachelor" find love in real life. So we're happy that he finally found love and asked Angye McIntosh to marry him last year. According to RadarOnline, before she left for the trip, Stephen tweeted, "The love of my life leaves me today to go home to Georgia :( ." Six months later they were engaged and they tied the knot last December, having their first kiss as a married couple to an instrumental version of the "Monday Night Football" theme song. One of DeAnna's good friends is Holly Durst, a contestant on "The Bachelor" who was let go by Matt Grant.
