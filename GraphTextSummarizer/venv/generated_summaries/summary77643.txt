On Saturday, a roadside bomb killed 10 Afghan police officers in Kandahar province, according to Police Chief Matiullah Khan. Also on Sunday, dozens of Taliban militants were killed after they ambushed a convoy carrying supplies for NATO forces in southern Afghanistan, an Afghan official said. Five security forces who worked for a private company were killed in the attack, in Zabul province, said Gulab Shah Alikhail, the deputy governor. -- Security was tightened in and around Kabul on Sunday with 7,000 additional police officers deployed ahead of Monday's 89th observance of Afghanistan's independence from Great Britain. Khan blamed the Taliban and their al Qaeda associates for the attack.
