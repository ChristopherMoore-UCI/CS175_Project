What Cantor will do for Moelis merits scrutiny because the ability to hire a marquee name like Eric Cantor means that his new bosses and shareholders have a substantial leg up, not just on the competition, but on civil servants whose job it is to produce policy that serves the public rather than private interest. The revolving door lures them away from the public service to work on behalf of elite interests that are elite, in part, because they're already investing big money to play the Washington Game. -- After an unexpected loss in the Republican primary, former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor resigned from Congress and nabbed the brass ring: A lucrative vice chairmanship at boutique investment firm Moelis & Co., along with a slot on its board of directors. Both sides have serious conflicts of interest. If members of Congress want to know how positions favored by various interests would affect their district, state or the national interest, they have to do their own due diligence by hunting down a source for credible, expert, unbiased research or produce it themselves.
