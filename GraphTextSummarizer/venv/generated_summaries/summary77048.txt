The impact of fighting and preparing for climate change may be greater than the effect of global warming itself, Fingar said. "Government, business and public efforts to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to deal with climate change -- from policies to reduce greenhouse gases to plans to reduce exposure to climate change or capitalize on potential impacts -- may affect U.S. national security interests even more than the physical impacts of climate change itself," he said. The report, the "National Intelligence Assessment on the National Security Implications of Global Climate Change to 2030," relied on U.S. government, military, academic and United Nations studies of climate change. International migration may also help spread disease, Fingar added, and climate change could put stress on international trade in essential commodities. Fingar painted a mixed picture of the effects of climate change on the United States itself.
