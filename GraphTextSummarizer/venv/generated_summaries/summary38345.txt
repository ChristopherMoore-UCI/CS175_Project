Clean up these crooks on Wall Street," said City Council Member Charles Barron. -- Protesters will resist any efforts to remove them from the Lower Manhattan park where they have been camped for nearly a month, despite Mayor Michael Bloomberg's order that they vacate the park at 7 a.m. Friday so it can be cleaned, an organizer said Thursday. The rules prohibit camping or pitching tents; lying on the ground or on benches; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground; using bicycles, skateboards or skates; and storing personal property that interferes with park use. "Come tomorrow morning, we will passively resist and make it as difficult a process to remove us as possible," said Occupy Wall Street spokesman Tyler Combelic. The cleaning is to be done in stages, and protesters will be allowed to return to the park as areas are cleaned if they obey the rules set forth by the owners, Brookfield Properties, the statement said.
