Yates had divorced Boomtown Rats singer Bob Geldof in 1996 after starting a relationship with INXS frontman Michael Hutchence. Bob Geldof later adopted Yates and Hutchence's daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. -- Police were on Tuesday investigating the death of model and TV personality Peaches Geldof, the 25-year-old daughter of Irish musician and Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof and TV presenter Paula Yates. "My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts every day," husband Tom Cohen said in a statement. But the following year Hutchence committed suicide in a hotel room in Sydney, Australia, and in 1998 Yates lost custody of the three daughters she had with Geldof -- Peaches, Pixie and Fifi.
