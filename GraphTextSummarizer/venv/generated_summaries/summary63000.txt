The agreement ended a private session at a Los Angeles County courthouse among Berk, ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry and his lawyer, Shawn Holley, Thursday afternoon. Berry, who pays Aubry child support under the shared custody agreement, was told she cannot move to Paris with the child unless Aubry goes there as well. In his statement, Aubry said: "While he was attacking me physically, Mr. Martinez said to me in an aggressive and threatening voice, 'You cost us $3 million. Aubry, in a sworn statement that helped him gain a temporary restraining order against Martinez on Monday, said the fight was apparently motivated by the custody battle, which Berry recently lost. While the lawyers would not elaborate on what the agreement covers, the fiancÃ©, Olivier Martinez, and Aubry, have each taken legal action against the other after the Thanksgiving Day scuffle at Berry's Hollywood Hills home.
