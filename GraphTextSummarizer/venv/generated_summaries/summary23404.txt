"The choice of cardinals of Burkina Faso and Haiti shows concern for people struck by poverty," he is quoted as saying by Vatican Radio. Two of the newly appointed cardinals already hold top Vatican positions -- Archbishop Pietro Parolin is its secretary of state, while Archbishop Gerhard Mueller is head of the church's chief doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. No Americans were named among the new members of the college of cardinals, but there is one Canadian, Quebec Archbishop Gerald Cyprien Lacroix. Commenting last month on the clergy named by Francis, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi highlighted the geographical range and diversity of the countries they come from. The new cardinals come from countries around the world, hailing from as far afield as Brazil, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, South Korea and Haiti.
