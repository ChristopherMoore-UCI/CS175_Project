John A. Novak, assistant director of the service, dismissed a black colleague's suggestion that the agency hold regional meetings to improve communications by saying such meetings are "nothing but traveling minstrel shows with people with banjos and guitars," said a senior government official familiar with the investigation. Officials with the federal Transportation Security Administration, which includes the air marshal service, confirmed Tuesday that Novak had been reassigned from his post as head of field operations, pending an investigation. Several officials who claimed lengthy work experience with Novak said he has no history of making racist or racially tinged comments. In recent years, numerous federal air marshals -- plainclothes officers who protect planes from terrorists -- have complained of unequal treatment. Novak recently helped coordinate a series of meetings with regional offices on how to handle Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints, one official said.
