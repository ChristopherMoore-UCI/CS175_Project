There is a slim chance of snow on Thursday, followed by days of sunshine and temperatures near 40 by Monday. More snow is expected from this system, but it's not likely to be enough to break the record as the forecast models indicate the majority of snow will stay south of the city. The National Weather Service warned that flooding could be an issue, especially across the lower Ohio Valley and western Mid-Atlantic regions. "Just celebrated the coming snow with a bowl of Moose Tracks," tweets country music legend Charlie Daniels. "Dear Mr. Heat Miser, please reclaim Dallas from your obnoxious half brother Snow Miser," tweets Dandy Killeen.
