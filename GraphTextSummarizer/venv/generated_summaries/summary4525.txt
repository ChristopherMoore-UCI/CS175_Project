Ex-PTA president accused of making child porn at elementary school It was these chats -- which included discussions about abducting, raping, murdering and eating children, according to court documents -- that put Portway on the radar screen of police. Geoffrey Portway, 40, was also ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution to five children whose images were found in online chats by Portway, according to court documents. -- A Boston-area man who plotted to kidnap children, rape and eat them, was sentenced Tuesday to more than 26 years in prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release, according to court documents from the United States district attorney's office. " Online chats, seized by police, showed Portway calling his basement a "dungeon" where he intended to "keep kidnapped children while he sexually abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the children," authorities said. His home in Worcester was searched last year and authorities found tens of thousands of computer images and videos of child pornography, 4,500 exchanges of child pornography between Portway and the people he chatted with online.
