Forriest often entertains Eagles fans with his singing outside the stadium, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. It was on the back of his motorized wheelchair when an intoxicated woman in Eagles gear jumped in his lap and broke his microphone, he told CNN affiliate KYW. Police in Philadelphia are looking for a woman who allegedly ran off with Sonny Forriest Jr.'s fake limb outside Lincoln Financial Field during the Eagles game on Sunday night. And who could forget what could be the largest one-sided snowball fight in history, when Eagles fans pelted the Dallas Cowboys team in 1989? In fact, city officials installed a courtroom in the old Eagles' stadium in the late 1990s just to sentence unruly fans.
