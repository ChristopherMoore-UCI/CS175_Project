In a new epilogue to her book "The End of Men: And the Rise of Women," Hanna Rosin wrote that, thanks in part to strong political women like Kirsten Gillibrand, Tammy Baldwin and Claire McCaskill, the patriarchy is officially dead. She was promptly fired by the Food Network and lost endorsements with, among others, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Target, and Sears. Even one of the year's more inspiring messages for women contained elitist notes: In calling for women to "lean in" to their careers, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg assumed that all women want to "have it all" -- or even want the same things, period. For every errant twerk, pop culture saw its share of positive messages for women, including Malala Yousafzai's "I Am Malala" -- a Pakistani girl's tale of being shot by the Taliban for speaking out about the rights of women -- and the consistent challenging of the Hollywood body ideal in Lena Dunham's "Girls." -- It was a big year for women, 2013.
