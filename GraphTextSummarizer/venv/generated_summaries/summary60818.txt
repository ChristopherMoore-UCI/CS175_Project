A Justice Department official previously told CNN that counterespionage agents had gathered information on the couple and set up an April 15 meeting at which an FBI undercover agent convinced the couple he had been contacted by Cuban intelligence and was to ascertain the scope of their activities. An affidavit released by the court said Kendall Myers first traveled to Cuba in 1978 and Cuban intelligence then began to develop him as a Cuban agent. The indictment said Kendall Myers, known to Cuban intelligence as Agent 202, and Gwendolyn Myers, known as Agent 123 and Agent E-634, engaged in activities "which spanned nearly three decades. According to court documents, the couple disclosed they had received coded messages via short-wave radio, had met with Cuban agents in Mexico and had been carefully watching for any sign of U.S. surveillance. The couple, who appeared in U.S. District Court on Friday, were captured June 4 after an FBI agent posing as a Cuban intelligence officer managed to coax them into offering information on U.S. government personnel, authorities said.
