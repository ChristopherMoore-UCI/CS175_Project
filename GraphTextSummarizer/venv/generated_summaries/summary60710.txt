Mortar fire hammered a college in Syria's capital, the government and rebels said, killing at least 10 people. The crisis in Syria began two years ago when the government of Bashar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protesters. State media earlier said 15 people were killed but eventually changed the toll to 10 dead in mortar fire by "terrorists" -- the name the government uses to describe anti-government groups. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 12 people died in the incident. One official who helped a failed effort to bring about a cease-fire in Syria says it's time for a bit of a change.
