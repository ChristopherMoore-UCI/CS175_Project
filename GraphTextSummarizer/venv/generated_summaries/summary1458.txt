The cause of the crush at Qinji Elementary School in Hubei province is still under investigation, the state-run news agency Xinhua said in a short report. A photograph carried by Xinhua showed one of the students injured in the crush, Zhang Jiali, receiving treatment on a bed in a hospital in Laohekou City in Hubei. A number of stampedes have taken place at Chinese schools in recent years. In 2009, eight students were killed and 26 were injured in an incident at a middle school in Hunan province. A total of 11 children were injured in the stampede, authorities in Laohekou said on their microblog account.
