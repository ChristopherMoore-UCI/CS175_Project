But I understand why facts might not make much difference to many people. Many people have made up their minds and refuse to listen to other points of view -- newly discovered facts and evolving evidence be damned. But Trayvon Martin has become a rallying cry for all the wrong that still exists in America regarding race and unequal treatment in the criminal justice system. They flatly reject any scenario other than that of George Zimmerman racially profiling Trayvon Martin and then shooting and killing him. George Zimmerman deserves to have his case decided on its merits and not as public retribution for societal sins.
