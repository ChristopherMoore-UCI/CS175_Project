Her younger sister Serena, unbeaten on clay in 16 matches this season, will next face Italy's Flavia Pennetta after her 6-3 6-1 win over Spain's Anabel Medina Garrigues. "It was difficult to play in the wind, but it was the same for both of us," Djokovic conceded ahead of his quarterfinal against world No. 5 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who beat Madrid semifinalist Juan Martin del Potro 6-4 6-1. "Conditions were difficult and windy but I think I found rhythm and after third game I played very solid," Nadal said.
