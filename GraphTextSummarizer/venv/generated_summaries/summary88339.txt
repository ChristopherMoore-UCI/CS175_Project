Gibson said he expects to "take action" against officials at a particular VA medical center this week after receiving more information from the VA's Office of Inspector General. Gibson has toured VA medical centers in three cities in the last week, meeting with hospital staff and outlining his plan to reform the embattled federal health care system that has delayed or failed to provide appointments for more than 120,000 veterans in the past decade, according to an internal VA audit. At a news conference on May 21, Obama said, "Anybody found to have manipulated or falsified records at VA facilities has to be held accountable." Obama named Gibson, the former president and CEO of the USO, the VA's interim secretary after Eric Shinseki resigned May 30. Although he said problems with manipulated wait lists in the VA are systemic, Gibson is not aware of any individuals being terminated outside of Phoenix. -- The director of the embattled Phoenix VA Health Care System remains on the government's payroll more than four weeks after President Barack Obama pledged to hold accountable Veterans Affairs officials involved in fraudulent scheduling practices.
