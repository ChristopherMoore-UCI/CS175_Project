Along with parents, the Chinese government is also interested in giving talented children an early start on their careers. For about $880, Chinese parents can sign their kids up for the test and five days of summer camp in Chongqing, where the children will be evaluated in various settings from sports to art. But according to Chinese scientists, this is the first time the test is being offered to children in China to help discover their natural talents. Children as young as two are regularly hand-picked by the government to represent China on the international stage. It seems that some of children may have grand ambitions all of their own.
