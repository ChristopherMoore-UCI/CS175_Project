Coronel's arrest is one of the most significant blows to organized crime in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. Authorities said Coronel is the father of Guzman's third wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, whom he married in 2007. The Sinaloa cartel is one of Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking operations, and Forbes has estimated Guzman's net worth at $1 billion. " Weapons and packets of marijuana were seized in Tuesday's operation, but no shots were fired, said Eduardo Sanchez Hernandez of Mexico's interior ministry. The high-profile arrest comes two days before U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in Mexico.
