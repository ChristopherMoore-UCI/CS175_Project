Gerald Ford, "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe" (1976): When President Ford said these words during a televised debate with Democrat Jimmy Carter, in an effort to counteract right-wing criticism about his policy of dÃ©tente with the Soviet Union, Democrats pounced on the statement to claim that the president was not competent on foreign policy. The statement was used by Democrats to attack Republican economic policies, connecting McCain to the unpopular President George W. Bush. -- Late last week, the campaigns of President Obama and Mitt Romney released Web videos highlighting the mistakes their rivals have made on the campaign trail. The statement was prime fodder for GOP commercials to demonstrate Sen. Kerry's flip-flopping and the inability of the Democratic Party to take a tough stand on foreign policy. George Romney, "Just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get when you go over to Vietnam" (1967): Michigan Gov. Romney, Mitt's father, then seen as one the most promising Republicans in the party because of his ability to compete for moderate voters, said this upon returning from the war's front lines.
