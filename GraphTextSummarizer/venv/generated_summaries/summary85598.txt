It requires abandoning the mirage of export-led growth as a savior for the eurozone, and vigorous efforts to stoke demand by increasing government spending and promoting wage growth. Only this will lead to a virtuous circle of borrowing, lending, and growth, and a sustainable rate of price growth. After a brief period of fiscal stimulus in 2009, the eurozone has pursued an austerity agenda that compounds the weakness of private demand by shrinking public demand. There's no encouragement to spend today to avoid higher prices tomorrow -- indeed, falling prices make putting off purchases attractive. The idea is to force the countries of the eurozone periphery become more competitive through cutting costs and especially wages, enabling growth through exports rather than domestic demand.
