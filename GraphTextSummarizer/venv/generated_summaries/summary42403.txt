In an interview with police on New Year's Eve, Strothers said that her friend "appeared upset" and told her "she felt as if someone was attempting to hurt her." "She also stated that Ms. English was acting out of character, and began discussing the end of the world and quoting biblical scriptures," said the police report. He said that he left around 10:30 p.m. on December 26, after English "began asking him if he was Satan" and told him to leave "her residence immediately." A friend, Michelle Strothers, told police that she last saw English on that day or the next one. Robert Kirk, a St. Louis man who had stayed with her December 24-26, said English was "acting peculiar and out of character" during the stay, adding that "she began screaming in the apartment and shouting biblical scriptures and indicating that the world was coming to an end," a police report said. Earlier, English's mother and stepfather told police that they typically talked with her "several times a week" and became worried after she did not answer their calls since they last talked with her on Christmas. English's abandoned car was discovered, with the motor running, in Atlanta in late December.
