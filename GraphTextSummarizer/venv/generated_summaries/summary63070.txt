Okinawa was the site of the last major campaign for U.S. forces in the Pacific during World War II. Much of the U.S. assistance to Japan after last year's earthquake was launched from Okinawa bases. In 1996, spurred in part by Japanese anger on Okinawa, Washington and Tokyo signed an agreement to reduce the amount of land being occupied by U.S. forces. Opposition to the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa runs so deep that it contributed to the resignation of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in 2010. At its height, U.S. military operations on Okinawa accounted for about 20 percent of the land use on the island chain.
