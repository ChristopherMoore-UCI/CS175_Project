John Senden set the clubhouse target with a four-under 67 at Riviera Country Club, then was joined by fellow Australians Robert Allenby and Aaron Baddeley, Britain's Martin Laird, Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Americans Spencer Levin, Ben Martin, Bill Haas and J.B. Holmes. Of that group, Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee and Indian Jeev Milkha Singh can both pass his total of eight-under 136 when they complete their final seven holes on Saturday. An incredible nine players shared the lead after the opening round of the PGA Tour's Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles on Thursday. Americans Paula Creamer and Juli Inkster were tied for fourth on five under, shooting 70 and 73 respectively to be level with Japan's Momoko Ueda (69) and South Korea's Na Yeon Choi (70). Meanwhile, Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello holds a one-shot lead after the fog-delayed second round of the men's European Tour event in India.
