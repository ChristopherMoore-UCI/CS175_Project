" Fleming had always maintained that he was on a family trip to Disney World in Florida when Rush was shot to death early on the morning of August 15, 1989, in a dispute over stolen money. In the course of the investigation, the Conviction Review Unit found the receipt in police records, time stamped and dated -- solidifying Fleming's claim that he was in Florida at the time of the crime, according to the district attorney's office. At Fleming's initial trial, defense lawyers provided family photos and home videos of Fleming in Florida around the time of Rush's killing. Fleming told his attorneys he had paid a bill for phone calls made from his Florida hotel room the night before Rush was killed, and he believed the receipt was in his pocket when police arrested him. "It has been a struggle since he got out," Koss said, adding that the damages Fleming is seeking include the loss of wages, companionship and emotional anguish.
