In 1998 they celebrated their golden anniversary; Zatopek asked Dana to marry him during the 1948 London Olympics where he had won gold in the 10,000 and silver over 5,000. Zatopek was not a pretty runner, he ran with a tortured style, his head lolling from side to side, but he was a trendsetter, the first to really push the limits in training. As Zatopkova recalled it was not an immediate demotion, because with the 1968 Mexico Olympics taking place, Zatopek was in the media spotlight. When he later opened it, Clarke was dumbfounded -- it was one of Zatopek's golds from Helsinki. The closest any athlete has come to match Zatopek's triple was indeed a Finn, Lasse Viren, who won the 5,000-10,000 double at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal and finished fifth in the marathon.
