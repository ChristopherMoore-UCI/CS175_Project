Authorities in Oruzgan province said Haji Sulaiman, 45, was the one who held Bibi Aisha at gunpoint and ordered five others -- including her husband -- to cut her. Read a behind-the-scenes with Aisha then and now "The file of Sulaiman was completed by police and submitted to the attorney general's office in Oruzgan province," he said. Aisha said her mutilation was an act of Taliban justice for the crime of shaming her husband's family. Juma Hemat, the Oruzgan police chief, said the arrest took place about two weeks ago and that Sulaiman confessed to the crime. The court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off, an act carried out by the six men in the mountains of Oruzgan, where they left her to die.
