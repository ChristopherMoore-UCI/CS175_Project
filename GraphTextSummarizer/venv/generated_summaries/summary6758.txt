-- Australian woman Schapelle Corby has walked out of a prison in Bali, Indonesia, after being convicted almost nine years ago of drug smuggling. Indonesian Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin said Friday that Corby had been granted parole. Australian media have reported that she will have to remain in Bali on parole until 2017. Corby, 36, was convicted in May 2005 for smuggling 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms) of marijuana in a bag while arriving at Bali's Denpasar International Airport the previous October. He said Corby's parole review was one of more than 1,000 that had been completed.
