" When Paillex learned about food deserts -- areas in the country that do not have access to healthy, affordable food -- he and his group set up farm markets to provide free fresh produce to residents of these areas. "But then I realized that people were hungry for fresh fruits and vegetables." Since then, Paillex has been helping to provide fresh produce for more than just his local pantry. Paillex plans to expand the program to other states. "To be able to put fresh food on someone's plate who's hungry that night," Paillex said, "there's no greater feeling and no greater reward." To help distribute the hundreds of thousands of pounds of produce it grows each year, the group partnered with the Community FoodBank of New Jersey. " Paillex and his daughter donated 120 pounds of produce that year.
