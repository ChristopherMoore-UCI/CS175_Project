City will be hoping Bony can produce the goals that will help Manuel Pellegrini's team maintain the Premier League crown and succeed in the European Champions League. Bony joined Swansea from Dutch team Vitesse in 2013 and has forged a reputation as prolific goalscorer. The move sees Bony join forces with his international teammate Yaya Toure, who has been with City since 2010. Bony, who scored more EPL goals than any other player in 2014, is currently with the Ivory Coast national team preparing for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations, which begins in Equatorial Guinea on Saturday. Hours after pictures of Bony holding aloft a City shirt emerged on Twitter, the English Premier League champions have finally confirmed the signing of the Ivorian striker.
