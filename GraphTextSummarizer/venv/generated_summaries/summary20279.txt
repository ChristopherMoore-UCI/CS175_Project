"There has to be some recognition that excessive use of force with a Taser is of a completely qualitatively different nature to just excessive use of force with your hands, if you like," Christian Porter was quoted by ABC News as saying. "I think we've reached the stage now where Tasers are such important instruments for the police force that disciplinary proceedings for excessive use of force with a Taser need to be treated in a special category. "Against all their training and procedures, two officers repeatedly Tasered a detainee because he wouldn't move when told, and all this while other officers watched," Western Australia Police Acting Commissioner Chris Dawson said in a statement. It said Tasers were used 3,070 times between 2007 and 2009, becoming the "option of choice" representing 74 percent of reported uses of force in 2008. " CCTV footage of the incident, which happened in Perth, Western Australia in 2008, showed an unarmed aboriginal man lying on the ground surrounded by police officers after reportedly refusing a strip search.
