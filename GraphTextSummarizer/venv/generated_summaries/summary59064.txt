Turkish riot police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of mourners who attended a funeral march Wednesday for a 15-year old boy. His family says he was next seen 15 minutes later suffering from a horrendous head wound believed to have been inflicted by a tear gas canister fired by Turkish police. Turkish television also aired footage of university students in a canteen, banging their silverware on tables in a show of support for the Elvan family. That night, demonstrators hurled stones, bottles and abuse at Turkish riot police in several Istanbul neighborhoods. Clashes also erupted in the port city of Izmir on Wednesday, as well as the Turkish capital Ankara.
