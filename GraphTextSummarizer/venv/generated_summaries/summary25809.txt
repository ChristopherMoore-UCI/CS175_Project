-- Ecuadorian law prohibits polling firms from releasing data in the 10 days before Sunday's presidential election, but unless something surprising happens, incumbent Rafael Correa can expect to win re-election. "Unfortunately, this government, despite its social and economic successes, institutions have been weakened and there is a control over everything by the executive," political analyst Ana Maria Correa said. Correa's closest challenger is Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, who ran on a platform promising lower taxes and the privatization of state media companies. Correa's administration has stabilized Ecuador, but more must be done, political analyst Hernan Reyes said. Indeed, the U.S.-trained economist has created his own "Citizens' Revolution," a socialist-oriented economic program with some similarities to what Chavez has done in Venezuela Correa has been criticized by press freedom groups for his government's aggressive legal battles against media outlets unfriendly to him.
