-- The woman set to become Thailand's first female prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, said Monday that authorities will reopen an investigation into her brother, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was convicted of corruption after being forced from office. Can election promises be kept in Thailand? " Thaksin said the incoming prime minister's relative lack of political experience might help with reconciliation efforts. If you were to have the people with a lot of political baggage come to reconciliation, it may be difficult. " Yingluck Shinawatra said Monday that reconciliation is "the urgent task ahead."
