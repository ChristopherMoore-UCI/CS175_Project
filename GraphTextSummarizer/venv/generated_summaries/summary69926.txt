" A pair of helmets worn by retired Red Bull racer Mark Webber in his final season in F1 also added to the charity's prize pot. The funds raised by Vettel's helmet will go directly to the Wings for Life charity set up by Red Bull Racing owner Dietrich Mateschitz. Meanwhile, the Australian racer got his first taste of his new drive this week as he tested the Porsche LMP1 racer he will race in the 2014 World Endurance Championship for sports cars. The successful bidder eventually paid $118,000 for the helmet which was worn by Vettel on his way to victory in this year's German Grand Prix. and it's my pleasure to donate this signed and worn helmet.
