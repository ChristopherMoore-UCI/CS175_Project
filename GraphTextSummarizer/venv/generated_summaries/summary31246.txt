His character's death leaves his TV wife, Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), as the show's mainstay as it concludes its 11th season in May. "Derek Shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character -- for Meredith (Grey), for me and for the fans," show creator Shonda Rhimes said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Patrick Dempsey's performance shaped Derek in a way that I know we both hope became a meaningful example -- happy, sad, romantic, painful and always true -- of what young women should demand from modern love. But the show will very much continue -- not only does it have a few weeks before the 11th season is over, Pompeo is also signed through season 12. Tweets from "Grey's Anatomy's" official account were filled with emoji of crying faces and broken hearts, as well as tearful images from the show.
