-- A web video featuring former special forces officers accuses President Barack Obama of taking too much credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden and allowing classified information about the raid to become public. The White House has denied leaking secret information about clandestine operations, and two federal prosecutors have been assigned to investigate recent leaks about the Stuxnet virus and drone strike operations. Another former Navy SEAL in the video, Scott Taylor, says of the bin Laden raid: "If you disclose how we got there, how we took down the building, what we did, how many people were there, that it's going to hinder future operations, and certainly hurt the success of those future operations. In recent campaign speeches, Obama has cited the killing of bin Laden as one of the campaign pledges he has fulfilled. " Defense officials: Leaks didn't come from Pentagon Smith said the ad campaign pays no heed to political affiliation, and the organization describes itself as nonpartisan and says its focus isÂ on protecting intelligence agents and special operations officers, not on politics.
