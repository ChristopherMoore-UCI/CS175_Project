A few months later, the Peterson boys met boxing trainer Barry Hunter, and it changed their lives. Hunter took them in and gave the boys more than just boxing lessons; he gave them life lessons. At times they had no place to stay and were forced to sleep on park benches, in abandoned cars and at a local Greyhound bus station. Last December, the discipline and work ethic Hunter instilled in the boys resulted in Lamont winning the light welterweight world championship. For Lamont Peterson, that's putting it mildly.
