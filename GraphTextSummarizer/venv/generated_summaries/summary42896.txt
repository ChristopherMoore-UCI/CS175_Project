But the reactions to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's message that may matter most came in Israel and Iran -- where emotions ran high, both in support and in opposition. In an address before the U.S. Congress punctuated by one-liners, Netanyahu claimed that ongoing talks about Iran's nuclear program "would all but guarantee that Iran gets nuclear weapons, lots of them." That mentality is what appears to be driving Netanyahu, who has been adamant and consistent in expressing his distrust of Iran (whose supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted last year that Israel should be "annihilated.") What the speech did accomplish, according to Herzog, is "greatly undermine ... the relationship between Israel and the United States," with Obama opposing Netanyahu's speech as a political move that threatened to thwart the nuclear talks. But many are worried about what Gilboa calls the worst crisis in the decades-long relationship between Israel and the United States, with Tuesday's speech doing little to help change the perception "there is very little trust between" Obama and Netanyahu.
