"Investors are pricing in...much greater monetary easing," said Ben Collett, head of Japanese equities at Louis Capital Markets in Hong Kong. I don't know how he achieves it." If anything, Collett believes Abe's timing is "quite fortuitous" and that Japan's economy has "hit bottom" and is ready to bounce back. Some investors believe the second coming of Abe will be good for Japan's equity markets. A weaker currency means Japan's exporters earn more yen when they repatriate overseas profits back to Japan. Still, Collett doubts if Abe can deliver on his calls for more stimulus and thinks investors might not see action.
