According to Arias each pound or kilogram of molten salt is able to store up to three times the amount of energy that can be stored in oil, an energy-store that is used at other CSP power plants. That, says the owners, is a rate of producing electricity comparable to conventional power plants and a rate they hope will make the plant very competitive. -- Typical solar power plants stop working when the sun sets, but a new one in southern Spain, called Gemasolar, can stay awake all night. The official inauguration is set for October 4, due to be led by Spain's King Juan Carlos and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. When the salts cool, they release energy that is used to produce steam, which turns turbines and generates electricity that is transferred to a general grid hookup at the plant.
