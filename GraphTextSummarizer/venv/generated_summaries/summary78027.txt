A tale of two streets in Ferguson A black hearse carried Brown's gold and black casket through the streets of St. Louis on that late August day. Sixteen days before, he had been shot dead by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. I stand where Brown's parents wailed as their son's casket was lowered on August 25 into a copper vault. I get back in my rental car and leave the quiet of St. Peter's to return to the storm of Ferguson. "You're looking for Michael Brown, right?"
