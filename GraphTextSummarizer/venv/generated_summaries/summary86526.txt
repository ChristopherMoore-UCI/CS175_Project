-- It was the longest game in Premier League history, and Saturday's unconvincing victory must have lasted an eternity for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini and the disgruntled fans of the big-spending English club. " Arsenal also rebounded from midweek European defeat as midfielder Mikel Arteta scored a late winner against bottom club Queens Park Rangers, who had Stephane Mbia sent off. Former Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov put the London team 3-2 up in the 88th minute, but Hal Robson-Kanu snatched his winless team's fourth draw from eight matches. The win moved City up to second place, a point behind Chelsea -- who take on third-placed Manchester United on Sunday. "I am very happy with the result because we lost two big games in our head, and the confidence was a bit jaded," manager Arsene Wenger said after seeing his team move up to fourth place
