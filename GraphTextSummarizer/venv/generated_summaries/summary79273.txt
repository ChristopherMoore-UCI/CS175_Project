-- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation early Wednesday in connection with suspected corruption and influence peddling Prime Minister Manuel Valls told BFMTV Wednesday that Sarkozy faced a "serious situation" and "serious facts." "No one is above the law, but it is important to remember that the presumption of innocence applies to everyone," he said. Bordeaux Mayor Alain Juppe, a UMP politician who formerly served as prime minister and foreign minister, said via Twitter that he was thinking of Sarkozy in a spirit of friendship. " Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and a high-ranking magistrate, Gilbert Azibert, were also placed under formal investigation Tuesday, BFMTV said. In the taped joint interview, Sarkozy said that there is a "willingness to humiliate" him, and that he "never committed any act contrary to republican principles or the rule of law."
