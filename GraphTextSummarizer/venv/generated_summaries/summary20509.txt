Opposition parties, farmers, animals rights groups and outraged citizens have demanded a ban on Indonesian cattle exports,  Oogjes said. -- Australians are demanding a ban on cattle exports to Indonesia after an investigation revealed brutal treatment that included animals getting flogged, kicked and bleeding to death in some cases. " Animal rights groups called on Prime Minister Julia Gillard to urgently halt cattle exports to Indonesia. " "It was really unfortunate if it really happened," said Djajadi, director of the Veterinary Health Department of the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, adding, "Australian cattle is different from Indonesian cattle. "While the government could deny knowledge of what's going on in Indonesia this time around -- if we have to go back and document further evidence -- the public will not be so forgiving,"  Oogjes said in a statement.
