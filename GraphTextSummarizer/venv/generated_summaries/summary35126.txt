Having held the ultimate ranking since the age of 19, Pieres is now ranked inside the top two in the world (he disputes the number one spot with fellow Argentinian Adolfo Cambiaso). From Jilly Cooper to Pretty Woman, polo has been used as shorthand to suggest a glamorous, dangerous world of sleek horses and brooding players. Polo players are rated on a scale of -2 to 10 according to their skill, where 10 is the highest rating possible. Like all equestrian sports, men and women compete side-by-side, making it the only mixed sport which is also a contact sport: players can 'ride off' opponents by using their mount to barge the other player out of the way. Players 1 and 2 are attackers, 3 is a playmaker and 4, or Back, is a defender.
