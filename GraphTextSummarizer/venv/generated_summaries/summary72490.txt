"It's still high, it's still hard, it's still cold," climber Nick Parker told the Anchorage Daily News. Alaska's lieutenant governor announced Wednesday that new mapping technology puts Mount McKinley at 20,237 feet rather than the 20,320 it was pegged at. "It's hard to climb, and the air is just as thin," mountaineer Stan Justice told the Fairbanks News Miner. The new height was measured last year with a radar mapping system deployed by the Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey. Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell said in a statement.
