But it's nearly impossible to accurately model strong weather systems such as big storms or hurricanes, which include various cloud systems. We have a much better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere, more observations from towers, balloons and radar, and faster computers with much more processing speed and memory. Depending on the temperature, pressure and humidity of the air, clouds will form and eventually result in rain. In 2011, some residents in Staten Island, New York, evacuated from their homes before Hurricane Irene approached, but Irene took another path and the evacuation turned out to be unnecessary. There are many features of the atmosphere that interact in complex ways.
