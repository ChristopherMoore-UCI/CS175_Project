But the fact of the matter is that the route is assigned by air traffic control, as it is by air traffic control systems all over the world. Routes filed by civilian airplanes have to avoid these areas. In the case of MH17, and with many other airlines transiting the Donetsk region of Ukraine where MH17 was downed, such safety restrictions had caused the plane to fly at a higher-than-usual altitude: 33,000 feet (Ukrainian officials had raised the minimum altitude requirement to 32,000 feet). Threat information is only as good as the intelligence supplied by air traffic control and its cooperating governments. But they have to plan their flights within the confines of air traffic control guidelines and restrictions and may not have many choices in certain areas other than to select a given altitude.
