The film, which was nominated for best ensemble -- the SAG Awards' equivalent of Oscar's best picture -- also earned nominations for Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, who play Coltrane's parents. Keaton, who has earned wide praise for his performance, earned a best male actor nomination, Edward Norton received a best supporting male actor nod, and Emma Stone, who plays Keaton's daughter, picked up a nod for best supporting female actor. Not only is he up in two categories -- best male actor in a film for "The Imitation Game" and best male actor in a miniseries or TV movie for "Sherlock: The Last Vow" -- "The Imitation Game" itself snagged a pick for ensemble. Among the television performers earning nominations were Louis C.K. ("Louie"), Edie Falco ("Nurse Jackie"), Amy Poehler ("Parks and Recreation"), Viola Davis ("How to Get Away with Murder") and both leads of "True Detective," Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. Other films received plaudits for specific performances.
