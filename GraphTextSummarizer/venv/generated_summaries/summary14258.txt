CNN said it "has been aware of this interview since before it took place, and has no further comment." Operation Golding is a strand of Operation Weeting and is specifically investigating allegations of phone interception at Mirror Group Newspapers, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said. -- CNN host and former UK tabloid editor Piers Morgan was questioned in December in connection with a UK police inquiry into phone hacking, he said Friday. Metropolitan Police inquiries have largely focused on alleged wrongdoing at the News of the World and Sun newspapers, owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch. " London's Metropolitan Police said in a prepared statement: "A 48-year old man, a journalist, was interviewed under caution on the 6th December 2013 by officers from Operation Golding in connection with 'suspected conspiracy to intercept telephone voicemails.' In December of that year, he was called to testify before the UK Parliament regarding his exact knowledge of a phone hacking scandal involving pop star Paul McCartney and his ex-wife, Heather Mills.
