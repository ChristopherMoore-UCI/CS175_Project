Previously unknown Velazquez discovered Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez (1599 - 1660) was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, and is best known for his portraits of the royal family, including his masterpiece, Las Meninas. Andrew Mckenzie, the company's director of old master paintings said the portrait was of "outstanding quality" and had "extraordinary presence." "Portrait of a Gentleman" was originally thought to be by 19th century British artist Matthew Shepperson -- but the change of attribution meant it sold for 10,000 times its original estimate. Instead -- following more than a year of tests, X-rays and research -- it was confirmed as a Velazquez, and so became the highlight of Wednesday's old masters sale at Bonhams in London. She said the company was "very pleased" with the sale, which also saw the world record for a work by Dutch artist Adriaen Coorte smashed when his "Three peaches on a stone ledge with a Painted Lady butterfly" went under the hammer for $3.3 million.
