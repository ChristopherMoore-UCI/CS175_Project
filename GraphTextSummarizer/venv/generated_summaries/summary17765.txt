Gray died Sunday, one week after he was arrested by Baltimore police. While Baltimore police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, the department has not released details of what the officers said or how Gray might have suffered the fatal injury. And what took place in the 30 minutes before police called paramedics to pick Gray up? Gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him. At least two people were taken into custody as protesters upset over the death of Freddie Gray scuffled Thursday evening with police on the streets of Baltimore.
