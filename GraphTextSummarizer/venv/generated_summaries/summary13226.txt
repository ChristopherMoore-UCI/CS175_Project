-- Former world number one Justine Henin has ruled herself out of the U.S. Open after sustaining an elbow injury in her Wimbledon exit to Belgian rival Kim Clijsters. Clijsters was later beaten by Vera Zvonareva in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, leaving both of the Belgian stars still searching for their first grand slam title at SW19. It is a shattering blow for Henin, who will also miss her 'Best of Belgium' clash with Clijsters in Brussels on July 8. Henin, who made her comeback to competitive tennis at the start of the year after 18 months in retirement, picked up the injury during her fourth round defeat to Clijsters. The U.S. Open begins on August 30 in New York, where Clijsters will be defending the crown she won in sensational fashion in her comeback year in 2009.
