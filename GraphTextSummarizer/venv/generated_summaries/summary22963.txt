Search for students continues Authorities say the 43 students intended to protest a speech by the wife of Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca. Bodies found in southwestern Mexico Pe√±a Nieto spoke the same day authorities announced that 11 partially burned bodies of young adults have been found in southwestern Mexico, just an hour's drive from where 43 missing college students went to school. The 11 bodies were discovered near Chilapa, about an hour's drive west of Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, a small college devoted to training students to become teachers in Mexico's impoverished countryside. Earlier this month, authorities investigating the case said human remains were found in at least one garbage bag in the San Juan River. Authorities say they believe the students were captured by Iguala police, turned over to a gang, and then executed in Cocula, 14 miles away.
