Fred Shapiro, editor of "The Yale Book of Quotations" and several other books in the field, points out that movie quotations can be a shorthand -- something that brings up powerful associations. These days, thanks to repeated television showings, video streaming and the Internet, quotations attach themselves to our craniums more quickly than ever. The late Harold Ramis was a champ at composing such wisecracks, anti-establishment jokes that have been repeated by generations of viewers. Shapiro makes a distinction between popular quotations and catchphrases. -- Screenwriter William Goldman has written some of the most famous lines in movie history.
