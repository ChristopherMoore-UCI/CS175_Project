White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was disappointed that Boehner was limiting attendance at Thursday's meeting to fewer than 20 of the more than 200 House Republicans. The president signaled more "give" to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Senate Democrats sought to keep up the pressure, holding a rally on the Capitol steps on Wednesday to demonstrate their unified stance in calling for House Republicans to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. The lawmaker said House Democrats are open to hearing what Republicans have in mind with a short-term deal. According to the source, the economic implications of a U.S. default "scares people" to make such a deal acceptable to enough House Republicans in order to get negotiations started.
