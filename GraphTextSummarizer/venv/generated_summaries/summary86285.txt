-- A tornado touched down in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on Saturday afternoon, injuring at least four people and leaving the area without electricity, according to emergency officials. Video showed twisted scaffolding and crushed cars, among other structural damage at a stadium set to host the 21st Central and Caribbean Games beginning Saturday night. The four injured were taken to a local hospital where they are in stable condition, said Janita Soto, a spokeswoman for the Mayaguez police. The twister struck Mayaguez, on Puerto Rico's western coast, at 12:35 p.m., according to Luis Correa, a spokesman for the State Emergency Department. Two of the injured were hurt "when they were running out of fear," said Sandra Virella, an emergency department spokeswoman.
