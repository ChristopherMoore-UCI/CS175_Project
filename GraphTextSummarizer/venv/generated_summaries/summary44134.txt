"And lo and behold, it's working out for her." Three weeks later, Patterson and Williams were told they would be part of the 26-person transplant effort, coordinated through Georgetown University Hospital and Washington Hospital Center. On Monday morning,  Leslie Wolfe visited Renee Patterson in her hospital room at Washington Hospital Center. But Patterson's doctor suggested they look into the paired kidney donation program at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. " On the last day of surgeries, Wolfe's kidney was removed, cleaned and readied to be transported to Washington Hospital Center, where Patterson's doctors were waiting to implant the new organ. In paired kidney donation, one incompatible donor/recipient pair, such as Patterson and Williams, are matched with another pair in the same situation, so that the donor of the first kidney gives to the recipient of the second, and vice versa.
