Vice Adm. Jan E. Tighe has made history with her appointment as head of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and the U.S. 10th Fleet, making her "the first female commander of a numbered fleet in U.S. Navy history," according to that military branch. Tighe succeeded Adm. Michael S. Rogers -- who is moving on to become director of the embattled National Security Agency and head of U.S. Cyber Command -- in a ceremony Wednesday at Fort Meade in Maryland. Her appointment comes at a time when the Navy and other military branches have been on the defensive over accusations that not enough is being done to protect women within their ranks from sexual assault. Figures have shown the rate of assaults in the armed forces is increasing, and some top officers are under fire for condoning such acts. Tighe's new job will be heading the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command, which has a mission that includes cryptologic operations and electronic warfare.
