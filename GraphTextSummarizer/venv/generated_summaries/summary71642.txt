You can see elephant seals, harbor seals, sea lions, whales, dolphins, porpoises, sea otters and more -- over 20 species of marine mammals if you are lucky. Go to AÃ±o Nuevo State Park to see elephant seals and Point Lobos State Park for more seals and sea otters. Where to go: In the city of Monterey, you can walk to the ocean to look at sea otters, harbor seals and sea lions. You can also take a whale watching tour to look at gray whales (in winter and spring), blue whales and humpbacks (in summer and fall), and with some luck, killer whales, dolphins, porpoises and whatever else comes by. Where to go: In August and September you can sit on a bench facing a watering hole, and watch countless herds of antelopes, zebras, elephants, giraffes and other animals walk in from the desert.
