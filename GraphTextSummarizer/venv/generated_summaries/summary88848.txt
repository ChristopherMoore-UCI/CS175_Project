If voter turnout stayed exactly as it did in 2008 (impossible, I know, but hear me out) then 11,000-some new voters would push the Aloha State out of last place for voter participation. TV stations and newspapers in Hawaii have been talking about Hawaii's low level of voter participation in recent weeks. In 2008, with Hawaii's own Barack Obama on the ticket, fewer than half of eligible people voted. But it's the local and state races that will really push people to the polls in Hawaii. The conversation: Take this with a grain of salt, but it seems from where I'm sitting (far-far away, in Atlanta) that lots of people in Hawaii are talking about voting this year.
