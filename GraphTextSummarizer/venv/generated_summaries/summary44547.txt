U.S. forces responded after a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a U.S. Navy ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on board the Quest, according to U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Mark Fox. According to U.S. officials, the four Americans -- ship owners Jean and Scott Adam, along with Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle -- were found shot after U.S. forces boarded the Quest early Tuesday. What started several years ago as local piracy by Somali fishermen has been taken over by organized-crime elements that are well-armed and intent on cashing in on a lucrative operation, according to Wing Commander Paddy O'Kennedy of EU NAVFOR. In previous cases involving Somali pirates and American vessels, the trials for suspects turned over from the Navy to the FBI were held in Norfolk, Virginia, and New York City. The killings signal escalating violence by Somali pirates who have increased torture and attacks on hostages in a bid to speed up the process of getting ransom money, said a spokesman for the European Union Naval Force combating the piracy.
