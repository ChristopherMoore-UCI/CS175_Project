-- At least 12 people were killed and more than 130 injured Tuesday when two explosions hit an Interior Ministry building in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, Egyptian media reported. Among the people injured is the head of the security directorate of Dakahlia governorate, state-news agency MENA said, citing Health Ministry officials. Previously, the semi-official Al Ahram news agency reported 14 dead, citing the country's Health Ministry. Egypt's interim Prime Minister Hazem al Beblawi called it a terrorist incident and said the perpetrators will not go unpunished. On Sunday, Ansar Jerusalem, a self-proclaimed jihadist group responsible for several terrorist attacks, mainly in the Sinai Peninsula, issued an online statement calling on army and police members to quit.
