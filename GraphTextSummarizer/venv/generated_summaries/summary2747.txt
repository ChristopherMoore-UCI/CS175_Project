"After three decades, Native American farmers and ranchers will receive the justice they deserve, and the USDA has committed to improving the farm loan system in ways that will aid Native Americans for generations to come. Under the agreement, which requires federal court approval, Native Americans can file claims for discrimination involving farm loans that occurred in the period from 1981-1999, said statements by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Attorney General Eric Holder. Mandan and her husband still reside on land that was allocated by the Dawes General Allotment Act of 1887, which intended to settle Native American tribes and turn them into farmers and ranchers. The government will provide $680 million in compensation to settle a class-action lawsuit by Native American farmers against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, according to a proposed agreement announced Tuesday. The settlement also includes $80 million for debt relief, as well as other assistance for Native American farmers.
