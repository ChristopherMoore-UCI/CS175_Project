Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so they opened an additional event site to accommodate more people. After the panic, a line of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, could be seen parked on the highway leading to the festival site, carrying away people injured in the crush. Lueb told CNN that some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular festival, which features dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. " "The young people came to celebrate; instead people were killed and injured," the statement said. Witnesses told NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded.
