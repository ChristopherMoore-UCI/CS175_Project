In particular, the audit said dozens of convicted felons got unescorted access to Navy installations for weeks and even years because the outside company issued temporary credentials to contractors before completing proper background checks. "The cost reportedly absorbed by contractors to obtain Rapidgate credentials are transferred back to the Navy in the form of higher contract overhead costs and other contract fees," the audit said, adding that the lack of transparent accounting meant that the Navy "is unable to account for actual NCACS-related charges from contractor companies." Called Rapidgate by its operating company, Eid Passport, the NCACS began screening and credentialing for most contractors and other commercial workers at Navy bases more than two years ago. It also challenged the contention by Navy officials that the Rapidgate program amounted to a money saving move because of the fees paid by contractors for credentials. Coming a day after a contractor opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard, killing 12 people and dying himself, the audit amounted to a powerful indictment of security measures at Navy facilities.
