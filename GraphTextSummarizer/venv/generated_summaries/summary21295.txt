"The tape is pretty unique because it captures a moment in history," Ted Owen of auctioneers Fame Bureau told CNN. The Beatles were quickly snatched up by EMI Records and -- after drummer Ringo Starr replaced Best -- the rest, as they say, is history. It turned out to be one of the worst decisions in music history. On New Year's Day in 1962, with the help of their manager Brian Epstein, the band recorded an audition tape at London's Decca Studios. The tape has a starting bid of $32,000, but Owen expects it to go for much more at the auction on Tuesday.
