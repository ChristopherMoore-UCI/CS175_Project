The army school is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar. The terror group had warned Muslims to avoid places with military ties, saying it carried out the attack to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by the nation's army strikes in tribal areas. Taliban militants ambushed the school, explosives strapped to their bodies, and burst into an auditorium filled with students taking exams. The military says he has confessed to other attacks in the same area. Of those, 132 were children, authorities said.
