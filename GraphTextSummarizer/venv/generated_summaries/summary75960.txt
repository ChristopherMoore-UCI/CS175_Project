Last month, radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr announced in a statement read by another cleric on his behalf that he would "escalate armed resistance and lift the freeze on (the) Mehdi Army" if U.S. forces were to remain. The prospect of U.S. forces remaining into next year is controversial. Asked whether he would support an extension of U.S. forces in Iraq, he would not answer. If 70% or 80% of Iraqis were to say yes to an extension of U.S. forces beyond 2011, then "the rest should accept this decision," he said. Under an agreement with the Iraqi government that was signed by the Bush administration in 2008, all U.S. forces are to be out of Iraq by the end of the year.
