However, a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Algeria coupled with Ghana's late 2-1 win over South Africa ensured Alan Girese's men would not be progressing from Group C. Playing an unimaginative brand of long ball football and with little shape in attack or defense, Senegal's demise seldom looked in doubt in Malabo Algeria had the chance to open the scoring after just 90 seconds but a terrible touch from Sofiane Feghouli when through on goal allowed Senegal goalkeeper Bouna Coundoul to smother. Ten minutes later though there was nothing Coundoul or his defenders could do as Nabil Bentaleb found himself free on the edge of the Senegal area. Algeria and Ghana are through to the quarterfinals of the 2015 African Cup of Nations at the expense of Senegal and South Africa after a dramatic conclusion to the competition's "Group of Death" Tuesday. Algeria's triumph meant Ghana required a win over South Africa in Mongomo to leapfrog Senegal in the standings and book their place in the quarterfinals. Ayew was left alone in the South Africa box and rose to flick Baba Rahman's cross past the despairing Khuzwayo and send his country through.
