Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid will lose his slot as majority leader once the GOP takes control of the Senate next year. Heller said he "of course" reached out to Nevada GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval to run to unseat Reid in 2016, according to a report out Wednesday from the Las Vegas Review Journal. But his Nevada counterpart in the Senate, Republican Dean Heller, is reportedly working to unseat Reid altogether in 2016. The position was viewed as a critical one for Heller: It would have increased his authority in the Senate leading into the 2016 elections, giving him authority to recruit candidates like Sandoval and actively fundraise for them. Heller lost his bid Thursday to become chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a group which works to promote and elect GOP senators.
