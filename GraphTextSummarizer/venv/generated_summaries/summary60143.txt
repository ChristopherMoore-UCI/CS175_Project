The U.S. State Department added the Caucasus Emirate, a Chechen group based in the North Caucasus, to its list of foreign terrorist groups, and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of its leader, Doku Umarov. Authorities arrested three men this week in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia on charges of plotting the attack in a joint operation with Abkhazian security services, the Russian National Anti-Terrorism Committee said, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. -- Russia's security service has foiled a plot to attack the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea city of Sochi, state media reported Thursday. His group also claimed responsibility for last year's bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died.
