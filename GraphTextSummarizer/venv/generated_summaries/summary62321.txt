Shawn Ruda of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said that police deputies spotted Knight late Friday as he was leaving a restaurant in the Universal CityWalk complex of shops, movie theaters and dining areas, which is located about nine miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Last May, Los Angeles police arrested Knight after they say he pointed a gun at a man outside the city. That prison time, along with Shakur's death, public feuds between Knight and some rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and others, contributed to the label's ultimate demise and bankruptcy proceedings in 2006. In his latest run-in with the law, rap music mogul Marion "Suge" Knight was arrested at a suburban Los Angeles outdoor shopping mall for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation. Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding his record label in 1991 and bringing in such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur.
