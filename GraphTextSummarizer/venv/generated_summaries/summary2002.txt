Some pet cemeteries, such as Pennsylvania's Keystone Pet Cemetery, offer "Bio Cremation," a process that uses alkaline hydrolysis instead of fire and boasts a dramatically reduced carbon footprint: It cuts natural gas usage by 90%, electricity usage by 66%, and CO2 emissions by 90%. Founded in 2010 by Eric Greene, the Green Pet-Burial Society is a nonprofit organization that offers "support for a gentle return" and seems to be the go-to resource for those curious about pet burials where eco-friendly/biodegradable containers, shrouds and unadorned pine boxes placed in natural settings are favored over plastic boxes and immaculately landscaped pet cemeteries. The Green Pet-Burial Society works in cooperation with the Green Burial Council in certifying eco-friendly pet cemeteries and maintains a list of participating providers including green cemeteries like Dust to Dust in Swansea, South Carolina., and the Glendale Memorial Nature Preserve in Glendale, Florida., that allow pet remains to be buried in family plots. I don't know if I've watched too many scary movies lately, but I've been pondering natural burial alternatives for dearly departed pets. Although cremation, in the end, is greener than traditional $4,000 metal casket-in-the-ground burials, it isn't without environmental minuses, specifically in terms of energy use and emissions.
