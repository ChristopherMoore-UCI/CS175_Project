-- Arsenal gained revenge over Liverpool for their humiliating defeat last weekend with a 2-1 victory in a pulsating English FA Cup fifth round tie at the Emirates Sunday. " In the other FA Cup tie played Sunday, third flight Sheffield United beat Nottingham Forest 3-1 to reach the last eight. Manager Arsene Wenger also hit back at a jibe from Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who had called him a "specialist in failure" in reference to Arsenal's long trophy drought. The hard-fought victory has earned Arsenal a home tie in the quarterfinals against Everton, who beat Swansea 3-2 earlier Sunday in an all-EPL clash. Humbled 5-1 in the English Premier League eight days ago, Arsenal restored pride and stayed on course for a first trophy since an FA Cup triumph in 2005.
