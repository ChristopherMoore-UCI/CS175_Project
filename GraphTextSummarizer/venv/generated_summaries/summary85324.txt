Bloody Algeria hostage crisis ends after 'final' assault Mike Lovelady said he's angry with the terrorists who took the compound his brother thought was safe, resulting in the deaths of people who had traveled there merely to make a better living for their families. "It's just unfair," Lovelady's brother, Mike Lovelady, said Tuesday.
