Justin Carter, who was 18 when he was arrested, will appear in Comal County (Texas) District Court on Tuesday, July 16, for a bond hearing, according to his lawyer, Don Flanary. Authorities say someone reported the comment -- which came about two months after the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut -- and Justin Carter was arrested February 21 on a charge of making terroristic threats. The Comal County District Attorney's office, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But, if the facts as reported are true, his comment is an objectionable joke rather than an actual threat, in which case the Comal County District Attorney is prosecuting protected speech. Police originally thought Carter lived with his father in Austin, Texas, at a home the arrest report says is 100 yards from a school.
