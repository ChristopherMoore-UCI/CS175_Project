Israeli military engineers early Friday detonated a segment of that tunnel, which it said stretched 1.7 kilometers (1.06 miles) from Gaza into Israel, near Israeli communities. That appears to match what the medical service in Gaza said was the death of a man around midnight Thursday or early Friday along the Gaza-Israel border, east of the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the mission was imperative to prevent "future attacks against Israeli civilians." The Israeli military said it also used aircraft to destroy a second "terror tunnel" in the southern Gaza Strip on Friday "following Hamas aggression." Israel didn't give specifics about the second tunnel. One of Israel's targets was a tunnel, discovered on October 7, that the Israeli military said reached from Gaza into Israel and might have been intended to help Palestinian militants kidnap Israelis.
