More recently, the British government budgeted £553 million ($890 million) on security for the London 2012 Olympics, plus £475 million ($760 million) for army, security services and police spending. "Security has become an ever-increasing issue for major sporting events in the past decade," the World Cup organizers said in a statement. "That's how it should be done, as we did: learn from those who were in charge of security for other events before us," Royal Canadian Mounted Police superintendent Kevin Bruyckere said. "This has increased the level of information exchange between countries that have recently hosted events to ensure public safety." The Brazil World Cup bid team has increased its security budget as the country prepares to host the tournament for the first time since 1950, as well as next year's precursor Confederations Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.
