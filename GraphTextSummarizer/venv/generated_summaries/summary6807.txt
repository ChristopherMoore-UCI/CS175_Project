Every person who wins more than $600 in the lottery is checked for outstanding taxes, liens, child support payments and the like, according to Judith Drucker, public relations manager for the New Jersey Lottery. Pedro Quezada, 44, the father of five children ages 5 to 23, owes back child support totaling $29,000, according to William Maer of the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. -- The winner of last week's $338 million Powerball jackpot is expected to appear in a New Jersey court Monday on a warrant for unpaid child support. Maer said that a child support warrant usually leads to payment, a scheduled payment plan or arrest. Quezada has chosen a cash payment of his lottery prize that will amount to approximately $152 million after taxes.
