Watch Delany talk about some effects of scleroderma and Evnin's strides toward a cure Â» Since Evnin joined the Scleroderma Research Foundation, more than $10 million has been raised for  research and many world-renowned scientists and research programs are joining the search for a cure. Today, with scleroderma patient Luke Evnin helping to lead the efforts, Delany said that people are increasingly aware of the disease and working toward a cure. Delany said Evnin gives much of his own money toward research, and she calls his efforts and accomplishments on behalf of the thousands of scleroderma patients "nothing less than heroic." Luke Evnin heads the Scleroderma Research Foundation, and actress Dana Delany is a board member. Evnin -- a successful venture capitalist with a doctorate in microbiology -- was a "perfect storm" for the foundation and for scleroderma research, Delany said.
