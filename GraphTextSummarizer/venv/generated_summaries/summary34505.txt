The quote originally popped up on the social network Tumblr, which like other social media is a haven of quotes, both real and not-so-real. Green fell on his sword in the video, and added that Internet culture as a whole is guilty of this sort of thing. He was alerted to the fact on Reddit, learning that a teenage fan of his, Melody Truong, had come up with the quote in 2009, and Green was then given credit by many people online as the quote went viral over the years. Truong tried to reach out to Green to no avail, but last week her friend posted about it to Reddit and Green responded. (Oddly enough, Green said he determined he had never written the line after illegally downloading and digitally searching a copy of "Paper Towns" for the quote.)
