The Serb ended a run of two years without a winner's trophy on Sunday, defeating Patty Schnyder in straight sets in the final of the Generali Ladies Linz tournament in Austria. But seeded seventh in Austria, Ivanovic did not drop a set all week and Schnyder was unable to provide much of a challenge to the rejuvenated champion in the final. -- Former world number one Ana Ivanovic has climbed to a year high of 26th in the rankings after breaking her WTA Tour title drought. Ivanovic -- who was a last-minute replacement in the draw for the injured Serena Williams -- took just 47 minutes to dispose of her Swiss opponent 6-1 6-2. Since rising to the top of the world rankings in 2008, the 22-year-old has suffered a dip in form due to illness and injury that has seen her fall to as low as 65 in the world earlier this year.
