"As the Prime Minister (Stephen Harper) has said, prostitution is bad for society and harmful to communities, women and vulnerable persons," Rob Nicholson, Canada's justice minister, said in a statement released by his office. A panel of five judges wrote that the law banning common bawdy houses "is grossly disproportionate" if all it aims to do is keep public order in a neighborhood and maintain public health standards. Ontario's top court has legalized brothels, saying Canadian prostitution laws unfairly discriminate against prostitutes and their ability to work in safe environments. The government indicated it would review the decision, but an appeal to Canada's Supreme Court is  also a possibility. You can see it through the world," said Nikki Thomas, executive director of  Sex Professionals of Canada.
