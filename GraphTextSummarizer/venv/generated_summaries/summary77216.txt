-- Friends and family of actress Farrah Fawcett -- including longtime partner Ryan O'Neal and their son Redmond, who was temporarily freed from jail for the service -- gathered Tuesday to say goodbye. Redmond O'Neal, 24, was arrested in September when deputies found methamphetamine during a probation search at the Malibu, California, home of his father, Ryan O'Neal. Tuesday's service at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles was private and closed to the media. Monday's court order allowed Redmond O'Neal out of jail for up to three hours for the funeral. She starred as a battered wife in the 1984 TV movie "The Burning Bed," and appeared on stage as a woman who extracts vengeance from a would-be rapist in William Mastrosimone's play "Extremities," a performance she reprised on film in 1986.
