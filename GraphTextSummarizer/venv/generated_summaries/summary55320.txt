After 25 years, Exxon Valdez oil spill hasn't ended Gulf oil may be big trouble for big fish More on oil spills Efforts to clean up a 168,000 gallons of thick, viscous oil that spilled into the Port of Houston near Galveston, Texas, stretched into a third day Tuesday, as wildlife rescuers sought to estimate the impact on birds and marine life. "In the early stages of this spill much remains unknown, but for shrimp, blue crab, menhaden and other marine life, which rely on the bay as an essential nursery, further investigation and long-term monitoring within the footprint of this spill is necessary. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel said they are continuing to look for affected wildlife in Bolivar Flats, which is considered a significant refuge for birds. There have also been sightings of oiled birds that have yet to be confirmed.
