On October 18, as highway signs cautioned drivers to remain in cars and local schools were making a decision to close the next morning, deputies traversed Thompson's property and beyond and came face to face with animals that most people see from the other side of a cage or in the safety of a guided safari. Kopchak's neighbor, Terry Thompson, owned a bunch of wild animals. Deputy Jay Lawhorne had been on Thompson's property before, responding to previous complaints about him, including animal abuse. John Moore, who worked as a caretaker for Thompson's animals, said that he had last seen Terry Thompson the day before he died, according to the police reports. Thompson, 62, had been released from a federal prison September 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms.
