-- A London court cleared singer Amy Winehouse of assault Friday after a two-day trial, her spokesman told CNN. Singer Amy Winehouse was accused of hitting a woman at a charity ball last year. The Grammy-winning artist arrived at court Friday wearing a white shirt, gray blazer, black skirt and pink ballet slippers. The verdict will be good news for the troubled singer, who returned to Britain this month after spending six months on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. Winehouse is famous for her retro, soulful R&B sound and has had a string of hits including "Rehab," "Back to Black," and "Tears Dry on Their Own."
