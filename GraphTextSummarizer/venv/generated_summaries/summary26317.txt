Arid Uka, 21, appeared in court in Frankfurt where he faces murder charges over the March 2 shooting outside Frankfurt International Airport, in which Nicholas Alden and Zachary Ryan Cuddeback of the U.S. Air Force died. -- A Kosovar has admitted shooting dead two American servicemen and injuring two others in an attack on a U.S. Air Force bus in Germany, his lawyers said Wednesday. Uka "deeply regrets the crime he has committed," according to a statement provided by his lawyers, Michaela Roth and Jens Joerg Hoffman, and made a full confession to the court. The court heard the video clip was in fact a scene from the U.S. anti-war film Redacted, German media reports say. On the eve of the shooting, Uka had watched an Internet video that he thought showed American soldiers severely mistreating a young Muslim woman, they said.
