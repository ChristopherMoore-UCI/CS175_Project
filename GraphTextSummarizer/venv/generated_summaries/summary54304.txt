"The seas of Antarctica are treacherous and unforgiving," Vice Adm. Charles Ray, commander of U.S. Coast Guard operations in the Pacific, said in a press release as the Polar Star was on its way to the trapped fishing vessel. "The situation was dire," said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Allyson Conroy. The 399-foot Polar Star is the only heavy icebreaker in the Coast Guard fleet capable of operating in the deep ice of Antarctica to free ice-bound ships like the Antarctic Chieftain or clear the route to resupply McMurdo Station. A U.S Coast Guard cutter has freed an Australian fishing boat trapped in ice 900 miles northeast of Antarctica. According to the Coast Guard, the Polar Star was diverted to aid the Antarctic Chieftain following the completion of a mission at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, where the 150-member crew provided military logistical support to a program managed by the National Science Foundation.
