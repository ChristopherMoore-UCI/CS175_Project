-- Mahdi Hashi came to Britain with his family as a six-year-old, fleeing the civil war in Somalia. Then, on December 21, 2012 -- almost a year after he disappeared -- Hashi turned up in a U.S. criminal court in Brooklyn, New York, charged with "material support" of a terror organization, Al-Shabaab, and allegedly training to be a suicide bomber. A statement from the FBI says Hashi was arrested in "Africa" by local police in August last year and then handed to the FBI. Hashi's British citizenship was stripped from him just a short time before he was put on a plane to the United States, Batchelder said. " Mahdi Hashi is now fighting to regain his British citizenship while in a New York detention center.
