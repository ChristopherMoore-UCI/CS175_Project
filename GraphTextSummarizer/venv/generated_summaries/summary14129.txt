He started manufacturing "worm poop" and packaging the organic fertilizer in used plastic bottles selling it as "Waste in Waste" under the name TerraCycle. -- They say one man's trash is another man's treasure and for Tom Szaky, founder and CEO of TerraCycle, that couldn't be more true. "My friends and I were trying to grow some plants and realized worm poop was one of the best fertilizers to feed them," Szaky said, "...and that suddenly started getting me to thinking differently about waste." "We collect about a billion pieces of waste every month from close to 25 million people, across 19 countries," Szaky explains. TerraCycle's influence is also growing around the world, says Szaky, with the company now collecting 6% of Sweden's coffee capsules and 2% of all of the UK's pens.
