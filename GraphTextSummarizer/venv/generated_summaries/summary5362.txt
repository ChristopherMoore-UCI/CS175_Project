Julie Corey, who was 35 at the time of the crime, was convicted in Worcester Superior Court in the 2009 slaying of Darlene Haynes, 23, in Worcester. At the time, Worcester police said Haynes told people she gave birth at an undisclosed Massachusetts hospital. "It's probably the most horrific case this office has seen," Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said. Days after the murder, Haynes' baby was found with Corey in New Hampshire. Corey's lawyers argued that police failed to follow up on leads, including Haynes' ex-boyfriend.
