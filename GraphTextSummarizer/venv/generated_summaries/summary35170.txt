The Sheriff's Office released several photos of DiMaggio, and Giannantonio said he is believed to be driving a blue, four-door Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986. "I'm hoping that the next time you hear from us will be maybe later on tonight with me announcing that we've located the children, they're fine, and Mr. DiMaggio is in custody," said Giannantonio. According to Giannantonio, DiMaggio and Anderson had "a close, platonic relationship." A massive manhunt is under way for James DiMaggio, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the mother, Christina Anderson. On HLN's "Raising America" on Tuesday, the children's aunt, Andrea Saincome, said that DiMaggio has known the family for years and that it would not have been unusual for the mother and children to be at his house.
