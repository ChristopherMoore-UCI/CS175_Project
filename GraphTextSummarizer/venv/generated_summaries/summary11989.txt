Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was in Tucson Monday to finish what she started -- a "Congress on Your Corner" meeting that was interrupted by gunfire, a shooting rampage that left six people dead and Giffords with a gunshot wound to her head just over a year ago. " Giffords, a Democrat, will submit a letter of resignation during the week to House Speaker John Boehner and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. The aide said leaders are now working with Giffords' office on the details, but they are planning to bring the bill up on Wednesday morning before House Democrats head off for their annual legislative retreat. I don't believe we've seen the last of Gabby Giffords." The decision to schedule a vote on the measure comes after Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, spoke to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor over the weekend, the aide said.
