During his second term as prime minister, in the late 1990s, Sharif oversaw Pakistan's emergence as a nuclear power, for which many Pakistanis still hold him in high regard. Following a term plagued by corruption allegations, militant violence, economic torpor and power shortages, its support fell away in an election marred by extremist attacks on candidates. The Pakistani National Assembly, where his political party secured control in elections last month, elected him prime minister with 244 votes. On Wednesday, he completed his long journey back to power and became prime minister for an unprecedented third term. He also has the complex task of resolving the country's energy crisis, which has resulted in prolonged power outages that hurt businesses and sometimes provoke street protests.
