Trippi, the campaign consultant, said the shouting matches at health care town halls expose the limitations of online discourse today. For example, the White House raised privacy concerns after it asked people to send the administration e-mails and online writings that spread misinformation about health care reform, he said. As the country's messy debate about health care reform continues, some online observers are starting to wonder if Obama has lost his grip on Internet discourse. But he said online debates and discussions will play increasingly important roles in public policy discussions. President Obama speaks during a town hall meeting on health care in August.
