President Obama could end the strike tomorrow with one decisive step -- he could start to transfer cleared prisoners. In a speech on May 23, 013, President Barack Obama stated "Look at the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees who are holding a hunger strike. . . This is especially true where cleared men are slated to go to close U.S. allies. If you were disturbed yesterday by the video we released of Yasiin Bey (aka Mos Def) being force-fed like a Guantánamo prisoner, please consider: right now this is happening 90 times a day at Guantánamo Bay. There is now an overwhelming consensus that the current state of affairs in Guantánamo -- a situation for which Barack Obama is directly responsible -- is unacceptable.
