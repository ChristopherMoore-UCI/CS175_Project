As a result, critics say, nuclear plants have made fuel pools the de facto method of storing fuel, crowding pools with dangerous levels of fuel, industry critics say. But events in Japan, where two of the six spent fuel pools at the Fukushima Daiichi facility were compromised, have raised questions about practices at the nation's 104 nuclear reactors, which rely on a combination of pools and dry casks to store used fuel. Currently, there is no maximum time fuel can remain in spent fuel pools, the NRC said Wednesday. The NRC and industry critics differed on whether spent fuel pools are safe. "At many sites there is nearly 10 times as much irradiated fuel in spent fuel pools as in the reactor core," he said.
