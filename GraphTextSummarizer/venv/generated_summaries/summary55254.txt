A week before we set off for the embed, I asked Stuart what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said: "Not only are the Parachute Regiment Britain's most elite soldiers, they are the most brutal of British troops. The majority of British casualties are all recorded in that area. We went there to film the British army's much-talked-about, multimillion pound "replica Afghanistan village." Perhaps more shocking than the horrific injuries the soldiers had sustained was the lack of support of these men from the British government of the time -- particularly those who suffered psychological problems as a result of combat shock. His story and those of other ex-Paras is now available to watch in a moving British documentary called "Isolation."
