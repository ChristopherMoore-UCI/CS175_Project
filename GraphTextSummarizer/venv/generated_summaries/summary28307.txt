"At the time China was about to be admitted to the WTO and our Chinese competitors were actually selling products cheaper than we could make them", said CEO Tony Caldeira. "The raw materials are manufactured in China so we'd end up shipping it over, incurring extra costs and complications." As far as Caldeira is concerned, Britain appears to be winning this round of the great pillow fight with China. Add to that the increasing costs in shipping, packaging, duty rates and fabric costs, and it's not surprising Chinese production has become less attractive. However, this year that saving shrank to 13 cents and next year the company predicts it'll cost the same to make the cushion in China and the UK. Last year it was cost-effective to make velvet striped cushions in Caldeira's Chinese factory, it cost 90 cents less in production per cushion.
