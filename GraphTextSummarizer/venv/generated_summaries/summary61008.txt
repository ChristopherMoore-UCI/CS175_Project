Even private companies are getting in on the austerity act, with some opting to hold their lunar new year parties at fast food restaurants, prompting a backlash from employees on social networking sites. But the austerity drive launched by the new Chinese leadership of Xi Jinping, coupled with the economic slowdown, has led government departments and state-owned enterprises across China to cancel or radically scale back new year festivities this year -- the equivalent of office Christmas parties in the West, but often far more lavish. Lunar new year begins this year on February 10, but banqueting season is normally in full swing at least a fortnight before. One employee said: "We have never been extravagant in our nianhui [new year parties], and actually had a really good year last year. One florist at Shanghai Chengzhuang Florist Company, which supplies flowers to hotels and restaurants where business is normally boosted by the parties, said that they were "greatly" affected by the cancellations and that their business had been cut by half from last year.
