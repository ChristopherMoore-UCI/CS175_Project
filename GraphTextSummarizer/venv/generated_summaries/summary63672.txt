Martha Stewart Living: Instant organization: Get it together in 15 minutes or less From there, I decided to make turkeys the theme: large Perma-Stone turkey "statues," gently tinted in various earth tones; smaller turkey place-card holders; turkey chocolates for dessert; and turkey decals for some of my Wedgwood Drabware plates. We tried casting in my old tin and metal turkey-shaped chocolate molds first, but we couldn't get the cement to release easily once set, so we used very beautiful plastic candy and candle molds of turkeys in various sizes for the project instead. We printed the clip art (you can find it and instructions at marthastewart.com/turkey- decals) on a home printer and stuck it on as a purely decorative embellishmentâ€”the plates were replaced with heated dinner plates for the meal. I wanted the table to be seasonal, indicative of turkeys and harvest, and I wanted everything to be for the children. With the help of crafts editor Marcie McGoldrick, we devised a method for casting numerous turkeys from a material called PermaStone, a lightweight, durable cement.
