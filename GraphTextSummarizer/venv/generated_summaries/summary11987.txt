Soldiers killed 32 suspected terrorists and destroyed 31 tunnels connecting Gaza and Egypt since a military offensive in the region began last month, said spokesman Col. Ahmad Mohamed Ali. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has visited the Gaza border and vowed to bring justice to those affected. Once called Operation Eagle, now Operation Sinai, the offensive started after more than a dozen Egyptian soldiers were killed and seven others were wounded in an August 5 attack near the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egyptian forces have killed nearly three dozen people so far in its fight against jihadis in the volatile Sinai peninsula, the army said Saturday. Sinai has fallen into a state of lawlessness since the uprising that toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year.
