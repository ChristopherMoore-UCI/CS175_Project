These bountiful natural resources combined with the relative stability of northern Iraq have helped fuel a nascent luxury property boom in recent years -- no mean feat in a country that has been pummeled by three wars, brutal dictatorship and recurring sectarian tensions over the last three decades. The rolling hills that surround the city of Erbil in northern Iraq once helped the bustling Kurdish capital earn its reputation as the Switzerland of the Middle East. After three years of oil prices averaging more than $100 a barrel, meanwhile, Iraq's fourth largest city is now enjoying a second boom as it welcomes wealthy Syrians, Egyptians and Lebanese fleeing violence and uncertainty in their homelands. Compared to the chaos and tragedy of the recent past, however, Erbil is a city on the move and a far cry from the days of Saddam Hussein or the violence elsewhere in Iraq. "I don't know how to describe it but it is growing and it will still grow," explained Dean Michael, chairman of Atconz Group, a Iraqi company behind a series of developments in Erbil's luxury property sector.
