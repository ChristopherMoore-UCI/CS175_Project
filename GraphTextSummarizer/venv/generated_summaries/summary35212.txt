The England and LA Galaxy midfielder has been in South Africa with Football Association chief Lord Triesman to promote England's bid ahead of the draw for the 2010 tournament. FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who had previously been critical of England's bid to stage the tournament, said that celebrity appeal can form just as important part of a bid as the quality of the stadiums. "England is one of the few countries with its stadia and its infrastructure that could host a World Cup almost immediately, next week. Of course that will help - isn't that what football is all about?" FA chief Lord Triesman also appreciates the role that Beckham, who has met with FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Warner while on the trip, can have on charming the relevant parties. Beckham was an ambassador for the successful London 2012 Olympic campaign, and now has a similar role in the World Cup bid.
