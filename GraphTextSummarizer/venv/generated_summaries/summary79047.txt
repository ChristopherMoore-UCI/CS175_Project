In 1997, she joined with industrial designer Alexandra Stratou and architect Stella Constantinides to create a breathtaking spiral made up of alternating conical dips and protrusions in the Sahara Desert, near the Egyptian town of El Gouna just off the Red Sea. Today, we're in a financial crisis, and perhaps Desert Breath reflects a new humility people feel, or a new need to connect to nature. "It's surprising that so many years later it would get all this attention, but on the other hand, sometimes things find their own moment," Stratou speculates. "Through its slow disintegration, it's become an instrument to measure the passage of time," says Stratou. The project, known as Desert Breath, spreads over one million square feet of sand.
