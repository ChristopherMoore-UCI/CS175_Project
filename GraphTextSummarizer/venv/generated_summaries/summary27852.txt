"Further, no one has ever found a single real-world example of tin whiskers causing an unintended acceleration event, nor have they put forth any evidence of unintended acceleration occurring in a Toyota vehicle because of tin whiskers forming inside an accelerator pedal position sensor," Lyons said. "Indeed, no data indicates that tin whiskers are more prone to occur in Toyota vehicles than any other vehicle in the marketplace," Lyons said in an e-mail to CNN. So far there are three known causes of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles: improperly installed floor mats, sticky pedals and driver error. Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said Thursday that "all the scientific evidence" confirms there's no problem with the electronic throttle-control systems in Toyota vehicles. -- U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is asking the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to look into additional questions about unintended acceleration of Toyota cars.
