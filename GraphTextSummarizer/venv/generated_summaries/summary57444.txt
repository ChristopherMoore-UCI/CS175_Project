Revenge porn victims withdraw from online engagement, shutting down their social media profiles and blogs to prevent strangers from finding them online. Revenge porn is a harmful form of bigotry and sexual harassment. The simple but regrettable truth is that after consulting search results, employers don't call revenge porn victims to schedule an interview or to extend offers. Schools have fired teachers whose naked photos appeared on revenge porn sites. Criminal law should have a role in deterring and punishing revenge porn.
