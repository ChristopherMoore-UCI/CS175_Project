Schools get much of their funding from property tax revenues. "The biggest issue is that when [children have to move] when there are other stressors going on, we know it puts these kids at greater risk for being behind in their academics," said Pat Popp, a past president of the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth. A study by the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children reported that more than 450 school districts across the nation had an increase of at least 25 percent in the number of identified homeless students between the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. It also found that  moving a lot reduces the student's chance of graduating from high school by half. The youngsters are pulled out of school, often leaving their friends behind without even saying goodbye.
