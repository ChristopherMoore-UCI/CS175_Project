Having already been issued with a life ban from the Greek national team for his actions in the 2-1 league win over Veria, Giorgos Katidis has now been sanctioned by AEK Athens as well. Although his 84th minute goal helped lift troubled AEK four points clear from the relegation zone, Katidis will play no further role in the remaining two months of the season as the traditional giants of the Greek game try to avoid the first relegation in their long history. In a statement, AEK confirmed rumors that the club future of the onetime Greek under-19 captain is now in serious question. An example of the club's political leanings came when AEK played a friendly in Belgrade against local side Partizan in April 1999, a fortnight into NATO's bombing campaign of Serbia, in a show of solidarity. " A section of AEK's support -- influential fan group Original 21 -- has already said that it wishes to see Katidis expelled from the club.
