" "There have been over 8,000 books about The Beatles but there has never been serious academic study and that is what we are going to address," says Miles Brocken, Hope's senior lecturer in popular music. Liverpool Hope University, in the Fab Four's home city, says its Beatles, Popular Music and Society course will be a long-overdue examination of the band behind songs such as "Help!" -- They helped introduce the world to mop top haircuts, collarless jackets and yellow submarines -- now a British university is launching what it says is the world's first ever masters degree in the Beatles. The masters degree will examine The Beatles' contribution to modern society. "Forty years on from their break-up, now is the right time and Liverpool is the right place to study The Beatles," he adds.
