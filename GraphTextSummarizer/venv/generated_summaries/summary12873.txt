But that's what police in Cobb County, Georgia, say happened last week when 33-year-old Justin Ross Harris left his 22-month-old son, Cooper Mills Harris, strapped into a car seat while he went to work. Leanna Harris spoke in defense of her husband during Cooper's funeral Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Justin Harris' hometown. Justin Harris is being held without bond at the Cobb County jail after pleading not guilty last week. The document states that when investigators interviewed Justin Harris, "he stated that he recently researched, through the Internet, child deaths inside vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for that to occur. "The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation," Cobb County police Chief John R. Houser said in a statement.
