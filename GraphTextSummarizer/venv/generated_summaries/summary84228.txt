The grisly search for human remains from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 entered a new phase Friday, as the largest group yet of international experts scoured the crash site in eastern Ukraine. Overnight, 10 Ukrainian paratroopers were killed near Shakhtarsk, less than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the crash area, when their convoy came under attack from pro-Russia rebel forces, according to the Facebook page of Ukraine's Counter-Terrorist Operation. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said at a briefing Friday that Russia was "actively preparing firing positions for shelling Ukrainian territory" and has positioned 17 Grad rocket systems in its Bryansk region, about three miles from the border with Ukraine, according to Ukraine's Ukrinform news agency. " U.S. concerns Obama spoke Friday with Putin and underscored "his deep concerns about Russia's increased support for the separatists in Ukraine," the White House said. Aalbersberg said the recovery team is now on its way to a new base in the town of Soledar, to the northwest of the rural location in eastern Ukraine where MH17 came down on July 17, strewing debris across a huge area.
