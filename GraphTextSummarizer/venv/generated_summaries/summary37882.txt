Sunday's attacks were the latest in a series of cross-border assaults from regions in eastern Afghanistan where U.S. troops began pulling out last year. In 2011, cross-border attacks by militants killed scores of Pakistani soldiers and increased tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Deadly standoff ends at Afghan hotel; hostages freed after several hours 2 children among dead in Pakistan blasts Journalist Aamir Iqbal contributed to this report. Washington has almost always sided with Afghanistan in the finger-pointing, often blaming some of the deadliest attacks against western targets in Afghanistan on militants based in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region. At least 15 Taliban fighters were killed in firefights that followed the attacks in the district of Upper Dir in northwest Paksitan, Colonel Wasim Ahmed told CNN.
