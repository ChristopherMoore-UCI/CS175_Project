Hammerschlag thinks the odds are high that sharks will swim through water filled with oil, but he can't be certain because there's no precedent. And a reduced shark population could impact the entire Gulf ecosystem, according to Neil Hammerschlag, a researcher at the University of Miami, who has been studying sharks for a decade -- tagging them to determine their migratory patterns and other behaviors. As with most weekends, Hammerschlag leads a university research team packed into a boat with interns and high school students, to fish for sharks. "Sharks don't chew their food they swallow it," Hammerschlag says. "Sharks breathe through the water," says Hammerschlag.
