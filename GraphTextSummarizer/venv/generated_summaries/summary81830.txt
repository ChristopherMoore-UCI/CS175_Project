For the past few decades when talking about malaria, public health officials and malaria experts have avoided the word "eradication." A second challenge will be to translate the enormous wealth of basic information about malaria parasites, mosquito vectors and the human host into new intervention strategies. The diversity of malaria in communities across the globe and the changes in tools and monitoring strategies required over time to achieve eradication were not fully appreciated. One of the means to develop important new tools critical for the eradication of malaria is through biomedical research. As we work toward controlling and eliminating malaria in endemic regions of the world, it will be important to monitor shifts in disease patterns as we achieve success.
