Wheeler, who lived in New Castle, worked under three Republican presidents -- Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush. A staff officer in Vietnam, Wheeler was a graduate of West Point, as well as Harvard Business School and Yale Law School. "It is only fitting that we pause now and remember Jack Wheeler, who served his country honorably, then dedicated himself to ensuring that our nation's service members are always given the respect they deserve," said Jan Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. Farrall noted that Wheeler's body was seen jutting out of a garbage truck at the landfill by a spotter whose job it is to ensure that hazardous material is not dumped there. The Delaware medical examiner's office has ruled the death of 66-year-old John P. Wheeler a homicide.
