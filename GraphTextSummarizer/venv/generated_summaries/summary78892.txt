Lincoln features a great deal of incendiary speech-making on the floor of the House of Representatives, and Kushner's script, which is based in part on the Doris Kearns Goodwin book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, has a lot of fun weaving insults of astonishing brazenness into oratory that lays bare the issues in all their gripping moral complexity. He thrillingly demythologizes Lincoln by placing us inside Lincoln's experience — shut up by himself (or with his querulous cabinet) in the drab meeting rooms of the White House, or in his bedroom with the ambitious, haunted Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field), who still blames Abe for the death of their son Willie. He nails Lincoln's thousand-yard stare — a gaze directed at once inward (at the whir of his own mental machinery) and outward (at the cosmic hum of history). Lincoln is a stirring paradox, a dream of history as it might truly have happened. It plugs us into the final months of Lincoln's presidency with a purity that makes us feel transported as though by time machine.
