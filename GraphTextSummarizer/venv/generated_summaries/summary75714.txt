"We got a lot of buzz out of the fact that we re-engineered all our care from beginning to end," Dr. Glenn Steele, president and CEO of Geisinger said. Through technology and its use of electronic medical records, the company says it has shaved costs by preventing unnecessary tests. Berger, who is also the system's director of clinical research, says patients and doctors both benefit from this type of medicine. Geisinger says its procedures and operations cost patients less than others. The company also helps keep patients with chronic problems from getting worse by assigning case managers to consult and check in with patients as often as necessary.
