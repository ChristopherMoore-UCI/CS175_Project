One of the strongest ever recorded, the storm put the Philippine port city of Tacloban underwater, and storm chaser James Reynolds was there filming the natural disaster at what's been regarded as its ground zero. The storm also destroyed most of Reynolds' camera gear, so he used a small backup camera and even his iPhone to film the biblical-like flooding of Tacloban -- until his batteries began to die. "One block of the city was up in flames, a raging fire was burning uncontrollably," Reynolds said in telephone interview from the Philippines. Reynolds and his crew filmed the height of flooding while at a Tacloban hotel. There was water, water, everywhere -- yet nary enough to put out a fire, Reynolds said.
