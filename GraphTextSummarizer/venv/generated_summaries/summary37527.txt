Father blames Israeli military in Palestinian teens' deaths Cameras that Fakher Zayed set up around his four-story Beitunya house showed Nowarah suddenly falling forward, landing briefly on his hands, then rolling over to lie on his back. CNN producer Kareem Khadder filmed the same clashes -- including video showing two Israeli security troops firing their rifles at Palestinian protesters at the same exact moment that Nowarah was shot. Source: Israel suspends soldier after Palestinian deaths Security cameras captured the second fatal shooting that day of a Palestinian teen -- 17-year-old Mohammad Odeh Salameh -- just before 3 p.m., showing him suddenly fall to the ground just steps from where Nowarah was wounded. Siam Nowarah, the father of the late 16-year-old Nadeem Nowarah, called the arrest "a step in the right direction." According to a medical report, Nowarah was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later, having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back.
