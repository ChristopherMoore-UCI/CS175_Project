There was simply no stopping the four-time world champion, who will be bidding for a record eighth straight Grand Prix victory and his 12th of the season when the race proper gets underway in Austin Sunday afternoon. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg struggled in the windy conditions and with unresponsive tires to be back in 14th. -- Sebastian Vettel adapted to "tricky" and blustery conditions at the Circuit of Americas to pip his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber to pole position Saturday at the United States Grand Prix in Texas. It was Red Bull's fifth one-two on the grid this season and Vettel's 44th career pole. Romain Grosjean was third fastest for Lotus, with Kimi Raikkonen's replacement Heikki Kovalainen an excellent eighth, coming in at short notice for his fellow Finn who has undergone back surgery.
