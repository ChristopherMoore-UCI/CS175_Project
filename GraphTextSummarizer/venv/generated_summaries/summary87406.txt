"Silverstone has a significant historical legacy, but we maintain our place at the forefront of contemporary international motor sport, hosting an array of world class events and activities. "The BRDC is extremely proud of this new building, but we acknowledge that none of it would have been possible without our superb and exceptional Silverstone team. "Silverstone is a cornerstone of our industry and the BRDC will continue to develop the circuit to ensure that Britain has a world class home for motor sport and related technology." -- Silverstone, the host of the British Grand Prix, has unveiled a multi-million dollar revamp of their pit lane and paddock facilities called "The Wing." Silverstone staged the British Grand Prix from 1948 onwards but was stripped of the race in favor of Donington Park in 2008.
