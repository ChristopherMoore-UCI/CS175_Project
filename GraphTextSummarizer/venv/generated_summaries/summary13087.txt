He will next face fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki, who beat Argentine 15th seed Juan Monaco to reach the last 16 at Wimbledon for the first time and only the second at any of the four grand slams. -- Roger Federer staged a remarkable fightback on Friday to reach the last 16 at Wimbledon and avoid following great rival Rafael Nadal in exiting the grass-court grand slam before the end of its first week. The 31-year-old, who also reached the fourth round last year, progressed with an equally battling 1-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 4-6 6-3 victory against Spanish 17th seed Fernando Verdasco. Federer had to come from two sets down in his first-round Wimbledon match in 2010, and he pulled off the feat for the eighth time in his career after winning the third set 6-2, leveling with a crucial 8-6 tie-breaker and then cruising 6-1 in the decider after his fellow 30-year-old called for treatment on a leg injury. Benneteau, ranked 32nd, had beaten the Swiss superstar once in the last of their previous three meetings in 2009 -- and the big-serving Frenchman was up for the challenge again as he won the first set 6-4 and then took the second 7-3 in a tie-break.
