"New Moon" has also easily beaten its own predecessor, "Twilight," which earned $36 million on opening day last year. According to Hollywood trade magazine Variety, "New Moon" is the biggest midnight showing in history, grossing $26.3 million when it opened in 3,514 theaters at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The second installment in the "Twilight" saga, starring Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen, Kristen Stewart as his star-crossed love and Taylor Lautner as the wolfboy who loves her, has already ripped through a box office record. And while "Twilight's" opening weekend was $69.7 million, early reports are that "New Moon" will do even better. "This film is nothing more than a moral vacuum with a deviant message and as such should be of concern," warns the Vatican's culture council leader, Monsignor Franco Perazzolo, in a statement timed to the release of "New Moon," according to E!
