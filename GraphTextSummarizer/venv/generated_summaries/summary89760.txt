A Miami cruise ship terminal was evacuated for more than two hours Wednesday morning when customs officials detected radiation from a passenger bag. But the sensitive devices can also detect naturally occurring radiation in such substances as ceramics and kitty litter, and even in people recently treated with nuclear medicines. Ruiz said Miami-Dade Police Department explosives detection canine support and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department hazardous materials units responded to the scene. Customs and Border Protection officers wear radiation devices, similar in size to pagers, to detect possible threats. U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Jaime Ruiz said officers from the agency detected radiation coming from a couple's bag as they disembarked from a cruise ship trip.
