-- South Korea conducted its largest-ever nationwide civil defense drill Wednesday afternoon to prepare the public for a potential military attack from North Korea after Pyongyang shelled a South Korean island less than a month ago. Traffic was stopped all across the country, and students were escorted out of school buildings into underground locations. Also the Defense Ministry announced Wednesday that it has nominated Gen. Kim Sang-ki, commander of the Third Army, for the newly vacated post of South Korea's Army chief, Yonhap news agency reported. "We actually don't participate very well, because nothing happened between North Korea and South Korea. South Korea plans on boosting its underground shelter facilities along the border regions and in the island areas in the Yellow Sea where the island attack occurred, according to NEMA.
