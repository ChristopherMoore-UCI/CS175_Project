NYPD hasn't given up on Baby Hope Detective Robert Dewhurst, a member of the squad, told CNN in July that several detectives were still on the case and that people with information may speak many years later for many reasons, such as feeling safer after moving to a new area where they don't see the person responsible every day. "We have been able to identify the mother of Baby Hope as a result of, in my judgment, outstanding detective work," Kelly said on Tuesday. Thanks to a tip, the department confirmed the identity of the girl's mother through DNA testing, according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. "He is someone we definitely have to talk to," NYPD Assistant Chief Joe Reznick told CNN on Thursday, "But can we arrest him for this right now? For months after Baby Hope's body was found, police went back to the site hoping whoever was responsible, driven by guilt, had left some type of memorial that would have helped police.
