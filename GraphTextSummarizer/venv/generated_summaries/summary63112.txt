Opposition to Saleh has solidified in the wake of violent confrontations between security forces and protesters on Friday, when thousands of anti-government protesters demonstrated in Sanaa, Aden and elsewhere. He spoke to military leaders Saturday, saying there was a plot against Yemeni unity and saying protesters in Aden were causing damage out of "selfishness." On Tuesday, Interior Minister Mutahar al-Masri said that three members of security forces died and 10 were wounded in recent protests, according to the official Saba news agency. Saleh met Monday with Muslim scholars and members of opposition groups to discuss the possibility of forming a coaltion government that would rule until elections to replace him, according to two Yemeni government sources. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom.
