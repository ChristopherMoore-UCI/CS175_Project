The COI cannot, of course, guarantee the adoption of a new Security Council resolution on human rights in DPRK. Based upon the testimony and information received, the COI found that DPRK authorities had committed, and were continuing to commit, crimes against humanity in political prison camps; in the ordinary prison system; by targeting religious believers; by imposing starvation on large sections of the population; and by targeting persons, including persons from other countries, and through the course of state sponsored abductions and disappearances. Failures with DPRK It was frequently said that the greatest danger to human rights in the case of DPRK was its possession of a reported 20 nuclear armed warheads and its current development of an arsenal of missile delivery systems that could threaten its neighbors and the global community. But this was not acceptable because of the substantial and believable testimony and other information demonstrating grave crimes against humanity and other human rights violations on the part of DPRK, a member country of the United Nations. In this sense, DPRK confronted the United Nations human rights system with an impasse.
