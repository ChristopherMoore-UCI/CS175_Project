Accused Ohio school shooter T.J. Lane was in juvenile court Tuesday for a pretrial hearing as prosecutors moved to limit the release of more information about the suspect. Authorities released police reports and court records last week that showed Lane had a troubled childhood. Prosecutors filed a motion Monday to block the media from access to other records related to Lane, CNN affiliate WOIO reported. Seated with his attorney and positioned in front of his grandparents, Lane, 17, wore a beige shirt and appeared to address the court politely during its ongoing deliberations over last month's shooting at Chardon High School. Prosecutors argued that Lane was already under "public scrutiny" and the release of more information "would only magnify the situation for him and his relatives," the affiliate reported.
