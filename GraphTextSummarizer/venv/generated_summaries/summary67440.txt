LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- Paul Stanley, a singer and guitarist with rock band Kiss, was forced to pull out of a show in California on Friday after his heart started beating at more than twice the normal level, he said on his Web site. A call to Kiss manager Doc McGhee for an update on Stanley's condition was not immediately returned late on Saturday. The apparent tachycardia happened while the band was rehearsing for a performance at a casino in San Jacinto, California, about 90 miles (145 km) east of Los Angeles.
