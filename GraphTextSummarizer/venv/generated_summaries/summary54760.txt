In contrast to what Guruswamy described as Modi's "relentless drive to become prime minister," questions have been asked whether Gandhi possesses a genuine desire to lead, while his personal style has failed to excite voters. "This election is a battle of ideologies, it's a battle for (the) kind of India we want," declared 43-year-old Congress Party candidate Rahul Gandhi -- whose great-grandfather, grandmother and father have all served as prime minister -- in a recent speech. "There is no 'Gujarat model,' and there are other states with faster economic growth," says Guruswamy. The party's support has been boosted by the immense popularity of prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, 63-year-old Chief Minister of the western state of Gujarat. "They're getting some hope that perhaps Modi can steer the economy in the right direction so that they can get more in terms of job opportunities and economic growth," he said.
