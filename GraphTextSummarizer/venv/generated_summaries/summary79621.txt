Sung, who was under investigation for fraud and bribery, left a note listing names and amounts of cash given to top officials, including those who work for the President. Calls for Lee to resign began after South Korean tycoon Sung Woan-jong was found hanging from a tree in Seoul in an apparent suicide on April 9. Lee will stay in his official role until South Korean President Park Geun-hye accepts his resignation. Lee and seven other politicians with links to the South Korean President are under investigation. Park heard about the resignation and called it "regrettable," according to the South Korean presidential office.
