Tony Lo, CEO of Giant Global Group, is an avid cyclist himself and commutes 35 kilometers on his Giant Propel Advanced SL, which he describes as the most aerodynamic road bike in the world. They're Giant Bicylces -- the work of a Taiwan based company which has been making bikes since 1972, and now has over 12,000 retail partners worldwide. You want the pedal to be very strong -- we call that the power core -- but in the seat you want it to be a bit soft, so it doesn't feel so hard," says Lo. "The most important thing we learn is that the bicycle can always become better," adds Lo. " Giant's bikes are made from millions of carbon fibers, each thinner than a human hair, cut by machines and sewn together.
