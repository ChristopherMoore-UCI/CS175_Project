Instead of "Do Not Track," Google says it offers a plug-in for Chrome called "Keep My Opt-Outs," which prevents users from deleting opt-out cookies from advertising networks when they delete their cookies. No one is using this plug-in and they don't expect anyone to use it." Of all the major browser makers, Google would have the most to lose if many people starting setting the flag and companies were forced, by public opinion or law, to obey it. While Google's largest source of ad money -- search ads related to search terms -- doesn't rely on behavioral tracking, its growing business of display advertising (on other websites and in YouTube) does. But Soghoian argues that both Google's ad program and its analytics program already let users opt out, so why not simply adopt the "Do Not Track" flag as another signal to opt out. Answering his own question, he says it's about money that Google stands to lose if users of its browser get an easy way to opt out of its advertising tracking.
