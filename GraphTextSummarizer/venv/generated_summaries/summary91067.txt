Four: Medicaid "coercion" (the national policy implications issue) 1 p.m. ET Wednesday, one hour of oral arguments This hearing will look at whether states can be forced by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse. Their needy citizens rely on Medicaid, states argue, but the law's expansion of the program could cripple state budgets, currently on average about 20%. No federal court has ever ruled states have been unlawfully coerced when they accept conditions or strings attached to federal funds. So the long-standing fight over "federalism" and the leverage the national government wields over states might soon reach epic levels with a high court decision either strengthening or limiting congressional authority on this and potentially a host of other regulatory areas. Two: Individual Mandate (the key issue) 10 a.m. ET Tuesday, two hours of oral arguments This provision requires nearly all Americans to buy some form of health insurance beginning in 2014 or face financial penalties.
