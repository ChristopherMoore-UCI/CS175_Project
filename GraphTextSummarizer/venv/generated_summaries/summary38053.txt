Meanwhile, France's Alexis Pinturault claimed only the second World Cup win over his career when he triumphed in the men's slalom at Val d'Isere on Saturday. Last year Vonn won her fourth World Cup title ahead of Maze and Hofl-Riesch. Vonn is 167 points behind leader Tina Maze of Slovenia, who followed up her Friday with with second place ahead of another U.S. skier, Julia Mancuso, on a course shortened due to poor visibility. Having failed to finish Friday's Super Combined race at Saint Moritz in Switzerland, the 28-year-old bounced back to win the Super G event on Saturday to stay in overall title contention. It was Vonn's 57th World Cup race victory, the second best tally in women's alpine racing, and her 20th in a discipline that she has dominated for the past four years.
