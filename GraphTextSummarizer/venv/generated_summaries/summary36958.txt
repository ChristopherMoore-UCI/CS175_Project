-- Health care workers returning to New York who've had contact with Ebola patients but don't show symptoms can serve a mandatory 21-day quarantine in their homes, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday night. A senior administration official told CNN on Sunday that "we have let the governors of New York, New Jersey and others states know that we have concerns with the unintended consequences of policies not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa. " Mandatory quarantines -- now what? 'Disincentive for the health care workers' A top federal health official publicly criticized Christie and Cuomo on Sunday, saying the two states' quarantine rule could discourage health workers from helping fight Ebola in Africa, which would ultimately endanger the United States. " Also on Sunday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio talked about Ebola at a news conference but didn't offer any direct criticism of Cuomo or Christie.
