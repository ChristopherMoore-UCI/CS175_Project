But today The Wall Street Journal reported that the Canadian smartphone maker may reveal its own iPad-like tablet at its developer conference in San Francisco, which starts Monday. The BlackBerry tablet--sometimes referred to as the "BlackPad" since RIM bought the domain blackpad.com--is said to have a 7-inch touchscreen and at least one camera, maybe two, according to the Journal. It's been reported before, but the Journal's story reiterates that the tablet won't use RIM's new BlackBerry 6 mobile OS. Since it's not being sold with wireless service, it seems unlikely it would be sold through a carrier the way BlackBerrys are, and that would mean no carrier subsidy like newer tablets from Dell and Samsung have. The much-discussed BlackBerry tablet may finally come to fruition as soon as next week.
