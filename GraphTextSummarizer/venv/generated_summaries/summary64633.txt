For their part, Obama and Democrats continue to push the central theme of last year's election campaign in calling for a combination of more tax revenue from the wealthy as part of a package that includes spending cuts, rather than what they call a meat cleaver approach. A majority of Americans support an approach that combines spending cuts and some tax increases to reduce federal deficits, according to surveys Thursday by Pew/USA Today and Bloomberg News. While House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders say they want to replace the forced cuts with other spending reductions that would be less harmful, some GOP legislators contend the across-the-board approach of sequestration is a good start. A $110 billion proposal by Senate Democrats, which is similar to a plan by House Democrats, would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires, stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. -- President Barack Obama, Democratic governors and even a Republican Cabinet member on Friday blamed GOP intransigence for the failure so far to reach a deal to avert the harshest impacts of forced spending cuts set to take effect March 1.
