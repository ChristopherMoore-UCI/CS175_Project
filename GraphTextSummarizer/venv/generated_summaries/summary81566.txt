-- Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko finally broke his English Premier League duck for Manchester City, as his goal helped Roberto Mancini's side to a 1-0 victory at Blackburn Rovers. England international Gareth Barry then had a header cleared off the line by ex-Real Madrid defender Michel Salgado before Rovers' striker Jason Roberts claimed a penalty after what looked like a trip by Vincent Kompany. Martin Olsson forced City keeper Joe Hart into an injury time save from a fiercely hit free kick, but Mancini's side held out until the final whistle for their second win in a row after they defeated bitter rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup semifinal. His close range 75th minute winner saw City pull four points clear of Tottenham in the fourth qualification slot for the lucrative Champions League tournament, while Rovers slipped deeper into relegation trouble. Dzeko moved to City from German club Wolfsburg in January for a fee reported to be in the region of $44.5 million but had gone nine league games without scoring before the trip to Ewood Park.
