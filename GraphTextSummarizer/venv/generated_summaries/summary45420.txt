-- Two bombs went off at separate locations in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry, police said Thursday. The IRA for decades fought against British authorities in Northern Ireland, but has since renounced violence. " Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second largest city, has a Catholic majority and is known as Derry by many residents. The police commander for the city, Chief Superintendent Stephen Martin, branded the attacks "reckless." " Elliott called for a security crackdown by British authorities and urged anyone with information on the bombers to give it to police.
