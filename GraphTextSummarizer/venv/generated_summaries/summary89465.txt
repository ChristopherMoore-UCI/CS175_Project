"When Harry Met Sally" isn't the only film Improv Everywhere has experimented with. The group's most recent stunt took place at Katz's Delicatessen, the setting for the classic fake orgasm scene in 1989's "When Harry Met Sally." Meg Ryan's Sally was proving a point to Billy Crystal's Harry that women can indeed simulate pleasure without actually being satisfied, and her performance was so convincing, another customer wanted to "have what she's having." Instead, the group has made it its mission to re-enact famous scenes from movies -- romantic comedies, action, fantasy films, you name it -- in ordinary situations. Their other "Movies in Real Life" segments include "Back to the Future," "Indiana Jones" and "Lord of the Rings."
