But many physicians -- backed by abortion rights supporters -- say they routinely induce medical abortions through a combination of drugs they determine is simpler, safer, and less expensive than the current federal protocols on the use of abortion drugs. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a pending appeal from Oklahoma officials who were defending a state law limiting abortions performed with medicine instead of surgery. The high court months ago had tentatively added this case to its docket, but put things on hold while it sought detailed answers from Oklahoma Supreme Court. The current case is Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice (12-1094). This was the first of several restrictive abortion laws nationwide to get review by the U.S. justices.
