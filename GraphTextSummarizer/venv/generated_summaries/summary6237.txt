This perception is reinforced by the fact that Annan's plan does not call for al-Assad to step down -- a detail that is not missed by the Assad regime propaganda machine. The activists who are spearheading Syria's revolution insist that the opposition exile leadership has a limited mandate and that is to discuss details for the transfer of power from the Assad family to the opposition. The six-point peace plan for Syria proposed by Kofi Annan is doomed to fail for one simple reason: Neither President Bashar al-Assad nor the government opposition is interested in making it work. Al-Assad has not been able to crush the opposition, and opposition seems nowhere near to dislodging al-Assad. Russia and Iran will probably not abandon al-Assad until they are part of the deal-making process about Syria's future government.
