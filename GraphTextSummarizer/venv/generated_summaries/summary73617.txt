Questioned on Netanyahu's statement that Israel was ready to relaunch peace talks Syria without pre-conditions, Assad emphasized that if Israel is serious about talks, Syria is ready to send experts to Turkey and begin discussions with Israeli experts. Assad said he and Sarkozy discussed living conditions in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory of Gaza -- reeling from the ongoing conflict with Israel, including the fierce Israeli offensive against militants that began late last year after constant rocket attacks on Israel by Gaza guerrillas. The Palestinian security sources said a special force opened fire on a number of youths near the border fence with Israel in central Gaza. Israel Defense Forces and Gaza security sources both confirmed an incident, but the sides had different accounts. Turkey recently had mediated indirect talks between Israel and Syria, neighboring countries that have been adversaries for years.
