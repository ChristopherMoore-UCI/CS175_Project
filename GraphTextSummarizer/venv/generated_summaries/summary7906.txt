Total's share price fell 7% Tuesday on news of the leak, but market analyst firm Jeffries International said Wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted. "If the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source, we could be looking at complete destruction," said Jake Molloy, an official with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. The Elgin is in significantly shallower water, which could make problems easier to fix, but it is leaking gas, rather than oil. It was down about 1% from the day before as of Wednesday afternoon in France, where it is traded. -- Energy giant Total was trying Wednesday to contain a gas leak that forced the evacuation of a platform off the coast of Scotland.
