Prosecutors could have never won a trial to convict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown and the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson was the right call, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday. RELATED: Ferguson an exception as '93% of blacks are killed by other blacks,' Giuliani says Several of the witnesses in the case gave conflicting versions of the altercation between Brown and Wilson that either contradicted the physical evidence or their own previous statements, St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloh said at a press conference Monday night. "If you can't prove probable cause, how are you going to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt when the witnesses are contradicting themselves?" Giuliani has been a vocal critic of the coverage of the situation in Ferguson, saying over the weekend on NBC's "Meet the Press" that what happened to Michael Brown does not exemplify a larger national problem. Giuliani, who also served six years as a U.S. attorney, said the case against Wilson failed the two tests that should be considered in weighing an indictment: whether there is probable cause and whether a prosecutor could clinch a conviction. Giuliani added that law enforcement officials should have responded more directly and forcefully to protests that turned violent Monday night.
