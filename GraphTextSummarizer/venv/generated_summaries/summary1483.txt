Funeral for Powell boys set for Saturday Authorities say Powell, who is also a suspect in the 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox-Powell, planned his sons' fiery deaths. " Powell's boss called and said he also received an e-mail from Powell, saying goodbye. I got an e-mail from my client and that e-mail gives me every indication that it was intentional. ... Jeff Bassett, Josh Powell's attorney, also called 911 after he received an e-mail from his client. -- Even before the explosions and blaze that killed Josh Powell and his two sons, a social worker feared the boys she brought for a supervised visit with their father were in extreme danger.
