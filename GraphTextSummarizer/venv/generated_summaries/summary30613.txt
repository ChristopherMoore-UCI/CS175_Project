-- Former child star and radio personality Danny Bonaduce is nursing a nasty bite mark after a fan latched onto his face at a Washington state casino Friday night. " Bath salts are a class of designer drugs that contain amphetamine-like chemicals and were initially blamed in a May attack in Miami in which a naked man chewed off part of another man's face. "It was so painful," said Bonaduce, who was also at the casino to serve as master of ceremonies for a concert by Hells Belles, an all-female AC/DC tribute band. Bonaduce said he won't file charges in the attack, saying he's certain the woman had lost her grasp on reality. Chucky is a reference to the villain in the "Child's Play" horror film series about a murderous, possessed doll with a bad attitude and a mouth full of sharp chompers.
