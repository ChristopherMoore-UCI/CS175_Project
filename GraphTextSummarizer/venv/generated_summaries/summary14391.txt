Emily Browning -- the doll-like child actress from "Lemony Snicket" who graduated to the status of action-babe in "Sucker Punch" earlier this year -- plays Lucy, a college student who takes on a series of menial jobs over the course of the film, including waitress, lab rat, secretary and sex toy. Scenes of Lucy's everyday life away from work -- bickering with flat-mates, or caring for a dying friend -- fail to shed much light on the character or her motivations, and are shot in the same monotonous rhythm. It's a strong indication that whatever else, Lucy has the willpower to dissociate mind from body -- to mentally switch off. This remains her defining characteristic throughout: a kind of abstention that serves her well in trying circumstances, but which also makes Lucy a frustratingly vague, ill-defined personality. Interviewed for another position by the immaculately coiffed and polished Clara (a chilly, regal Rachel Blake), Lucy uncomplainingly strips down to her undies for an intimate physical inspection.
