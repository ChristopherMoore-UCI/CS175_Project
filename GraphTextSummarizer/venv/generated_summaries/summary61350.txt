Among the other terms of the plea, the former star of the TV series "The Partridge Family" must attend DUI school, pay a $500 fine and serve 50 hours of community service, said Gayle Braun, supervisor of the misdemeanor and juvenile divisions of the state attorney's office for the judicial circuit encompassing St. Lucie County. -- Former teen idol David Cassidy was ordered to serve a year of probation and had his license suspended for six months after pleading no contest Wednesday to a DUI charge in Florida. On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was Cassidy's real-life step-mother). Cassidy failed roadside sobriety tests and registered at 0.14% blood alcohol content on a breath test, nearly twice the state's 0.08% legal limit, according to the arrest report. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teen-aged girls attracted to such hits as "I Think I Love You."
