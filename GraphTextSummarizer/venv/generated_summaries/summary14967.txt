Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. Although no one has claimed responsibility, Boko Haram militants are the main suspects. "Baga is not accessible because it is still occupied by Boko Haram," said Sen. Maina Ma'aji Lawan of northern Borno state. " "If reports that the town was largely razed to the ground and that hundreds or even as many as 2,000  civilians were killed are true, this marks a disturbing and bloody escalation of Boko Haram's ongoing onslaught,"  said Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher for Amnesty International. Many who tried to cross into neighboring Chad drowned while trying to swim through Lake Chad.
