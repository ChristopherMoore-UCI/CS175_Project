Hough, 26, told PEOPLE backstage after Monday night's show. The actress and talk show host ended up atop the leader board on Monday after earning 23 points for her lively jive. But Lake, 42, who continuously says she's "hoping to pull a Kirstie Alley," needs to stop focusing on other people's accomplishments and inspire herself, according to her ballroom partner Derek Hough. (PEOPLE.com) -- Ricki Lake has made no secret about which former "Dancing with the Stars" contestant she looks up to as she competes on the show. I really love working with Derek.
