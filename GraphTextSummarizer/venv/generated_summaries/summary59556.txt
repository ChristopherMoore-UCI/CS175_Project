" Mongar's family filed a lawsuit last week against Gosnell's practice seeking damages, the family's attorney, Bernard Smalley, said. Born in Bhutan, Mongar spent 18 years living in a bamboo hut in a Nepalese refugee camp before coming to the United States in July 2009 as part of a humanitarian resettlement program, Smalley said. "These children have to grow up without their mother, you have a husband who is going to have to go on without his wife," Smalley said of Mongar's family. " Dr. Kermit Gosnell is charged with seven first-degree murder charges related to the deaths of seven viable babies, and one third-degree murder in the death of Mongar. Mongar died November 20, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by the doctor, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said.
