The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) called it a "good day" for the province, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it opened a "new chapter" for Northern Ireland. -- Leaders from Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland "People across Northern Ireland feared that if the political process failed, they stood to lose all that had been achieved over these last few years," Brown said.
