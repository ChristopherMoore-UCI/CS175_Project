Some observers also had expected Black Friday to mark the debut of Apple's huge new retail store inside New York City's iconic Grand Central Station. A page on Apple's site invites Black Friday shoppers to visit its online store; it's not clear whether the same deals will be offered at the company's retail stores as well. -- If you've been weighing buying a new Mac or iPad but are holding out for one of Apple's rare discounts, Black Friday is your chance. Those would be in line with the Black Friday deals Apple offered last year, although the company only marked its iPads down by $41. But the blog 9to5Mac published what it claims are some leaked details: Modest discounts of $101 on Macs, $41-$61 on iPads (depending on storage capacity) and $21-$41 on iPods.
