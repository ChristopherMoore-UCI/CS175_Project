The medical examiner's office on Monday released the 30th name: Bill L. Spillers, 30, of Arlington. The death toll from last month's landslide in rural Washington state has risen to 33, the Snohomish County medical examiner's office said Monday. A square mile of wet earth and rock rushed into the outskirts of the town of Oso in the North Cascade Mountains on March 22. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report. The slide came from a rain-saturated hillside along the north fork of the Stillaguamish River.
