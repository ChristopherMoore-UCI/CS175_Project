'Inside Llewyn Davis': Oscar Isaac, Marcus Mumford, and the Punch Brothers perform a song from the film The film opens with Llewyn performing a song at the Gaslight Cafe, and he's a terrific singer — direct, emotional, and pure. But "Inside Llewyn Davis" is about how life has played a cosmic joke on Llewyn. But I was still taken aback to see their jokey misanthropy applied to "Inside Llewyn Davis," a tale set in the achingly sincere Greenwich Village folk-music scene of 1961. Yet the more I watched "Inside Llewyn Davis," the more I saw that there is something indelible in the Coens' vision of a morosely gifted loser slipping through the cracks. With "Inside Llewyn Davis," they've made a film that is almost spooky in its perversity: a lovingly lived-in, detailed tribute to the folk scene that — hauntingly — has shut their hero out.
