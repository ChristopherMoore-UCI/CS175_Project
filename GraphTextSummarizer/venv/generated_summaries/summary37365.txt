Eight Palestinians and one Israeli died between Sunday and Tuesday in a spate of rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes, officials on both sides reported; Israel also said a Palestinian child was killed when a rocket launch attempt by militants backfired. Gaza has remained quiet since the rockets were fired, but Israeli aircraft can be heard flying overhead, a CNN producer in Gaza said. Rockets from Gaza came down in Israel overnight, according to the Israeli military. Israeli warplanes struck two targets in Gaza on Tuesday in response to the rocket fire, the Israeli military said. Another independent militant group admitted to firing one rocket into Israel at 12:45 a.m. Thursday (5:45 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday), also citing retaliation.
