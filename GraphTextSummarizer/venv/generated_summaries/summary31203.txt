-- Most Egyptians favor an advisory role for religious leaders in their country's new government, believe economic conditions are worsening and generally mistrust the United States, according to a Gallup survey released Monday. It's the fifth consecutive year Gallup has surveyed Egyptians, though the result this year clearly reflected a change in Egyptian opinions on social, religious and political reforms in Egypt. Among other findings, according to Gallup: -- 92% of Egyptians say they would include freedom of speech as a provision if they were drafting a new constitution for the country -- 67% say they would draft a provision for freedom of religion were they drafting a new constitution -- 55% say they would include freedom of assembly in a new constitution -- 92% say they have confidence in their religious institutions, while 96% say religion remains important in Egypt -- 69% favor an advisory role for religious leaders, while 14% want religious leaders to have full authority -- 9% wanted religious leaders to have no role in the new government. The findings, according to Gallup, show "Egyptian leaders must deliver on their people's expectations for free and honest elections, building on the success of the constitutional referendum. The survey, the first since the Egyptian revolution toppled Hosni Mubarak, found most Egyptians were positive about their future and their country's political and economic prospects.
