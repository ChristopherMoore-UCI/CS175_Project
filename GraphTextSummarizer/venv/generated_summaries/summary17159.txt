Since retiring from soccer, Pele has remained in the public eye as a product pitchman, ambassador for the sport of soccer and advocate for Brazil's poor, having grown up as one of them in the inland city of Tres Coracoes. He burst onto the scene as a teenager, helping lead his native Brazil to the 1958 World Cup championship. The 74-year-old has no fever and is receiving antibiotics intravenously, according to doctors at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Pele went on to star on two other World Cup title teams, in 1962 and 1970. The athletic icon had one kidney removed during his days as a player, said his aide, Jose Fornos Rodrigues.
