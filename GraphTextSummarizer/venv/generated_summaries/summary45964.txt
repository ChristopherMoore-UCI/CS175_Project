SI: NFL's most embarrassing moments They watch film for hours, have to take a weekly rules test and read what are called case books -- thick binders full of plays that give guidance on rules.

One of the NFL's best known referees, Ed Hochuli, a partner at a law firm in Phoenix, told ESPN's John Clayton earlier this month that officials often spend as many as 30 hours a week during the season at their part-time gigs. But thanks to a new contract with the NFL, veteran officials will work the game.
