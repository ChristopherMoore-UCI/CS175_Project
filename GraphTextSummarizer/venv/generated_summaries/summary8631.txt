Such customers demand the very highest of quality but they are also willing to pay the price for the bespoke craftsmanship, John Jenkins, master weaver at Toye Kenning & Spencer, said. "It certainly helps people have confidence in the company without a doubt, especially with our traditional markets, state insignias and stuff like that," said Fiona Toye, CEO of Toye Kenning & Spencer, a family business which has been making military trimmings for more than 300 years, and was given the warrant in 1956. Toye Kenning & Spencer is making around 200,000 medals for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, a huge order which has boosted the company even as it struggles with a 30% decline in core business over the last decade. Toye Kenning & Spencer has responded by diversifying into fashion and expanding overseas, using its Royal Warrant as a calling card. The company has suffered as traditional clients such as defence ministries tighten their budgets, while societies and clubs face declining memberships.
