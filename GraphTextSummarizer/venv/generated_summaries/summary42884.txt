The San Ysidro massacre seemed to introduce a "cluster" of mass shootings in the '80s and early '90s, said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University professor and author of six books on mass murder. When Rosario arrived at the McDonald's, he saw people hiding behind cars in the lot. San Diego police Capt. Michael T. Rayburn, an independent police firearms trainer in Saratoga Springs, New York, said the San Ysidro incident and others -- including gangland battles of the 1920s and more recent episodes like the infamous North Hollywood bank shootout in 1997 and the Columbine school massacre in 1999 -- force police to keep developing new weapons and tactics. At 3:40 p.m. on July 18, 1984, Huberty carried a long-barreled Uzi, a pump-action shotgun and a handgun into a McDonald's in San Ysidro, an enclave of San Diego, California.
