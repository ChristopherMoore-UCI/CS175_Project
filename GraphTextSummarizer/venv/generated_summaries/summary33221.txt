It sounds like a dangerous combination: massive tanks holding chemicals near a major water supply. That's left West Virginia officials trying "to beef up what could be viewed as a loophole with these kinds of facilities. "There's not necessarily the kind of robust environmental controls that people might anticipate that there should be on these types of facilities," he said. That was the setup in West Virginia last week when a chemical spill contaminated a river supplying water to hundreds of thousands of people. A 2005 fact sheet about the chemical filed with West Virginia environmental officials offered guidance for what to do if a large spill is detected: "Prevent runoff from entering drains, sewers, or streams."
