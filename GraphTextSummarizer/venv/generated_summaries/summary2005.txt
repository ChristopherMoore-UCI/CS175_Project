Students jumped out of windows to escape the Iranian police forces who threw tear gas and beat students, according to the iReporter, a former Tehran University student who now lives outside Iran. The investigating lawmakers have spoken to Tehran University students and other officials and are demanding the release of the detained students, Press TV reported. Tehran University students told a CNN iReporter that government forces staged a massive crackdown early Monday at the university's dorm. Amnesty International said it appeared students were also targeted at Tabriz University in northwestern Iran when security forces entered dormitories there and detained 10 students. Amateur video posted on YouTube showed several injured people identified as Isfahan University students.
