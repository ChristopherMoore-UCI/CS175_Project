"VW Kombi are no longer common in Uganda," says Landman. "Kombi Nation Tours was born out of Boase's and Cresswell's motorcycle tour and it remains the inspiration of the tour company," says Landman. "[Kombi tours] are to replicate that trip, a true adventure," says Landman. "She'd been last used as a matatu (bus/taxi)," says Rachel Landman, director of Kombi Nation Tours. In 2009, Steven Cresswell and William Boase toured Uganda from the UK on a motorcycle and saw several deserted Kombi vans along their way.
