Sono controversially sacrificed a lucrative career in America to return to apartheid South Africa in an attempt to help the country to change. Former players such as Kalusha Bwalya (Zambia), Abedi Pele (Ghana) and Salif Keita (Mali) may not be household names that roll off the tongue, but they all played a crucial role in breaking down the prejudice that existed, and hampered, the abilities of players from Africa. The hosting of the 2010 World Cup by South Africa was always going to be an occasion for celebration among football lovers around the world, but for former soccer greats who call the continent home, the event has a significance beyond mere fandom. Superstars like Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast), Michael Essien (Ghana) and Samuel Eto'o (Cameroon) may have global fame and great riches thanks to their talent, but for every modern legend from Africa there are just as many pioneers who helped break down the barriers to allow such opportunity. One such pioneer was Nigerian great Jay-Jay Okocha -- a skilful attacker who help guide the Super Eagles to Olympic gold glory in 1996 -- told CNN he believes that the World Cup proves African football has finally come of age.
