-- Afghan  President Hamid Karzai and Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, say  they've secured backing from local leaders for an upcoming military operation in  the province. But initial reports indicate that Afghan  troops will take the main role in the center of Kandahar, while U.S. troops will be mainly on the  perimeter. McChrystal  took Karzai and some of his security chiefs to Kandahar, considered the heartland of Taliban  country. McCrystal  said securing support from Afghan leaders before the start of a new offensive  was critical to success. With  McChrystal in the front row, Karzai delivered a full-court press to a group of  about 300 tribal leaders Sunday, in a bid to get their support.
