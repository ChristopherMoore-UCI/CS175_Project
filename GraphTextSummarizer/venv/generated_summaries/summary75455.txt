Back then, carriers touted improved data speeds, but many consumers didn't understand what those data rates could be used for -- completely understandable considering the relatively small installed base of smartphones in that quaint era of feature phones. When network latency is low, however, real-time applications like video chat really begin to sing. Those things include real-time gaming, streaming video and the ability to make video calls. Bottom line: Even if you've got the fastest throughput imaginable, high latency levels will prevent you from enjoying video calls and and other types of streaming video. This number refers to pure network speed -- and everyone wants speedier data service, hence everyone's preoccupation with throughput.
