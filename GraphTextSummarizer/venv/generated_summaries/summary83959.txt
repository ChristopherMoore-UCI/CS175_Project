There was some talk among the women about whether circumcised penises were "cuter" than uncircumcised penises. Parenting: A history of circumcision I'm not worried about the hygiene issues that are potentially related to uncircumcised penises. There is, I suppose, a slightly higher risk of HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections for uncircumcised males. I can't help but wonder if the practice of male circumcision, as with female genital mutilation, has something to do with a fear of human sexuality and a desire to control. They went as far as to claim that there are as many good reasons for prohibition of male circumcision as there are for female genital mutilation.
