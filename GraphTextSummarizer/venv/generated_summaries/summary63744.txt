The ranges of skin color and hair type among black folk are from deep, rich blue-black to can't-tell-you-from-a-white-person; and hair can be short and coarse/nappy to coarse and long to straight and long and all in between. Important enough to know they have special gifts and talents. -- Kudos to the Department of Education for a new study documenting that black students, especially boys, receive much harsher discipline than other students in public schools. Children in trouble need caring and confidence-building now -- right now. I remembered how profoundly the messages we get as children shape our world as adults.
