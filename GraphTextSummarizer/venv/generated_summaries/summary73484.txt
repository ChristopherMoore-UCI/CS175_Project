San Diego County is a red county that is turning purple as the number of Democrats grows, thanks to changing demographics.

Opinion: No room for lecherous mayors The 70-year-old is no longer just a weirdo with what he admits is a problem (he recently underwent what we are assured was intensive behavioral therapy). Since the beginning of this soap opera by the sea, the loudest voices clamoring for Filner to leave have belonged to his fellow Democrats.
