There was a beautiful Chinese-built theater; also the main public library, at one time the biggest in Somalia," recalls Jama Muse Jama, who six years ago founded the Hargeisa Book Fair. The period also brought on new forms of Somali literature, alongside poetry. Saleh points out that new books are again being translated into Somali. Now, with the help of writing and photography workshops held at the book fair, a new generation of young Somali writers will hopefully pick up the tradition. "It was one of the best things that happened in Somali society," he says.
