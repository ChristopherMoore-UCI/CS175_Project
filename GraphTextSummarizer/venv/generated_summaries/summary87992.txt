The deciding third set was a real battle, as the pair shared five breaks -- the last fell to Sharapova who broke Kerber in the 12th and deciding game. Meanwhile at the WTA event in Stuttgart, defending champion Maria Sharapova booked at place in Sunday's final after beating Germany's Angelique Kerber in three sets 6-3 2-6 7-5. But Nadal fought back in typically ferocious fashion to take the first set and then overrun Raonic in the second to reach his seventh consecutive final since returning to the ATPTour in February following a knee injury. I won this tournament last year on the way to the French Open so I am really pleased to get back into the final again," Sharapova said. I won the third game, which was very important for the match, because if you are 3-love down against a big server like Milos, you're in big trouble.
