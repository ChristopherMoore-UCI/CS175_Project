Euromillions, which said the ticket was bought in the Stevenage and Hitchin area, has made repeated appeals to try to find the missing ticket-holder. -- Six months ago, a winning ticket was bought for the Euromillions lottery draw in or near the English town of Stevenage, north of London. The search for the unknown winner has gripped the centuries-old town of 84,000, as well as the smaller neighboring town of Hitchin. A billboard campaign has even been run in a central square in Hitchin, an old market town. A Euromillions press statement attempts to jog the memory of the ticket holder, who it suggests may have come from the area or stopped off while driving through.
