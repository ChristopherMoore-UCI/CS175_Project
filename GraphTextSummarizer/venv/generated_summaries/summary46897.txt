Broadcaster Fox, which had paid an inordinate sum to secure World Cup broadcast rights, must be angry with that possibility too, as it coincided with one of the biggest advertising paydays in world sport: the Super Bowl. Germany who won last World Cup, took a six week winter break December to January. Discounting the fact that "winter" is a relative term (there have already been six World Cup finals hosted during winter months in the southern hemisphere,) the reaction has been almost universally negative; a sign not just of Qatar's perceived ability to change the rules of the game, but also of FIFA's mendacity. Tuesday saw a commission set up by FIFA, world soccer's governing body, recommend what was already the worst held secret in sport: that the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar should be moved from the oppressive heat in the summer to the cooler winter months. At least that's the impression you get from the reaction to a possible winter World Cup.
