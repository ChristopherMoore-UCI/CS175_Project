See map showing takeoff site, crash site Â» The site of Wednesday's discovery also is about a quarter-mile from where a hiker reported finding two aviation identification cards with Fossett's name and $1,000 in cash in late September, Anderson said. Searchers found the bones, Fossett's driver's license, a pair of shoes and a $100 bill on Wednesday, Anderson said last week. -- Bones found last week near where Steve Fossett's plane crashed in eastern California's Sierra Nevadas are those of the adventurer, authorities said Monday. The discovery site was a little more than a half-mile from where Fossett's plane wreckage was found on October 1 in a remote area of the Sierra Nevadas at an altitude of 10,000 feet.
