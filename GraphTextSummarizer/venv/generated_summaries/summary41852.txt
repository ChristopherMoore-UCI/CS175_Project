As the boys grew up in Wetumpka, Estes said, Collar stopped playing baseball to focus more on his dominant sport, wrestling. One of Collar's oldest friends was Chris Estes, 18. "Gil loved to hang out with friends, he loved having a good time and made the best out of every situation, always keeping his head up," said Estes, who stayed behind to attend nearby Auburn University at Montgomery. Collar's mother said he was a two-time state qualifier in wrestling, and Estes said he could have wrestled at the collegiate level if he chose. When he left the station to investigate, the school said, "he was confronted by a muscular, nude man who was acting erratically." Minnesota: police officer facing charges for hitting man in detox
