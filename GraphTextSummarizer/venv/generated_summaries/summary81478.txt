According to its website, DataSift promises customers will be able to "unlock trends from public tweets" and "access the full Twitter firehose. Starting next month, DataSift will launch a cloud-based service that will allow other companies to analyze these two-plus years of tweets to learn more about their customers. For years now, companies have been combing through Twitter postings, trying to glean any information that may help them improve their products and services. One of Twitter's new customers, DataSift, has formed an alliance with the social network to get access to tweets going back to January 2010. Twitter, however, has decided to make it easier for these companies to mine billions of messages for valuable marketing data.
