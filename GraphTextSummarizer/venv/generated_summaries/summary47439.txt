Snell said the threats targeted group members who were quoted in a CNN article in January entitled "After ISIS Twitter threat, military families rethink online lives." The hacking is the latest volley in an ongoing cyberbattle that pits ISIS and its sympathizers against hacking groups such as Anonymous, which on Tuesday claimed responsibility for cyberassaults against nearly 800 Twitter accounts, 12 Facebook pages and more than 50 email addresses linked to ISIS. Military family activist Liz Snell never thought it would happen to her group: Apparent ISIS sympathizers hacked her group's Twitter account and posted threats against a half dozen or so members. The threats came just a month after Snell told CNN she wouldn't allow the ISIS-related hack of the U.S. military's Central Command Twitter account to deter her fight to help military spouses in distress.
