"One of the things that's happening is that some of these individuals that have previously been either deported or ordered deported and are looking for refuge in Canada, have entered Canada illegally, are now looking to come back into the U.S. and possibly take advantage of the temporary protected status that our government has given," said David Aguilar, acting deputy commissioner at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have arrested 140 Haitian men and women who have crossed the border from Canada into Vermont since late January. Many had gone to Canada well before the earthquake to seek asylum, and thought they could take advantage of a relaxed U.S. policy on deporting Haitians. That message was likely lost in translation,  said David Watts, a court-appointed attorney for three Haitians charged with illegal entry and jailed. Seguin was living in the Haitian community in Montreal after going to Canada in 2008 to seek asylum.
