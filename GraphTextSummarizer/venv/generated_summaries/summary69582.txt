Abhisit spent much of Monday morning holed up in a safe house in a military compound, which was surrounded by protesters. The rejection came after another largely peaceful day of demonstration during which thousands of red-shirted protesters called for a blood bath of sorts -- organizing a blood drive and threatening to spatter hundreds of liters of donated blood over government buildings and the prime minister's residence. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva rejected protesters' demands Monday that he call an early election and dissolve parliament, saying on national television that he would listen to the protesters but would not be forced to accede to their demands. If Abhisit still refuses to dissolve parliament, the demonstrators said, they will collect another 1,000 liters of blood the next day and splash it on the headquarters of the ruling party.
