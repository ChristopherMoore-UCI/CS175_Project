Strawberries and cream One of the traditional symbols of the championships of which a staggering 28,000 kg are consumed during Wimbledon fortnight, served with over 7,000 liters of fresh cream. From the royal connection to the unusual adornment on top of the men's singles trophy; to the crowd's obsession with strawberries and cream and little-known original use for the All England grounds, each combine to make Wimbledon so special. Wimbledon is the oldest grand slam in tennis, dating back to 1877, and it boasts a rich and varied history. It's a highly skilled game but once tennis was introduced to Wimbledon in 1877 interest in croquet receded. The Royal Box The future King George VI was also a regular in the special area on Centre Court which has been reserved for the British Royal Family and guests of Wimbledon since 1922.
