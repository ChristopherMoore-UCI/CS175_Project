Paul Ryan is second with 12%, and there is a cadre of politicians -- including Sen. Rand Paul, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- with support in the single digits.

Would Hillary Clinton top Chris Christie in New Jersey? Hillary Clinton is heading to Iowa as the politician that most Democrats would choose as their 2016 presidential nominee.
