Life in detention Ranjini and her sons are being held in a "lower security" section of Villawood Detention Center in Sydney with other families who are waiting for their claims to be processed. Three more moves followed, to detention centers in Perth, Adelaide and then Brisbane where they were released to community detention in April 2011. On Ranjini's due date, January 6, pregnant mothers with children showed up at closed prisons in Australia and held up signs reading "born free. Baby Paari was born on Tuesday to Ranjini, a 33-year-old mother of two other boys aged six and nine, who was granted refugee status by Australia in 2011 after fleeing violence in Sri Lanka. Such detention, effectively condemning refugees who have not been charged with any crime to detention for the term of their natural life, runs counter to the basic principles of justice underpinning Australian society."
