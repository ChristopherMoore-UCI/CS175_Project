It was then that that a request by Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, for an inventory of holdings sparked alarm among Detroit residents and museum administrators that the DIA's collection could be sold to help pay off the city's debt. "It is my opinion, therefore, that the art collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts is held by the City of Detroit in charitable trust for the people of Michigan, and no piece in the collection may thus be sold, conveyed, or transferred to satisfy city debts or obligations," Schuette told CNN in a written statement. Then, in June, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette issued an opinion stating that Detroit can't sell the DIA's art, although the city technically owns the collection. " However, Detroit's creditors say promises were made and debts must be paid. " "All of the city's creditors have asked about the DIA and whether it has been valued -- it has not -- and some creditors have said everything that isn't nailed down should be sold to pay them," Nowling wrote in an e-mail to CNN.
