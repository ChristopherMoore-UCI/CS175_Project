-- Cuban-state media on Sunday published photos of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro meeting with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Havana. Castro wasn't at the ceremony, which was officiated by his brother, Cuban President Raul Castro. In the letter titled "I Lived to Fight," Castro mentions the recent scandal involving Cuban weapons discovered hidden on a North Korean freighter trying to cross the Panama Canal. "Trying to make our head of state and government appear as if they were tricking the United Nations and other heads of state and were guilty of being two-faced." After Panamanian authorities seized the North Korean ship, Cuba admitted to sending MiG fighter jets, missiles and anti-aircraft systems aboard the ship, which also carried 10,000 tons of Cuban sugar. According to the official Cuban government site Cubadebate, Maduro gave Castro a painting by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who died in March of cancer, and Castro gave Maduro a letter for the heads of state who had attended the anniversary of the revolution.
