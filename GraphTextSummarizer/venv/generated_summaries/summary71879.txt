French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said the declaration of independence in northern Mali was meaningless if it was not recognized by African states. France will help the future government find a political solution to the problems in northern Mali, where the Tuareg rebels have gained control, it said. The announcement of a promised return to civilian rule came shortly after separatist rebels, who had captured large areas of Mali's vast Sahara region in the north of the country, declared independence for a region they call Azawad. -- France on Saturday welcomed an agreement between military coup leaders in Mali and a regional bloc that would return the country to democratic rule, two weeks after a coup plunged it into turmoil. Mali state television announced late Friday that the leader of Mali's coup, Captain Amadou Sanogo, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had signed up to the plan.
