Now some of those memorable performances have been compiled into a 13-track live album called "Jack Johnson and Friends -- Best of Kokua Festival." "It's nice to know that we are all coming together to raise money for the kids in Hawaii, for the schools, for these environmental programs," says Johnson. The sparkling blue waters of Hawaii run through Jack Johnson's veins like lifeblood. He's been joined onstage by an impressive list of famous friends, from Eddie Vedder, Dave Matthews and Ben Harper to Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne and Ziggy and Damian Marley. "Lately, I've been motivated to take my kids surfing, and just do their homework with them and things like that," Johnson told CNN.
