They may not have set any records -- yet -- but other London Olympians deserve a mention, including Manteo Mitchell, the American 4x400m relay runner who inexplicably finished his team's heat despite running on a broken leg. Grenada went straight to the top of the podium with its first Olympic medal courtesy of Kirani James,19, who won the men's 400m, making Grenada the country with the smallest population to ever win Olympic gold. Double-amputee Oscar Pistorius made plenty of headlines, but his presence at the Games to compete against able-bodied athletes was a notable first for London. Qatar, Brunei Darussalam and Saudi Arabia allowed women to compete on their teams for the first time ever, making London the first Olympics represented by both women and men from all 205 participating nations. Step forward Tajikistan (boxing), Hong Kong (cycling), Puerto Rico (hurdles), Morocco (1500m), Saudi Arabia (equestrian), Afghanistan (taekwondo) and Kuwait (shooting) and a first medal ever for Bahrain, a bronze for Maryam Yusuf Jamal in the 1500m. Of course, many countries went home with nothing beyond the experience.
