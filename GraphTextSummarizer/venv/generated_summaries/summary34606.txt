This summer, Malala visited Nigeria and appealed to Boko Haram militants in Nigeria to lay down their weapons and "stop misusing the name of Islam. An outspoken supporter of a girl's right to an education in Pakistan, Malala was despised by Taliban militants who opposed her assertive initiative because they didn't want girls to go to school. " Boko Haram, the name of which roughly translates as "Western education is a sin" in the local Hausa language, is trying to impose Sharia law across Nigeria and especially opposes the education of women. She made the trip in support of an estimated 276 girls kidnapped in April by Boko Haram from their school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Despite Taliban threats and pronouncements, she kept going to school and speaking out for education, and she wrote an anonymous blog for the BBC about her harrowing experiences.
