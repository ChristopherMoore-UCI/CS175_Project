-- "The fastest man in rugby" could soon be showing his sprinting skills in the NFL after the Detroit Lions signed United States sevens international Carlin Isles. "If you want to develop one of those guys you have to give some guys a chance here or there and this was an opportunity to be able to do that because of the way our roster is and bringing some of the guys up that we have, we have a spot open," Lions coach Jim Schwartz told the NFL's team website. Indianapolis Colts gave former rugby union player Daniel Adongo two games earlier this year, while Lawrence Okoye, a discus thrower at the 2012 Olympics, is on the books of the San Francisco 49ers. "Rugby is quite similar to American football," Isles told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show last month. "He's a legit track guy," said Schwartz of Isles.
