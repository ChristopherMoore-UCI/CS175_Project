By extracting DNA from ancient human bones, we can reconstruct the human genome at different times in the past and look for differences that might be related to adaptations, risk factors, or inherited diseases. As a molecular archaeologist, I research the origins and evolution of human disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient peoples. This allows us to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease, right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens, and it can teach us about how pathogens evolve and why they continue to make us sick. Coprolites, or fossilized human feces, which can be found in dry caves, can provide detailed information about diet and intestinal disease. To better understand these diseases, we need to move past studies of the human genome alone toward a more holistic approach that takes into account human health in the past.
