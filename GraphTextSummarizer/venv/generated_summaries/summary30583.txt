The servers to GeneSimmons.com, the website belonging to the KISS band member, are based in Los Angeles, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Kevin George Poe, of Manchester, Connecticut, made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Hartford on Tuesday, and a judge ordered him released in lieu of a $10,000 bond, federal prosecutors said. He was ordered to appear in federal court in Los Angeles at an undetermined date, prosecutors said. If convicted of both charges, Poe could face up to 15 years in federal prison, prosecutors said. Poe is charged with two counts: conspiracy and unauthorized impairment of a protected computer, prosecutors said.
