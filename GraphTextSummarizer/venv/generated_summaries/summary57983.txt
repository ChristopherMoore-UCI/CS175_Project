However, monitoring data shows more than 4% of public water systems have detected perchlorate and between 5 and 17 million people may be served drinking water containing it, the EPA said. It comes after EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson ordered agency scientists to review "the emerging science of perchlorate. "Today's action delivers on the promise to strengthen public health protection from contaminants in drinking water," according to the EPA. Some states have already established limits on perchlorate in drinking water, but there has been no national standard. The strategy included addressing contaminants as a group so that their presence in drinking water could be addressed "cost-effectively."
