As America's European allies gather to discuss how to respond to the latest news of U.S. spying, it is clear the time has come for Washington to take much more meaningful action to address the allegations. The continuing drip of revelations from Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who fled the United States with a trove of secret information about America's intelligence practices, has become more than an irritant and distraction. The latest reports allege that U.S. spying reached into the activities of America's allies, including German Chancellor Angela. When news is made public that the United States has been listening in, recording, saving information without authorization, governments are under pressure to respond. First, though, it's worth noting that the United States is not the first or the only country to engage in massive spying.
