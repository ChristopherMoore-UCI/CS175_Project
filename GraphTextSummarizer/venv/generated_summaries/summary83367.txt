Demonstrators chanting anti-government slogans marched in Damascus, Homs, Lattakia and other cities, and were frequently met by security forces who fired into the crowds and beat protesters, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In another Damascus neighborhood, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters who were chanting anti-government slogans. The group said it had also received reports of troops near mosques in several towns. Syria has been wracked by violent government crackdowns on protests across the country since mid-March, when teens were arrested for writing anti-government graffiti in the southern city of Daraa. The agency said some neighborhoods around Damascus, Hama, Homs and Idleb "saw gatherings" after Friday prayers but did not elaborate.
