Celina's body was found around 10:30 a.m. Monday by divers from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department near a hydroelectric plant outside West Stewartstown, New Hampshire, according to the attorney general's office. "We have brought Celina home, not the way we wanted to bring her home," New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said. -- The medical examiner's office in Concord, New Hampshire, will conduct an autopsy Tuesday on the body of Celina Cass to determine how the 11-year-old girl died. Celina's body was found by divers searching the Connecticut River on Monday -- one week after she was last seen. She described investigators' focus Monday around Celina's home as "routine," after being asked about yellow crime tape there and the removal of a vehicle.
