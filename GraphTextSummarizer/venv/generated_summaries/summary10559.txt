Watch Shazia handle stares from men Â» "When I used to go to school there used to be benches for boys on one side and girls on the other; my teacher always made me sit with the girls." Like other eunuchs in Pakistan, she has lived in colonies. Shazia belongs to Pakistan's community of eunuchs. Shazia has formed an action group and is campaigning for eunuchs like her to get proper recognition. I feel very strange that Allah could have made me a boy, or he could have made me a girl, but this way, neither boy nor girl.
