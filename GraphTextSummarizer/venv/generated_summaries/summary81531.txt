The Central Park escapee comes on the heels of a peahen -- the female counterpart to a peacock -- fleeing the Bronx Zoo in May and an even more infamous cobra, who disappeared from its Bronx Zoo pen for five days in March. The male peacock "wandered" away from the Manhattan Zoo on Tuesday, said Wildlife Conservation Society spokeswoman Mary Dixon in a statement. The adventurous bird made its way to a Fifth Avenue apartment building near the park and perched on a third-floor window sill. Zoo officials are encouraging onlookers to avoid following or harassing the peacock and say the runaway poses no danger to the public. Zoo officials did not comment on how the bird escaped or what type of enclosure he was in.
