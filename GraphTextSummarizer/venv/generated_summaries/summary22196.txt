"He had a rare ability to exude a sense of warmth, a transcendent light," said Robert Goodwin, who wrote the book "Points of Light: A Celebration of the American Spirit of Giving," with Kinkade. Art from the self-described "painter of light," adorns many living rooms in America. Kinkade, 54, also suffered from hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease, said the autopsy report released Monday.
