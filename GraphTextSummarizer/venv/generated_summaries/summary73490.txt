-- As Western powers try to verify claims that the Syrian government used chemical weapons this week in a northeastern suburb of Damascus, the Syrian government is accusing rebel forces of doing the same. "If, in fact, this was a deliberate use and attack by the Syrian government on its own people using chemical weapons, there may be another attack coming," Hagel said. The Syrian government has steadfastly denied its forces used chemical weapons outside Damascus or elsewhere. "It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area," Syrian TV reporting, citing anonymous source. Hagel predicted other nations would lend their support if the investigation finds that the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its people.
