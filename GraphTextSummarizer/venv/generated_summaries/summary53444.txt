Thank you for your prayers, well wishes and support through this entire ordeal," Kasem's daughter, Kerri Kasem, posted on her Facebook page soon after the order. Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed that earlier conservatorship petition, claiming the retired radio host "has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family" by his wife. The petition last year claimed that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, had been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. The judge ruled last year that Kasem was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem. Last year, Kerri Kasem said that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him.
