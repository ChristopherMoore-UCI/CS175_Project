Democrats claim these measures will discourage young and nonwhite voters from voting, who tend to vote more often for Democrats. Consider too the remarks of people like Alabama congressman Mo Brooks, who declared recently that President Obama and the Democrats are prosecuting a "war on whites." But prior to stances on issues, what voters of color and young voters pick up on is a vibe -- an overall sense of whether we are welcome. This is the moment for a rising Republican to deliver precisely that message to people of color and young voters: Participate. GOP legislators insist they're only worried about voter fraud and the integrity of the electoral system.
