The Obama administration took Alabama to court over the law, arguing that the legislation and a similar act in Georgia law encroached on federal authority. The judges blocked parts of the Alabama law in August, including language that makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work or solicit work; imposed criminal penalties to hide "an alien" or rent property to anyone in the United States illegally; and required state officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools. "As the governor of Alabama, I have a duty to uphold and defend Alabama law. The judges let stand one of the most controversial portions of the law, allowing local and state police check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. Federal courts should not restrain state governments in a way that is contrary to the U.S. Constitution."
