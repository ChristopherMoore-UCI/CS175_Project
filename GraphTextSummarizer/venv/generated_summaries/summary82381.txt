King was "in a state of drug and alcohol-induced delirium" and "either fell or jumped into the swimming pool," said the autopsy report released by the San Bernardino County coroner Thursday. King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead in the swimming pool at his Rialto, California, home on June 17, authorities and his fiancee said. " King's brother, Zhan Paul King, told investigators that King has "been doing very well and was happy" as he traveled to promote a book for the 20th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots. Kelly, who was a juror in King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in 1994, told police that King was an "avid swimmer" but that she was not, De Anda said. Nearly a year after the rioting in Los Angeles, four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges.
