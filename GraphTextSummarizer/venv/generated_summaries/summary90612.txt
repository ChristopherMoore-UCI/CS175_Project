Toro Rosso serve as a feeder team to Red Bull, which placed second in the manufacturers' standings behind Brawn last season with Sebastien Vettel second in the drivers' championship and Mark Webber fourth. Alguersuari replaced Frenchman Sebastien Bourdais at the Hungarian Grand Prix in July, becoming the youngest F1 driver in championship history, but finished only three of his eight races at the wheel. The 19-year-old Spaniard will line up alongside Sebastian Buemi, 21, as the Red Bull-owned outfit retain the two men who ended last season in their colors. -- Formula One team Toro Rosso have announced that teenage driver Jaime Alguersuari will be given another chance to impress with a contract for the 2010 season. Jaime's appointment also confirms our commitment to bringing on graduates of the Red Bull Junior Team young driver program."
