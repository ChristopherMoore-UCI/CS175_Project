According to Mac, men are like dogs because, among other things, they have short attention spans and pay a lot of attention to their own crotches and the crotches of others. " The bad All men are obsessed with cars, the remote, sports, and video games. For the record, my man keeps his video game playtime short, hands remote control power over to me, and doesn't care for sports or cars. I'm willing to bet short attention span isn't an inherently male trait, and I can personally testify that neither is an interest in crotches. This is my favorite piece of advice from Mac, who says the mistaken conclusion women come to when they call first post-date and get blown off is that the call made them look clingy and spooked the guy.
