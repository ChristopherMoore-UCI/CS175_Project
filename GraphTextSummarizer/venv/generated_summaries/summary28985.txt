Crimea borders southeastern Ukraine, where much of the current unrest is focused and into which Russian troops allegedly have moved. Pro-Russian rebels claim control of parts of that region, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. Russian officials frequently deny claims that the military has moved into disputed parts of the Ukraine, and this time is no exception.
