Tom Lorenz of the Glendale police department told CNN affiliate KTLA that the fire moved rapidly over ridge lines. "Fire nearly knocked down," the city said on its Twitter feed late Friday afternoon. -- While firefighters waged war on a large wildfire in another part of the the Los Angeles metropolitan area, crews in the northern suburb of Glendale corralled a 75-acre brush fire that prompted evacuations. Crews from several jurisdictions assisted Glendale, bringing the total number of personnel to about 200. One school was evacuated Friday afternoon.
