Ivanovic and world number three Djokovic -- whose singles win over Benelmans on Thursday secured Serbia's final berth -- will be replaced in the weekend's title-clash by Belgium who finished in second place in group A. Henin and Bemelmans will now face the United States team of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and John Isner in the final, after Mattek-Sands's straight sets defeat of British teenager Laura Robson on Friday was enough for the American's to secure their place at the top of group B. The injury is an early-season blow for Ivanovic, who recently made a comeback to the WTA tour following a string of fitness problems. Saturday's other last-four clash will see American second seed and world number eight Andy Roddick take on Kevin Anderson of South Africa, after the pair had respective quarterfinal wins over Marcos Baghdatis and Santiago Giraldo on Thursday. The 26-year-old brushed aside Aussie qualifier Matthew Ebden in straight sets and will now face Czech Radek Stepanek in the semifinal, after the former world number eight and two-time finalist of the Brisbane event put out seventh seed Florian Mayer 6-3 6-3. Williams, beaten by Vera Zvonareva on Thursday, went down in straight sets to Li Na of China, 6-3 7-6. In the women's singles draw Germany's Andrea Petkovic caused an upset by knocking out the tournament's fourth seed, Marion Bartoli of France in straight sets.
