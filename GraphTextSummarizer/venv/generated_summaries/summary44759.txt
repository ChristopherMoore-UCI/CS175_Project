HealthOne, the health care system that includes the Medical Center of Aurora and Swedish Medical Center, pledged to "eliminate personal financial responsibility for hospital charges as appropriate. Five more shooting victims are being cared for at Aurora Medical Center, and two are in fair condition at Swedish Medical Center in Denver, the hospital said. Some of his victims, both in and out of hospitals, faced a difficult recovery process and the prospect of daunting medical bills. Children's Hospital Colorado said in a statement it will use its charity program and donations to cover medical expenses for victims who don't have insurance, as well as waive co-pays and deductible-related expenses for those with insurance. "The surgeon came and talked to us and said he'd be in ICU at least a week," said Medley's friend, Michael West, who set up a website to help take care of medical bills and the needs of Medley's family.
