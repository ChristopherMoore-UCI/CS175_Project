-- Pirates off the eastern coast of Somalia picked the wrong target this week when they tried to attack a U.S. Navy ship, the Navy said Thursday. The attempted attack happened Wednesday against the USNS Lewis and Clark, a dry cargo and ammunition ship that supports the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet and coalition ships in the area, the Navy said. "The actions taken by Lewis and Clark were exactly what the U.S. Navy has been recommending to prevent piracy attacks -- for both commercial and military vessels," said Capt. Evasive maneuvers and other defense measures such as on-board security teams have worked to protect other ships and their cargo, the Navy said. Two pirate skiffs pursued the Lewis and Clark for more than an hour as it headed north, the Navy said.
