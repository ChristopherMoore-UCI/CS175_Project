Stephen Odell -- chief executive officer of the U.S. automaker's European division -- told CNN the debate over a UK referendum on EU membership is not an "inhibitor" to Ford's investment strategy in the short term. This week Ford is launching its new Tourneo Courier at the Geneva Motor Show, with the people carrier set to hit UK showrooms next spring. Ford's Europe boss says the car giant is sticking with the UK despite the slumping currency and friction with European partners. Odell says Ford is already beginning to see encouraging signs in sales in the European car industry. Odell also said the weak pound would not deter Ford's operation in the UK.
