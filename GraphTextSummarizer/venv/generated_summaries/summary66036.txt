Elsewhere, fillings in the five burgers at La Maison MÃ¨re's (French site only; 4 Rue de Navarin; +33 01 42 81 11 00) cost up to about $27 and include breaded cod and Black Angus steak (the "Black Label"). Moreover, three-quarters of traditional French restaurants now list "le burger" on their menus; in many cases burgers outsell more traditional meals such as steak frites. Burgers now make up just more than 45% of all sandwiches sold in France, according to research from the French consulting firm Gira Conseil cited by the Telegraph. In 2012, French fast food sales accounted for 54% of the restaurant market, outstripping traditional sit-down restaurant meals for the first time. The news isn't all bad news for French cuisine.
