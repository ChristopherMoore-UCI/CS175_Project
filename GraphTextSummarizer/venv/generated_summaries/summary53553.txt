And in this typically exquisite, nuanced, memory-infused work from master British filmmaker Terence Davies ("The House of Mirth"), we believe every minute of the torment of Hester (Rachel Weisz), a cultivated woman who's married (passionlessly) to a solicitous magistrate named Sir William (Simon Russell Beale) but is helplessly in thrall to Freddie (Tom Hiddleston from "War Horse" and "Thor"), a younger, drink-prone chap who will never love her the way she does him. In interviews, Davies has given aesthetic shout-outs to both the movies of Doris Day and the quintessentially British thwarted-passion drama from 1945, "Brief Encounter."

Davies adapted "The Deep Blue Sea" from the 1952 play of the same name by Terence Rattigan as part of the centenary celebration of the late British playwright. And fans of Davies since his early, autobiographical films "Distant Voices," "Still Lives," and "The Long Day Closes" will appreciate the inclusion of one of his favorite time-capsule gestures: a warm pub scene in which every patron, young and old, joins in singing popular tunes.
