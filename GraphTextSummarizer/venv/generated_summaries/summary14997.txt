"It was chaos," said witness Carol Winn, who said she was headed to Albany on I-90 "when all of a sudden there was this big traffic jam in front of me." "A large contingent of state police and East Greenbush PD responded to the area," the statement said. A law enforcement officer approaches the gunman Saturday along Interstate 90 in New York.
