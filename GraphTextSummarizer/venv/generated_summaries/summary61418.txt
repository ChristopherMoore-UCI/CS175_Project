One day, U.S. and Iranian president might shake hands A new sense of optimism Without doubt, the long years of hostility between Iran and the United States leave many Iranians wary and distrustful of Western countries. To many Iranians, Rouhani seems to be really advancing the "hope and prudence" slogan he used during his successful campaign to become president in June, posturing as a centrist and reformer against hardline conservatives that characterized previous president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At the open microphone, several speakers didn't need prompting to broach perhaps the biggest subject on the international community's mind -- whether Iran is building nuclear weapons. But several Western countries want Iran to fully comply with a United Nations agency's inspectors looking into whether the nuclear development is to build a bomb. And Iran is willing to discuss its nuclear program, President Hassan Rouhani says.
