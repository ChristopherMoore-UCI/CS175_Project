-- The Obama administration's breach of religious freedom and freedom of conscience through the Health and Human Services agency's contraception mandate has reignited the national conversation about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare." Obamacare encapsulates many of the major conservative objections to President Barack Obama's presidency: the vast and costly expansion of government, increased taxes and regulations and the infringement of personal and religious liberties as is now being litigated in the federal and Supreme Courts. Furthermore, Obamacare will dramatically increase the cost of government health care and welfare programs while growing the national debt. We won't know the full extent of the secretary's power until Obamacare is enforced, but if the contraception mandate is any indication, the secretary could have the power to regulate what health care Americans receive, what doctors they see and what insurance coverage they are eligible for. In 2013, Obamacare will unleash an avalanche of taxes on individuals, businesses and insurers. Regardless of what the Supreme Court rules in the spring, Obamacare is indelibly symbolic of President Obama's record.
