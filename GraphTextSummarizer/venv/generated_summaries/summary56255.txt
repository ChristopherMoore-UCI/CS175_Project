His attorneys have consistently fought court rulings that Loughner continue his treatment at the Missouri hospital. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Larry Burns decided to extend that treatment until at least June 7, Ninth Circuit court spokesman David Madden said. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Cabanillas said then that Loughner "could revert to being a danger to himself" if the medication were halted. In July, bizarre and suicidal actions by Loughner while in custody pushed a federal appeals panel to allow authorities to force the defendant to take anti-psychotic medication. The medical treatment plan for Jared Loughner -- aimed at improving his mental state, so he would be competent to stand trial -- was set to expire on Wednesday.
