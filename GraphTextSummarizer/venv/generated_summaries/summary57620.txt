Hull City beat West Ham United 1-0 while Cardiff City beat Fulham 2-1 at Craven Cottage. Liverpool will move up to second if they can beat bottom side Sunderland by more than two goals on Sunday. Eight minutes later Chelsea scored again but this time the goal stood as John Terry flicked a Juan Mata free-kick past Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal. Last weekend, it was Manchester City fans who were cheering following a thumping 4-1 win over neighbors United. At the start of the second half, Mourinho brought on Spanish midfielder Juan Mata for John Obi Mikel and Chelsea's fortunes soon started to improve.
