On Monday, the U.S. government said it had eased the requirements for orphaned children from Haiti to enter the United States on a temporary basis. In a separate statement, the State Department said Monday it is working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Haitian government to process nearly 300 cases of Americans who are waiting to adopt Haitian children. The airport handled 180 flights Monday, none of which were delayed, Lt. Gen. P. K. Keen told CNN. "We will continue to grant, in special cases, humanitarian parole for orphans and medical evacuees, but our position is clear that people from Haiti attempting to enter the country illegally will be repatriated. At least 24 of those children have left Haiti and have joined their adoptive families since the embassy expedited processing for immigrant visas, said Michele Bond, deputy assistant secretary for American citizen services.
