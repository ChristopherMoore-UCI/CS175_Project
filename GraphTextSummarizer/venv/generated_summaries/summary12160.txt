Rupert Hamer, defense correspondent for the Sunday Mirror newspaper, and photographer Philip Coburn were embedded with the U.S. Marine Corps and were accompanying a patrol near Nawa in southern Afghanistan when the explosion occurred Saturday, the ministry said in a statement. "Rupert believed that the only place to report a war was from the front line, and as our defense correspondent he wanted to be embedded with the U.S. Marines at the start of their vital surge into southern Afghanistan," Sunday Mirror Editor Tina Weaver said in the statement. "Both Rupert Hamer and Phil Coburn accompanied me on my most recent trip to Afghanistan," said British Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth in the statement. The Mirror said in a statement that Hamer, 39, and Coburn, 43, had flown to Afghanistan on December 31 for a trip that was to have lasted a month. According to his Mirror blog page, Hamer had covered the British armed forces since 2004 in the Middle East, central Asia, Oman, Bahrain, Iraq and Afghanistan.
