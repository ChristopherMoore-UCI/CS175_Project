Marching band director Jonathan Waters was fired Thursday after the report's release, Ohio State University President Michael Drake said. New band members also took part in "rookie introductions," where they stood at the front of a bus en route to games and answered sexual questions or told dirty jokes before walking to the back of the bus "while other students attempted to remove articles of clothing," the report said. The report described traditions such as the "midnight ramp," in which band members entered the stadium through a ramp wearing only their underwear. After being told that sexual nicknames were not appropriate, investigators asked Waters why he tolerated the practice. Waters' lawyer, David Axelrod, said his client was named acting director in February 2013 but that the objectionable acts laid out in the report started many years before.
