In the Dominican Republic, a ban on abortion is preventing a teenage girl from receiving treatment for a life-threatening disease. Opinion leaders like former representative Victor Terrero say clandestine abortions are also putting the lives of many women at risk. " Bautista Rojas Gomez, the Dominican minister of health, has publicly indicated he favors chemotherapy over protecting the pregnancy, but doctors are still reluctant to act for fear of prosecution. Lilliam Fondeur, a women's rights activist, complains that conservative politics is preventing necessary treatment to save the teenager's life. Turkish women rally against plans to restrict access to abortion Miguel Montalvo, the director of the bioethics council that rules on the application of the law, says the council is leaning toward allowing the treatment.
