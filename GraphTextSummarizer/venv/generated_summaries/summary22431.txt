"We hope that today's guilty plea provides further assurance to the victim's family and to the community that the Department of Justice will leave no stone unturned to find those responsible for these senseless racially motivated attacks," said Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez. Joseph Dominick, 21, from Brandon, entered a guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Jackson, Mississippi, to one count of conspiracy to commit federal hate crimes. "Our investigation is ongoing, and we will continue to pursue those who participated in this violent conspiracy, which culminated in the tragic death of James Craig Anderson." Four of the men who were there that night pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes in 2012. A Mississippi man pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal hate crime charge in connection with a group of young men and teenagers who carried out racial attacks against African-Americans in 2011. A fifth man, Jonathan Kyle Gaskamp, 20, pleaded guilty in December to hate crimes related to other incidents.
