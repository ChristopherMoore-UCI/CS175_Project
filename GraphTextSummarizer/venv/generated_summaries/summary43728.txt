The pair met in Las Vegas in 2006, when Murray treated one of Jackson's children at the recommendation of one of Jackson's bodyguards. John Thomas, Murray's friend, said he spoke to the doctor three days before Jackson died to invite him to an event in Las Vegas. Webb, one of Murray's Las Vegas patients, said he helped save her life. The doctor, who was with Jackson on the day he died, has offices in Houston and Las Vegas and specializes in cardiology and internal medicine, according to state medical boards. Murray's office in Houston was searched last week, and on Tuesday, authorities searched his Las Vegas home and office.
