-- Pakistan election officials on Monday disqualified opposition party leader and former former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from participating in January parliamentary elections. Sharif filed paperwork for his candidacy last week, although he had left open the possibility that he would boycott the election in protest of a state of emergency imposed by President Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf, who quit as military leader and took office for a third term last week, has pledged to lift the state of emergency by December 16. Sharif, an outspoken critic of Musharraf, who ousted him from power in 1999, had said he wanted to keep all options open. Sharif was convicted of terrorism, hijacking and tax evasion after Musharraf seized power in 1999.
