Lomax played in several British rock groups, including The Undertakers, in the early 1960s, following and crossing the path of the Beatles performing in Liverpool and in Hamburg pubs. -- British rocker Jackie Lomax, who recorded with legendary stars but whose own career always seemed a degree removed from fame, died at the age of 69 this week. The singer-songwriter-guitarist enjoyed a 50-year career playing with many of music's biggest stars -- notably the Beatles -- but personal commercial success eluded Lomax. He was eventually signed to the Beatles' Apple Records as a songwriter and artist, with George Harrison producing and writing songs for Lomax. What more can there be?" His studio sessions never produced hits despite having three Beatles -- Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr -- recording with him.
