-- Colombian President Alvaro Uribe on Thursday demanded that his ministers of the interior and defense get to the bottom of how a jailed top rebel leader escaped in the northeastern city of Arauca, Colombia. The request comes during a period of tension between Colombia and Venezuela, in part because of Colombian claims that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has aided the rebel groups. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe wants answers after a top ELN rebel was freed from prison. Uribe, who has held a strong stance against leftist rebel groups in his country, had strong words about the incident. The security at Arauca was weak, and somehow Giraldo's rescuers knew where and when to find him, Uribe said.
