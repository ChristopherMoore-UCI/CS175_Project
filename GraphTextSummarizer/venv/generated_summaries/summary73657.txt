Summers says the state of Maryland has already allocated $20 million for other green projects and that this is the first of many projects. The road will help clean and filter toxic storm water pollution that drains into rivers, and eventually into Chesapeake Bay. " Storm water runoff often carries toxins and pollution from parking lots and city streets, and from farms and agricultural lands in rural areas. "This kind of green infrastructure project to reduce storm water and energy consumption is exactly the kind of thing we need to do around the bay watershed to reduce pollution. " Summers says the benefits of this project are twofold: a reduction in storm water pollution and, through the energy efficiency in powering lighting, a reduction in air pollution and fallout.
