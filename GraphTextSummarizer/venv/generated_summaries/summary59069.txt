Schools in New York City have decided to observe two Muslim holidays and close schools for them. I simply find it to be a problematic endorsement of religion by the secular state. I cannot support the government endorsing religion of any kind. In Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), the U.S. Supreme Court gave us a three-part test to determine whether governmental conduct violates the Establishment Clause: (1) the governmental action must have a secular purpose, (2) it must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) it may not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion. De Blasio should have used this opportunity to change direction, and state that there would be no official religious holidays â€” that selecting just the Abrahamic vein of religion as officially recognized by the state is simply improper.
