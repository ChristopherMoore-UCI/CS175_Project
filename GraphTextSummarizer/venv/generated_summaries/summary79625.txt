"People look at the hands and kind of get it instantly." Hands have become a big symbol for Ferguson protesters who allege that Wilson shot Brown even though he was unarmed and, they say, had his hands up in the air. Davis' art caught my eye instantly as I drove down West Florissant, past fast food shops, beauty stores, laundromats and convenience stores, all made ugly by the plywood. West Florissant Avenue almost looks like it did before that August day when Michael Brown was shot and killed. In the rear view mirror, West Florissant Avenue fades, just for a minute, and I see only the prints of hands on paper. Some had taken the plywood down but have put the boards back up, ahead of a grand jury decision on whether to indict police Officer Darren Wilson.
