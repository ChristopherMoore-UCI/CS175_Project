A vast warehouse has been decked-out to resemble the urban landscape, filled with a haphazard assortment of steel railings, brick walls, and giant trucks tires. "We wanted somewhere you could train without worrying about residents complaining or being kicked off by the police -- and fair enough, if you are jumping on somebody's walls, they might not like it," explained 27-year-old James Adams, who four years ago quit his job as a high court civil servant to teach parkour full-time. "It really pushes you mentally to face fear and overcome it," says Adams, who first took up parkour because he was "bored out of his brain at the gym." Despite his bulky physique, there is an elegance to the way Adams lightly leaps over wooden barriers, and it's easy to see why parkour is also increasingly being used on stage -- the group is currently working on a performance of "Alice in Wonderland". Lights, camera, action Since it emerged in France in the 1980s, parkour has been as hard to pin down as the people who practice it, used as everything from a way to keep fit, to security training, and even film stunts.
