Suu Kyi has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest. Democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has said she will not vote in the elections. Critics say the November 7 elections -- its first in two decades -- aim to create a facade of democracy. The constitution requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament, which critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip on the Southeast Asian nation. The regime recently passed a law that made Suu Kyi ineligible to run because of a court conviction.
