Rignot added that the same winds that stir subsurface heat toward the base of Antarctic ice shelf also can expand sea ice cover. However,  Rignot and Anandakrishnan said their findings on the west Antarctica ice shelf don't clash with news of the record levels of Antarctic sea ice. For example, such opponents of policies to reduce U.S. carbon emissions say the severe North American winter that just ended and evidence of increasing Antarctic sea ice defied the claims by scientists of a warming planet. NASA says the region has enough ice to raise global sea levels by 4 feet. The entire west Antarctic ice sheet has enough ice to raise the global sea level by about 16 feet, NASA said.
