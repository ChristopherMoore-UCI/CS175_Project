"This is something that's really impacting a lot of people and scientifically, it's an event that we don't see too often here in Atlanta -- especially when it's not connected to a tropical system," said Laura Griffith, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Georgia. Prolonged rains led to severe flooding in Atlanta. Responding to the rain, creeks and rivers in metro Atlanta are overflowing in some places, setting new records. Jeras said the storm that remained stuck over Atlanta on Monday previously had brought needed rain to southern Texas. The soils became saturated with water over the eight days of rain, meaning the heavy rains seen in Atlanta on Monday had nowhere to go but straight into creeks and drainage ditches, which quickly overflowed.
