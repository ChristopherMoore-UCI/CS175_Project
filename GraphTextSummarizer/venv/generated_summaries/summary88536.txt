-- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo went into hiding last week, canceling appearances and perhaps hoping that a blast of sharply negative press coverage -- triggered by a hard-hitting front-page New York Times story -- will somehow fade away. New Yorkers will have to decide if their representatives are politicians they can trust, including Mr. Cuomo." The Times published a trove of e-mails and interviews that show top Cuomo aides actively interfered with a high-level anti-corruption investigative panel -- in ways that benefited big-money donors to Cuomo -- even after Cuomo personally and repeatedly vowed the commission would be independent. Cuomo should take a page from his neighbor, Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has been far more adept at handling the more serious "Bridgegate" scandal, in which thousands of commuters were subjected to paralyzing traffic jams for days on end, for what appears to be the pettiest of political reasons. After five days of silence, Cuomo announced -- at 11 p.m. on a Sunday -- that he would take questions Monday in Buffalo, far from the New York City media capital.
