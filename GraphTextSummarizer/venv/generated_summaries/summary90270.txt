Katy Perry made our teenage dreams come true at the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday with dizzying pyrotechnics, dancing sharks and enough outfit changes to give Beyonce a run for her money. Then, Perry transitioned to a tropical landscape of dancing beach balls, palm trees and sharks for "California Girls," and everyone started wondering whether we were in a "Teenage Dream" or on a bad acid trip. Much of the credit goes to guest stars Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott, whom some deemed more worthy of the spotlight. Regardless of whether you appreciated her artistry, the show delivered throughout on memorable (and meme-worthy) moments, from Perry's entrance atop a robot tiger, dressed in a suit of flames, until her exit on a star that drew comparisons to NBC's "More You Know" logo. Overall, most seemed to delight in roasting Perry, and were generally pleased that the show delivered enough moments to make into memes and objects of mockery.
