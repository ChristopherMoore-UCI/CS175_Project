The deed on record was signed by Presley's longtime manager, Col. Tom Parker, said Parker Pickle, Desoto County tax assessor. -- It's arguably one of the largest pieces of Elvis Presley memorabilia ever: a 154.5-acre ranch in Horn Lake, Mississippi, once owned by the king of rock 'n' roll. "It had a large cross there that Elvis really liked, and a concrete bridge over a 14-acre lake," real estate agent Rodger Motz told CNN. Elvis Presley bought the property in February 1967, three months before marrying Priscilla Beaulieu. The property, called the "Elvis Ranch" by locals, is just east of Highway 301 in Horn Lake, about 17 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee.
