" Mitchell is accused of abducting Smart from the bedroom of her Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. It's unclear when they returned to Utah, but Elizabeth Smart testified that she convinced Mitchell that they should hitchhike back to Salt Lake City. Watch Smart's father talk about the hearing Â» Mitchell and Barzee are charged with six felony counts, including aggravated burglary, aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault. Mitchell was in court Thursday for a competency hearing, but Smart never saw him because U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball ordered him removed from the court when he ignored requests to stop singing and disrupting the proceedings. "I think she asked [U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman] if he could be muzzled and have to sit there and watch it." Tolman, standing alongside Smart's father after Thursday's hearing in Salt Lake City, confirmed the 21-year-old woman's request: "She did ask me whether or not [Mitchell] got to see that testimony and hear that testimony, and I indicated to her, to her relief, that he was there in a room with the audio and video and had nothing else to do but listen.
