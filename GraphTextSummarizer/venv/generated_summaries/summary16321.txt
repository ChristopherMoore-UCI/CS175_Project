"At no time was I worried he was going to hit the ground without a parachute, but given the circumstances and where we were I thought it would be better to get him under parachute earlier than later," McFarlane said. "I managed to catch him on my second attempt and deploy his parachute." Jones, who described the incident on YouTube as "possibly the scariest moment of my life," told the ABC that skydiving was a substitute for his dream of becoming a pilot. "Halfway through the skydive, he had a seizure and rolled onto his back," WA Skydiving Academy business manager and chief instructor Robin O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Jones told the ABC that he'd been seizure-free for four years but was not intending to pursue a skydiving career. Instructor Sheldon McFarlane, who was wearing a helmet camera, struggled to catch up with Jones.
