Now, Winter Olympics are a different proposition altogether as smaller cities have to contend with grand projects well beyond their normal needs. While Beijing's appears to be nothing more than a tourist attraction, London's will be home to a mix of football, athletics and already stands at the heart of a new urban park -- home to big named concerts and yes, lots of tourists. Beijing and London went in other ways -- new stadia for the opening and closing ceremonies and athletics -- with a vow to keep the spirit of the Olympics in the building's bones. London also got new train stations and better access to the east of the city. It has rightfully scared the IOC and host cities into getting it right, or face financial headaches for years to come.
