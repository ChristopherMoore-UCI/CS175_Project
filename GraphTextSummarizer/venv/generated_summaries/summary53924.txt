Even as the defense for accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev continued its quest to move the trial to another city, prosecutors indicated Thursday that a federal court is drawing close to finding enough unbiased jurors in Boston. So far, 219 people have been questioned closely about their opinions about Tsarnaev's guilt, their feelings about the death penalty and whether they or anyone they knew was directly affected by the bombing and deadly police shootout a few days later. But prosecutors countered that painstaking individual questioning of jurors is successfully identifying people who promise to keep an open mind and decide the case based on the evidence they hear in court. The defense says it is impossible to overcome the bias against Tsarnaev in Boston. Meanwhile, jury selection is continuing, with just nine more to be found before each side exercises 23 challenges, dismissing individual jurors without having to explain why.
