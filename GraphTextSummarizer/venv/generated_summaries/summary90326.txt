CA 125 is not a good test for ovarian cancer screening, and ovarian cancer may not be a good cancer for screening. We need something as effective for ovarian cancer screening as pap smears are for cervix cancer screening. Unfortunately we do not have a good screening test for ovarian cancer, the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women. Of the 100,000 women, we expect 148 will die of cancer and nine of the 148 will be die because of ovarian cancer within a year of the screen. When done as a routine test it is quite easy to see that ovarian cancer screening could actually cause the death of more women than the number of women saved.
