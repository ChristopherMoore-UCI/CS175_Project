Tensions in the metropolitan area have been heightened since May 22, when a soldier, Lee Rigby, was killed in Woolwich in southeast London. -- Police are investigating whether anti-Muslim sentiments were behind a fire early Wednesday that caused extensive damage to a Somali community center in north London. The spike in reported crimes was less than spikes that followed the 9/11 attacks in the United States and the 2005 bomb attacks on London's transport system, she added. Community leaders said they and the center had co-existed peacefully for 20 years, Chief Superintendent Adrian Usher told reporters. The English Defence League has staged protest marches in London and elsewhere.
