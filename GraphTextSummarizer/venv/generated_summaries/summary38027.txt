The lawsuit, filed by 35 California district attorneys and two city attorneys, alleges that Walgreens stores improperly disposed of items like batteries, liquid corrosive waste, aerosol cans and pharmaceutical waste in company trash bins, sending them to local landfills rather than authorized disposal sites. -- A group of county and city prosecutors in California have sued Walgreen Co., alleging that the drug store chain broke state laws when disposing of hazardous waste, medical waste and customer records. The complaint also says Walgreens improperly disposed of customer records containing confidential medical information, failing to take required steps to protect privacy. Walgreen's actions were systematic and statewide, and the company must be held accountable," Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen A. Trutanich said in a statement Monday. The county and city attorneys originally filed a lawsuit in June, asked a judge to stop the company from improperly disposing of waste and consider fining the company for allegedly violating state laws.
