-- Football club Barcelona paid 13.5 million euros ($18.5 million) in additional taxes on Monday, while denying any fiscal "irregularities" in its purchase of Brazilian superstar Neymar, which is now under investigation by a court. In his writ, Perals alleges that he's "become aware of a series of economic transactions by the club, and in favor of various companies, related to the signing of Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., based at times on simulated contracts." FC Barcelona announced the surprise payment on its website, which it called "voluntary," just four days after a judge at Spain's National Court in Madrid filed preliminary charges against the fan-owned club for alleged tax fraud in the Neymar deal. Last Thursday, Judge Pablo Ruz expanded his investigation against the club, as requested a day earlier by a prosecutor, who alleged the club avoided paying 9 million euros (more than $12 million) in taxes on Neymar's signing and transfer, corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013. Barcelona's former president, Sandro Rosell, who resigned last month after a judge agreed to investigate a lawsuit against him for alleged irregularities in the Neymar deal, has denied any wrongdoing.
