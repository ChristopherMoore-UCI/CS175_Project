Human Rights Watch says Bahraini police forces have arrested more than 430 people in recent weeks, often violently and late at night. Zainab Al-Khawaja was entering the sixth day of her hunger strike when her health deteriorated to the point that her family took her to the hospital, said Nabeel Rajab, head of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. Al-Tajer is one of several attorneys who have defended opposition figures and human rights activists arrested by the government. More than two dozen uniformed and plainclothes officers raided the home of lawyer Mohammed al-Tajer on Friday and arrested him, Human Rights Watch said. On April 9, at 3 a.m., masked officers burst into Zainab Al-Khawaja's home and assaulted her father, Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, and her husband, Mohammed Al-Masqati, according to family members and human rights activists.
