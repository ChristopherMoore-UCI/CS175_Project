Gulfstream have added a number of bells and whistles to the new jets, including lower cabin altitude, which the company say reduces fatigue on long-range flights, and the ability to use your iPhone to control cabin features including window shades, temperature, lighting and displays. Both Boeing and Airbus produce private planes with a long range and luxury options, basically modified versions of their commercial planes. Earlier this year the company flew one to Shanghai for the Asian Business Aviation Conference, a key event for meeting Chinese customers. One Airbus customer has even bought an A380 super-jumbo for private use. The appeal of the G650 -- that can carry up to 18 people -- comes down to size, speed and range.
