" Tiny cells offer hope Pancreas transplants for patients such as Schofield are not typically an option because they are difficult to perform, said Dr. Michael Rickels, associate professor of medicine at University of Pennsylvania. Islet cells contain beta cells that produce insulin, as well as alpha cells that produce a hormone called glucagon. A few days later Schofield, received his first infusion of islet cells. Islet cell transplantation cannot help those with Type 2 diabetes, Posselt said, because they already produce insulin -- their bodies just have a greater resistance to the hormone. Like most Type 1 diabetics, Schofield learned to control his diabetes with insulin injections and constant monitoring.
