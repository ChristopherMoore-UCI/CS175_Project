In 1995, the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted the ex-commander, along with 51 others, on charges of war crimes and atrocities. On Thursday, the tribunal said Mladic's defense team will have "ample opportunity" to present evidence in response to the latest allegations. In 1992, Mladic led the siege against Sarajevo, which killed thousands of people, including civilians, and lasted more than two years. A United Nations-backed International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia announced Thursday that the court will hear details about a mass grave investigators believe has ties to Ratko Mladic. The former commanding general of the Bosnian-Serb forces is accused of leading a campaign of "ethnic cleansing," widespread killing, torture, forced labor and physical, sexual and psychological violence during the Bosnian war.
