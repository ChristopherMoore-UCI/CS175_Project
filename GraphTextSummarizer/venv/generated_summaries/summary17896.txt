Bair was only discovered last July in a New York City flea market by an agent from The Society Management, who said they represented top talents like Victoria's Secret angel Adriana Lima and runway mainstay Lindsey Wixson. The unlikely itinerary sums up Bair's budding fashion career: a whirlwind trip from the mundane life of an American teenager to the rarefied heights of international style and back again -- accompanied by no small amount of adolescent bewilderment. Bair said before she started in fashion, people would often approach her at the mall to ask whether she was a model, but she never gave it serious thought, especially as she struggled with her looks as other girls matured. " In less than a year, she's walked for major-league designers like Chanel, Alexander Wang, Proenza Schouler, Prada and Giambattista Valli, as well as appeared in Vogue Italia, W Magazine and a campaign for American brand Coach. "I would never think that a girl who spent most of her childhood with a unibrow, glasses and a Yoda shirt would be in Vogue Italia," Bair told CNN from her parent's home, where she still resides when she's not working.
