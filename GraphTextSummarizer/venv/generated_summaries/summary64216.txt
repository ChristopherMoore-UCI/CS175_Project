The body remained at the site Friday night after rangers decided to wait until Saturday morning to remove the remains because of the waning light and the number of bears in the area. Earlier that year, grizzly bears killed two men in Yellowstone National Park, according to the park's superintendent. Last September, a grizzly attacked and killed a hunter in northwestern Montana within sight of another hunter. -- A lone backpacker was killed in a grizzly bear attack while hiking in Alaska's Denali National Park, the National Park Service said Saturday. About 12 grizzly bears have been living this summer around where Friday's attack occurred, the park said, citing wildlife biologists.
