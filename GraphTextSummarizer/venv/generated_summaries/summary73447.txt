But also I think there is still -- I don't like to call it a glass ceiling, but I think there is still an unseen barrier for women, which is that, if you ask most business people, would they like to promote more women, they would all say yes, they'd love to: "Where are these women, I want to promote them," will be the answer. I think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and I don't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide. Benjamin: Why do you think that is? Gooding: Partly a lack of role models, partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family, in work. And what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top? Gooding: But actually life isn't like that, you have to tell people about your results and your achievements, and men are often better at doing that than women are.
