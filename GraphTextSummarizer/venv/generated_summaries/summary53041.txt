"Billy Casper was one of the greatest winners in PGA Tour history and was a dominant player for the better part of three decades," tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said in a statement. A devoted family man and devout Mormon, Casper said last year that he still had a "close relationship" with the military. Recently, Casper recalled the evolution of enormous prizes for top golfers. Billy Casper, a pioneer of professional golf, died Saturday afternoon at his home in Springville, Utah, at the age of 83, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. In the past several years, Casper's golf facility operations company has helped raise more than $1.1 million for the Wounded Warrior veterans project via the "World's Largest Golf Outing" event.
