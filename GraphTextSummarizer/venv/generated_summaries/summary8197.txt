-- First lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush on Saturday led the commemoration for the victims of Flight 93, which crashed and burned as passengers and crew fought hijackers determined to strike the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2001. Others who spoke at the ceremony were Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, and Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93. "They all took a different path to that September morning. Bush noted that the terrorists who hijacked the plane had other targets in mind, but the spot near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, "was chosen by the passengers of Flight 93, who spared our country from even greater horrors." "As we gather to remember those who were lost and honor their courage, we are deeply grateful," she said. Speaking generally about 9/11, Bush praised the first responders in Shanksville, the rescuers at the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon, and the millions who took part in blood drives, vigils and memorial services.
