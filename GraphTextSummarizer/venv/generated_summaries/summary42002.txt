While the jury's out on what will happen next November, the new round of primary challenges from candidates enjoying support from tea party activists appears to be proof that the movement continues to strongly influence the Republican Party, even after some political pundits prematurely wrote the tea party's obituary after 2012. But Walsh said that he doesn't see a repeat of what occurred in recent years even though a majority of Republican Senators running for re-election are facing primary challenges. But Republicans have a tremendous opportunity to win back control of the Senate next year and it's a critical reminder to Republican primary voters that candidate quality matters," he told CNN. "Republicans effectively gave away five Senate seats the last two cycles because of candidates who weren't capable of winning in November," said Brian Walsh, who served as communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which provides support, advice and funding to Republican candidates, during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have made major headlines, and have hurt the GOP's efforts in the last two elections in their attempts win back control of the Senate from the Democrats.
