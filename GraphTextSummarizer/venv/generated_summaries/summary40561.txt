Before the memorial, Texas Gov. Rick Perry made a similar appeal, calling the slayings "direct attacks on the core of our civil society" and announcing that authorities were offering a new reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest and indictment of the killers. McLelland said Hasse wasn't involved in the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas investigation, but his office was one of numerous Texas and federal agencies involved in an investigation that led to the indictment last year of 34 alleged members of the group -- including four of its senior leaders -- on racketeering charges. While authorities offered no new information on the investigation Thursday, Perry said investigators would leave "no stone unturned" in finding the killers and any group they might be associated with. The emotional plea came as investigators search for suspects in the unsolved killings of two prosecutors that have shaken this Texas county and drawn national attention. "Any organization that is operating in the state of Texas outside the bounds of our laws is going to be put on notice that we're going to hunt you down, we're going to punish you and do our best to remove that type of threat to the safety of the citizens of the state of Texas," Perry said.
