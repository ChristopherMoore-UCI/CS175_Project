Years before Karolyne Smith sold Golden Palace Casino ad space on her forehead for $10,000, and long before an image of the Virgin Mary was toasted into the buttery crust of a grilled cheese sandwich and hocked for $28,000, there was a little family in a little town in Michigan that imprinted their names onto the awkward pages of eBay infamy with another strange sale. At the time, eBay was a relatively new phenomenon, and celebrity worship was at an all-time high. It was that awkward juncture between childhood and adulthood, and one muttered phrase to my dad -- "Did you know Madonna's house is for sale? Just about everyone in my hometown of Rochester Hills knew Madonna had grown up there, but I would guess there weren't too many who could point out which house had been hers. It all started when I returned home from college after my freshman year to find my newfound freedom again weighed down by daily parental oversight.
