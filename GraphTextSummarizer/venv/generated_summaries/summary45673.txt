The families assisted by The Welcome to America Project typically have languished in refugee camps for 10-12 years, says Manning, and come from countries including Iraq, Myanmar, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria and Bhutan -- places where they were often persecuted because of their race, religion or political views. Through her Welcome to America Project, Manning helps legal refugees being resettled to Phoenix by the United Nations. Watch Manning describe the refugees' strikingly different backgrounds Â» Over the last seven years, Manning says, she's learned a lot from the refugees and finds herself looking at American customs from a new perspective.
