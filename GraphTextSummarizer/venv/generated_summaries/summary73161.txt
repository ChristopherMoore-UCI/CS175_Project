Several efforts are underway to increase radiological security, but the GAO found that "agencies that play a role in nuclear and radiological security are not effectively collaborating to achieve the common mission of securing mobile industrial sources." At oil and gas facilities, the GAO found an apparent loophole that allows companies to place radiological material in separate containers in the same room, thus avoiding stricter regulations than would apply if the material were considered "collocated" in the same container. The GAO recommended that agencies work together to provide security, seek input from companies using the radiological material, reconsider collocation rules and evaluate when someone with a criminal history is given unescorted access to radiological material. Four trucks with radiological sources have been stolen since 2005, the GAO found. To evaluate security, investigators visited 33 industrial sites that use radiological sources in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming over the last two years.
