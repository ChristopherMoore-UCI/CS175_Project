"The descent into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely traceable to nontextual means of interpretation, which erodes society's confidence in a rule of law that evidently has no agreed-upon meaning," write Scalia and Garner. And Scalia reiterated his firm views over what he agreed was the most talked-about recent court decision -- the 2000 ruling effectively handing the presidency to George W. Bush after the Florida ballot recounts. Scalia, along with Bryan Garner, is co-author of a new book, "Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts." In his new book, Scalia argues interpreting laws and the Constitution properly requires a strict approach to look at the actual text of the law itself. But Scalia said it was wrong to question Roberts or other court members personally for their legal conclusions.
