Next, the software asks DM2 if she or he wants to send some of this larger pot of money back to DM1. All participants got these instructions: DM1 can give up some or all of his or her $10 and transfer it to DM2 by computer but cannot talk to, or meet, the other person. Then, DM2 gets a computer message identifying how much has been received from DM1 and a reminder of the total in his or her account. If you were DM2, what would you do -- keep it all or share some back with DM1? The DM1 to DM2 transfer is understood to be a measure of trust, while the DM2 to DM1 transfer measures trustworthiness.
