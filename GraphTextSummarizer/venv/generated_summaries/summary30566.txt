Dems to highlight Ryan budget Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer has called the focus on the Ryan budget this spring "a turning point" and a "gift" to Democrats. Paul, Cruz, former senator and 2012 GOP candidate Rick Santorum have been to the state more often, and GOP strategists say if serious about running for president Ryan needs to start spending more time cultivating support there. The question that confronts Ryan is whether his budget, dubbed the "path to prosperity," will help pave a path for him to compete in the early contest state in two years. But Iowa Republicans believe that attacks from Democrats could strengthen Ryan going into 2016. "I don't think it helps him at all," Tammy Kobza, Iowa State director for the Eagle Forum, a conservative group, told CNN when asked if Ryan's record crafting GOP budgets could be a basis for 2016 presidential campaign in Iowa.
