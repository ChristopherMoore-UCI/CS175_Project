The Odwalla 13D Schedule represents that W. Mitt Romney is chief executive officer, president and managing director of BCI VI and his principal occupation is "Managing Director of Bain Capital, Inc." Similarly, a Schedule 13D for Stericycle Inc., filed November 22, 1999, by various Bain Capital entities and Romney as an individual states that Romney is "the sole shareholder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BCI, BCI VI Inc., Brookside and Sankaty, Ltd." Bain Capital Partners VI (BCI VI) was one of many investment vehicles managed by Bain Capital Inc. (BCI). Since February 11, 1999, Mr. Romney has not had any active role with any Bain Capital entity and has not been involved in the operations of any Bain Capital entity in any way. Some portfolio companies were resold by Bain entities at a substantial profit; others failed. We do not know how much money Romney made on Bain deals because he will not make full disclosure of his finances.
