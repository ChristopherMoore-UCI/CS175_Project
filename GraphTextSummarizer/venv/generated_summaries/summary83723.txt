Toyota Tuesday predicted sales growth across the board for 2011, pinning its hopes on green cars and the emerging markets like India and China. -- Toyota returned to profits for the fiscal year ending in March, despite the continuing economic downturn and a series of recalls that rattled consumer confidence in the United States, the Japanese automaker said Tuesday. That figure compares to a loss of 437 billion yen for fiscal year 2008. Toyota cars and trucks have been the subject of at least three separate major recalls in the past year. Another was for gas pedals that can stick on some floor mats, and a third was for braking problems on Toyota Prius hybrid cars.
