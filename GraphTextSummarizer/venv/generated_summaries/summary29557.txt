Study: Caffeine affects teen boys more Study author Dr. Steven Lipshultz has handled cases involving children who became sick after consuming energy drinks. The American Beverage Association recommends that energy drink makers identify the quantity of caffeine from all sources. While studies about the impact of caffeine on children are limited, Lipshultz, a professor and chairman of pediatrics at Wayne State University, said adolescents can experience serious problems after drinking only 100 mg of caffeine. The Food and Drug Administration does not set a standard for what is considered a safe amount of caffeine for children. The association also suggests including the advisory "not (intended/recommended) for children, pregnant or nursing women (and/or persons/those) sensitive to caffeine."
