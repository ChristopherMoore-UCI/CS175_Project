Election method On the question of electing the chief executive, the Basic Law, Hong Kong's "mini-constitution," provides that "the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures. Unlike other cities or provinces in China, or for that matter, those in other countries, the HKSAR enjoys a far higher degree of autonomy in many areas including our legal system, legislature, internal security, immigration, customs, economy, finances, trade, industry, commerce, shipping, aviation, education, sport, religion and external affairs. Much discussion has centered around the recent decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of China on the parameters for electing the chief executive (CE) by one-person, one-vote in 2017. It must also be a discussion based on the constitutional framework that provides for a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) within China. Such claims are unfounded as we have not even started to discuss the detailed but crucial aspects of the nominating process for potential chief executive candidates.
