In a written response, Armstrong's office asserts that witness testimony to USADA is contradictory to prior testimony; that witnesses testified only after Armstrong decided not to contest the USADA proceeding; and that USADA offered sweetheart deals to active riders in exchange for their testimony. A statement on the UCI's official website read: "With respect to Lance Armstrong and the implications of the USADA sanctions which it endorsed on Monday 22 October, the Management Committee decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events. There are also question marks about a $100,000 donation from Armstrong to the UCI in 2002, revealed in USADA's report, but McQuaid insists there was no cover up in regard to Armstrong's activities. The disgraced American operated "the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen," according to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). The UCI said it would soon appoint a fully independent external commission that would look into the role it played during the Armstrong affair and report no later than June next year.
