Deposed Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi picked up support Monday from the Gulf Cooperation Council, with that regional group of six Arab states calling on the Yemeni people to support Hadi against Houthi militants who forced him from office. Hadi escaped from the capital, Sanaa, on Saturday after being under house arrest for a month following his resignation under pressure from Houthi rebels. Hours after Hadi fled Sanaa on Saturday, Houthi officials tried to force parliamentarians to meet immediately to accept his resignation, but their efforts failed. In Taiz, tens of thousands took to the streets to show support for the legitimacy of Hadi as President, and to condemn the continued Houthi takeover of the capital. Houthi militants then put Hadi under house arrest.
