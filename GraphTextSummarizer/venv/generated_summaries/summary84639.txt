Such steps can include providing and reinforcing a trained medical workforce to coordinate activities on the ground in Africa, educating local communities about Ebola and how it is transmitted, supplying basic medical equipment like masks and gloves, and assisting the governments in West Africa to strengthen their public health systems and emergency response infrastructures. The CDC has deployed teams of public health experts to West Africa to assist with disease surveillance, health education, contact tracing, and database management. Ebola can be stopped, but to do so requires both effective containment action and basic medical care. It would, of course, be advantageous to have a proven vaccine or drug therapy to tackle Ebola, but in the meantime, basic care should be provided to significantly help those infected and prevent the spread of disease. In addition, our health care providers have the training and equipment needed to control infections and protect themselves and others when caring for Ebola patients.
