Repeated shots of Eva and Kevin dunking their faces into water (seen from under the water), a bow and arrow motif and the endless use of tomatoes, tomato soup, red wine and red paint as metaphors blood are beyond obvious, and the film can hardly be called subtle: The first time we see Celia, she has an eye patch. These are some of the questions faced by Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) with respect to her son Kevin (played by Rock Duer as a toddler, Jasper Newell as a grade schooler and Ezra Miller as an adolescent, all to chilling effect). As he ages, Kevin is, to Eva and to the audience, if not to Franklin, increasingly creepy. By this time, Eva is more or less convinced that Kevin is damaged goods and things only get worse when she decides (without consulting Franklin) to have another child, perhaps in the hopes of getting it right, the second time. "We Need to Talk About Kevin" is full of hints and foreshadowing (but considering much of the film is told as Eva's memory, it could just as easily be called "after-shadowing") and this is where I found most fault with the film.
