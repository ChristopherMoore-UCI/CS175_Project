Arndt was apparently in violation of Army recruiting regulations because a recruiter isn't "allowed to have anyone who would be considered influenced by your position in the Army in your private home, in your dwelling place," said Kathleen Welker of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Police continued their investigation Tuesday into the shooting deaths of an Army recruiter and a 17-year-old girl in Maryland that appear to be "a murder-suicide," Montgomery County police said. Adam Anthony Arndt, 31, knew Michelle Lynne Miller because he supervised her recruitment as she planned to enlist in the Army Reserves after graduating high school, police said. Police found both of them dead Monday inside Arndt's apartment in Germantown while looking into a report of a missing juvenile possibly being at that location, police said. "Detectives now believe that Arndt shot Miller and then shot himself," police said in a statement.
