Twenty-one children -- ranging in age from 5 to 17 -- were on the St. Landry Parish school bus when it was hit while pulling back onto a highway in central Louisiana, Louisiana State Police said in a news release. Earlier Friday state police indicated that the crash left three children -- ages 5 and 15, plus one more whose age was unknown -- in critical condition. As of 5 p.m., Port Barre High School Principal William Duplechain said, 19 students had been treated and released from hospitals, and two remained in critical condition. He had pulled over on the side of U.S. 190 and, after all the students had boarded, began to slowly move forward "with all of his warning devices still activated," according to Louisiana State Police. He said he favors working with parents and school officials to remove all bus stops along major highways.
