" Latest F1 standings Webber is fifth overall, 63 points behind Vettel, and has helped Red Bull march towards a third successive manufacturers' title. The Ferrari driver led by 44 points with nine races to go, but Vettel now holds a six-point advantage going into Sunday's Indian Grand Prix -- where the Red Bull driver will start in pole position as he seeks to repeat last year's victory at the Buddh International Circuit. " Meanwhile, MotoGP world champion Casey Stoner will start in pole position for his farewell race at his home circuit in Australia on Sunday. The 25-year-old, who has won the last three races, topped Saturday's qualifying session ahead of teammate Mark Webber and will have the McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button creating a buffer against Alonso, who was fifth fastest. While Hamilton and Button are effectively out of the title race, third-placed Kimi Raikkonen still has slim hopes of adding to his 2007 crown -- though his chances of success on Sunday were hit when he qualified seventh as the leading Lotus.
