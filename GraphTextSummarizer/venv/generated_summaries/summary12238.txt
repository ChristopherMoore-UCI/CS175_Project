Andrews was good friends with Clem's wife and kept going to his house even after the initial attacks, Totten said. Clem was convicted of one count of forcible rape and two counts of second-degree rape, attacks that occurred when Andrews was a minor. "Frankly, I think the judge's sentence was surprising to most everyone in the courtroom," said Clem's attorney, Dan Totten. Regardless of Clem's past troubles, from Totten's point of view the sentence was too harsh. According to Clem's attorney, the relationship should not have happened because Clem was married and Andrews was a minor, but it was consensual.
