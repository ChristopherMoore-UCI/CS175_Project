-- When American basketball player Kevin Sheppard moved to Iran in 2009, he was greeted by elaborate graffiti that read "Down with the USA" and "America is the Devil." Filmmaker Till Schauder joined Sheppard on his journey, chronicling the basketball player's experience in one of the most feared countries in the world in a documentary called "The Iran Job." Although Sheppard had played basketball in several countries around the globe -- including Israel, Spain, China and Brazil -- he accepted the job in Iran with some reluctance. It was the beginning of the country's Green Movement, when demonstrators claimed a rigged election and demanded the removal of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Along with his co-producer and wife, Sara Nodjoumi, Schauder launched one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in the fundraising site's history, raising $100,466 for the production of "The Iran Job."
