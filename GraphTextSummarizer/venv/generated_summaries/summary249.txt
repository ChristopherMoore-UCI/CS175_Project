-- A free speech dispute over a California law banning sale of violent video games to children will go to the Supreme Court for review. Lawmakers also said there is a "causal connection" between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children. As defined by California, such interactive games are those in which the player is given the choice of "killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being" in offensive ways. Similar efforts in other states to restrict gaming content have been rejected by various courts. The Supreme Court in recent years has thwarted repeated congressional attempts to protect children from pornography, saying legislation went too far in limiting adult access to explicit, but lawful, sexual content on the internet.
