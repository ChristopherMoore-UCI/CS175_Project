Radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr thanked followers who offered to launch attacks against the U.S. military in Iraq should he reinstate his notorious Mehdi Army militia, according to a posting on his website. The exchange between a follower and al-Sadr on his website comes as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is talking with members of his government about the possibility of requesting American troops to stay in Iraq beyond a year-end deadline to withdraw. His Mehdi Army has been considered one of Iraq's most formidable private armies following the fall of Saddam Hussein. An increase in attacks in recent months against American troops has been blamed on Shiite militias, including the Promised Day Brigade. Al-Sadr has ratcheted his anti-American rhetoric up in recent months, raising concerns about an increase in violence as Iraq weighs whether to request that some of the 47,000 troops in Iraq stay beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline agreed upon between the two countries.
