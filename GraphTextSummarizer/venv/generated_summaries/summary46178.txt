They have been frustrated by this dynamic since long before Michael Brown was born -- so no, it is not this day that would confer peace, no matter how many hugs and smiles came with it. All of this protesting -- this boy's death will mean nothing if we don't start doing what we can to change the way things are." Makeshift voter registration booths had popped up around Ferguson, most notably at the burned-down QuikTrip which has served as ground zero for protesters, and another near where Brown was shot and killed. "I vote, but many of my friends don't because they think it doesn't matter," said 21-year-old Joshua Jones, a native of Ferguson who said he recently graduated from DePauw University and is starting graduate school at St. Louis University this fall. "But I don't think anything in Ferguson is going to change unless black people start voting." Vote -- lest the outrage that followed Michael Brown's passing be for naught, and true peace remain unattainable.
