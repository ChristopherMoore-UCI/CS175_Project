"I called up my existing clients who were all incredible women, and one of them happened to be a doctor and a sex therapist who happened to be in wheelchair," Hammer told Today.com. Hammer told Today she began the campaign a year ago when she was first asked to show her designs at Fashion Week. Jamie Brewer is about to make fashion history as the first model with Down syndrome to walk a runway during New York Fashion Week. Brewer, who is best known for the "American Horror Story" TV franchise, was recruited to strut her stuff Thursday for designer Carrie Hammer. The actress/model is part of designer Hammer's Role Models Not Runway Models campaign, which highlights women making a difference.
