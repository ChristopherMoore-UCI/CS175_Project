According to Dibble's lawyer, Andrew Smiley, NYC Transit rather than Dibble bore primary responsibility for the accident because the subway driver had time to stop the train but did not. Dustin Dibble, 25, landed in the subway tracks after a late night watching a hockey game at a bar with friends April 23, 2006. Dustin Dibble fell on New York subway tracks, was hit by a train and had his leg severed in 2006. The deficit-plagued MTA plans to appeal the decision, according to spokesman James Anyansi. -- A Manhattan jury awarded $2.33 million to a man who lost his leg after drunkenly stumbling onto the path of an oncoming subway train.
