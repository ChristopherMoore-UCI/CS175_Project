When asked if crime had increased during the two months since the cuts, the mayor's spokesman, Robert Corrales, said only, "Crime, in general, ebbs and flows and to pinpoint it on layoffs is just inconclusive." "Public safety is our primary obligation as elected officials," Redd said in a press release. In an agreement between Camden officials and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the city will have access to $2.5 million from what is known as a "payment in lieu of taxes," or PILOT, state fund. Camden is second only to St. Louis in annual crime-rate rankings of cities, with the rankings based on compilations of FBI crime statistics. Redd pledged to keep working with the governor and local officials to find and implement a long-term plan.
