Stenson finished two strokes clear of American Steve Stricker at the rain-delayed event in Boston, putting him in pole position to collect the $10 million FedEx Cup winner's check. The top 70 players in the FedEx Cup standings will now progress to play in the BMW Championships, with the top 30 players then advancing to the series-ending Tour Championship. The Deutsche Bank Championship is the second of four FedEx Cup playoff events. The player who finishes top of the FedEx Cup standings following the Tour Championship picks up a check for $10 million. He finished as runner-up to Phil Mickelson at July's British Open in addition to a third-place finish at last month's PGA Championships.
