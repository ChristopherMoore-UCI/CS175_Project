Over the past few years, Morrissey has canceled tour dates for reasons like food poisoning, bleeding ulcers, pneumonia and a sickness he blamed on his opening act, but this is the first time the usually candid rocker has uttered the C-word aloud.

In a recent interview where Morrissey talked about his many health issues, he proclaimed that, "The worst was in June in Boston, when I was hospitalized with acute fever. At press time, Morrissey hasn't updated his fan sites about the cancer reports. It's been a rough year for Morrissey, as the laconic singer has endured everything from tour-canceling illnesses to possibly being dropped from his new label to bizarre allegations of a murder-for-hire plot.
