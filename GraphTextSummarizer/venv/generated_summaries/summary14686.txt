The USA Bid Committee announced on Friday it had made the decision after "several months of careful deliberation" following meetings with the sport's world ruling body FIFA and Europe's controlling organization UEFA. "For some time we have been in conversations with FIFA and UEFA about the possibility of focusing only on the 2022 bidding process, an option we have made reference to many times," bid chairman Sunil Gulati, also the president of U.S. Soccer, said in a statement. "We have had an open and constructive dialogue with the USA Bid for some time now, after it became apparent that there was a growing movement to stage the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Europe," he said. "The announcement by the USA Bid to focus solely on the 2022 FIFA World Cup is therefore a welcome gesture which is much appreciated by FIFA. " FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke welcomed the decision, saying it made sense given the location of the four other 2018 candidates.
