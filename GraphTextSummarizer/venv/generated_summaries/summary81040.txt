Denying women this care until they can raise the money to pay out of pocket can force them to seek abortion later in their pregnancies and drive them into the clutches of back-alley providers such as Gosnell, who offer them substandard care. Gosnell also ignored the standards of care and safety recognized as best practices by medical professionals who provide abortion care. A Guttmacher Institute study found similar abortion rates in countries where abortion is illegal and where it is legal. Not to be outdone, North Dakota enacted a six-week ban on abortion -- that's before most women even know they are pregnant. In fact, it was the stories -- daily stories -- of horrors women faced from unregulated, unsafe, unsanitary procedures that shocked a nation into action back in the days when abortion was illegal.
