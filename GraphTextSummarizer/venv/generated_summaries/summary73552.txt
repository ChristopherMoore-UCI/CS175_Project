During her darkest hours in captivity, former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt considered death preferable to her ordeal, she said in an interview with CNN's "Connect the World." Betancourt, who was kidnapped in 2002 during her campaign for the presidency and rescued in 2008, wrote about her experience in a new book, "Even Silence Has an End." Betancourt had seen other hostages die in similar circumstances in the jungle. In a memoir published last year, the U.S. military contractors rescued along with Betancourt painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of France and Colombia, describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members. Betancourt was freed in a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in July 2008.
