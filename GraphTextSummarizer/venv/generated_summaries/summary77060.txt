On the final day of action in the second flight, Hull City secured a place in the Premier League for next season after drawing 2-2 at home to champions Cardiff City. The FA Cup finalists are just two points below fourth-bottom Sunderland, who host Stoke City Monday, and three points adrift of Newcastle United, who could only draw 0-0 at West Ham United. Elsewhere, deposed champion Manchester City were held to a 0-0 draw at Swansea City while already doomed Reading scored a fine 4-2 win at Fulham. Watford, Brighton and Hove Albion, Crystal Palace and Leicester City will contest the play-offs for the third promotion spot to the riches of the EPL. Tottenham also have 65 points and have played one game less than Arsenal in a desperately tight battle for the top four qualification spots for the Champions League next season.
