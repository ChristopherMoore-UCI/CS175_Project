"We would like to see Hollywood go back to labeling movies with lots of violence, and gun violence in particular, with an R rating, just like they have been doing for explicit sex all along." Coinciding with the rise of violent video games and violence in movies is a significant decrease in juvenile violent crime. Perhaps more surprising is that gun violence in PG-13 films has tripled since 1985, even exceeding the amount found in R-rated films in more recent years. While the study authors saw gun violence in PG-13 films triple, the same was not true for R- and G/PG-rated films. "We don't know if seeing gun violence on the screen has a unique effect, but it is concerning considering that we have seen a rise in the use of guns in schools and other settings in recent years."
