"DOJ [Justice Department] is ready to opine that Oregon doctors who assist suicides are not violating the Controlled Substances Act (This is contrary to an initial DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] ruling," wrote Kagan. At issue was a federal challenge to Oregon's 1994 Death with Dignity Act allowing doctors to prescribe lethal doses of medicine to assist patients to commit suicide. The high court the year before the Kagan memo upheld state bans on assisted suicide, concluding there was nothing in the Constitution supporting an individual's right to die. The Bush administration in the 2000s -- backed by a Republican-led Congress -- vigorously took up the issue to make assisted suicide a federal crime and to challenge the Oregon law, eventually appealing all the way to the Supreme Court. -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan once believed a federal law to ban physician-assisted suicide was a "fairly terrible idea."
