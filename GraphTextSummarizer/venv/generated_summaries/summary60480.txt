"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money," Branch recalled. As for the Lloyd case, Hernandez's lawyers contend the circumstantial evidence has gaps. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.
