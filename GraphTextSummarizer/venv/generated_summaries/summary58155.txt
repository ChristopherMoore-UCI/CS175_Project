The win gives Abe four more years to institute his policies aimed at reviving Japan's economy by flooding the market with cash, encouraging corporations to create more jobs and increasing government spending. Official results are still being tallied, but Japanese public broadcaster NHK said Abe's ruling coalition had secured a two-thirds majority in Parliament's Lower House, winning 326 of 475 seats. His special adviser on economic affairs, Etsuro Honda, has called for a further $25 billion in cash handout stimulus and tax cuts to kickstart the economy. But as exit poll results came in on Sunday, it appeared that Abe's coalition had picked up more than 30 seats. And many had wondered why Abe, with a sizable majority in the Lower House -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early.
