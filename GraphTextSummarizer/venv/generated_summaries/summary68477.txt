ATF Director Michael Sullivan says the agency is revising its procedures on lost weapons and laptops. "We are revising our procedures of reporting losses of weapons or laptops," Sullivan said. "ATF could not provide adequate information" about the contents of the other 398, the report said, and therefore, "ATF could not assess what damage these losses could have had on ATF's operations or national security." "It is especially troubling that ATF's rate of loss for weapons was nearly double that of the FBI and DEA," the report said. -- The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Wednesday it is changing its ways after an audit showed that the agency was losing guns and laptops, often through carelessness.
