"Our university community has suffered an unfathomable loss," Millersville University President John Anderson wrote. Karlie Hall was found in her dorm room Sunday morning at Millersville University, about an hour west of Philadelphia, the Lancaster County District Attorney's Office said. Her boyfriend, 19-year-old Gregorio Orrostieta, called 911 around 5:20 a.m., prosecutor Craig Stedman said. Stedman said the couple started dating 11 months ago, when she was in high school. About three hours before Orrostieta called 911, a residential assistant heard a struggle and knocked on Hall's dorm room door, Stedman said.
