Officials stopped the game after 82 minutes, with Ghana fans having gathered behind one goal as they attempted to get away from missiles being hurled by Equatorial Guinea supporters. Meanwhile, the CAF has fined Equatorial Guinea $100,000 (Â£65,000) after crowd trouble marred Thursday's Cup of Nations semifinal defeat to Ghana. Trouble had threatened to boil over earlier on, with missiles thrown at Ghana players as they headed down the tunnel at half-time and the atmosphere in the stands souring as several decisions went against the home team. It said Equatorial Guinea must pay for the treatment of the 36 fans injured in the clashes, which broke out during the closing stages of Ghana's 3-0 win at the Estadio de Malabo in Equatorial Guinea. That led to the CAF banning it from taking part in the 2015 event after Equatorial Guinea had stepped in as host nation -- and African football's governing body has now imposed further, sweeping sanctions.
