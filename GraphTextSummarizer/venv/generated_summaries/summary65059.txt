The reward for the safe return of a missing New York City teen with autism, Avonte Oquendo, has been raised to $70,000, thanks to an anonymous donation through Autism Speaks, according to a spokesman for the organization. " Surveillance video shows 14-year-old Oquendo, of Queens, running out the door of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City at 12:38 p.m. on October 4. Perecman also told CNN that he is taking steps to investigate how Oquendo was able to escape school grounds unsupervised. The $50,000 donation came in Friday morning and was specifically earmarked to aid the search effort for Oquendo, said C.J. Volpe, director of media relations for Autism Speaks, a national organization devoted to autism research and advocacy. Later, Oquendo's mother's employer, Health First, and The Perecman Firm, the law firm now representing the Oquendo family, pledged an additional $5,000 each, according to David Perecman, the family's attorney.
