"I wouldn't be shocked if it came here," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. The first cases of the novel coronavirus, which is in the same family as SARS and the common cold, were found to have occurred in an Amman, Jordan, hospital in April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission where you see a chain of many cases going person to person to person," Gerber said. And in most cases, patients have not infected family members. A study published in November found that genetically, the new coronavirus was most closely related to viruses found in bats.
