The Oscar winner admitted to David Letterman on his "Late Show" on Wednesday that she has a huge fear of singing in front of other people, and it all goes back to the time she sang a holiday song in front of her school as an 8-year-old. " Lawrence claims that she has this "tone-deaf Amy Winehouse voice," but when she broke into a rendition of "Have a Holly Jolly Christmas," which is the song she performed way back when, Winehouse is definitely not who we were reminded of. " We'll find out how she sounds when "Mockingjay -- Part I" opens November 21, but we can already bet it'll be better than her take on Christmas carols. "I do not like singing in front of other people," Lawrence told Letterman. Lawrence actually had to face her fear of singing for the latest "Hunger Games" movie, "Mockingjay -- Part I," because she had to perform a song called "The Hanging Tree."
