" Ekso Bionics chief executive Eythor Bender and his team developed the robotic model to help wheelchair users and those who have suffered spinal chord injuries. "We are working with soldiers -- the most able-bodied -- to carry more weight and reduce back injuries," Bender said. The developments of Ekso Bionics are funded through private investments and government grants. The so-called Ekso, a mechanical skeleton created by California-based company Ekso Bionics, is designed to give paraplegics the power to walk unaided.
