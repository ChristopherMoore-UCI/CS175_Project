The Asia-Pacific region is a maritime theater whereas Europe was mostly a land theater. The relative importance of counterterrorism, intelligence, training and equipping foreign security forces, and special forces operations will continue to grow. But I also believe President Barack Obama has been too quick to commit forces to other missions not core to our security interests. For the U.S., the Asia-Pacific features a collection of bilateral military alliances in contrast to our involvement with the multilateral NATO in Europe. -- A president's most solemn duty is to protect America and her people -- a responsibility that, in a time of evolving security threats and unsustainable debt, will only grow harder for the next administration.
