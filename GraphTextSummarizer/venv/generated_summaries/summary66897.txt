Flight 17 was downed on July 17 by a suspected surface-to-air missile over eastern Ukraine, where groups of pro-Russian rebels are fighting Ukrainian government forces.

The EU's move aims to punish those supporting the monthslong pro-Russian rebellion in eastern Ukraine. 378 body bags processed so far As of Friday afternoon, 378 body bags containing remains of Flight 17 victims have been processed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, where discovered remains have been sent, Sergey Bochkovskiy, the head of Ukraine's State Emergency Services, told reporters there.
