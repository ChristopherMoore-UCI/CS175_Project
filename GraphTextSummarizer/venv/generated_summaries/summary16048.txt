In his statement, Ford alluded to the end of his time as a coach for the Don Bosco Eagles high school team, as well as the departure of his mayoral chief of staff Mark Towhey. His demeanor Friday was markedly different from the man Star reporters described in the video, which the newspaper claimed was shot last winter. Later in the video as described by the Star, an "incoherent" man both the Star and Gawker claimed to be Ford ranted on a number of subjects, from Liberal leader Justin Trudeau to the high school football team he coached. Echoing the mayor, Doug Ford questioned the Star for its "accusation of a video that does not exist or we haven't seen." Eight days ago, Gawker and the Toronto Star published stories stating their reporters had seen a cell-phone video showing Ford, as the Star described it, "inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."
