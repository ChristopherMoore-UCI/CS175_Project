Over the past year or so, apps like Secret and Whisper, which let users share anonymous photos and written posts, have taken off, particularly among young users. Bullying, graphic sexual content and scam attempts have all been reported on anonymous apps. Facebook is working on a standalone app that would let users post under assumed names, according to the New York Times. It remains to be seen how Facebook, which has aimed to be home to its users' "real" online persona on a Web with a host of anonymous corners, would police an anonymous app. And it looks like the burgeoning field of anonymous sharing apps may be next.
