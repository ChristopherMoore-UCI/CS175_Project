Read about the case against Amanda Knox Still, at occasional prison visits, Curt Knox and Mellas try to give Knox a light at the end of the tunnel. When she learned Kercher was dead in the room, a hysterical Knox called her mother, Mellas remembered. "As parents, the Kercher family received the worst phone call they could get," Curt Knox said, adding he believes Kercher has gotten lost in the sensational coverage. Prosecutors say Knox directed then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her, Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. Yes, they concede, Knox, now 22, and Sollecito say they were smoking marijuana and having sex at his home the night Kercher was killed, but that was as wild as it got.
