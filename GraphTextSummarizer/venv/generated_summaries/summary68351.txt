-- Hyundai is recalling more than 220,000 Santa Fe SUVs and Sonata sedans because of potential problems with their air bags. These vehicles' front passenger airbags may not deploy in the event of a crash because of a possible problem with their occupant classification system, which gauges the size of a passenger and based on that whether an air bag should be deployed. Hyundai dealers are expected to notify owners and replace the curtain side airbags free of charge, the NHTSA said. The recall affects almost 200,000 SUVs from the 2007-2009 model years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The system may need to be recalibrated to detect to "small statured adults," the federal safety agency said.
