"It's easy to look at us and say we're this little hillbilly town in southwest Missouri," said Virginia Laas, professor of history emeritus at Missouri Southern State University. Bogle, who studied the integration of Joplin schools, said she found it wasn't as difficult as it had been in other cities. Another major place of industry is Missouri Southern State University, a revered institution spared by the tornado. But as in many American towns, people get an education at a place like Missouri Southern, and then they head out. The tornado-ravaged city of Joplin, Missouri, is an authentic American crossroads, a truck stop and regional mecca with a rich mining heritage that straddles a cultural vein linking the Great Plains and the Ozarks.
