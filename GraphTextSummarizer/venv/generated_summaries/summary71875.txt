First Baptist Church, a few feet from the neighborhood where Michael McLendon, 28, opened fire Tuesday, welcomed members of this close community Wednesday night for a prayer service. Sellers also thanked town leaders, medical personnel and local law enforcement while asking the question that's been on so many minds: "I don't know what set a young man off like that, but I, too, want to pray for his family. Watch how state copes with "shock and disbelief" Â» While members of this tight-knit town may never fully understand how McLendon could've committed this crime, many find comfort in faith and friends. McLendon was once a police officer in Samson, the small town hit hardest by the deadliest crime in Alabama history, authorities said. It's just a small town where you consider your friends as family."
