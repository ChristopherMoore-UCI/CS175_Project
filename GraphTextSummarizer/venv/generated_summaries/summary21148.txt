The protesters damaged buses and cars Monday, setting several on fire, while police used clubs and tear gas to disperse the Islamists, who were wearing skullcaps and burial cloths. The government recently announced its National Women Development Policy 2011, which ensures women expanded rights in property and education. Amini said the Quran defines how much property a woman should inherit, and the government should not allow women more than that. "We'll die for the cause of Islam, but (will) not allow the government to disrespect (the) Quran," one protester shouted during the demonstration near the national mosque in downtown Dhaka. "Amini is misleading the people," said government spokesman Mohammad Shahjahan Miah.
