Jody Herrington-Gettys, director of domestic disaster relief for Operation Blessing, has pledged support to the region, saying it will partner with local churches and other groups and assist in aid efforts through grants and donations. -- Sunday's outbreak of severe weather spawned more than 60 tornadoes and caused damage in several Midwestern states, including Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. The Central Illinois chapter of the Red Cross has established a shelter in the Illinois town of Washington. Some of the hardest-hit communities are Washington and Peoria, Illinois, and Kokomo, Indiana. As is often the case, the Red Cross is one of the first groups to arrive and provide aid to victims of such terrible storms.
