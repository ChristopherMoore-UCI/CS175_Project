Marshall's son, E. Pierce Marshall, died in 2006, and Smith died in 2007 from what a Florida medical examiner ruled was "acute combined drug intoxication." Marshall died a year after the wedding, but Smith, according to legal briefs filed with the court, was not given a share of the estate in the will or separate trust. Smith, a former Playboy pinup and stripper, fought for more than a decade with a son of J. Howard Marshall over a fortune estimated as much as $1.6 billion. Smith claimed that Marshall's son "used fraud and undue influence" in his father's last months to have him leave Smith out of his will. "The lies that were told about told about E. Pierce Marshall have finally been put to rest," Marshall's family said in a written statment.
