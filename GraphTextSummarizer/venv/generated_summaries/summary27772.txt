Dominy, who has studied enzymes in saliva, found the results surprising, and said no one had previously surveyed the variety of bacteria in saliva. "Having those bacteria -- that's the price we have to pay for having a lot of saliva in the mouth to begin with," said Nate Dominy, anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This was the first global survey of bacteria diversity in human saliva. But a new study published in the journal Genome Research finds that bacteria in saliva may not be as related to environment and diet as you might think. In fact, researchers found that the human salivary microbiome -- that is, the community of bacteria in saliva -- does not vary greatly between different geographic locations.
