Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, has been plagued by water hyacinth plants for over two decades. That means we are alleviating poverty," said Caroline Agwanda, who heads Hyacinth Ornaments Production Enterprises in Kisumu, Kenya. The organization, which sells products ranging from handbags to furniture, aims to give employment to disadvantaged women, youths and those with disabilities. While its flowers can be beautiful its foliage can grow to cover large swaths of the waters in a dense green mat of leaves that choke the shoreline of fish. The wares that Agwanda's group creates are sold mainly in large towns across Kenya.
