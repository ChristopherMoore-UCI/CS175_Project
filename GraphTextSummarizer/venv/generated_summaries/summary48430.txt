"What we have done is to gather together 300 companies, just to start with, including, some of the top 50 companies in the country, companies like Walmart, and Apple, Ford and others, to say let's establish best practices," President Barack Obama told CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview. Critics have said Obama's push for executive action illustrates diminished expectations. In a separate interview, Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate and a potential White House hopeful next time around, told Tapper that Obama appears to be circumventing the Constitution with an "end run" around Congress. Efforts backed by Obama to extend a federal program providing jobless benefits to that group fell flat this month in Congress. The move is in line with Obama's State of the Union push to take executive action on initiatives that he does not need Congress to accomplish.
