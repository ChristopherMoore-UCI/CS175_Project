Though they still live halfway around the world from each other, Bordier in Paris and Futerman in Los Angeles, they text multiple times every day. I was wondering where you were born?" Futerman, who was raised in Verona, New Jersey, and who has two brothers (her parents' biological sons) and a half-brother from her father's previous marriage, at first didn't know what to make of Bordier's friend request and message. She and Bordier have teamed up with Futerman's friend, fellow actress Jenna Ushkowitz, a Korean-American adoptee and cast member on "Glee," to start a foundation called kindred. Bordier says Futerman is always waking her up in the morning via text because of the time difference. Anais Bordier and Samantha Futerman have the same laugh and the same freckled cheeks.
