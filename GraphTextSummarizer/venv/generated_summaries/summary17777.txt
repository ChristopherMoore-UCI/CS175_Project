-- Detroit became the largest U.S. city to exit bankruptcy this week, with the effective approval of a plan to slash $7 billion in debt and reinvest $1.4 billion to improve city services. Local and national philanthropies, retirees and unions, elected officials on both sides of the aisle and from all corners of Michigan, businesses from the "Big Three" automakers to JP Morgan Chase, cultural advocates, a groundswell of Detroit residents -- all came together to forge this compromise, underscoring that no one entity, or sector, can do it alone. At the Kresge Foundation, a philanthropy rooted in Detroit and committed to expanding opportunity in cities nationwide, we fundamentally rejected this way of thinking. But it is the positive characteristics of the Grand Bargain that form the basis of Detroit's future -- and that serve as inspiration for other cities to tackle similar, seemingly insurmountable challenges. But in Detroit -- and, indeed, in countless cities across the country -- the duo constitute an essential part of the city soul.
