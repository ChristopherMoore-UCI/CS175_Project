As Republicans criticize the Obama administration's appointment of Klain, Democrats are intensifying their push for a vote on the delayed nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy for surgeon general. "Given the public's increasing fears regarding the spread of the disease, it is imperative that we confirm a Surgeon General who will play a significant role in educating the American public about the disease and how to best protect their health," write Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee,  Judy Chu and Ami Bera and dozens of other House Democrats in a letter being sent this week to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. "In terms of what role the surgeon general would play in this specific response, I guess what I would say about that is it's hard to imagine it would hurt, and that we would only benefit from a scenario where we had a dedicated public health professional who was involved in helping us communicate with hospitals and medical professionals all across the country to ensure that these protocols, the proper protocols, were in place and closely followed," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said last week. In an editorial Thursday the Boston Globe said: "It's a bad time to be without a surgeon general; dismayingly, Obama's appointment of Dr. Vivek Murthy of Brookline sank earlier this year because of [National Rife Association] opposition. "Given Dr. Murthy's lengthy history of hostility towards the right to keep and bear arms," the NRA said "there is little reason to believe that he would not work to further a gun control agenda if confirmed as Surgeon General."
