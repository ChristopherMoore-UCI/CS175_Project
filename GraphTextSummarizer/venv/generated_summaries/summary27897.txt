If you're just starting triathlon and only planning on doing one or two local events, you can use a beach cruiser, shopper or mountain bike. Bikes can be few hundred dollars or as much as the price of a car. Secondhand bikes can be a great value, but it's your responsibility to make sure your bike is roadworthy. Just make sure you swim in the wetsuit before race day and learn how to get it on and off properly. Swimcap: These are usually provided by race organizers, but a spare is useful for training and for doubling up if the water is cold.
