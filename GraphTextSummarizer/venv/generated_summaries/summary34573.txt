Jones instead began his dream of building his own course at Augusta, and made money writing golf books and making short instructional films for Hollywood studio Warner Brothers. However, despite his prodigious talent, it took Jones time to make his mark as he battled his own demons. In November 1971, just a month before his death, Jones wrote a letter to the U.S. Golf Association that led to his club's Highlands course hosting its first major tournament, the 1976 U.S. Open. The only man to win golf's four major tournaments in one year, Jones founded one of his own events that is now among that pantheon -- the Masters. Jones served in the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel during World War II, but ailing health ended his playing participation at the Masters after 1948.
