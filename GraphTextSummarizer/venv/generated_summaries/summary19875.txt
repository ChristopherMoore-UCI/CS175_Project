The incident began about 2:20 p.m., when Palm Bay police got a call from people in the hospital cafeteria who said a man was pointing the gun at anyone who tried to talk to him, said police spokeswoman Yvonne Martinez. As police officers and SWAT personnel from Palm Bay and nearby agencies assembled outside the hospital, the hospital was locked down and emergency vehicles were diverted to other hospitals. " Hospital spokesman Elliot Cohen told CNN that the man, who has not been identified publicly, "was terminated about a month ago for having a poor attendance record" after having worked at the hospital for about two years. -- A former employee who had recently been fired from Palm Bay Hospital returned there Thursday afternoon carrying a gun, holed himself up in an office, then apparently killed himself, officials said. Palm Bay Hospital resumed normal operations as soon as the body was discovered, he said.
