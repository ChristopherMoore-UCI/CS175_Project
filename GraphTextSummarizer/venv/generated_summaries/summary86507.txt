Syrian state TV also reported that Israeli forces had shot down a Syrian warplane. U.N. forces withdrew last week from the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, a little more than two weeks after Islamic militant fighters took some peacekeepers hostage and besieged others. The incidents occurred after Syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing in Quneitra in late August. Al-Nusra Front freed 45 U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji in good condition earlier this month, while forces from the Philippines escaped after exchanging fire with militant fighters, according to media reports. Militants in the area are trying to dislodge Syrian government forces from their last two strongholds in the area, the group said.
