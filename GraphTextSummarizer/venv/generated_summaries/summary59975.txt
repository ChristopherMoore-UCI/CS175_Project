'Stand your ground' denied in Alexander case The case gained the attention of civil rights leaders, who say the African-American mother of three was persecuted because of her race, and from others, including U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, who said the sentence was too harsh and Alexander never should have been charged. Florida lawmakers won't have special session on 'stand your ground' InSession's Jessica Thill and CNN's Chuck Hadad, Michael Pearson and Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report. Rather, the appellate court pointed out, the prosecution had the burden to prove that Alexander herself was guilty of aggravated assault. A jury convicted Alexander, 31, of aggravated assault in March 2012 after just 12 minutes of deliberation. Corey had said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence, but Alexander chose to take the case to a jury trial, where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a Florida law known as "10-20-life."
