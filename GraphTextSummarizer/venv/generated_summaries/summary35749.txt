-- A Florida pastor who canceled plans for his congregation to burn Qurans on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks had the right to follow through with his intentions, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said Wednesday. Yet he said he was not bothered by a poll that found two-thirds of respondents couldn't name a single Supreme Court justice, and recalled a similar poll a few years back that there were more people who could name the Three Stooges than three Supreme Court Justices. " He also recalled tests of public school affirmative action plans in Seattle, Washington, and Louisville, Kentucky, where local officials sought to use race as a criterion to grant white students admission to the schools to integrate them. "It's so often I hear people say -- and particularly in college students -- 'Well, that's just so terrible what he's saying.' I say, 'Oh, you think that free speech is only for people who don't say things that are terrible?'" he said.
