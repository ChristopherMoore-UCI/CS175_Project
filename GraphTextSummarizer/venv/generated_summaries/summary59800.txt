Werder Bremen beat Mainz 2-1 in Sunday's other Bundesliga fixture, with two goals from Aaron Hunt lifting his team to seventh place and above the visitors on goal difference. In Italy's Serie A, Napoli failed to capitalize on Juventus' first defeat in 50 matches, being held 1-1 at home by Torino on Sunday despite a sixth-minute goal from Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani. The result left Newcastle in 10th place, and came at a cost of injuries to midfielder Cabaye, defender James Perch and top scorer Demba Ba. Meanwhile, Queens Park Rangers moved off the bottom after a 1-1 draw at home to Reading in Sunday's other EPL game. Such was his combative presence on Sunday that he lured visiting defender Fabricio Coloccini -- a fellow South American from neighboring Argentina -- into a rash challenge that earned a red card.
