-- Paris Hilton was released from a Las Vegas, Nevada, jail Saturday morning after being arrested late the night before on suspicion of cocaine possession, police said Saturday. The hotel heiress was riding in a black Cadillac Escalade which was pulled over in front of the Wynn Hotel on the Vegas strip at about 11:30 p.m. after police detected the smell of marijuana coming from the SUV, Lt. Wayne Holman told CNN. The driver, whom police identified as Cy Waits, was arrested for driving under the influence, he said. Waits is a Las Vegas nightclub mogul and the rumored boyfriend of Hilton. Last month, Hilton was briefly detained in South Africa for allegedly smoking marijuana at the World Cup.
