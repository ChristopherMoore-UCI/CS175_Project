Investigators are trying to determine if the man is connected to the shooting at the newspaper, as well as two other Monday crimes -- a shooting that injured no one in front of the Societe Generale towers in Paris, and a carjacking near the towers in the Paris neighborhood of La Defense, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Paris police said they had no information about the man's motive. The description of the man at Liberation is similar to that of the man at BFMTV, and the gun used was of similar caliber, police said. Dekhar allegedly shot a photographer at the daily newspaper Liberation in Paris on Monday. Dekhar was arrested Wednesday in Bois Colombes, in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, the prosecutor's office said.
