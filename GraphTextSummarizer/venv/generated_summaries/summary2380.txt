The 21-year-old, a wild-card entry after reaching the Shanghai Masters semis, will play defending champion Roger Federer in Sunday's final as he seeks his second ATP Tour title -- the first came in 2008. Djokovic, the champion here in 2009 and runner-up last year, said he would travel to France for next week's penultimate event, the Paris Masters, despite his fitness worries. He will next face Argentine wildcard entry Juan Monaco, who upset defending champion David Ferrer -- beating Granollers' fellow Spaniard 7-5 1-6 6-3. " Djokovic returned to action in Switzerland after six weeks out with a back injury suffered during his epic U.S. Open final against Rafael Nadal, an ailment which left him unable to guide Serbia into a second successive Davis Cup final. The sixth seed could have moved up to ninth in the rankings with victory, and was in good form having not dropped a set all week, but was surprisingly beaten 6-4 7-6 (7-4) by last year's runner-up Marcel Granollers.
