The simple free app, called Facebook Poke, allows you to send fleeting messages, pokes, photos and 10-second videos to Facebook friends. "With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you're up to in a lightweight way," says Facebook in a blog post announcing the new app. The app is Facebook's fifth iOS app, joining the main Facebook app, Facebook Messenger and Facebook Camera. The app Poke shamelessly imitates is Snapchat, a photo and video-sharing service that has surged in popularity over the past year year. The Facebook Poke app is also ad-free for the time being.
