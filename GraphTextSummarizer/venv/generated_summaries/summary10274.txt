-- Indian security forces Friday enforced a strict curfew in Srinagar and other major towns of Indian-administered Kashmir to stymie protests sparked Thursday when four civilians were shot and killed by the paramilitary border security force. Early Friday, thousands of police and paramilitary troops fanned out in Srinagar and other towns to enforce the restrictions on movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. " Traffic on the lone highway connecting the landlocked Kashmir valley to rest of the country remained suspended Friday, according to traffic police. Militant attacks in Indian Kashmir have seen a sudden surge recently in the capital city, Srinagar, and other towns. In a separate incident, a leading cardiologist, Sheikh Jalal, was wounded in a militant ambush that left his two police guards dead Thursday in the south Kashmir town of Pampore, a police spokesman said.
