If we hope to improve upon the currently stalled accident rate, we must -- like the rest of the world -- move beyond artificially narrowed construction of causation statements and truly see the events before us as they are instead of forcing them into an outdated congressional mandate of single cause. "I do suggest that the Safety Board should explore other approaches to determining probable cause or causes as a way to refine our approach and if necessary, ask Congress to grant us the statutory relief needed to structure our probable cause findings to be more comprehensive." Additionally, over the past 20 years, increased regulatory oversight, improved engineering methods and better procedures to name a few have helped reduce the number of deadly airline accidents to its lowest in history. This is an impossible task left over from an outdated congressional mandate that has caused the United States to lag behind in accident investigation. Single explanations fall short of answering a larger, perhaps more important question: Why?
