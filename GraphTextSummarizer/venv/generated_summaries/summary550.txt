Davis' testimony was the latest from Edwards staffers about their former boss's relationship with Hunter. Hunter, according to Davis, "told me that she and Sen. Edwards were very much in love" and the candidate was concerned because Davis had seen Hunter in the hotel. Huffman, a longtime friend of Mellon, said he understood money was welcomed because "Mr. Edwards needed financial support for a poverty center. Davis also suggested that Edwards came close to pulling out of the race after an argument with his wife, Elizabeth Edwards, who has since died. But Edwards later told him he was not in a relationship with Rielle Hunter, John Davis said.
