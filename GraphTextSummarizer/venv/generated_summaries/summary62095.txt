Jean has been helping the presidential campaign of popular musician Michel Martelly, who is on the ballot against former first lady Mirlande Manigat in Sunday's pivotal presidential runoff election. -- Hip-hop singer Wyclef Jean heard "the sound of the boom" and then realized he was "grazed by a bullet" in Port-au-Prince Saturday night, the eve of Haiti's presidential runoff election, Jean told CNN. In September, he officially ended his bid to be president of Haiti a month after election officials ruled that he was ineligible to run. The police investigation was stalled by Jean's refusal to speak to police about the incident, according to Garry Desrosiers, a spokesman for the Haitian national police. The wound was superficial and "he is doing well," Jean spokeswoman Cindy Tanenbaum said.
