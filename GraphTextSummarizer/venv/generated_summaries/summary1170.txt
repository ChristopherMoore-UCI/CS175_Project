-- Pucks will fly as soon as next weekend if National Hockey League players ratify a collective bargaining agreement that won a seal of approval Wednesday from the league's board of governors. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said Sunday the "basic framework" of a deal was agreed upon after a 16-hour negotiating session at a Manhattan hotel. Sports Illustrated has tracked the intricacies of the talks and flashpoint issues, and argued that the NHL is "in dire need" of a new way of handling labor relations. There were 526 games, nearly 43% of the season, scheduled from the start of the regular season on October 11 through December 30, the NHL said. League officials hope for a truncated 48-game regular season to start January 19 if the 700 NHL athletes approve the pact.
