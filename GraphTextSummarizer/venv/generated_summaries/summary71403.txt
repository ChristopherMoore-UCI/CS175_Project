North Carolina State coach Everett Case didn't realize he was starting a trend in 1947. While he deservedly gets credit for being the college coach who popularized the net-cutting ritual, some sources -- including Tim Peeler's "Legends of N.C. State Basketball" -- claim Case actually brought the tradition with him from Indiana, where he'd been a hugely successful high school coach before coming to Raleigh to coach the Wolfpack. Either way, cutting down the nets may have remained an obscure Hoosier State tradition had Case not brought the practice to the national stage. In 1986, Barrett was an unknown 31-year-old folk singer when he went to a bar in East Lansing, Michigan, to watch a Boston Celtics game. Who's responsible for college teams cutting down the nets after big wins?
