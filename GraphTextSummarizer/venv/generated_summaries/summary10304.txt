Isla de Providencia, Colombia The residents of Providencia, a 25-minute flight from neighboring San Andr√©s Island, make much of their association with Sir Henry Morgan, the 17th-century swashbuckler de picted on rum bottles worldwide. The men spend their days fishing for grouper and mackerel and leading visitors on boat trips to the archipelago's dozens of uninhabited islands, some barely 100 yards wide. Water Island, U.S. Virgin Islands To call Heidi's Honeymoon Grill a restaurant would be an overstatement it's a food truck that parks on the beach and serves patrons seated at picnic tables but it's about as close to an actual restaurant as you'll get on this 490-acre speck of land a 10-minute ferry ride from St. Thomas.

But it's not all about old times a cosmopolitan yachting crowd regularly drops anchor (and their swimsuits) at the west coast's Anse Crawen beach.
