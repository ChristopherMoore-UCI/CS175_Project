Ukraine: Russian losses number 2,000 The conflict in eastern Ukraine showed no sign of abating Friday morning. But a CNN team in southeastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces and the rebels have engaged in fierce fighting this week between the Russian border and the port city of Mariupol, said that as of 20 minutes into the ceasefire period there had been no renewal of artillery fire. " She added, "If there is a ceasefire agreed in Minsk today, member states would look at how serious it was and decide whether to go forward." Russia: Volunteer fighters in Ukraine Kiev and the West accuse Moscow of both arming the rebels and sending Russian troops into Ukraine to aid them -- claims Moscow denies. "We stand firmly behind Ukraine's right to make its own decisions, not to have then dictated by Russian tanks rolling over the border." Europe and the United States are firmly resolved to maintain their pressure on Russia, in support of Ukraine, he said. In what may be another retaliatory move, Russia's federal consumer rights protection service banned all confectionery imports from Ukraine, Russian state news agency ITAR-Tass reported Friday.
