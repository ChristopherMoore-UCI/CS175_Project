Mayweather was sentenced to a 90-day prison term after being found of domestic violence, however a judge in Nevada ruled last week that the Mayweather could postpone reporting to jail until June because he had already lined up a fight date in May. Mayweather faces jail for domestic violence Last year, Pacquiao filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Las Vegas for defamation against Mayweather and others for allegedly claiming he had used performance-enhancing drugs. And Filipino broadcaster ABS-CBN reported that Pacquiao's adviser Michael Koncz said late May was preferable so that a temporary outdoor stadium could be constructed in Las Vegas to maximize revenue from the showdown. With a November date, he can still do a lot of training in jail." U.S. boxer Floyd Mayweather Jnr took to his Twitter account this week to throw down the gauntlet to Manny Pacquiao, calling on his arch-rival from the Philippines to "step up punk" for a May 5 fight.
