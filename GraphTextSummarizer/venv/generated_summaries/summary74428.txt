As of now, nearly half of New York City voters don't think Weiner should run for mayor this year, according to a new poll. According to a Quinnipiac University survey, which was conducted in the week before Weiner's announcement and released Wednesday, 49% of New York City voters said Weiner should not run for mayor, with 38% saying he should make a bid and 12% unsure. "When you have someone as skillful as a messenger as Anthony, that makes a big difference in a race where TV ad spending is limited due to New York City election laws and the fact that it's the most expensive media market in county," adds the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. Anthony definitely has a shot," says a Democratic strategist who's worked in New York City politics. Weiner talked about his controversy in a video that went up online early Wednesday where he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City.
