The association said competitive bidding will "increase Medicare costs because it will lead to longer, more expensive hospital stays." Congress sets the rates Medicare pays and Congress determined that wheelchairs should be billed on a monthly rate for 13 months -- the renter has to pay 20 percent of the costs. So CNN loaded its wheelchair onto a Delta 757 to Washington and rolled it through the halls of Congress to find out why any representative -- not to mention 84 of them (the number who signed an April letter asking that competitive bidding be put on hold once again) would object to a plan that Medicare maintains will save taxpayer money. CNN went to the same company that charges Medicare for Brown's chair, Apria Healthcare, and bought it for $349 -- about a fourth of what taxpayers' have paid for Brown's rented wheelchair. When CNN asked Apria why it rented wheelchairs to the government for $1,200, but sold it to us for $349, the company said it was an "honest, unfortunate mistake."
