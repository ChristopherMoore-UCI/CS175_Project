French warplanes pounded Islamist militant targets in Mali Thursday as international efforts to help the African nation's government fight insurgents gained momentum. By this weekend, U.S. trainers will be in Africa "to offer pre-deployment training and sustainment packages" for troops from African nations who are heading to Mali.

The United States is supporting the French-led effort in Mali "with intelligence and airlift," said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
