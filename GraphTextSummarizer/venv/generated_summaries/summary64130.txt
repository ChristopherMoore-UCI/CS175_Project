The deputy commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan ordered troops Friday to treat the corpses of slain insurgents and civilians with "appropriate dignity and respect. The NCIS investigation, which was opened Wednesday, will report to Lt. Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Central Command. "I condemn it in the strongest possible terms." Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos said that the behavior is "wholly inconsistent with the high standards of conduct and warrior ethos that we have demonstrated throughout our history. The investigations are being structured to allow for possible courts martial of the Marines involved, as well as a broader administrative probe into issues surrounding the event, according to a Marine Corps official. The Marine Corps confirmed Waldhauser's appointment in a statement, in which it also said it was confident "an expeditious, full and fair investigation will be conducted, and appropriate action will be taken in response to this incident."
