The National Weather Service said at least two EF-1 tornadoes struck Thursday, one of which damaged 50 homes in St. Martin Parish. St. Landry Parish spokeswoman Megan Vizena said 30% of the area was underwater. In Acadia Parish, rescuers saved close to 80 people from rising water, including 20 at an oil well. "The Mermentau River is well above flood stage and expected to go to major flood stage," he said. A third tornado, in Iberville Parish, was confirmed as well.
