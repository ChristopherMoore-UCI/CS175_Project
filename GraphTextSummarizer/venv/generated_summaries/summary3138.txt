The harsh rhetoric that the president has been directing at Republicans suggests that he is less interested in settlement than unconditional surrender. Seasoned GOP leaders across the country know that if the shutdown does serious damage, chances of Republicans picking up Senate seats in 2014 and the White House in 2016 could evaporate. Shutdowns are a lousy way to run a government. I have only two conditions: I will not accept a gutting of Obamacare -- we settled that at the ballot box in 2012 -- and any settlement here must include a pledge not to let the country go into default. When is Washington going to get serious about overhauling the entitlement programs so they will survive for coming generations?
