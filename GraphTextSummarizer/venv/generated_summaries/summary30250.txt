Just over a year later, a DeKalb County grand jury indicted her father, Keith Antonine Furlow, on felony murder and second-degree cruelty to children, according to the court document filed Thursday. The district attorney explained Friday that Furlow is being charged with felony murder because he is accused of killing his daughter while committing child cruelty. James earlier told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB that authorities don't see any way the baby could have consumed the vodka, unless it was given to her by the now 20-year-old Furlow. The latter charge states that Furlow, "with criminal negligence, caused ... cruel and excessive physical pain by feeding a four month old an alcoholic beverage," according to the indictment. -- A North Georgia man is charged with murder after authorities say he put vodka in his 4-month-old's baby bottle, leading to her death -- an incident that his public defender says was an accident.
