Casey Anthony was arrested October 14 in a traffic stop after a grand jury indicted her on seven counts of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and four counts of providing false information to police. Casey's brother, Lee Anthony, also pleaded with his sister to tell him where Caylee was, according to police documents. When questioned, Casey Anthony gave conflicting statements to police, including some that were later disproved, accounting for the charges of providing false information. She claimed that she dropped Caylee off with a baby-sitter, but when police checked out her story, they learned that the address Casey Anthony supplied belonged to an apartment that had been vacant for weeks. The woman Casey Anthony named as her baby-sitter told police she did not know her.
