Another electric car that a law enforcement force might be happy to have in its fleet is BMW's Electric MINI, which has been styled by German tuning company, AC Schnitzer. Police departments all over the world are embracing all manner of electric vehicles, recognizing their duty of care to the environment as well as to the citizens of the streets they patrol. The three-wheel stand-up bike has proved popular not only with police forces but also with security companies and the military. The three-wheeled remotely controlled electric vehicle is aimed at helping police in high-speed chases, not only to reduce the amount of manpower needed to catch criminals, but also to cut down injuries and fatalities that pursuits cause. The Zero DS motorcycle is part trail, part road bike and has a top speed of 55 miles per hour, which might not make it so useful in a high-speed pursuit.
