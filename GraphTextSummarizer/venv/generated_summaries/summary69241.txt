If they wish, soda drinkers can buy a 2-liter bottle of soda at the grocery for about $1.70 and pour as much of it down their throats as they wish. Americans drink more soda for the very simple reason: it's getting cheaper. Sugary drinks now provide 7% of the calories in the American diet, the largest single national source of calories. But if a restraint on soda serving size will not do everything, it may still do something. Teen boys average more than a quart of sugary soda per day.
