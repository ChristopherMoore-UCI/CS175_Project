"We hope President Carter will urge the Cuban government to immediately release Mr. Gross on humanitarian grounds," she told CNN. On Monday afternoon, he met with Jewish leaders and the archbishop of Havana, Cardinal Jaime Ortega. But expectations are high that Carter also will work behind the scenes to secure the release of American contractor Alan Gross, who was recently sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban prison. -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, landed in Havana on Monday for a private visit aimed at reducing tension between the Cold War enemies and seeing first-hand the economic reforms sweeping the communist island. Carter declined to comment Monday when reporters asked him about Gross, shouting, "There will be a press conference later."
