We need to show young Muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to. To fight extremism, we need to pose this question to young Muslims: "Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith?" Understanding what leads young Muslims like Dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization. Thanks to social media, a medium that the world's burgeoning young Muslim population is increasingly comfortable with, more Muslims can and will see this, too. Before my time, the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims.
