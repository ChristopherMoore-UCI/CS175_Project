Chromeless, fullscreen app experiences Windows 8 also innovates with a unique, tablet-optimized approach that eliminates distracting "chrome" â€” in other words, all those busy interface elements that can junk up a desktop or app interface. But in Windows 8, switching between open apps is much more intuitive and easy: A swipe from the left edge of the device will immediately pull up the last app you used (assuming it's still open in a multitasking state). But iOS 5 for iPad also lets you swipe from open app to open app, much like the method in Windows 8. It's not an insanely revolutionary feature, but little UI nuances like this make Windows 8 so appealing in total. In Windows 8, however, you'll find a happy medium between the tidy organization that iOS provides, and the freedom and utility of the Android home screen.
