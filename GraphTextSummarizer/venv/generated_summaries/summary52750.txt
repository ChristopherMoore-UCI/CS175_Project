Garrido has been appointed despite "The Yellow Submarine" being linked with former Getafe coach Michael Laudrup, with the team 10th in La Liga after last year's impressive fifth placing and having been knocked out of the Copa Del Rey by second division Celta Vigo. Reserve-team coach Onesimo Sanchez takes over a team who have won just three times in the last 31 league outings, with the announcement made as Valladolid unveiled new loan signing Asier del Horno. -- Spanish club Villarreal will wait until the end of this season to appoint a permanent new manager after deciding to give reserve coach Juan Carlos Garrido the reins on a short-term basis. Meanwhile, struggling Real Valladolid sacked coach Jose Luis Mendilibar on Monday, making him the seventh managerial casualty of the Spanish top-flight season. The 48-year-old had kept the club in La Liga for two seasons after a record-breaking promotion-winning campaign, but Sunday night's 1-1 draw with lowly Almeria left his team just one point above the relegation zone.
