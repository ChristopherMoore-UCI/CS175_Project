" Schulz -- along with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy -- accepted the award on the EU's behalf Monday, with the massacre of July 2011 already on his mind. "We had a culture of literature and philosophy and mathematics," he said, "And we had a culture of extermination at Auschwitz." Schulz said that Norway, a nation proud of its liberal, peaceful and tolerant traditions, offered an avenue of hope "The reaction of the Norwegian society, to say our answer to the gunman is more democracy, more respect and to fight more for our values - that was the right answer, a good example for the whole world." But with the Nobel Prize for the EU and the the massacre at Utoya, Norway finds itself close to both Europe's best intentions and some of the worst instincts in European history. Utoya Island has dropped from the headlines, but it remains fresh in the memory of many, including one of the European Union leaders who received the Nobel prize, as the site of Norway's worst mass murder since World War II. In confusion that followed, the anti-immigrant extremist who detonated the bomb drove roughly 45 minutes to a ferry that took him to Utoya, the scene of an annual summer camp for young members of Norway's Labor Party.
