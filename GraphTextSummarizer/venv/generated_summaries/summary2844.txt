On July 11, 2006, a series of seven explosions killed at least 174 people on crowded Mumbai commuter trains and stations. "The sound was absolutely deafening," said Hemant Mehta who was in the Opera House area, near a diamond market that serves as a small epicenter of the city's economy. "Security systems do not inspire confidence," said textiles trader Puneet Kumar. Thursday morning, as authorities tried to piece together the latest tragedy, daily life in Mumbai's unaffected areas resumed as usual -- millions of people rushing to schools, jobs, train stations. " Chidambaram said the attack was aimed squarely at India. The three blasts Wednesday evening occurred within minutes of each other in the areas of Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar and Dadar, all busy commercial hubs teeming with people.
