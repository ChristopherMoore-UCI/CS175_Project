"The defendant ... then became angry that [Gjika] had the last booster seat and made the comment, 'But we were here first,' " the report said She then became loud and abusive to the woman, the report said, shouting profanity at her and at one point saying, "I am Dr. Amy Bishop." Bishop was asked to stop using profanity, but continued to verbally abuse the woman, becoming so loud that she was heard throughout the restaurant, police said. Authorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986. It was the latest incident to surface involving Amy Bishop, a biology professor who is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in the shootings at the University of Alabama in Huntsville last week. Bishop was charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct, police said. The defendant Amy Bishop then also asked the waitress for a booster seat but Amy was told by the waitress that there were no more booster seats.
