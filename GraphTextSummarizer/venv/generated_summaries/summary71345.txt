-- It was a fitting end to a remarkable era -- Alex Ferguson celebrated his final home game as manager of Manchester United with a dramatic late victory against Swansea on Sunday. Newcastle and Norwich both won on Sunday to ensure another season in the top flight, respectively beating bottom club Queens Park Rangers 2-1 and eighth-placed West Brom 4-0. He will begin preparations for United's title defense when he formally takes over in July, with Ferguson's legacy being 13 league championships, two European Cups, five FA Cups, four League Cups, one European Cup Winners' Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. The win put United 13 points clear of City ahead of Ferguson's 1,500th and final United game away to West Brom next Sunday. City's season suffered another setback on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat to lowly Wigan in the FA Cup final, which has sparked speculation that manager Roberto Mancini will be sacked.
