-- British girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished during a 2007 family vacation in Portugal, may still be alive, UK authorities said Wednesday. "As a result of evidence uncovered during the review, they now believe there is a possibility Madeleine is still alive and are appealing for anyone who is able to provide direct information as to her whereabouts to contact the team," police said in a statement, without disclosing any details on the possibility of new leads. Last year, a report of a girl bearing a resemblance to the child created a spike on social media. The investigation is split equally down two lines -- one assuming that Madeleine is dead, the other that she is alive, police said. Timeline of the case An investigative review formed in May last year has been going through details from the case.
