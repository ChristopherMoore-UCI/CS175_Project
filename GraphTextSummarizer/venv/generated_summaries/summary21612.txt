But on the first day of Jordan's sensational second-degree murder trial -- expected to last months -- defense attorney Allan Brenner painted a starkly different portrait. "He knew that Jude was her soft spot." Jordan "believed he was going to kill her, leaving a sexual predator to exercise his paternal rights," Brenner told the jury. Jordan believed that if she died, Jude's biological father -- a yoga instructor and undocumented immigrant who Jordan said she married to help him get a green card -- would get custody, according to Brenner. Jordan first learned that Jude had been sexually abused in December 2007, Brenner said. After being interviewed by him for 30 minutes, Brenner said, Jordan was accused of being unfit and delusional, taken to a medical facility and separated from her son for several months before being reunited with the boy.
