As we mark National HIV Testing Day on Saturday, I strongly encourage all Americans to get tested for HIV. Put simply, HIV testing saves lives. By increasing the number of people who know their HIV status, we can decrease the number of new HIV infections, and help save thousands of lives. Increased HIV testing will make it possible to significantly reduce the number of new infections. That's more than 200,000 Americans who may be transmitting the virus to others without knowing it, and who can't take advantage of HIV treatments that could prolong and improve the quality of their lives.
