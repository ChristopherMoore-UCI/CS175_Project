"It is difficult to get a clear picture, but there have been spikes in radiation to enormous doses, high enough to risk radiation sickness," said Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the organization Physicians for Social Responsibility. Exposure to 1,000 millisieverts (1 Sievert) of radiation can cause radiation sickness. Thousands of people living near the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been evacuated from their homes because of the risk of radiation leaks from reactors damaged by last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami. "There is at least fragmentary evidence that in some places on this site there are life-threatening doses of radiation. According to the World Health Organisation, the average person is exposed to about 3.0 millisieverts (mSv) a year of radiation, from naturally-occurring, medical and other sources.
