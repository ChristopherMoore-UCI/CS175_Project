Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, warned Tuesday that if the House wanted quick Senate action on that aid, it should pass the Senate's version of it. With bipartisan support earlier this summer, the Senate passed its own five-year farm bill that includes disaster assistance for livestock farmers and ranchers. But House Republicans decided Wednesday they would pass their own language and then leave it to the Senate. But with mounting pressure from drought-stricken livestock producers, the House decided at the last minute to extend disaster aid just for them before leaving town. A Senate Democratic leadership aide tells CNN that the Senate is "unlikely" to take up an aid bill that the House plans to pass Thursday before lawmakers dash out of town for a five-week break.
