-- Thousands of people gathered Tuesday in Marrowbone, Kentucky, to lay to rest nine people who were killed in a crash in central Kentucky last week. He died while on a mission trip in the Ukraine three years ago, Leroy Kauffman said last week. Four of the couple's children -- Leroy, Rachel, Rose and Anna -- were also killed, according to the Rev. Leroy Kauffman with the Marrowbone Christian Brotherhood. The family was traveling to the wedding of a woman who was on the mission trip with Johnny, Leroy Kauffman said. "The amount of people who came is overwhelming to say the least," Kauffman said.
