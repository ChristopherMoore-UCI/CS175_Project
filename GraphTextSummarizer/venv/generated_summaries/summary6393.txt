Garizabalo faces seven charges following the May 10 incident at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station. The post, signed by six members of the troupe, said Garizabalo described to them being in a play at the train station on May 10. The 24-year-old man accused of attacking commuters while naked at a San Francisco subway station proclaimed he is not guilty Tuesday. According to the San Francisco District Attorney's office, Yeiner Garizabalo waived his arraignment and entered not guilty pleas. He now stands accused of two felony counts of false imprisonment, four misdemeanor counts of battery and one misdemeanor count of sexual battery in the incident, said Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the District Attorney's office.
