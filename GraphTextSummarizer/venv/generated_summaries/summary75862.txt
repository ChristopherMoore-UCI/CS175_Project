U.S. star Serena Williams plays glamorous Russian ace Maria Sharapova in a battle of world number ones present and past, while Texas-based Andy Roddick takes on fellow big-serving American John Isner in the men's match-up. It has already hosted soccer, this year's NBA All-Star game and world title boxing as Filipino sensation Manny Pacquiao beat Ghana's Joshua Clottey earlier this year. Williams took the women's singles title last year and Sharapova won in 2004, while Roddick suffered a heartbreaking five-set loss to Federer last year. He will be action on July 10, just six days after the men's final at Wimbledon in England, where last year he lost an epic title match to Roger Federer. But next month some of the sport's top players will grace a new stage: the glittering $1.2 billion Cowboys Stadium in Dallas, which hosts Super Bowl XLV next year.
