President Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah into the United States, with much hesitation, and the Iranians were outraged. Even though the United States and Iran had come to an agreement to free the hostages in December, the Iranians waited literally until the hour President Reagan was sworn in before allowing the plane with the hostages to take off. Ted Koppel described this as the Iranians' last act of cruelty toward President Carter. Iranians felt the United States meddled too much in Iran's internal affairs, and were afraid the CIA was plotting to return the Shah to power. Many felt they were left unprotected in the embassy after Carter made the decision to allow the Shah into the United States.
