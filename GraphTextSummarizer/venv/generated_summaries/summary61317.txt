Simon and Modestini then called in da Vinci experts from all over the world to further verify the painting. " It's a discovery so rare, so unlikely, that when New York art dealer and da Vinci expert Robert Simon of Robert Simon Fine Art first saw the painting, he didn't even consider the possibility. "Salvator Mundi" is going on public display in London in November, as part of the exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: That's why initially, Simon and Dianne Dwyer Modestini (Senior Research Fellow and Paintings Conservator for the Samuel H. Kress Program at the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University), thought the painting was by one of Leonardo's associates or pupils -- a fact which, in itself, would have made the work extremely precious and very valuable. " The truth revealed itself little-by-little as Modestini painstakingly removed the layers of varnish and over-paint in her studio and Simon carefully studied the painting's provenance, comparing it with da Vinci's other paintings and preparatory drawings.
