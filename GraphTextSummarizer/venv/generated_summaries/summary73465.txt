Some wedding guests noticed tension between the couple almost immediately after each said "I do," said Vigo County Sheriff Chief Deputy Clark Cottom. Samson's body was found near his gun safe, where he had earlier removed other weapons, said Cottom. In addition to the male, two other people were found in home: Ecker's 10-year old-son was in the bedroom where his mother's body was found, and he was unharmed, Cottom said. Cottom said several dozen of them had been removed. By the third call, at 1:27 a.m., Cottom said it's clear the situation has escalated because the caller's voice is in more distress.
