"Buy Nothing Day highlights the environmental and ethical consequences of consumerism." "Singles Day" is China's version of Valentine's Day for people without romantic partners who treat each other to dinners and gifts bought online. -- As "Black Friday" follows Thanksgiving in the United States, "White Day" follows Valentines Day in Japan.
