What Leviathan discovered probably should concern Android app developers and Google, rather than consumers who use Android phones and tablets. The best practice is still to notice which permissions apps require before installing them, don't install apps that seem to require too many permissions, and report to the developer any suspicious activity by an app. "What this research found is really little cracks in Android -- not great big security holes you could drive a truck through," said Kevin Mahaffey, co-founder and chief technical officer of Lookout Mobile Security, a leading provider of security apps and services for Android devices. -- Savvy Android users tend to be wary of installing apps that request seemingly unnecessary permissions. " For instance, developers sometimes build apps that store user data (such as usernames and passwords) in ways that could be easily accessed through the security cracks Leviathan found.
