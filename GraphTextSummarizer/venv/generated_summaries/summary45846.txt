Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Juan M. Garcia III will offer remarks on Monday afternoon to commemorate the occasion, the release says. The NROTC program educates and trains young men and women for leadership positions in the Navy and Marine Corps, the Navy's statement said. -- Columbia University will welcome back the U.S. Navy and a new class for the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps on Monday after a more than 40-year absence, according to a news release from the Naval Service Training Command. The repeal "provided a historic opportunity for our nation to live up to its ideals of equality and also for universities to reconsider their relationships with the military," Bollinger said upon announcing the reinstatement in 2011. "Columbia is proud of our record of welcoming a sizable student veteran population in recent years," a statement from the university says.
