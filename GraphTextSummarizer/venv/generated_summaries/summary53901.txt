Hotels have to recoup costs Others contended that hotels are well within their rights to charge for the costs they incur for for providing internet services to their guests. Overcharging is getting old Another popular theme to arise was that hotels that charge for internet access are damaging their own commercial prospects when others are providing the same services for free. Some of you were adamant that hotel Wi-Fi should always be free: You get what you pay for While some respondents were near evangelical in their demands for free web access, others said they were quite happy to pay for the internet as long as the price was reasonable and commensurate with the service received. Individual hotel policies on internet access and pricing are almost as divergent as the opinions the subject creates. Others said that the cost of installing and maintaining a reliable wireless network for use by hundreds of people at a time comes with extensive costs that hotels must recoup through user charges.
