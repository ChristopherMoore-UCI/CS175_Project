"We are looking into every possible motive," Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Ramon Villaraigosa said. The two men, who have not been identified, are in stable condition at separate hospitals, said Deputy Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department. "We have eliminated no one and that includes the teenager who was detained," said Lt. Alan Hamilton. Authorities had interviewed the victims, said Jorge Villegas, assistant commander for the Los Angeles Police Department. Moore said the two victims, ages 38 and 53, arrived at the synagogue's parking garage in separate vehicles.
