In sharing great music, great food and great fun, a tradition was born: Record Party. Many record stores have used records, which can save you some money. From bottom of the line models to high-end turntables, you wouldn't believe how many people have record players. This is always most fun with close friends who have similar tastes in music. But part of the fun is also learning about new music, so you may want to require guests to bring some records of their own.
