In other words, whatever the reality of what happened to Jackie, Goldberg and others were skeptical because they simply don't believe rapes like that happen with the participation of groups of assailants, let alone the complicity of bystanders. And while we don't know whether something terrible happened to Jackie, it would be truly tragic if we let this incident cast doubt on all allegations of rape and sexual assault. Instead, Goldberg insisted, Jackie's account was "a convenient conversation for an expos√© of rape culture," something, incidentally, Goldberg also doubts to be real. Today the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics released a new report showing that 80% of college rapes and sexual assaults go unreported to police, and 67% of such attacks by non-students go unreported. When feminists raise our voices about rape and sexual assault, we aren't cheering on victimhood.
