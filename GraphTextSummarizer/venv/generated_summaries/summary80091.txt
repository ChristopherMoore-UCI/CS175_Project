In the pool, Kylie Palmer swam to gold for Australia in women's 200 meter freestyle ahead of Jazz Carlin, who secured Wales' first medal since 1974, while England's double Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington stook bronze. South Africa's Chad Le Clos set a new Games record as he pipped England's Michael Rock to gold in the men's 200m butterfly while Canada's Ryan Cochrane beat Australia's Ryan Napoleon by 11 hundredths of a second to claim the 400m freestyle. It's the first time India has hosted the competition between countries of the former British Empire and the build-up was dominated by negative headlines about the cleanliness of the athlete's village as well as poor construction. In the men's 56kg category Malaysia's Amirul Hamizan Ibrahim took gold ahead of Sukhen Dey and Srinivasa Rao of India. Away from the pool Australia also proved too good for the rest of the field in the artistic gymnastics team competition, as they finished three points clear of England to take gold.
