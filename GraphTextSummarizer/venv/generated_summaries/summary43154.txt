But Ivory Coast should have had a second through Wilfried Bony and go through as group winners to face Algeria in the last eight -- perhaps to the frustration of Premier League managers, with stars like Bony, Yaya Toure, Kolo Toure and Cheick Tiote still wrapped up in the Cup. Algeria now represents one of the competition's toughest tests for a generation of Ivory Coast players who have failed to deliver a major trophy despite their promise -- coming only as close as the final of the 2012 Cup of Nations final in 2012, where they lost to Zambia. Cameroon coach Volker Finke, criticized for his selection of inexperienced players at the tournament, threw on Lyon striker Clinton N'Jie in a bid to wrest control of the game. The Saint-Etienne forward guided Ivory Coast past Cameroon with a 20-yard first-half strike that evaded goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa. Ten of the 24 Cup of Nations games played to date at this tournament have now ended 1-1.
