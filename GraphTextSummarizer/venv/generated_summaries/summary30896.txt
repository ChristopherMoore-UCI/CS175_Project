With the 2014 World Cup in Brazil due to start Thursday, FIFA officials have been gathering in the South American country for their annual Congress in Sao Paulo between June 9 and 12. FIFA was under growing pressure Sunday after one of its key sponsors demanded an investigation into corruption allegations published in a British newspaper over the controversial award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Qatar World Cup organizers have continually denied that bin Hammam had any official or unofficial role in the bidding process and remain confident that they will not lose the rights to stage the competition. "We expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately, and continue to expect FIFA to adhere to its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations," Sony said in a statement to CNN. In its second batch of reports, Britain's Sunday Times made a series of new revelations, centered on the role of Qatar's former top football official Mohammed bin Hammam, in the nation's bid to stage the global showpiece.
