Districts are supposed to be redrawn to reflect population changes and to make sure there is equal representation in the House. Lawmakers have been accused of carving district lines around the constituents that will give their party an advantage and secure political gains. Districts can affect the balance of power in the House and representation in the state legislature. When data from the census show a shift in population, seats in the House get reassigned. Now, do I think overtime creating districts so incumbents are always re-elected is the healthiest way to have a democracy?
