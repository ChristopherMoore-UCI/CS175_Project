" Blatter was in similarly defiant mood at an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) meeting -- also in Sao Paulo -- despite many of FIFA's corporate partners, such as electronics giant Sony, calling for an investigation into corruption allegations. A strike by subway workers in Sao Paulo on Monday caused chaos in the city which will host Brazil's first match against Croatia. The game's global governing body FIFA has faced a slew of corruption allegations over the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, most recently claims that bribes were paid to Caribbean, Asian and African officials in order to secure Qatar the right to host the latter tournament.
