"A bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart, that's the evidence that will prove to you that defendant Stephanie Lazarus murdered Sherri Rasmussen," Deputy District Attorney Shannon Presby told jurors as an unusual criminal trial began this week in Los Angeles Superior Court. Ruetten did care for Lazarus, Presby continued, but in his view they were just good friends -- with occasional "benefits. " A key part of the case involves a confrontation between Lazarus and Rasmussen at the hospital where Rasmussen worked, but Overland insisted his client was no stalker. Lazarus had taken the day off; Rasmussen had called in sick that morning. Tests revealed the DNA found in the bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm belonged to Lazarus.
