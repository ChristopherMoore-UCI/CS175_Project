Before Asimov, most robot stories followed a similar pattern: Scientists create robot; robot goes haywire and attacks its creators. But they are also credited with helping create the "lovable" robot in science fiction: an archetype popularized in TV and movies, from "Lost in Space" to "Star Wars" to "Short Circuit." Robby the Robot Robby made his first appearance in the 1956 movie "Forbidden Planet." It's hard to argue anyone did more to propel robots from hardcore science fiction into the wider public consciousness than these two when they hit the screen in 1977. From robots you can buy right now to the ones invading the work force to tech giant Google's move into military robotics, our automated friends are no longer just the stuff of science-fiction double features. So, as we ponder the real-world arrival of robots in our midst -- delivery drones, self-driving cars -- it's worth taking a look at 10 of the most influential robots from pop culture that helped inspire us along the way.
