The Ecuadorian president said the United Kingdom would be "suicidal" to come into Ecuador's embassy in London, where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been holed up since June. Standoff at embassy, after Ecuador grants asylum Opinion: Assange's stubborn grip hurt WikiLeaks Why Assange needs Ecuador and why Ecuador needs Assange Last week, Ecuador officially offered Assange asylum in the South American country, but the British say they will not give him safe passage out of the embassy. "The U.S. war on whistle-blowers must end," he said, calling for the freedom of Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier suspected of giving hundreds of thousands of pages of secret American government documents to Assange for publication on WikiLeaks. UNASUR backed Ecuador's decision to grant Assange asylum and called for more dialogue between Britain and Ecuador on the issue.
