A statement on FIFA's website explained: "These services include the provision of coaching classes for local football clubs for youth and adult players; involvement in and support of football for those with disabilities; and the support of ongoing and future domestic anti-match-fixing activities. These latest sanctions add to a further 10 worldwide bans imposed on players from Korea in June last year. -- FIFA has imposed a worldwide lifetime ban from football on 41 players from Korea who became embroiled in match-fixing activities in their domestic league. The charges relate to match-fixing in Korea's domestic K-League competition and in all but one case were centered on offering or accepting bribes to throw matches. Napoli were hit with a two-point penalty that dropped them from third to fifth in Serie A as part of the ongoing probe, though they vehemently denied any wrongdoing.
