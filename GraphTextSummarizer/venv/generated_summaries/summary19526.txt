The club, who have just claimed their 20th Premier League title, reported a 52.2% increase in sponsorship revenue having announced new deals with two financial services providers in Denmark and Vietnam as well as an agreement with a Japanese social gaming company. The drive for sponsorship revenue comes at a time when United is seeking to bring in new players for the 2013/14 season in September, as the team prepares to defend its domestic title and attempt to win the European Cup for fourth time. Earlier this week, manager Alex Ferguson promised the club would be "competitive" in the summer transfer market as they hope to rival other title contenders such as Manchester City and Chelsea.
