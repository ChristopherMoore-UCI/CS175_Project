Alexander Rybak of Norway performs during the final of the Eurovision Song Contest Saturday in Moscow, Russia. This year the contest was televised from a packed stadium in Moscow, Russia. The protesters wanted to draw attention to what they call widespread discrimination of gays in Russia. On Saturday night Rybak beat out contestants from 42 countries, with singers from Iceland and Azerbaijan taking distant second and third places.
