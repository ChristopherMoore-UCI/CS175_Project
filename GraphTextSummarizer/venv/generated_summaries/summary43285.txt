Visiting Spurs moved up to fourth, on goal difference behind Liverpool and Chelsea, and five points adrift of London rival Arsenal. The victory put Atletico a point behind the unbeaten champion and five clear of third-placed city rival Real Madrid, which struggled to a 3-2 win over bottom club Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Inter Milan reclaimed fourth place with a 3-0 win at Udinese that kept Walter Mazzarri's team above Verona on goal difference. The capital club, seeking a first title since 2001 under the guidance of new French coach Rudi Garcia, seemed on course for another routine win when Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman fired a 28th-minute opener. The result left league leader Roma three points clear of Juve and Napoli, who both won on Saturday.
