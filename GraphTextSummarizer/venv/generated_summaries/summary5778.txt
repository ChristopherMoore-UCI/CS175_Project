Reprieve said the men are also being tried in military courts, in violation of Congo's constitution, which says such courts may only handle cases involving the military or police. Reprieve said prosecution evidence includes photographs of two guns alleged to have been found on Moland's computer, but both guns have been traced to Norway and have never left Norway. Norwegian authorities deny that the two men, who are former soldiers, were ever involved in spying for Norway, Reprieve said. The two men traveled into Congo from Uganda on a motorbike trip in April 2009, Reprieve said. Reprieve said there is no physical evidence against the men and the two witnesses who testified against them were given large sums of money in compensation and have changed their stories "countless" times.
