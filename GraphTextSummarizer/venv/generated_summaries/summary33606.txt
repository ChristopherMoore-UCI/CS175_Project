Adler said he believes as more publishers make eBooks available to libraries, the companies will limit the number of times most books can be loaned out. Publishing companies call that wait "friction" and it's why they're comfortable with libraries lending physical books for free. He hopes that more publishing companies will see the benefit in making eBooks available to public libraries with mutually beneficial arrangements. It may not be surprising, then, that while more people are borrowing eBooks from libraries, more people are also going to libraries. "Our usage is going up as well," said Platt as he pointed out that New York libraries loaned more than 28 million items in 2010.
