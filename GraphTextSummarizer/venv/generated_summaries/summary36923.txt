However, when there is an unanticipated event like an earthquake or tsunami, Japanese leaders cannot cope well. Japanese Parliament's new report on the Fukushima nuclear crisis stated that the "fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to sticking with the program." Japanese companies are known to be indecisive, always taking a long time to reach any conclusion. Japanese workers are extremely obedient, hard-working and loyal to their group. Many Japanese scandals in the past have been the result of this type of behavior.
