According to a new CNN/ORC International poll, seven in 10 Americans believe ISIS has the resources to launch an attack against the U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, the GOP Senate nominee who's challenging Udall, lambasted Udall's comments from the debate, saying "it's outrageous that Senator Udall would put words into the mouths of dead Americans." Sen. Mark Udall apologized Monday for saying that the two beheaded U.S. journalists would agree the U.S. shouldn't "be impulsive" in dealing with ISIS. " Answering critics, Udall said in his statement Monday "these terrorists are a serious threat to U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East, and Americans are counting on their leaders to get this right." Garner also hit Udall for not viewing ISIS as "an imminent threat to America. The two men were executed in the past month, with their ISIS killers vowing to do more harm if the U.S. maintained its targeted air strikes against the militant group.
