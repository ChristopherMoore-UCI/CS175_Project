Ronaldo, fresh from helping Madrid lift FIFA's Club World Cup in Morocco on Saturday, was in Funchal just 24 hours later to unite with his family for the statue's official unveiling. The "CR7 Museum" -- opened in December 2013 in the Real Madrid attacker's hometown of Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira -- houses more than 125 awards, including the two Ballon d'Or titles he won in 2008 and 2013 after being voted the world's best player. Ronaldo, who has scored 34 goals in 27 games for club and country this season, is favorite to land the 2014 Ballon d'Or ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer, with the result being announced on January 12, 2015. The 29-year-old has enjoyed a 2014 to remember, having helped Madrid lift the European Champions League, European Super Cup and Spanish Copa del Rey, as well as the Club World Cup. While in Funchal, Ronaldo also found time to receive the "Cordão Autonómico de Distinção" -- the highest distinction of Madeira.
