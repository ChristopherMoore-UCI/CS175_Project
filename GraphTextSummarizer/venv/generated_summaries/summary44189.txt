I don't know why performance-capture moviemaking -- the kind pioneered in "The Polar Express" and "A Christmas Carol" by Robert Zemeckis, who also produced "Mars Needs Moms" -- hasn't received more applause. In a parallel universe, "Mars Needs Moms" is a great, jaunty adventure about an unruly kid named Milo (Seth Green, the right guy for the job) who had no plans to go to Mars but finds himself there anyway. Enhanced by nimble ad-libbing from the comedy-trained cast, the screenplay is delightful, by turns funny and emotional, as befits a Disney family fable in which, through wacky adversity, Mom and kid reaffirm their love for each other while Dad is nowhere in sight.
