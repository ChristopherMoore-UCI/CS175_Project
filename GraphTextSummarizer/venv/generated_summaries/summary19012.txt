Kidd's logic squares with the numbers: While industries such as manufacturing have had decreasing job openings, there continues to be a deep need for health care positions such as nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists and primary-care physicians. Employment for physician assistants is projected to grow much faster than average because health care institutions increasingly use these practitioners to contain costs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of May 2007, a registered nurse in the United States earned on average $62,480 per year, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. For anyone interested in changing careers to health care, experts recommend exploring courses at local community colleges and vocational schools. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that 9 percent of Americans think health care is the most important issue facing the country.
