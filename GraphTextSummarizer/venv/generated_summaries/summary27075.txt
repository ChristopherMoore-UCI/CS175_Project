Scientists from NASA hope that rubber ducks will help them better understand glacier movements. One theory is that the summer sun melts ice on the surface of the glacier which creates pools of water which then flow into moulins -- narrow tubular shafts in the glacier. It's not the first time rubber ducks have helped scientists track water flows. Alberto Behar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California told Reuters: "We haven't heard back but it may take some time until somebody actually finds it and decides to send us an e-mail that they have found it." In the name of climate change science, researchers at NASA have dropped 90 rubber ducks into holes of Greenland's fastest moving glacier: the Jakobshavn Glacier in Baffin Bay.
