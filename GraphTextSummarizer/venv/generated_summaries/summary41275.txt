West Ham originally won the right to move into the stadium in February, beating off competition from rival London club Tottenham Hotspur, after their bid received the unanimous backing of the OPLC. The British government announced the stadium, which is located in the Stratford area of east London and has the capacity to hold 80,000 spectators, will be kept in public ownership and rented out to a suitable tenant. The latest development also secures the future of the stadium as an athletics venue, with London bidding to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships. "The government and mayor of London have decided to end the current process to dispose of the Olympic stadium," read a statement on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's website. Another contributing factor is the time London would need to prepare for hosting the 2017 athletics showpiece, with Qatar also bidding to stage the championships in Doha.
