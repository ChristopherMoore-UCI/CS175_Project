"I've seen it happen pretty regularly when it comes to significant infectious disease circumstances," agency spokesman Tim Church said Tuesday when asked whether this was a unique approach to quelling a public health crisis before it starts. -- Washington state health officials have issued a warning to anyone who may have been in the vicinity of a particular woman at the end of March: You may have been exposed to measles, a highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory disease. The department says the woman became contagious with measles on March 26 after visiting a local family member with measles linked to an outbreak in British Columbia. On Friday, March 28, for example, after working from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the at the Lynden Dutch Bakery (home of the "world's best scones" according to its website"), she made a stop at Lynden Wine and Spirits before checking into the Best Western in downtown Seattle at 7:15 p.m. Church would not pinpoint when the woman was diagnosed, only that it occurred between March 29 and April 2, when the agency posted her schedule online.
