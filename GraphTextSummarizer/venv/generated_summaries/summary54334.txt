This official and others briefed reporters on further details about the assault on the compound, which they believe was built five years ago for the specific purpose of hiding bin Laden -- known by the code name "Geronimo," a U.S. official said. Bin Laden and his family lived on the second and third floors, and they were cleared last, with bin Laden killed in the last five or 10 minutes of the siege, the official said. A senior administration official said later that "Geronimo" was code for the act of capturing or killing bin Laden, not the man himself. After years of intelligence work and months of following a specific lead, they traced a courier linked to bin Laden to the compound in Abbottabad, the officials said. Months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom-built to hide a high-value terrorism suspect, almost certainly bin Laden.
