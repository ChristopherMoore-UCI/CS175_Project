Almost all roads in the Texas Panhandle were impassable Monday, and the state Department of Transportation pulled virtually all of its snowplows off roads because of whiteout conditions, Texas DOT spokesman Paul Braun said Monday morning. The Kansas Department of Transportation reported that many highways in the central part of the state, including Interstate 70, were completely covered by snow and ice on Monday morning. In Mobile, Alabama, on the Gulf Coast, residents prepared for the possibility of heavy rain and wind gusts as strong as 30 mph by Monday night. The powerful storm will move northeast through Oklahoma on Monday night, prompting blizzard warnings there. All flights in and out of Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport in Texas were canceled until noon on Monday.
