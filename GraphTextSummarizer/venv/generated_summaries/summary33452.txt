After Brown's death, police controversially issued documents alleging that he was a suspect in the theft of cigars from a convenience store shortly before he died, but he was not charged in that incident. -- The attorney for the family of slain Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown is coming down hard a local newspaper, accusing the St. Louis Post-Dispatch of reporting "gossip and racist speculation" instead of news surrounding the 18-year-old's death. However, Crump said the newspaper continued to press the case despite statements by police and in court that Brown was facing no charges. Attorney Benjamin Crump is upset about the newspaper's pursuit of juvenile records on Brown, accusing its reporters of failing to apply the same zeal to obtaining background information on the police officer who killed Brown, Darren Wilson. Brown died on August 9 in an encounter with Wilson that set off days of sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb.
