Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel sentenced Lohan to 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. After Lohan was taken to jail July 20, a sheriff's spokesman said her stay would likely last between 13 and 15 days. Revel ordered Lohan to enter a program within 24 hours of leaving jail. She said Lohan's next court date would come a week after her release from jail, although if she is in a rehab program her lawyer can appear without her.
