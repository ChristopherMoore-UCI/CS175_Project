" In the dense forest and woodlands of Gombe, chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior. But on the whole, probably their main enemy is something like me, humans," Collins continued. "(Some) people hunt chimps for eating, some places they get bits of chimps for cures, even witchcraft, and for a while there was a trade in baby chimps for their medical research and things like circuses and zoos. This has resulted in a huge number of trees being cut down that would otherwise offer shelter for communities of chimpanzees. Before the program began, chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat. These deep environmental connections are enough to convince some that chimpanzees are key to the future of rural Tanzania.
