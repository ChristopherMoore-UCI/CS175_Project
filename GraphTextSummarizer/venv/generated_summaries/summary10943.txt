As the Kagan nomination goes forward, White House officials have told me they expect no problems from civil rights groups. White House officials would quickly suggest that they are on excellent terms with the Rev. Al Sharpton, but this goes beyond him. One civil rights leader opined that President Obama is "losing his emotional connection with black leadership and black voters." Yet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for. But it has also opened another fissure in the complex relationship that exists between black organizational leaders and President Obama, the nation's first African-American president.
