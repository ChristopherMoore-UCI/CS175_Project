Though NSync hasn't released an album together since 2001's Celebrity, the five briefly reunited at 2013's VMAs to perform a medley of "Girlfriend" and "Bye Bye Bye." Some of those songs include "Believe in Yourself," which they performed on Sesame Street in 2000, and a cover of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight." Bass isn't the only NSync-er excited to hear what tracks are on this surprise album: Chris Kirkpatrick wrote "It's great to release some of the songs that had never made a record before!" on Twitter Tuesday. The group's label, Sony Legacy Records, released The Essential *NSYNC, a double album featuring NSync's hits as well as some rarer songs, Tuesdayâ€”and the band, evidently, had no idea.
