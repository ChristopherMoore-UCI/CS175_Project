The trial, in its seventh week, took a dramatic turn Wednesday when defense attorney Steve Sadow accused prosecutor Renee Rose of knowingly having Nadine Alexie, a former Smith nanny, lie on the stand. -- A key witness in the Anna Nicole Smith drug trial denied Wednesday that she was coached by the prosecutor on testimony the defense argued is false. On Wednesday, Alexie recanted an earlier statement that she had seen Stern melt pills in a soup spoon and then inject the drug into Smith during cross-examination Wednesday. Instead, Alexie said she only saw a spoon that appeared to be burned in Smith's bathroom. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor are on trial for allegedly conspiring to provide drugs to an addict and using false names on prescriptions for Smith.
