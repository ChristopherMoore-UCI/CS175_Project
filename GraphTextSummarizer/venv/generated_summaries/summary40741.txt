Tech companies including Apple and Google, and traditional home stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, are all pushing smart-home products as the next big thing. Internet-connected cameras like Dropcam are a popular alternative to full security systems, but images and videos stored in the cloud can be vulnerable to hackers. Mattisson saw that big companies were taking existing products like thermostats and refrigerators and adding Internet. "They want to have peace of mind and know that everything is fine, but they don't want or need full security systems," said Nils Mattisson, co-founder of Form Devices, the start-up that makes Point. He left the company last year to start Form with co-founders Marcus Ljungblad, Fredrik Ahlberg and Martin LÃ¶Ã¶f.
