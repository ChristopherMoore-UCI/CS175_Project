Noe Raygoza-Garcia, 33, was indicted Thursday and was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday, but because of "documentary snafu" was never transported from a prison in San Bernandino, California, said Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Carlo DiCesare. According to an affidavit from U.S. Border Patrol agent Kevin Legg, authorities were conducting anti-smuggling operations on March 17 in Fallbrook, California. -- A Tijuana, Mexico, police officer will appear in a U.S. federal court next week after being arrested on a charge of possession with intent to distribute almost 20 pounds of heroin and methamphetamine. Raygoza-Garcia further told agents that he was going to San Bernandino to visit his dying uncle, but when asked the location, he said he didn't know, according to the affidavit. The square ones tested positive for heroin and the misshapen ones tested positive for methamphetamine, the agents said in an affidavit.
