"Mr Gbagbo allegedly bears individual criminal responsibility, as indirect co-perpetrator, for four counts of crimes against humanity, namely murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and other inhuman acts," the international court said in a statement last year. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of both sides, leaving thousands dead. Gbagbo is accused of crimes against humanity after he rejected election results and refused to step down when current president,  Alassane Ouattara, was declared the winner in the 2010 poll. Authorities arrested Gbagbo in April last year, ending the standoff. The International Criminal Court postponed a key hearing in the case against Laurent Gbagbo, the former Ivory Coast president who is facing charges of crimes against humanity.
