Syrian refugees face brutal winter with inadequate shelter and food -- As the Syria conflict further escalates, refugees continue to cross borders to seek safety in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. Refugees who came in the summer months, did not come prepared to endure the harsh winter. Despite these dire conditions, refugee families offered me tea or to share their dinner. Mercy Corps will be distributing over 6,000 winter clothes and over 4,000 vouchers for winter clothes in Bekaa this month.
