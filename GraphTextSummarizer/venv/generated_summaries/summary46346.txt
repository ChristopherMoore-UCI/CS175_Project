It's not on the way to anything, which makes for special kinds of visitors, park ranger Lucas Westcott said. Michigan's Isle Royale, one of the few island national parks in the United States, is nestled in the northwest corner of Lake Superior, encompassing 850 square miles of road-less backcountry and water accessible only by a three-hour ferry ride or seaplane. The average stay is three to four days, compared with just a few hours in other national parks, Westcott said. The trail winds back and forth between forest and shoreline, offering stunning views of Scoville Lake, craggy bluffs and barrier islands. There's only one nine-mile trail that takes visitors there and back, but it's worth the journey for the gorgeous views of Siskiwit Lake, Westcott said.
