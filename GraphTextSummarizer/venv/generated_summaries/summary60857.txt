"Antibiotics are not always used in chicken production; rather, they are administered to prevent and treat disease, only under the care of a licensed veterinarian," said Ashley Peterson, National Chicken Council vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, in a statement. Chick-fil-A Inc. announced plans Tuesday to use chicken raised without antibiotics in all of its restaurants within five years. The company is also testing the possibility of taking out other food additives, including artificial ingredients in the buns and high fructose corn syrup in dressings and sauces. Many antibiotics that farmers give food-producing animals are also used to treat sick humans. A popular American fast food restaurant wants you to "Eat mor chikin" without antibiotics.
