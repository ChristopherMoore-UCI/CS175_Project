Lohan entered a court-ordered substance abuse rehabilitation program at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on August 2, following a 13-day stint in a Los Angeles county jail for a probation violation. -- The judge in the Lindsay Lohan case will issue an order Wednesday morning concerning the actress' stay in rehab, a court official said. Judge Fox, who has met behind closed doors with Lohan's lawyer and the prosecutor, will hold a hearing in his Beverly Hills courtroom Wednesday morning, a court spokesman said. Judge Marsha Revel, who ordered Lohan to spend 90 days in rehab, was replaced by Judge Eldon Fox earlier this month. Revel ordered the jail time and rehab after she ruled that Lohan violated her probation from a 2007 drunk driving case.
