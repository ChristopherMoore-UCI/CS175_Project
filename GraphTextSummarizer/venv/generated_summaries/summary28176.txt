Ponzi started buying and selling postal reply coupons using agents in his native Italy, and he was making a good living doing it. " The next month, regulators raided Ponzi's office and discovered that he didn't have a huge quantity of postal reply coupons. While Barron conceded that there probably was a way for a person to make a small amount of quick cash on the postal reply coupon scheme, he figured that Ponzi would have to be moving 160 million coupons around to raise the cash he needed to support the business. Ponzi later boasted that he'd taken in a million dollars in new investments the day the report ran. The alleged scam, which cost investors $50 billion, sounds like a classic Ponzi racket.
