But Schalke roared back with four goals in 33 second-half minutes through Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, captain Benedikt Hoewedes, Cameroon midfielder Joel Matip and Austrian defender Christian Fuchs. Meanwhile, midfielder Sergio Pinto put Hanover ahead with a 33rd-minute free-kick, only for teenager Pierre-Michel Lasogga to level matters for Hertha seven minutes from time. With $60m new signing, Javier Pastore, making his debut, PSG took a 39th minute lead through Kevin Gameiro. Mainz, who blazed a trail at the top this time last year, won their first two matches of the new campaign -- and looked to be heading for a third straight victory after Andreas Ivanschitz and Colombian midfielder Elkin Soto scored within the opening 12 minutes to give them a 2-0 lead. Meanwhile, in France, big-spending Paris Saint-Germain claimed their first success of the season with a 2-1 win over Valenciennes.
