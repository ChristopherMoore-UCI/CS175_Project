Venturi, now retired from architecture, wrote: "Denise Scott Brown is my inspiring and equal partner." In a partnership spanning more than 40 years, Scott Brown and her husband and partner Robert Venturi both designed iconic buildings and changed attitudes with their theories and books. Scott Brown told CNN that, as a woman, she had felt excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career. Her seminal book "Learning from Las Vegas," written with Venturi and Steven Izenour and published in 1972, has been in print ever since and is still a standard text for architecture students. At the age of 81, Denise Scott Brown is still busy and in demand at architecture events, giving lectures and writing.
