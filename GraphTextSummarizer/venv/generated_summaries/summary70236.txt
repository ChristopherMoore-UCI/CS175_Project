" McLaren's Jenson Button is the only other driver who can still mathematically overhaul Vettel and the 2009 title winner spoke of his fondness for Japan, saying the Asian country is a home away from home. [Japanese for good luck]'" Button's fellow-Briton and teammate Lewis Hamilton, a world champion in 2008, praised the Suzuka circuit and described it as one of his favorite Formula One destinations. "It's a place that's very close to my heart, and, obviously, it's going to be a very emotional experience for me to be racing in Japan for the first time since the events of last March. "I consider Japan my second home," Button, 31, said. "The fans in Japan are special," Vettel, who has won the last two grands prix in Japan, told Formula One's official website.
