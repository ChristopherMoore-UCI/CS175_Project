Allie Torgan: Why are you involved with the Red Cross? Nate Berkus: I have a very personal connection to the Red Cross because when I survived the tsunami -- the Indian Ocean tsunami, which was seven years ago now -- the Swiss Red Cross was the first sign of help that I saw with my own eyes. -- Designer and TV host Nate Berkus is a member of the American Red Cross Celebrity Cabinet, which helps to highlight the organization's initiatives and response efforts. Torgan: Why are you involved in the CNN Heroes campaign? Berkus: I think the Heroes campaign is really great because it highlights everyday people that we relate to, and it brings them to a place where they're getting recognition. Founded in 1881, the American Red Cross is part of a worldwide movement that offers humanitarian care to victims of war and natural disasters. Torgan: How did that experience affect you? Berkus: For me, having survived a natural disaster of that magnitude, there are things that happen that you don't even think about.
