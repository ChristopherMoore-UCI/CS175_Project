Consumers have been slow to adopt Windows Phones, and Windows 8 is essentially just a blown-up version of that. This fall, Microsoft will launch Windows 8, a radical redesign from the Windows you've grown accustomed to since Windows 95 made its debut 17 years ago. Windows 8 has been reimagined from the ground up, and it's built to run on both the traditional desktop and touchscreen tablets. Right now, there are only a handful of prototype tablets that run Windows 8, so I've been using it on a laptop instead. The classic Windows is still there in Windows 8.
