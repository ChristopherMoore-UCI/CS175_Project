KTVK reported that Vogel is a registered nurse and was a hospital employee at one time, according to the probable cause statement written by police. Her husband, whose name wasn't released by authorities, is expected to survive as he recovers in Chandler Regional Medical Center, said Sgt. After the IV monitor alarm sounded, the hospital staff entered the recovery room and found Vogel manipulating her husband's IV, police said. Two of them contained fluid, and the third appeared to have trace amounts of fecal matter, police said. She is now charged with attempted first-degree murder and vulnerable adult abuse, according to police and CNN affiliate KTVK.
