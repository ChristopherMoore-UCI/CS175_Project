A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) told CNN that Huang made an enquiry about buying the English Premier League club, and that he was passed on to Broughton and investment bank Barclays Capital. -- Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton claims there have been "several" bids for the club after Chinese businessman Kenneth Huang's interest was confirmed to CNN. The English club's current owners -- American duo George Gillett and Tom Hicks -- put the club up for sale in April and appointed British Airways chairman Broughton to oversee the deal. The club did receive a boost on Tuesday though, with the news that star striker Fernando Torres was staying at the club. He is chief executive of Chinese sports investment company QSL and is reported as having a stake in baseball team the New York Yankees as well as NBA side Cleveland Cavaliers.
