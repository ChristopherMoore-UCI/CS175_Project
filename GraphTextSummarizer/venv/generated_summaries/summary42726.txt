Following the success of that operation, the organization's general assembly approved a resolution allowing Interpol to seek public help in child sex abuse investigations. "'The public's response has been very positive," said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings unit, in a news release. Last October, Interpol disseminated pictures of another man whose face appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children. Interpol is trying to locate a man who is pictured sexually abusing young boys in hundreds of images on the Internet. Ten days later, Christopher Paul Neil -- a 32-year-old Canadian man who had been working as an English-language teacher in South Korea -- was arrested in Thailand and charged with child abuse.
