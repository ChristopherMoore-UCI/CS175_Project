But police said Wilson shot Brown after the 18-year-old attacked him and tried to take his service gun in August. The "Weekend of Resistance" protests have ended, the prosecutor didn't step aside and the world awaits word from a grand jury determining whether charges should be brought against a white police officer who fatally shot unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. But the prosecutor's office says there could be a decision by mid-November. The grand jury is deciding whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter, said Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office. Protesters demanded criminal charges against Officer Darren Wilson, who some witnesses said shot and killed Brown while he was surrendering with his hands up.
