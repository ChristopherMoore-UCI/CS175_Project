In the 1990s, Abu Ghaith developed a reputation in Kuwait as a militant preacher Nasir al Bahri -- who was bin Laden's personal bodyguard in the late 1990s -- told the newspaper al Quds al Arabi in 2005 that Abu Ghaith "gave a Friday sermon in Kuwait and spoke about Osama bin Laden and defended him and about the Al-Qa'ida Organization.... The Turkish authorities were apparently anxious that to extradite him directly to the United States could provoke a backlash by al Qaeda sympathizers. Several reported seeing him in meetings at Tora Bora with other al Qaeda leaders. A U.S. Justice Department complaint said, "On the morning of September 12, 2001, Abu (Ghaith) appeared with Bin Laden and Zawahiri, and spoke on behalf of al Qaeda, warning the United States and its allies that "[a] great army is gathering against you" and called upon "the nation of Islam" to do battle against "the Jews, the Christians and the Americans." The picture that emerges of Abu Ghaith from the testimony of detainees at Guantanamo Bay is of someone close to decision-making in al Qaeda immediately after the 9/11 attacks.
