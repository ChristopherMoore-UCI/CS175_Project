Norris speculates it took about 15 million years before the planet and surviving species started recovering from the impact that also destroyed 70 percent of other species. -- A team of scientists has agreed that a giant asteroid killed off dinosaurs and a majority of other species on Earth more than 65 million years ago. "It's believed that the impact actually blew down the forests over most of North America from the pressure wave associated with the explosion," Norris said. Since 1980, scientists have gathered an overwhelming amount of evidence that shows a single asteroid about 6 miles in diameter, traveling at around 43,000 mph, slammed into the Gulf of Mexico, said Richard Norris, a paleoceanographer at the University of California San Diego. Norris compared the asteroid's impact with a blast from 100 million megatons of TNT.
