Hospitals are supposed to take care of the sickest members of our society and uphold the highest standards of patient care. One place where I have seen these issues addressed is in Morbidity and Mortality, or M and M â€” a weekly gathering of doctors, off limits to the public, which serves in most hospitals as a forum for the discussion of mistakes, complications, deaths and unusual cases. Doctors make mistakes. But hospitals are also charged with teaching doctors, and every doctor has a first mistake. At my first M and M as a medical student, I heard the story of a patient who had received antibiotics for an upper respiratory tract infection.
