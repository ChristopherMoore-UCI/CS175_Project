Tyson's acceptance speech for best actress in a play was an emotional highlight of the American Theatre Wing's 67th annual Tony Awards broadcast live from New York's Radio City Music Hall. Harris' opening number included scores of performers from current Broadway shows -- and a cameo by boxer Mike Tyson, who stars in his one-man show "Undisputed," singing and dancing in a white tux. It included a spot-on replica of a young Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5. Harris ended the show with another trademark -- a closing "Tony hits lists" rap written as the show progressed. -- Cicely Tyson's return to Broadway after three decades earned the actress a Tony on Sunday night.
