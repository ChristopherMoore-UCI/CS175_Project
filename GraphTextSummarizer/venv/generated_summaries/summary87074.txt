"Unfortunately, when the boat was being raised back up, one of the wires snapped, resulting in the boat falling back into the water," a Thomson representative said via e-mail Monday. Investigations are being conducted by Thomson Cruises, Spanish maritime authorities, the ship's flag state of Malta and ship classification company DNV, the cruise line said. -- A safety drill gone wrong on a cruise ship resulted in the death of five crew members in Spain's Canary Islands, Thomson Cruises said. It is customary for crew members to get into lifeboats during a drill, Thomson said, but passengers do not board them. The accident happened just before noon Sunday on board the Thomson Majesty while it was docked in La Palma, one of the Canary Islands.
