-- Stepping on stage after leading her party to its biggest electoral triumph in decades, German Chancellor Angela Merkel almost seemed the antithesis of a modern-day politician. After all, it's not often that voters favor consistency over charisma, especially during times of economic strain. Set to become only the third post-war chancellor to win as many terms in office, Merkel's speech was a modest affair compared with those of other three-term titans like former British PM Tony Blair. As elected chancellor of one nation in Europe she has extended her mandate way beyond its borders, dictating humiliating terms to Germany's bailed out neighbors and shying away from big foreign policy asks on Mali and Syria. A pastor's daughter from the country's former Eastern bloc, Merkel comes over as a moralist in the tawdry world of international government and its gargantuan egos -- perhaps unnervingly so.
