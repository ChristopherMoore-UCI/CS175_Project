Mobley had worked at nuclear plants operated by PSEG Nuclear for different contractors from 2002 to 2008, doing routing labor such as carrying supplies and assisting with maintenance activities, company spokesman Joe Delmar said. Mobley, who also worked at other nuclear plants in the region, satisfied federal security background checks required to work in the U.S. nuclear industry as recently as 2008, he said. Yemeni authorities had detained Mobley and 10 other al Qaeda suspects earlier this month in a "successful security sweep" in the capital of Sanaa, Albasha said. -- Federal authorities are investigating a New Jersey man suspected of being an al Qaeda member and going on a deadly rampage at a hospital in Yemen. Yemeni counterterrorism forces rushed to the hospital and captured Mobley, who had barricaded himself in a hospital room, said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington.
