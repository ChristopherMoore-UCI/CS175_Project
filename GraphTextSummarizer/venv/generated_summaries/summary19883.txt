Kearney said "numerous homes" have been burned in west Texas and that firefighters were continuing to battle the blazes as of Sunday night. -- Heavy winds and dry weather helped set off a rash of fires across a wide swath of north, central and west Texas on Sunday, state forestry officials said. The largest concentration of blazes broke out around the west Texas town of Midland and near the panhandle city of Amarillo, where meteorologists reported wind gusts of up to 69 miles an hour. Kearney said heavy winds are expected to blow across much of the state into Monday, thus making it more likely that firefighters could be many hours away from dousing the final flames spread by the winds. There have been no fatalities, said Lewis Kearney, a spokesman for the forest service's Texas State Lone Star Incident Management Team.
