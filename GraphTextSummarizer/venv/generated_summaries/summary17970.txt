Villas Boas is Mourinho's protege and student, but aged just 33 -- seven years younger than Mourinho was when he won his first title with Porto -- the question is whether the apprentice can match his former master's astonishing achievements at the Estadio do Dragao. "I can find similarities between Villas Boas and Mourinho in the way they started their careers and the way in which they reached immediate success at Porto," Rui Orlando, a football commentator for Portuguese-based SportTV told CNN. And when Mourinho returned to Porto, after cutting his managerial teeth at Uniao Leiria, he took Villas Boas under his wing, going on to employ the willing student at both Chelsea and Inter Milan in exactly the same manner as Robson had done with him. Leaving his mentor behind in Italy, Villas Boas took over at bottom of the table Academica last season, performing a minor miracle to steer a club, without a win before his arrival, to mid-table respectability. -- There are few careers that can match the pedigree of Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho.
