Now, authorities have widened their inquiry to include all homicides that occurred in a general area of south Los Angeles where Franklin lived from the 1970s, when he got out of the military, through the 1980s, police spokeswoman Karen Rayner said Wednesday. Los Angeles detectives have vastly expanded their investigation into the "Grim Sleeper" serial killer case and are now looking at whether any of 230 murders are connected to the alleged slayer, police said Wednesday. Prior to his arrest in July 2010, Franklin had worked for a time as a garage attendant at a Los Angeles police station, authorities said. In April, police were investigating the Grim Sleeper's connection to 55 unidentified women -- a quarter of what they're now probing -- whose photographs were found among 180 videos and photos taken from the Los Angeles home of Lonnie David Franklin Jr. Most of the victims were discovered dumped in south Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris, authorities said.
