While New York City and its surrounding suburbs, the Albany area, and Ithaca are all growing, much of upstate New York is experiencing declines in population, Beveridge said. "After many years of higher growth, Florida is now poised to overtake New York within the next couple of years. Last year, New York had about 250,000 more people than Florida. "This has been going on for many years, it's not a recent phenomenon," said Stan Smith, population program director at the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR). When Florida surpasses and continues to outpace New York in population, it will likely end up with more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after the next official census, in 2020.
