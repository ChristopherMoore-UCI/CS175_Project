Gamal's comments were made through CNN iReport, which has an assignment on life in Egypt under President Mohamed Morsy. The country also remains divided over Islamist leader Morsy, who came to power as Egypt's first popularly elected president after Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February 2011. In March, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry released $250 million in economic aid to Egypt, calling it a "good faith effort" and urging Morsy to pledge economic and political reforms. But Egypt's tourism minister Hisham Zazou has recently told CNN the industry had cause for optimism. Hardline Islamists -- repressed under the autocratic rule of Mubarak -- have been given more freedom under the governance of Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood, leading to large-scale religious clashes in Muslim-dominated Egypt.
