Ken Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was "at a standstill" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington State's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production. "Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds and you would expect to see real progress for clean-up [to] happen with those dollars." While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used, the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland, Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the clean-up boom.
