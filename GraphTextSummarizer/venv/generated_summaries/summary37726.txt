That said, if you're expecting some finger-wagging lecture about not spending money on gifts this year, well, I hate to disappoint you, but that's not where I am headed. But there is just no excuse for running up any credit card debt for gifts. You get the idea: Before you spend a penny on gifts this season you need to have a formal plan from which you will not deviate. What you gave to someone last year, or the length of last-year's gift-giving list should be irrelevant. No dipping into savings (unless you in fact were smart and have a holiday savings account you've been socking money into throughout the year).
