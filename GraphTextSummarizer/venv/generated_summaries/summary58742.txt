So, to find out all this gross and unfortunate information, Michigan State University researchers stealthily observed 3,749 people in public restrooms. " In addition to discovering that most of us fail to wash properly -- especially men -- they also learned that 33% of people don't use soap, and 10% didn't even bother to wash at all. Carl Borchgrevink, professor of hospitality business and lead investigator in the study, noted that, "These findings were surprising to us because past research suggested that proper hand washing is occurring at a much higher rate." So, it seems we've gotten lazy. But what it really means is that many people don't actually wash for long enough to kill infectious germs. And by "made" I mean smothered it in little tiny particles of human filth.
