At the United Nations General Assemby in New York last week, President Viktor Yanukovych did not make any mention of Tymoshenko's imprisonment. The video, shot on lawyer Sergiy Vlasenko's cell phone, is the first time Tymoshenko has been seen since December of last year. -- Ukraine's imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko accuses the country's president of running a "mafia" government in a video smuggled out of her prison by her lawyer, the lawyer told CNN Sunday. The Ukrainian government did not immediately respond Sunday to CNN requests for comment. All other inmates in Ukraine are allowed phone calls to their family members, but Yulia Tymoshenko is severely restricted."
