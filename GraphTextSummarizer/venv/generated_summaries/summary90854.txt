" Laychak is one of many looking forward to the dedication of the memorial, which is being built to honor the 184 people killed when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. Stainless steel benches are oriented according to whether the victim was on the plane or in the Pentagon. The only thing he has not done is visit the bench dedicated to his brother, Dave Laychak, who died on September 11, 2001, when a passenger airplane hit the Pentagon. Each bench is engraved on the end with the name of one of the 184 people who died on board Flight 77 or in the Pentagon that day. "The way the bench is facing, my father's bench, if you read his name on the end of it, you are facing the same direction that the plane was flying [from] as it impacted the Pentagon," said Ploger, whose parents were originally scheduled to take a different flight but changed their plans.
