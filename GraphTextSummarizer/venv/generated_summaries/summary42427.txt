Deadlock ensued for the remainder of normal time but as the game moved into the first extra period, it was Arsenal who grew in stature as Hull's players wilted. Arsenal overturned a two-goal deficit to beat Hull City 3-2 after extra time in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. Unfancied Hull, who were playing in their first FA Cup final, raced into a 2-0 lead in a frantic opening to the match. Steve Bruce's men continued to frustrate Arsenal who were becoming more potent in open play, but it was another set piece that ended up unlocking Hull's defense -- Laurent Koscielny turning the ball in from a corner kick in the 71st minute. Aaron Ramsey finally delivered the killer blow, firing a low shot past goalkeeper Allan McGregor to send Arsenal ahead for the first time in the match.
