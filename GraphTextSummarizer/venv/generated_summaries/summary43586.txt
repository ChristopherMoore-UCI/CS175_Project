De Gucht recognizes the European Commission's role in helping companies trying to enter into the Chinese marketplace. -- European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht believes businesses need to be lean and mean if they're to ensure growth during the tough economic times engulfing the continent. De Gucht emphasizes the need for businesses to be innovative to guarantee they survive and thrive in troubled economic times. He also believes European companies need to look outside the continent for future growth, and points to China as a market which should be explored more. But De Gucht warns the business world not to discount Europe.
