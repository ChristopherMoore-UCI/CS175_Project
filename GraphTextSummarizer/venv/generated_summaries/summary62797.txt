Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Jackson 5 original Tito Jackson, was appointed temporary guardian last week. -- A judge restored Katherine Jackson as permanent guardian of Michael Jackson's children and approved a plan to add their cousin T.J. Jackson as co-guardian during a hearing Thursday. "It's clear to me that the children are well-cared-for by Mrs. Jackson," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said. The co-guardianship arrangement, which is supported by the three children, codifies "the very thing that's been in place since Michael's death," Katherine Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders said after the hearing. "It's clear to me that they love her very much and they have substantial significant relations with T.J. Jackson and love him very much."
