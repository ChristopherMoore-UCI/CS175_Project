The past is the past The Federal Elections Commission has a breakdown of presidential campaign receipts ( in millions of dollars) going back to the 1996 presidential race, that shows how dramatically campaign fundraising and spending has multiplied in a short time: 2004 George W. Bush: $269.6 John Kerry: $234.6 2000 Bush: $95.5 Al Gore: $48.1 1996 Bill Clinton: $42.5 Bob Dole: $44.9 CNN's Kevin Bohn, Bill Mears and Rob Yoon contributed to this report. Of numbers released by Republican campaigns before they have to formally submit their fundraising to the Federal Elections Commission, Texas Gov. Rick Perry's campaign said it raised $17 million, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's campaign estimated it raised between $11 million and $14 million and Texas Rep. Ron Paul's campaign said it raised around $8 million. It also allows campaigns to get ahead in the media wars -- on TV, radio, online, in the mail -- and on-the-ground grassroots outreach. While federal election law requires campaigns to disclose the names of donors of more than $250, there is no requirement to reveal the names of bundlers. And then there's length of U.S. campaigns.
