Aazis Richardson is accused of shooting the cab driver, Vincent Darbenzio, 47, twice in the back of his head while still in the cab, according to Lackawanna County Assistant District Attorney Gene Talerico. Richardson believed Darbenzio had ignored his route suggestions in attempt to increase the fare, according to Talerico. On Sunday, more than 50 of Darbenzio's friends and family members held a vigil near the spot where Darbenzio was killed, according to the victim's brother, Chris Darbenzio. " Richardson was charged as an adult with multiple counts of murder in the first, second and third degrees, as well as robbery and firearms-related offenses, according Talerico. "I just told him, 'take this way;' he didn't want to listen -- he got his (expletive) shot," Richardson told CNN affiliate WNEP.
