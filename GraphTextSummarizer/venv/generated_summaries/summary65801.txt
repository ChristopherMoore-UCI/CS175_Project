Animal records are always a feature, many of them even stranger than the world's smallest cow at 33 inches from hind to foot in West Yorkshire, England. "Animal achievements are among the most popular records in our book, so for 2011, in addition to the usual chapter on record-breaking creatures in the wild, we've added an entire new chapter focusing on our favorite pets, zoos, and farm animals, said Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness World Records. "From being a stray dog, being dumped, to being a Guinness World Record holder is just phenomenal," owner Becky Stanford said. The Smurf collection involves 1,061 different items owned by Stephen Parkes, 44, of Nottingham, England. " Other animal records include the oldest gorilla in captivity, Colo, who lives in the United States and is now 53.
