" American University in Cairo identified the three detained students as Sweeney, 19, a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri; Gregory Porter, 19, from Glenside, Pennsylvania, who attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Luke Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, who goes to Indiana University. David Lynfield, deputy press officer for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, said the Egyptian authorities' "claims are being currently investigated." Sweeney interned for U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Missouri, between February and May, press secretary Pat Sloca said. Social-media posts appear to show Gates and Sweeney in the thick of recent protests in Cairo, with Gates indicating he had been injured in clashes over the weekend. Cairo police have questioned the three, who were detained Monday night, and they will face additional investigation by prosecutors, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the office of Egypt's general prosecutor. "I can't remember seeing his face look like that," said Nicole Sweeney, whose brother Derrik Sweeney is among those detained.
