-- Furious over Russia's invasion of Georgia, the United States and its allies are weighing steps to diplomatically isolate Moscow as punishment for the conflict, senior administration officials said Tuesday. The United States boycotted preparatory meetings Tuesday for a NATO meeting with Russia, and NATO has canceled a naval exercise with Russian forces in the northern Pacific. The United States has criticized the Russian move against Georgia, its ally, as "disproportionate" and demanded a cease-fire, to which French President Nicolas Sarkozy said both sides agreed late Tuesday. According to the second administration official, officials from several countries have told a variety of Russian officials, " 'you know you cannot stay," to which the Russian response is, " 'we don't want to stay.' Watch Georgia's president discuss the cease-fire Â» "I wanted to make very clear that the United States stands for the territorial integrity of Georgia, for the sovereignty of Georgia; that we support its democratically elected government and people, and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Georgia," Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday.
