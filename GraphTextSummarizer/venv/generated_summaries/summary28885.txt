At the end of the APEC trade summit in China, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a climate change agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping that would cut both countries' greenhouse gas emissions by close to a third over the next two decades. " On top of historic climate change agreement, Obama and Xi also agreed on the importance of cybersecurity, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, strengthening military relations and increasing trade. Obama said he hopes the announcement will spur other nations to tackle climate change. "As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change," Obama said Wednesday in a joint press conference with Xi. Another official said the agreement "won't all fall together in five minutes," but hopes this will demonstrate to other nations that working together to reduce carbon emissions would prove that "we can work together to enhance deployment of sustainable clean technologies."
