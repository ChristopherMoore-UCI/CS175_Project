Downtown Atlanta could get as much as 5 inches of snow Friday, beginning at mid-morning, according to CNN weather modeling. The storm system moving across the Deep South in the next few days will bring 3 to 6 inches of snow to Jackson, Mississippi, up to 2 inches to Biloxi, Mississippi and 2 to 4 inches to Mobile, Alabama, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Because temperatures are expected to rise into the 30s and 40s across much of the South on Friday, road crews are worried about melting and refreezing on roads over the next couple of days. As forecasters predict up to 8 inches of snow across a swath of the Southeast that hasn't seen more than an inch of snow in at least a decade -- including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi -- public officials are reacting with a mix of trepidation and helplessness. Hundreds of flights into and out of Atlanta have been canceled for Friday as snow bears down on the area.
