Dr. Craig Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City last month, is now free of the virus and will be released from the hospital Tuesday, city officials said. He completed his work treating Ebola patients in Guinea on October 12 and left Africa two days later via Europe, arriving at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on October 17. He was diagnosed with Ebola on October 23 -- the same day he contacted Doctors Without Borders to report that he had a fever. After being released, he is expected to go to his apartment in the New York City neighborhood of Hamilton Heights. Why U.S. Ebola patients seem to be recovering faster Complete coverage on Ebola
