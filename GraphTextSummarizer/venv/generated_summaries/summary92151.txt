-- Pope Francis had lunch Saturday with his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, in what the Vatican said was the first such encounter in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. Video footage released by the Vatican after Francis had returned to Vatican City showed the two men warmly clasping hands as they greeted each other. Benedict "has attentively followed the events of recent days," including Francis' inauguration Mass before crowds of well wishers and dignitaries, the Vatican said. He was greeted at the helipad by Benedict XVI, and the pair exchanged an embrace, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said. And when former hermit Pope Celestine V resigned in 1294 after less than six months in office, he was imprisoned soon afterward by his successor, Pope Boniface VIII.
