1,000 years of Roma discrimination Authorities asked questions about Maria because she has fair skin and blond hair, while the couple who said they were her parents have darker complexions typical of Roma, a people descended from Indian nomads, who face widespread discrimination in Europe. Suspicions of false documents Police have said they suspect records that the couple provided for Maria and for other children in their care may be false. Maria's case plays into old prejudices about them stealing children for forced labor. Maria was not hidden away," Maria Kaleas said. A spokesman for a Greek children's charity said about 10 cases of missing children around the world are "being taken very seriously" in connection with Maria's case.
