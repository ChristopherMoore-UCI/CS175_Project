Anti-Japan protests erupt in China amid island dispute Gemba said he planned to send Japan's vice foreign minister, Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, to deliver a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao on behalf of Japan's prime minister. Relations between the two countries have been tense in recent weeks, with anti-Japan protests erupting in several Chinese cities earlier this month over a disputed island chain known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. Gemba also said that Japan and China needed to exchange views on the current bilateral relationship and regional issues such as the Korean peninsula. "It was very regrettable -- the national flag shows the country's dignity and it's a principle of international law that you should respect it," Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, told reporters. Diplomatic vehicles in China carry special number plates but typically only ambassadors' cars display national flags.
