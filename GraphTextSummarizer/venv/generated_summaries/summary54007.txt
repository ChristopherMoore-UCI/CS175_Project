" Drinking is such a big part of Korean life that Seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city's drinking culture. Drinking etiquette is the first thing you teach foreign guests," says Bryan Do, a Korean-American director at the South Korean branch of a U.S. company. "I didn't really like it in the beginning," says Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who came to Seoul to work for a South Korean company. Koreans love singing, as evidenced by the country's staggering number of karaoke bars, as well as the rush of audition programs on Korean television. So how do you avoid offending someone (worst of all, a superior or client) at a Korean drinking extravaganza?
