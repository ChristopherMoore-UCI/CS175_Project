By then, though, the discharge had already caused major environmental damage, not to mention significantly affecting Gulf Coast economies. They include sales and hotel occupancy taxes that the state didn't receive, it contends, because visitors and others didn't go to its Gulf Coast communities due to the spill, as well as "lost" revenue for state park entrance and concession fees. Florida, for instance, did so last month, joining several other Gulf states. Thousands of businesses and individuals made claims in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, some coastal counties in eastern Texas and western Florida and adjacent Gulf waters and bays. The Texas Attorney General's office, in a news release Friday, said the state expects "its case to be consolidated" with others -- all of them intent on recouping "damages associated with harm caused to the Gulf."
