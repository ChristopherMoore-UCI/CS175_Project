In that agreement, Israel agreed to ease restrictions to allow for humanitarian aid and construction materials with an agreement to engage in talks aimed at easing economic hardships in Gaza. If the ceasefire holds, the two sides have agreed to begin talks four weeks from now on a broader range of issues, including the Israeli release of Palestinians -- primarily Hamas members -- arrested during the conflict and the construction of a seaport in Gaza, according to published reports in state-run media.
