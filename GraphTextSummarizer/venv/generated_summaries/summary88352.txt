Duncan was admitted into isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28 with common symptoms of Ebola: fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Family questions wait on experimental drug Duncan was not given a blood transfusion with blood donated by an Ebola survivor, as Ebola patients Dr. Rick Sacra and Ashoka Mukpo were given in Nebraska. "Autopsies on patients who die of Ebola should be avoided." Duncan's body will be enclosed in two bags and the bags will be disinfected for transportation, Texas health officials say. Duncan first walked into Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas after 10 p.m. on September 25. "The care team has been consulting with the CDC and Emory, on a daily basis since Mr. Duncan was admitted to the hospital, discussing the possible course of treatment, including the use of investigational drugs," hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said in a statement.
