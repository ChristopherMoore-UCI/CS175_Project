And the ACLU says the findings show racial disparities in marijuana arrests have grown significantly over the past 10 years. But Ezekiel Edwards, director of the ACLU Criminal Law Reform Project and one of the primary authors of the new report, argues that racial disparity in marijuana arrests only cause more problems for people of color. Those are just some of the statistics put forth by the ACLU in a new report that the organization says shows wide racial disparities in marijuana arrest rates nationwide. Increasing arrest rates don't correlate to marijuana usage rates by race, according to data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2001-2012 cited in the ACLU report. Among 18-25 year olds -- a group with higher arrest rates than other age groups, according to the report -- more whites than blacks said they used marijuana in surveys every year between 2001 and 2010.
