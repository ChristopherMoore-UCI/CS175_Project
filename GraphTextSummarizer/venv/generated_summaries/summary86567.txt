"The new MacBook Pro is the most advanced Mac we have ever built," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. Schiller also unveiled other MacBook Pros without high-res displays but with processors he said will be 60% faster than current models. In other iOS 6 news, Apple announced that its FaceTime video-chat feature for newer iPhones and iPads will work over cellular networks, not just Wi-Fi. Apple has sometimes used past WWDCs to unveil new iPhones. As usual, Cook began the keynote with a batch of new stats about Apple's impressive growth.
