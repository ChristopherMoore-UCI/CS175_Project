But House Republicans -- many of whom were elected on budget-cutting campaigns -- have commonly taken a stricter stance on government spending and collective bargaining. Thirty-five U.S. states and Puerto Rico reported projected budget shortfalls for fiscal year 2012 totaling $82.1 billion, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A month after Illinois lawmakers approved a massive tax hike, Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday unveiled a $35.4 billion budget that depends on state lawmakers approving $8.7 billion in new borrowing largely to clear a towering stack of unpaid bills. The legislation requires workers to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions, although supporters say local governments will decide on health care contribution for their employees. The budget battle is somewhat unique in heavily unionized Wisconsin, where collective bargaining began.
