At 53, Costner is the soft-spoken, heroic everyman we've seen time and again in such movies as "Dances With Wolves," "The Bodyguard" and "Field of Dreams" -- except today he's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat. Listen to Costner kick it with his band Â» CNN: Even though your album, "Untold Truths," is being marketed as a country album, your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country. I am like, "Please don't show me." CNN: Are you planning to make more albums? Costner: I will be making more music. The three have been making music on and off since then, with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. He was backed by his band, Modern West, which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class.
