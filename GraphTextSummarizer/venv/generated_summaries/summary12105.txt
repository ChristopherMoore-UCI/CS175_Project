Sougarret said that attaching directional motors to the drill would slow it to a speed of 1 meter per hour, adding that 20 to 30 meters per day "would be a good average. " Under optimal conditions, it is capable of drilling 1,000 meters in 24 hours, said Juan Carlos Marin, a site representative for Schlumberger oil services company. Previously, officials have said that the workers could be rescued, if all goes well, in late October or early November. The plan is for the new drill to descend vertically for at least 40 meters before turning at an angle to reach the underground ramp that leads to the miners, said Andre Sougarret, manager of the state copper mining company. But officials do not know how long it will take the drill, normally used in to drill for oil, to reach the men trapped 700 meters (2,300 feet) underground.
