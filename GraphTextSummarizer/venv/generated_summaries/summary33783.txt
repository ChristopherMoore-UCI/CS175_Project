That's useful when you want to share links on social networking sites like Twitter that limit the size of your messages, which helps explain why URL shortening services in general are proliferating. Launched about a year ago, Bit.ly is now being used to shorten 8 to 10 million links a day, according to general manager Andrew Cohen. Bit.ly is still exploring business models, but one thing it won't do, according to Cohen, is inject advertisements when users click on a link. The service will pay Twitter users who get followers to click on a short URL and then either interact with framed ads or make purchases at supported merchants. That's just one example of opportunistic middlemen taking advantage of shortened URLs.
