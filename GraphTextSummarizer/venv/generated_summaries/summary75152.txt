A train carrying chemicals derailed and burned for hours, forcing the evacuation of about 600 homes Crews were still fighting the blaze at midday, but expected to have it fully contained in the afternoon, said Rockford Fire Chief Derek Bergsten. "It's under control and we're taking every precaution not to harm firefighters or residents," Bergsten said, adding that federal and state environmental officials were on scene monitoring air and soil samples. The fatality was a woman, said Winnebago County Coroner Sue Fiduccia. Bergsten said six people were injured, and all train workers were accounted for. Three motorists who were stopped at a train crossing were burned, one severely, Bergsten said.
