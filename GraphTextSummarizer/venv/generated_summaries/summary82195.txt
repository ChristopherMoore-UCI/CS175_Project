Burton gave the reading, which was held in front of an audience of adults, as part of a charity event held by the Rooster Teeth production studio's Extra Life team, a 24-hour video game marathon to raise funds for Children's Miracle Network hospitals. In June, Burton's Kickstarter campaign to revive his very popular "Reading Rainbow" television series, which aired on PBS from 1983 to 2006, received a boost in the form of a $1 million pledge from "Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane. And who better to read such prose than Burton, a well-known advocate for literacy? Video of the "Star Trek" actor reading an excerpt from the irreverent children's book "Go the F*** to Sleep" caught fire over the weekend as fans enjoyed hearing the actor use some colorful language. -- Holy crap, LeVar Burton.
