In fact, in last year's incident, Scalia actually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor prostitution after an undercover officer bought hot dogs from her stand, took her business card offering topless dances, and received a lap dance at her home. Scalia disputed the charges at her arraignment Saturday in a Nassau County Court in Hempstead, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. Catherina G. Scalia, 47, of East Rockaway, New York, was arrested after she responded to a call to go a hotel on Long Island, police said. When CNN's Jeanne Moos profiled Scalia and her hot dog truck a year ago, Scalia asserted she was a stripper, not a prostitute. Scalia has four teenage boys, but she said last year they were in their grandmother's custody.
