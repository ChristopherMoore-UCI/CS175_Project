Naeem Iqbal, Islamabad police spokesman, said three men and two female students were killed, and 22 people were injured. In recent weeks, Pakistan has been relentlessly rocked by a wave of suicide attacks as Islamic militants retaliate against a military offensive to rout insurgents operating along the Pakistan-Afghan border. Police investigators collect evidence at the suicide blast site at Islamic International University in Islamabad. A day earlier, militants attacked two police training centers and the country's Federal Investigation Agency in Lahore in eastern Pakistan. And on October 10, militants held dozens of hostages for 22 hours inside an army headquarters in Rawalpindi, which neighbors Islamabad.
