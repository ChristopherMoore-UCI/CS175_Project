-- Fifteen crew members of a South African Airways flight spent the night in jail after customs officials found marijuana and cocaine worth nearly half a million dollars hidden aboard a long-distance flight to London, British customs officials said Wednesday. Customs officials interviewed the crew members overnight, and all were released on bail Wednesday pending further inquiries, Gaiger said. Border agents arrested the crew at London's Heathrow Airport on suspicion of involvement in smuggling prohibited drugs into the United Kingdom, customs spokesman Bob Gaiger said. "SAA has a zero-tolerance approach towards the use of the airline's services for any criminal activity," airline spokeswoman Robyn Chalmers said. The 10 women and five men -- who include three pilots -- were detained on arrival from Johannesburg, South Africa, after customs officials found 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of marijuana and 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of cocaine in three pieces of baggage, HM Revenue and Customs said.
