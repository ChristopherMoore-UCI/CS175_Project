Birmingham, like many other areas in Britain, was roiled by riots that began Saturday, spurred by the shooting death of a man who protesters said was killed by police. Why are we doing this?" Jahan's son, Haroon, was killed early Wednesday in Birmingham, along with two brothers, Shazad and Munir Hussein -- both in their 30s. In addition to the three deaths in Birmingham, police on Wednesday identified a man fatally shot in a vehicle in south London as Trevor Ellis. "I remember passing by there a few hours before it happened, and there were lots of Asian kids, calmly watching guard outside shops, not disturbing anyone," said Esther Kiilu, a resident of neighboring Rowley Ridges. "I just want things to return to normal, this has just got out of hand," said Hilda Siviter, who lives in Bewdley, a small town near Birmingham.
