Upright seat designs would allow airlines to pack more passengers into a cabin and provide an affordable alternative to public transportation on short haul flights. The design shows narrow rows of folding saddle seats with low backrests on which passengers perch rather than recline. The patent application, which makes even the most budget of budget airline seating look luxurious, was published last month and is available for viewing by the public. The Airbus design is somewhat similar to the SkyRider, a perching saddle for planes developed by Italian firm Aviointeriors and unveiled at an expo in 2010. "Airbus files hundreds of patents each year -- this is what innovative companies do," Airbus UK head of media relations Robert Gage said via email.
