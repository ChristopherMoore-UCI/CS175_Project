At the dawn of the gay rights movement, people wanted to liberate sexuality not only for gay men and women but also for everyone, expanding the range of sexual self-expression along a spectrum of identities. "I think it's irresponsible to be airing a show with the content that gives the idea that sexual orientation is a choice," GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said. But we honor and respect religious choices, and afford them protections under our laws because we are a nation that continually aspires to increasing freedom and self-determination. The antidote to that, simply, is choice. This so-called "therapy" is as psychologically damaging to individual gay people as it is to our societal aspirations to be ever more equitable and tolerant.
