Break out your winter gear -- the Farmers' Almanac is predicting a rough winter for large parts of the U.S. The longtime periodical, published since 1818 and famous for its long-range weather predictions, is out with its annual winter forecast, which says Old Man Winter is really going to hammer folks in the Midwest and upper Great Lakes region with very cold and very snowy conditions. According to Duncan, "February 12th-15th looks very stormy with blizzard conditions possible especially in New England but also going down to the mid-Atlantic coast." Nasty weather is also in the forecast for late in the season as winter moves toward spring. The periodical says, "While three-quarters of the country is predicted to see near- or below-average precipitation this winter, that doesn't mean there won't be any winter storms! "We're actually predicting a possible blizzard in the northeast to the mid-Atlantic states sometime in February," Duncan says.
