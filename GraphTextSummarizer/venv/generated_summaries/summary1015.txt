Fallon has managed to keep fans riveted with expectations over what musical guest might pop up next in a way that hasn't happened since Arsenio Hall left the air (admit it, you sang along when Mariah Carey did "All I Want For Christmas") and capitalized on the boyish charm that made him star of "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live." Meanwhile Kimmel has been everywhere recently, from the cover of Rolling Stone to ruling the Web on Friday after his "nemesis" Matt Damon took over his show Thursday night in what turned out to be one seriously funny Kimmel roast. Thursday night's temporarily renamed show, "Jimmy Kimmel Sucks," was the result of a long-time "feud" between Kimmel and the Academy Award winning Damon and helped pull in the viewers. The Washington Post reported that when asked what it was like to "kill Dave" in the ratings, Kimmel was quick to retort "I'm not killing Dave" and point out that Letterman's ratings had not changed since Kimmel's show replaced "Nightline" in its time slot. It ranked No.1 among late-night talk shows in both households and among the coveted 18-49 demographic, beating "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" by 62% and "The Late Show with David Letterman" by 120%. During a recent appearance before a group of television critics, it was announced that Kimmel had beaten Letterman in the ratings.
