Watch report on the signing from CNN's Ivan Watson Â» During the U.S. presidential campaign, then-candidate Barack Obama called for passage of the Armenian genocide resolution. Armenian and Turkish ministers sign accord as dignitaries, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, look on. The signing was delayed because of Armenian objections to the wording of a final oral statement intended to be given after the signing. Armenians accuse Ottoman Turks of committing genocide, killing more than a million Armenians beginning in 1915. Turkish-Armenian relations are often overshadowed by the dispute over the massacre of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, more than 90 years ago.
