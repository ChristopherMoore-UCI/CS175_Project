President Barack Obama met Wednesday with Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and potential Democratic successor, for about an hour in the Oval Office, a White House official said. It's the first time the two have met in person since August, when they both attended a party at the Martha's Vinyard home of Vernon Jordan, an aide to former President Bill Clinton. More recently, Clinton has backed Obama's decision to overhaul immigration rules and forestall deportations for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens through executive action. "As is well known, President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy getting together in person on a regular basis. Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, told CNN in an email that her camp will "defer to the White House on any details."
