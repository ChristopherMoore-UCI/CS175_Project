In a major defeat for supporters of tougher gun laws, the U.S. Senate on Wednesday defeated a compromise plan to expand background checks on firearms sales as well as a proposal to ban some semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault weapons. The Manchin-Toomey plan would have expanded background checks to include private sales at gun shows and all Internet sales, while continuing to exempt most sales between family members and friends. Offerd by conservative Republicans, the alternative plan introduced Wednesday after weeks of  hearings and debate on Democratic proposals lacked any expansion of background checks but called for more funding to better enforce the existing system. Meanwhile, an alternative package of gun proposal that reflected the NRA position also was defeated. And they started looking for an excuse, any excuse to vote 'no.'" Reid earlier warned Republicans that the strong majority of Americans who support expanded background checks won't forget votes against the Manchin-Toomey compromise.
