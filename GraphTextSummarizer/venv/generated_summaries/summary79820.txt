Calling violence against women, whether street harassment or sexual harassment or rape or murder, a "women's issue" allows men to ignore it as if we have no responsibility for it or stake in ending it. Starting March 8, over one year we will secure promises from men around the world to take concrete action toward stopping violence against women. I've been working since 1994 to bring men in as leaders and partners in stopping violence against women. Here in New York, men have produced excellent videos calling on other men to stop street harassment. Men joined women in pushing for a serious response to allegations of gang rape in Steubenville, Ohio (and the social media vileness that followed).
