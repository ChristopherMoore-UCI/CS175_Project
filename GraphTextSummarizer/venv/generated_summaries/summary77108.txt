While most consumer goods companies are seeking opportunities in China, domestic condom maker Safedom is going in the opposite direction -- seeking European partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global. It will sell 200m condoms this year, all within China, and is targeting sales of 1bn next year; the same number that Durex, the world's biggest player, was producing in the country within three years. "In the old days free condoms were welcomed by the people," said Shuyu Xu, director of international sales. At the opulent Venetian casino in Macao, Safedom sells single condoms for HK$50 (US$6) a throw and, according to Mr Fu, designer condoms (presumably fake) are available online at US$65 apiece. Sales outlets and channels are also likely to vary from China, where half of all condoms are bought by women.
