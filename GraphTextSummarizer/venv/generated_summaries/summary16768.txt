"Travel is down, agents and brokers need deals, so rather than just a few full-price charters, we decided to stay busy, put more people to work, and help island tourism by doing charters at cost. The move to make such vessels more affordable comes as the recession continues to put pressure on the luxury holiday and mega-yacht industries. The 100-foot Katania was chartered by Hollywood star Hilary Swank and her husband, Chad Lowe. Although the costs of crew and luxury food aren't extremely cheap, it is expected this move will open up the recession-strained market to many more potential holiday-makers. The price includes full crew, premium wines, gourmet food prepared by a private chef, amenities such as kayaks, hot tub, fishing/crabbing/shrimping equipment, and even a 30-foot whaler for guest use.
