The result of Cowperthwaite's curiosity is a film that raises a number of questions, not the least of which being whether killer whales have any place in theme parks. "I became interested in this project when I found out about the death of Brancheau," filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite said. "For anyone who has ever questioned the humaneness of keeping wild animals in captivity and training them to perform tricks for food, this will be trenchant, often harrowing stuff," The Hollywood Reporter said in its Sundance review. Although Brancheau's story is at the heart of the film, "Blackfish" also shows more generally the dangers of working with orcas and their majestic beauty and intelligence. The nearly 90-minute documentary tells the story of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was killed in 2010 when the killer whale Tilikum grabbed her and yanked her underwater.
