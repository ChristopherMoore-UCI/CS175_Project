Basel, Switzerland When it comes to art fairs that truly put their cities on the map, Art Basel tops the list. Art Basel is limited to 20th and 21st century art, and the emphasis is on the new. The next Art Basel takes place June 13-16, 2013. As at the original Art Basel, the focus here is on the new, but in Miami Beach, there's emphasis on artists and galleries from the United States and Latin America. This being an odd-numbered year, the city is preparing the 55th Venice Biennale -- a nearly six-month-long festival (June 1 to November 24) with pavilions and art installations throughout the city.
