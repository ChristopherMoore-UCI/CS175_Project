Prince Harry earlier posted a message on YouTube on behalf of Sentebale to mark World AIDS Day in which he said the virus was the No. 1 cause of death across Africa and second highest cause of death globally for those aged 10 to 19. Throughout the day, celebrities including singer Joss Stone, actor Charley Boorman, race car driver Daniel Ricciardo, and former rugby player and sport commentator Will Greenwood will be revealing secrets about themselves as part of #FeelNoShame. Prince Harry co-founded the Sentebale charity with Lesotho's Prince Seeiso in 2006 after being struck by the impact of AIDS/HIV on children and young people in the southern African nation. He said Sentebale encouraged children to talk openly about their health concerns. "To show our support to the children of Lesotho and help reduce the stigma for all those affected by HIV, we are turning this World AIDS Day into a day in which no one should feel any shame about their secrets," Prince Harry said. The fourth in line to the throne unveiled a hidden fear Monday in support of the #FeelNoShame campaign being run by his Sentebale charity for World AIDS Day.
