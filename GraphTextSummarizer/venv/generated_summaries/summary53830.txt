NASA said the parts the crew delivered will add years to the station's life after the space shuttle fleet is retired next year. Some of the parts are for systems that keep the station from overheating or tumbling through space, NASA said. About an hour after the shuttle landed, the crew transport vehicle moved alongside the orbiter access hatch on Atlantis' port side, NASA said on its Web site. Stott had spent 87 days on the international space station, according to NASA. Mike Fincke's daughter was born in June 2004 while he was aboard the international space station, NASA said.
