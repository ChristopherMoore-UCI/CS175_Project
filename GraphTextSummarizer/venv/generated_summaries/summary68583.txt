In terms of connectivity, Royal Caribbean has partnered with service provider O3b Networks and claims to offer "more bandwidth than every other cruise ship in the world combined." However, the report suggested these issues will likely be resolved by the time the cruise docks in New York on November 10, blaming the patchy WiFi on the fact service provider O3b Networks does not yet have a satellite covering the UK. The highly hyped ship is now in the middle of its inaugural voyage, an eight-day cruise from the UK port of Southampton to New York. According to Cruisecritic.com, the Quantum Class of ships represents a significant reduction in size compared with Royal Caribbean's Oasis Class ships, which measure 225,282 tons and carry 5,400 passengers at double occupancy. But what seems to be getting all the attention are on board attractions such as the iFly skydiving simulator, those aforementioned robot bartenders in the "Bionic Bar", North Star -- a sky pod that allows guests to rise 300 feet above the ship in a retractable crane -- bumper cars and interactive art created by digital and video artists.
