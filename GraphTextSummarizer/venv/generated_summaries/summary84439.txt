Fire officials south of Big Sur are on alert for brush fires there, said Robert Lewin, the Cal Fire Chief for San Luis Obispo County. The Pacific Coast Highway, also known as California Highway 1, remained open in Big Sur, authorities said Tuesday. A nearly uncontrollable 550-acre wildfire showed no mercy Tuesday and burned several homes in California's Big Sur, including the fire chief's. Firefighters have 36 hours to put out the fire before a weather system brings 30-mph gusts to Big Sur, which could energize and expand the wildfire, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. That twist wasn't lost on Fire Chief Martha Karstens of the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade.
