"Our embassy in Brasilia, our consulate in Rio de Janeiro, many people have been up through the night just to provide support to the Goldman family, to maintain contact with the Brazilian government ... as we, hopefully, come to the end of this process and look forward to the reuniting of Sean Goldman with his father, David," Crowley said. David Goldman arrived in Rio de Janeiro to reunite with his son, but one Supreme Court justice issued a stay, ordering Sean to remain with his Brazilian relatives until the high court could consider the case. Last week, a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that Sean Goldman be returned to his father in New Jersey. The custody battle began in 2004, when Goldman's wife, Bruna Bianchi, took their then-4-year-old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation. He said he would like Bianchi to meet with David Goldman so she can tell him what Sean likes to eat, what he enjoys doing and other details.
