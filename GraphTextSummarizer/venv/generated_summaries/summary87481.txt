Other slaves worked as masons in the government quarries, cutting the stone for early government buildings, including the White House and U.S. Capitol. In 1865 one of Madison's former slaves, Paul Jennings, wrote the first White House memoir: "A Colored Man's Reminiscences of Life in the White House." Twelve American presidents owned slaves and eight of them, starting with Washington, owned slaves while in office. According to records kept by the White House Historical Association, slaves often worked seven days a week -- even in the hot and humid Washington summers. In fact, the legacy of American presidents owning slaves goes all the way back to George Washington.
