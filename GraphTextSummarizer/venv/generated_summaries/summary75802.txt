The body of 18-year-old Croom turned up in rural Oregon on Monday, authorities say. " Johnathan's green Honda CRV was found on a lonely road in the quiet country town of Riddle, Oregon, on Wednesday, two days after he was supposed to start college at Mesa Community College. In the book, McCandless cut off communication with his parents and traveled to Alaska, where he lived in a school bus before dying of starvation. " Krakauer's account of McCandless' life has taken on an almost cult status among countless free spirits who dream of shedding the trappings of modern life and living off the land. Like McCandless, Johnathan Croom apparently traveled with very few belongings: perhaps a small backpack and his phone, his father said.
