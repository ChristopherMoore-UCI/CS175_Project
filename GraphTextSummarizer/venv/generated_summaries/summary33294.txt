Later that year, on September 19th Eavis organized a Pop, Folk and Blues Festival at Worthy Farm charging £1 and offering free milk to festival goers. Eavis will raise £2m for charity this year with Greenpeace, WaterAid, Oxfam, I Count and a range of local charities all benefiting from the festival. It was initially with some reluctance that Eavis accepted his inheritance of 150 acres, 60 cows and an overdraft, and returned from his life at sea to run Worthy Farm. The rest of the decade proved more peaceful and crowds soared to over 100,000, but the millennium would close on a tragic note for Eavis when his wife and mother of the festival, Jean, died of cancer in 1999. But by now, Eavis was facing annual opposition from local residents and the district council who threatened to revoke the festival's entertainment license.
