Radiation worries However, concerns remain about background radiation levels and uncertainty surrounding the safety of the area, especially given past concerns about the reporting of radiation levels in the area by Fukushima's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Last month, Miyakoji residents were told at a community meeting that radiation contamination levels had lowered sufficiently to enable their return to the area -- though some voiced concern over existing radiation levels despite decontamination efforts around some communities. Around 138,000 Fukushima residents remain in temporary accommodation, with a number of cities, towns and villages reduced to ghost towns due to continued high levels of radiation. Areas are declared suitable for habitation if residents are exposed to a maximum of 20 millisieverts of radiation per year. The containment effort at the wrecked Fukushima plant has been beset by problems, with regular reports of leaks of contaminated material.
