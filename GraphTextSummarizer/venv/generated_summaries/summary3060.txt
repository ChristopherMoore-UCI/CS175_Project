The Libyan government tried and failed to swap three captured Dutch military personnel for two Libyan Air Force jets whose pilots defected with their warplanes to the European island nation of Malta last month. The three Dutch navy personnel were captured by Libyan security forces on February 27, after they tried to evacuate a Dutch citizen from Libya by helicopter. Libyan state TV also showed captured weapons, and claimed that the crew had been operating a fighter helicopter in Libyan territory in violation of international law. In a telephone interview with CNN, a spokesman for Malta's foreign ministry said Libya sent Mohamad Tahir Siala, a senior Libyan diplomat, on a private jet to Malta on Wednesday to meet with Lawrence Gonzi, the Maltese prime minister. "During the discussion it was discussed whether Malta would give back the two Mirages in exchange for the Dutch prisoners," said ministry spokesman Melvyn Mangion.
