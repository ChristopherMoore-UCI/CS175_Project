-- Ousted Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali was sentenced Monday to 15 and a half years in prison on charges related to the alleged discovery of weapons, archaeological artifacts and illegal drugs -- including marijuana -- in his country's presidential palace. Both Ben Ali and Trabelsi were sentenced last month to 35 years in prison on corruption charges. Ben Ali argued in June that he has been unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. Hosni Beji, one of the lawyers representing Ben Ali, earlier asked the presiding judge, Touhami Hafi, to postpone the trial in part to give him time to persuade the former ruler to return to Tunisia. Ben Ali had ruled Tunisia since 1987.
