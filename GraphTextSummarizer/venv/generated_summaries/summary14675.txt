The most significant breakthrough in terms of Myanmar's remaining debt to creditor countries came after an intense 19-hour negotiating session between Myanmar and the Paris Club group of creditor countries in Paris late last week. Under Paris Club rules, a debtor country must first clear its arrears with international financial institutions before it can negotiate with creditor countries. The Paris Club agreement, to cancel at least 50 per cent of a further $4.4bn in bilateral debt, will meanwhile enable Myanmar to start negotiations with nine creditor countries on repayment terms. Myanmar owed about $4.4bn to nine Paris Club countries including the UK, Germany, France, Denmark and the Netherlands. The Paris Club is an informal group of creditor countries that consult regularly on issues including loan restructuring and debt cancellation, particularly for heavily indebted poor countries.
