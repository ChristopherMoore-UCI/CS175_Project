Frein is charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in an ambush that killed one officer and wounded another outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove on September 12. -- When authorities arrested Eric Frein near an abandoned airport hangar last week, they found a laptop, first aid supplies, shave kits, DVDs, contact lenses, and even a copy of the New Testament, according to police documents released Wednesday. Frein's trove of survival supplies indicated that he was well-equipped to survive alone in the wilderness for weeks or even months. Frein also spent his 48 days on the lam in possession of a radio, binoculars, blankets, a headlamp, glass ashtrays, laundry detergent, batteries, maps, a nail clipper, pots and pans, a propane stove, notebooks, toilet paper, a compass, and glow sticks. In addition to various articles of clothing and multiple weapons and ammunition, Frein had packed food items such as cup noodles, rice, beans, five-gallon water jugs, crackers, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and even a bottle of soju, a Korean vodka.
