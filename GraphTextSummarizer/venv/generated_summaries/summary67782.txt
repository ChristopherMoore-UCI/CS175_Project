The doctors, Steven Brigham and Nicola Riley, had faced identical charges: five counts each of first-degree murder, five of second-degree murder and one of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Days later, Elkton police searched the abortion clinic where Brigham and Riley work and found several fetuses "in a freezer chest." Murder charges against two Maryland doctors over abortions they performed on late-term fetuses have been dropped, prosecutors said Wednesday. "We have exercised our discretion to dismiss them at this point," said Cecil County State's Attorney Ellis Rollins. Maryland is one of 38 states that have fetal homicide laws, often supported by anti-abortion advocates, which advocates say are intended to protect the lives of both the pregnant woman and the fetus.
