The lack of phone calls, texts or social media postings from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has raised a number of questions about how cell phones work on airplanes. Despite the urgings of flight crews to turn off all phones or put them in airplane mode, cell phones can continue to work after a plane takes off, but only while in range of a cellular tower. Those base stations would relay any cellular signals through satellites or cell towers on the ground that are already set up to work with airplanes. Recently, the FAA loosened its rules for using cellular devices on airplanes. It is also considering allowing cell phone calls in the air.
