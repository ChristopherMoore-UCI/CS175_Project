The Myanmar quake was roughly comparable in magnitude and depth to last year's Haiti earthquake, which measured 7.0. The death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit Myanmar has gone up to 75, state media reported Friday. The 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Thursday near its borders with China, Thailand and Laos, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has been badly hit by natural disasters in the past few years. More than 200,000 people died in the Haiti earthquake, and millions were affected.
