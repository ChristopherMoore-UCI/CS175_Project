The Chinese sometimes use force, as they did last year against the Tibetan monks, which causes a huge backlash in Tibet and outside. Zakaria: The Chinese government has always believed that when the Dalai Lama speaks of "autonomy," what he really means is independence, a sovereign nation for Tibet. Zakaria: It's not so simple, because although China never recognized an independent Tibet, neither did it exercise any control of Tibet. The Dalai Lama also addressed relations between Tibet and China in the interview, which Zakaria discussed with CNN. The Chinese have claimed an unbroken line of sovereignty over Tibet ever since.
