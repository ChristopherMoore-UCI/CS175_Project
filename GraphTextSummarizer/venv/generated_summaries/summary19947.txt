-- A man committed an error when he tried to carjack the mother of baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr., Maryland authorities said Tuesday. One of Ripken's sons is Cal Ripken Jr., who set the major league record for most consecutive games played with 2,632. Violet Ripken was at a bank parking lot in Aberdeen when the suspect, armed with a handgun, demanded her car. She was abducted at gunpoint the morning of July 24, 2012, from her Aberdeen home. Ripken's hands were bound, but she was otherwise unharmed, police said.
