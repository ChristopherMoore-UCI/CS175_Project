Officials say their barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a 52-year-old contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door. My phone beeped; a local friend texted me to say McAfee had just proclaimed a $25,000-dollar (just over 12,000 U.S. dollars) reward for information leading to the arrest of Faull's killer. Tiffany says she's not seen or heard from McAfee in nearly a week -- not since the neighbor, Greg Faull, was discovered dead and McAfee went into hiding. McAfee lives in the remote northern part of Ambergris Caye, an island 36 miles from the Belize mainland. McAfee 'frightened for his life' Others say it goes back to April when police raided his compound on the mainland looking for drugs and guns.
