-- Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, has arrived at Iran's notorious Evin prison to begin serving a six month sentence for making anti-government statements, semi-official Fars news agency reported. He had long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. She was sentenced in January, just before Iran held parliamentary elections. Hashemi, who was picked up by authorities late Saturday, was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests. He later toned down the attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
