An article published Thursday by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "From Menu to Mouth: Opportunities for Sodium Reduction in Restaurants," offers strategies that reduce sodium in restaurant food. The city's Public Health Department worked with 206 restaurants, first evaluating their menus for sodium content and then helping them choose ingredients and develop recipes with less sodium. Americans eat out, on average, almost five times a week, and restaurant foods make up a surprisingly high percentage of sodium in the American diet. On average, food from fast-food restaurants contains about 1,850 milligrams of sodium per 1,000 calories and food from sit-down restaurants has nearly 2,100 milligrams per 1,000 calories. One way found to reduce sodium was for restaurants to cut the use of commercially prepared sauces and instead make their own.
