The IAAF completed its report on December 19 and had planned to release its findings last week, but it delayed the announcement to give Pistorius more time to look over the report, said spokesman Nick Davies. The IAAF does not prohibit prosthetic limbs in able-bodied sports, but it does ban technical aids. Athletics South Africa said it would immediately apply the decision which does does not affect Pistorius' eligibility for Paralympic events. The IAAF said that after the Italian race, evidence suggested an athlete with prosthetic limbs performed differently than an able-bodied athlete, and it agreed with Pistorius that more tests were needed. The IAAF determined that Pistorius was able to run "with about 25 per cent less energy expenditure" than other sprinters, it said in a statement released on its Web site Monday.
