Syrian rebels, regime forces clash in Aleppo Syria: As al-Assad's grip loosens, what could come next? Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that if the government's military effort fails in Aleppo, "it will cost the regime dearly and begin a process of contraction of regime control over Syria." "If the regime is able to beat the rebels back, this conflict will go on far longer," he said. The day before, 48 of the 200 people killed in Syria violence were also from the Aleppo region, the first time since the uprising started that the region led in the number of deaths in a single day. " Outside Aleppo, battles between regime forces and rebels raged. The witnesses reported casualties in a "blistering" regime "dawn attack" in the district, in central Aleppo.
