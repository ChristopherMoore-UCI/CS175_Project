-- Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former Iranian president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was sentenced to six months in prison for making anti-government statements, semi-official Mehr News Agency reported Tuesday. He had long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Hashemi was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests, and the announcement of her sentence comes as parliamentary elections near. In recent months, Rafsanjani had toned down attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Her father, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, is a powerful cleric and former parliament speaker.
