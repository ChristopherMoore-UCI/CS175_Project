" Thomas decided -- in addition to telling Robles about food banks, churches and other places she could get food -- she was going to help Robles and her family. Jessica Robles told CNN affiliate WSVN she was desperate and had no money to pay for groceries for her daughter and two young sons. When the officer asked if she had food at home, Robles said, "I looked at her in her face, and I told her, 'Not at all.'" Robles' 12-year-old daughter Anais described the family's dire situation to WSVN. Thomas looked at Robles' criminal history and didn't find any major charges, WSVN reported. According to Miami-Dade Police, Robles walked out of the store in late September with a cart carrying $300 worth of groceries that she didn't pay for.
