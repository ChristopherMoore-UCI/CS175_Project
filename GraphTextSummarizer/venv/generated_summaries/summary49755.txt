Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak When asked for a comment, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, "We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated." The California Department of Public Health said Orange County had the most measles cases, with 23, followed by San Diego County, with 13. The disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. California has reported more measles cases.
