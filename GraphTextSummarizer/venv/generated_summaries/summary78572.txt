-- Services for Sen. Edward Kennedy will be Saturday morning at a Boston church before his burial in Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington, his office announced Wednesday. Robert Kennedy's grave is, in turn, just steps away from the grave of their brother, President John F. Kennedy. At this point, U.S. military ceremonial units have not received orders for participating in a funeral, but military sources said a typical congressional funeral would include military personnel at the internment, a military team to carry the casket, a firing party for a gun salute and a bugler. The proposed grave site is 95 feet south of the grave of Sen. Robert Kennedy, the official said. President Obama, who called Kennedy an "extraordinary leader," will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, according to several sources.
