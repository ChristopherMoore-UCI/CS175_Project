Amnesty International said the announcement that women will be given the right to vote is "no guarantee of rights." "It is a welcome, albeit limited, step along the long road towards gender equality in Saudi Arabia, and a testament to the long struggle of women's rights activists there," said Philip Luther, the human rights group's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, in a statement. In June, a number of Saudi women took to the streets -- in cars -- to demand the right for women to drive and travel freely in the country. Earlier this year, Saudi women activists wrote the government requesting that women be allowed to vote and be candidates in the municipal elections, according to the U.S. Library of Congress. The changes the king announced follow increasing pressure, from outside and inside Saudi Arabia, to give women the right to vote and greater political participation. There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia.
