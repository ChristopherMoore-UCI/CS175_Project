Mirko Vukasovic, a 25-year-old illustrator in Santiago, had been dancing at a club early Saturday when the disco ball began swinging wildly. CNN iReporter Matias de Cristobal said the earthquake destroyed many homes in her Santiago neighborhood. Mescher, 27, was at the home of his host family when the 8.8-magnitude quake struck early Saturday. When the aftershocks began and kept rolling in jolts to his Santiago neighborhood, Mescher said some neighbors prepared for a night outside of their home. Dozens of aftershocks later, Mescher was looking at cracks that had shaped around the door frames and crept up walls.
