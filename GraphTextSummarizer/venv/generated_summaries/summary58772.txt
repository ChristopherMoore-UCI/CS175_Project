The equipment had been used to operate on a patient now suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the state Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday. An autopsy to confirm the illness -- which differs from variant CJD commonly known as "mad cow disease" -- was being conducted at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center, the hospital said. "Our concern is with the health and well-being of the eight patients who may have been exposed to CJD," Dr. Joseph Pepe, the hospital's CEO, said in a statement issued with the state agency Wednesday. Most medical devices are sterilized by heat, but the World Health Organization recommends the use of a caustic chemical like sodium hydroxide to disinfect equipment that may have come in contact with tissues that could cause CJD. CJD strikes fewer than 400 people a year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
