-- Security forces patrolled deserted streets in Gabon's capital as citizens of the west African nation awaited official presidential results amid growing fears of violence, witnesses told CNN on Thursday. Local media reports indicated that the younger Bongo had won, but CNN was unable to confirm those results. "The Gabonese have come out of 42 years of dictatorship; they don't care who will be the next president, as long as it is not Bongo," Andriankoto Ratozamanana told CNN by phone from the capital, Libreville. Voters in the oil-rich nation went to the polls Sunday to elect a successor to President Omar Bongo, who died in June after more than four decades in office. Bongo, main opposition leader Pierre Mamboundou and former interior minister Andre Mba Obame have all claimed victory.
