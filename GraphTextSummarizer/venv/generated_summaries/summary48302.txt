Some actions that Stoddard said investigators found curious: â€¢ Ross and Leanna Harris took turns dropping off and picking up their son at day care, and on the day Cooper died, Leanna arrived and was told that Cooper hadn't been dropped off that morning. The defense also cited the governor's program to explain several Internet searches Ross and Leanna Harris conducted in the days before Cooper died. Stoddard also said that messages between Leanna and Ross Harris indicated the two were having financial problems and that Leanna had made complaints about some purchases Ross had made. The day care workers told police they tried to tell her that there could be a multitude of reasons that Cooper wasn't dropped off, but she insisted that Ross left him in the vehicle, Stoddard testified Thursday at a probable cause hearing for Ross Harris. We haven't heard from Leanna Harris, but Ross Harris told police he was happily married, according to background in one of many search warrants issued in the case.
