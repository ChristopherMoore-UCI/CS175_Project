Judge Jose Castro is leading the investigation at a local court in Palma de Mallorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands. Urdangarin, an Olympic medalist in handball, led a private foundation that secured contracts from regional governments to promote sports and tourism. The magistrate brought preliminary charges against the princess in April last year but they were dropped in May, after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court, citing insufficient evidence. -- Preliminary charges of financial corruption have been filed against Spain's Princess Cristina for a second time by a judge investigating her husband for alleged diversion of public funds. But Castro continued his investigation and has now decided to bring preliminary charges again.
