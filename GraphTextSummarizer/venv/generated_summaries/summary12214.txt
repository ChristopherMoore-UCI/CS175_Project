Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not deny a report that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro "not to ever second guess me again" on how to deal with Hamas, though he said the report did not reflect the general "tone and substance" of the calls. Though officials tend to sing from the same song sheet in public, there is a clear behind-the-scenes tension between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations over many issues, sources tell CNN -- including whether Israel's military operations in Gaza are excessive and resulting in preventable civilian deaths. "I think the United States has been terrific." Netanyahu then praised President Barack Obama's "unequivocal stand with Israel on our right to defend ourselves" as well as the "untiring efforts" of Kerry. Just 90 minutes into the 72-hour cease-fire, Israel accused Hamas of breaking it with an attack on Israeli soldiers through one of its tunnels. In his news conference Saturday night, Netanyahu attempted to lump in the Associated Press report, which neither American nor Israeli officials have denied, with a supposed transcript of a phone call between Obama and Netanyahu that has been widely rejected as bogus by officials in both governments.
