This is not about setting school dress codes, which schools certainly have the right to do. "Wasatch High School and Wasatch County School District are evaluating the practice of photo editing of pictures as it now stands and will make a determination on further use of the practice. Now that the yearbook has been distributed, several female students are complaining that their pictures were altered to show less skin without their knowledge, according to CNN affiliate KSTU. But the high school asserts that a large sign -- 4 feet by 5 feet -- warned all students of the policy at picture day last fall, the school said on its Facebook page. For now, students will have to live forever with what they describe as unflattering photos in their yearbook.
