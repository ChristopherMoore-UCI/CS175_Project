Mourinho: 'No story' in Real Madrid exit rumors Meanwhile, the pressure continues to build on Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho after he all but conceded defeat in the race for the title. For Barcelona, victory over Atletico would place it nine points clear of its closest title rival and surely allow the Catalan club to wrestle the title away from defending champion Real Madrid. Magic Messi extends record streak Atletico and Falcao -- the pretenders to Barcelona and Messi's crown. Falcao then went close again after firing narrowly wide when well placed, while Messi seemed to vanish as Atletico took control of the contest. Messi fit to resume bid for goal record After taking the ball in his stride, Falcao burst past Barcelona's central defenders before lifting the ball over the stranded Victor Valdes to net his 17th league goal of the season.
