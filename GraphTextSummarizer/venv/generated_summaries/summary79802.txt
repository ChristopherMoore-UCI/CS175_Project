Tensions over the killings of Israeli teens and Palestinian boys marked the run-up to the military conflict  in Gaza between Israel and Hamas this summer, which took dozens of Israeli lives and more than 2,100 Palestinian lives. In October, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. Days later, Israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by Palestinians to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. Israeli security officers opened fire on the Palestinian teenager. A Palestinian teenage girl with a knife assaulted an Israeli man Monday in the West Bank, adding another attack to a chain of ethnic violence.
