Eventually I would be placed at the Boys Town group home in Washington under the leadership of Hubert and Chauna Geter, who revealed to me what the meaning of true love, patience and nourishment truly means. This summer, I had the pleasure of interning on Capitol Hill under Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland for the Congressional Coalition on Adoptions Institute's Foster Youth Internship Program. At that moment, I lost the one person who meant the world to me, my father, Thomas McRae Sr. I was left with this man so that he could take care of me. Instead, he paid other people to take care of me.
