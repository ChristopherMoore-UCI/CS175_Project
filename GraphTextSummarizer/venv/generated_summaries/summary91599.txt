Watershed moments Opening speeches by Mandela and other leaders were generally non-combative policy statements until South African President F. W. de Klerk, exercising his privilege to go last, attacked the ANC for refusing to disband its armed wing and turn over weapons. During the question period after Mandela spoke, I asked about his recent criticism of the South African media as biased against the ANC. At the party's first legal conference in South Africa in December 1990, he lectured activists calling for a halt in secret talks between ANC leaders and the white government aimed at setting up formal negotiations. In an angry voice, he berated the foreign media for failing to report on what he called unfair treatment the ANC received from South African newspapers. After the 1993 assassination of Chris Hani, a popular communist firebrand considered a possible future ANC leader, Mandela appeared on state-run national television to urge calm among his black supporters.
