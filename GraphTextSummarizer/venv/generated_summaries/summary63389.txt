But by using X-ray phase contrast tomography -- a 3-D technique used in medicine for soft biological tissue -- they have been able to reveal writing on the tightly wrapped scrolls without unrolling them, wrote a team led by Vito Mocella of the Naples-based Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems of the National Council of Research. "This attempt opens up new opportunities to read many Herculaneum papyri, which are still rolled up, thus enhancing our knowledge of ancient Greek literature and philosophy," they wrote. The team looked at two scrolls given to Napoleon in 1802, burnt by volcanic gases reaching about 600 degrees Fahrenheit, and were able to discern a handful of Greek letters through the X-ray technology. The scrolls, which were buried in a Herculaneum library and excavated 260 years ago, are easily damaged or destroyed by unwrapping, so researchers have been unable to read them without risk. One of them, the University of Michigan's Richard Janko, told The New York Times we might find works thought lost to history.
