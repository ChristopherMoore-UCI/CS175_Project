For men like Abu Mohamad, who, like other refugees, prefers not to be identified by his full name, there wasn't much choice but to adjust to their new lives, new livelihoods and new ways of doing things. At least in Zaatari -- which, within its packed 1.3 square miles, is already one of the world's largest refugee camps and ranks as Jordan's fourth largest city, according to the United Nations -- refugees have taken matters into their own hands by transforming their new home. This doesn't necessarily make up for the larger strain that refugees have had on Jordan's economy, with an April 2014 International Monetary Fund report calling the overall impact "negative." Thinking outside the box becomes a necessity when you're essentially living in boxes like Abu Mohamad and more than 83,000 others like him, who fled their homes in war-ravaged Syria and settled across the border in northern Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp. "They realized they were going to be in Jordan longer than they first thought," U.N. refugee agency official Nasser Touaibia said.
