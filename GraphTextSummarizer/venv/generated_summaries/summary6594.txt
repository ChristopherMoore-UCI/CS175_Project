During a recent interview with entertainer and humanitarian Harry Belafonte for my TV One Cable Network show, "Washington Watch," he said that even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. recognized the benefit of anger in a social justice movement. But if we're going to see a true change in this nation when it comes to social justice and the legal system, it will have to be led by young people. The shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and its galvanizing effect on African-Americans has often been compared to the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till. It is going to require a 21st-century Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, the fearless, passionate and successful group that played a vital role in the civil rights movement, only to fall victim to more militant voices toward the end of the 1960s. Belafonte, who was an adviser and funder to SNCC while also being a confidant to Dr. King, said the only way we are going to see a truly changed America is if the nation's young rise up in a moral army for good and righteousness.
