-- Bangladesh's Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to keep his position as managing director of the bank he founded. In a statement issued last month, Yunus said he strongly believes Grameen will continue to work to empower the poor, especially women in rural areas. Grameen's work cast a global spotlight on microcredit, a then-novel idea of making small loans to poor people who would not qualify for standard bank loans. For their efforts, Yunus and Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. "Opportunity has to be created to hand over the charge of Grameen Bank in a happy environment so that it could achieve its objectives," Yunus said.
