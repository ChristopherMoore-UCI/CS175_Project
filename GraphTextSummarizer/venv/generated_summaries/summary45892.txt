On Monday, the show received one more set of honors: a slew of nods at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, including the Emmy for outstanding drama series. Noting that the awards show was on a Monday night in August -- so it didn't conflict with Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards and an NFL game on Emmy network NBC -- the host noted that could only mean one thing: It's "about to get canceled. The AMC series -- about a chemistry teacher-turned-drug lord who rides a powerful methamphetamine called "Blue" to wealth and pain -- concluded its triumphant run last year as one of the most-lauded TV series of all time: the story of "Mr. Chips turning into Scarface," as creator Vince Gilligan liked to describe it. She also won last year. "Breaking Bad's" win wasn't its first; it also won best drama last year.
