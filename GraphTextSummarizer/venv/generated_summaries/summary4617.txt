I also missed watching Neil Armstrong step foot on the moon and the first space shuttle take off for the stars. I will always wonder what it was like to huddle around a shortwave radio and through the crackling static from space hear the faint beeps of the world's first satellite -- It's like the set for a George Lucas movie floating to the edge of space. You and I will have the chance to watch a man take a leap into an unimaginable free fall from the edge of space -- live. The balloon will slowly drift to the edge of space at 120,000 feet (22.7 miles/36.53 kilometers).
