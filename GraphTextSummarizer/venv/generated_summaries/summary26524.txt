Daniel Donovan, the prosecutor in the case surrounding the death of an African American man at the hands of a white police officer, was endorsed by the Staten Island Republican Party this weekend as their pick to replace resigned GOP Rep. Michael Grimm, according to local reports. Grimm won a decisive victory despite the cloud of controversy hanging over him after he was indicted last spring on 20 counts, including the tax fraud charge to which he ultimately pleaded guilty, which could result in jail time. Party Chairman John Antoniello chose Donovan after interviewing both him and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who has also expressed interest in the seat. Donovan was prosecutor in the case in which the grand jury decided not to indict the police officer, a decision that fueled further anger and protests from Americans nationwide frustrated by what they see as the unfair treatment of minorities by law enforcement. Though the Brooklyn Republican Party has yet to endorse a candidate and has informally expressed support for Malliotakis, Staten Island makes up the vast majority of the district's population, and the SIGOP's endorsement all but ensures Donovan will win the GOP primary outright.
