Event organizers have designated Colbert, who is a native of Charleston, S.C., Honorary Captain of the Fleet. Colbert, the host of American political satire show "The Colbert Report," said in a statement Friday. Colbert will take part in the 777-mile Charleston Bermuda Race in May, organizers of the event have announced. Held every two years, the first-to-finish in Bermuda competition is open to sailors with boats that are at least 30-feet long. The Charleston Bermuda Race is described by organizers as a "romp through subtropical waters."
