Margaret Gould Stewart, the company's director of product design, explained Facebook's softened approach to humanizing its customers at the Atlantic Technology Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. That can help Facebook employees create better products for those advertisers and be more invested in figuring out why a campaign did or didn't take off with Facebook users (sorry, people). Facebook wants you to know it doesn't see customers as a mass of faceless moneymaking advertising targets. And that, of course, will make it a little easier to serve people ads. Facebook has an empathy team that designs programs to help engineers and designers understand what it means to be an advertiser or small business -- an experience Stewart says they cannot immediately relate to.
