Schalke's erratic season continued as the Champions League semifinalists lost 1-0 at home to Kaiserslautern ahead of Tuesday's visit by English leaders Manchester United. Defending champions Bayern could not return to third place, being held at Eintracht Frankfurt, and face a battle for the final Champions League spot with Hannover -- who beat Freiburg 3-1 on Thursday. Leverkusen came from behind to beat mid-table Hoffenheim, who led in the 28th minute when Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigursson went past three men before before beating goalkeeer Rene Adler. Bayern needed a controversial late penalty to salvage a point at struggling Eintracht Frankfurt, who took the lead nine minutes after halftime. Dortmund would have clinched a first German crown since 2002 with victory against the Bundesliga's bottom team if Leverkusen had drawn or lost.
