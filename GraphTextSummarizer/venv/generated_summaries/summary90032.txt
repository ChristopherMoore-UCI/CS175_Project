The money from blood diamonds can end up funding rebel violence, the Kimberley Process group said. "I can confirm that there has been illegal mining taking place in Zimbabwe, but we seem to be getting on top of the situation now," said Kembo Mohadi, Zimbabwe's co-minister of home affairs. The armed forces also are accused of funneling money from diamond fields to President Robert Mugabe's party. -- Illegal diamond mining by Zimbabwean troops is leading to bloodshed and attacks against civilians, said a global watchdog group formed to cut the flow of so-called "blood diamonds." Separately, Human Rights Watch has accused the armed forces of funneling money from the fields into ZANU-PF, President Robert Mugabe's party.
