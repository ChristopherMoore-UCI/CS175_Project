-- Authorities believe at least one person not in custody may have information about the deaths of eight people in a Georgia mobile home, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said Sunday. Autopsies on the victims were taking place Sunday in Savannah, Georgia, Doering said. Doering remained tight-lipped Sunday about many aspects of the case, refusing to say how the victims died or to give a breakdown of male and female victims. Police have "no known suspects," Doering told reporters Sunday afternoon. Volunteers conducted an extended search of the area around the mobile home, but nothing was found, Doering said.
