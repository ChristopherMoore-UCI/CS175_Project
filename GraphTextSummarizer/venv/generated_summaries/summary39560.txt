Now, we are using platforms like social media to speak out against consistent appropriation of Native culture or to collectively oppose offensive Native American imagery. These events are significant because Native American voices are often marginalized, ignored or simply left out of the American conversation. But Native American nations are diverse, and recent visibility in the news offers a chance to see a wider range of who we are. Now, more than ever, Native Americans are visible in ways they have not been in the past, erasing the antiquated image of a mythical, loin-cloth-clad Tonto figure and giving voice to real American Indians. Due to a complex history and interconnected issues, many tribes face poverty unlike other American ethnic groups and have the highest dropout rates.
