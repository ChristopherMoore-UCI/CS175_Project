Mayang Prasetyo, an Indonesian living and working in the city, was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend, Marcus Peter Volke, who later took his own life, local media has reported. Voke's mother told Brisbane media that he and Prasetyo were "starting to get settled" in Brisbane after an itinerant life aboard cruise ships. Australian media reported that she was working as a "high class prostitute" and using her earnings to fund the education of family members in Indonesia. Police said they found "various body parts" cooking in chemicals, according to reports. The Brisbane Times reported that Volke was an "outspoken opponent" of violence against women, and animal cruelty.
