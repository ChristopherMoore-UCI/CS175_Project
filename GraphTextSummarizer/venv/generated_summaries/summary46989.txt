Border police made 49 arrests at Rome's Fiumicino airport, with another 37 in major Italian airports including Bari, Bologna, Milan Linate, Naples, Palermo and Verona, the Italian National Police said in a statement Friday. The accused have been charged with criminal offenses including theft, aggravated theft and damage, since the luggage that they were not able to open was sometimes damaged out of spite, police said. So the news that dozens of baggage handlers working for the major Italian airline Alitalia have been arrested over alleged theft from passengers' luggage may confirm their worst fears. The alleged thefts took place on board the aircraft during the loading and unloading of baggage, police said. The 18-month-long investigation began after people reported that objects were stolen from their luggage at the airport of Lamezia Terme, police said.
