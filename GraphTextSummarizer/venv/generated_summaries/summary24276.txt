A day after South Sudan withdrew from the disputed region, it accused Sudan of launching ground and aerial attacks on its territory. Col. Philip Aguer, a spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army of South Sudan, said eight bombs were dropped in Unity state Saturday. South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. Simmering tensions peaked this month when South Sudan seized the oil-producing region of Heglig from Sudan, raising the stakes by targeting a resource that fuels the economies of both nations. Sudan claims ownership for the region, and lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory.
