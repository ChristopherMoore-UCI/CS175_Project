To finish the day, at 1715 three European Prime Ministers -- Italy's Enrico Letta, Irish Enda Kenny and Sweden's Fredrik Reinfeldt will join Jose Manuel Barroso, the President of European Commission to discuss Europe's transitioning from crisis response to -- hopefully -- crafting a long-term strategy for competitiveness. With growth rates at half their pre-crisis levels, concerns arise that the golden age of emerging markets growth may be over. Former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Goldman Sachs chairman Peter D. Sutherland and European Parliament's President Martin Schulz will be giving their insight on the topic. Peter Maurer, the president of International Red Cross, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres will discuss what more can the international community do to respond to this urgent humanitarian crisis.
