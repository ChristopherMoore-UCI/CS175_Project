" From Snow to Omar to Ol' Dirty Bastard, Williams believes he has found his calling. From there, Williams reached out the director, asked to be an executive producer and offered to do what he could to promote the film and tell Snow's story, which he got to know more of when they met in tha Bluff. It cost me." Williams said he also dealt with his own "racism" with "The Wire," especially when the first season with a predominantly black cast was followed with a second season with more white characters. Williams is probably best known for his role as gay stick-up boy Omar Little on HBO's "The Wire" and currently plays bootlegger Chalky White on "Boardwalk Empire." With that success has been the ability to help bring awareness to the real people behind "Snow on tha Bluff" and the chance to bring a real human element to the story of Ol' Dirty Bastard in film "Dirty White Boy."
