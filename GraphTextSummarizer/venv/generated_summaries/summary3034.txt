The men are in custody at the Rainbow Bridge, a checkpoint on the border at Niagara Falls, and are being interviewed by federal authorities, Massachusetts State Police David Procopio said. -- Three Afghan National Army officers -- guests of the U.S. military at a training exercise in Massachusetts -- disappeared on Saturday and reappeared Monday in the custody of Canadian border guards. The military, State Department and other government agencies are remaining especially quiet about the choice the three Afghan officers made to go off the radar. Shelbe Benson-Fuller, regional press officer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency was notified by the Canadian Border Services Agency when the men were taken into custody. The purpose of the exercise is to train participating nations in "stability operations" and "operations conducted during United Nations mandated peacekeeping operations," according to the guard.
