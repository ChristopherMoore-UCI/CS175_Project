The news seems to echo Fox rebooting its action franchise "24" for a limited series to launch this May, though NBC has long been fond of recycling prior TV hits â€” there have been short-lived new version of "Bionic Woman," "American Gladiators," "Knight Rider," and the network had also developed (but not aired) new editions of "Wonder Woman" and "Murder She Wrote." Reviving "Heroes," which was canceled four years ago, might be met with some mixed feelings by the show's fans, however. But with broadcast drama TV ratings on the decline, networks are increasingly turning to event series to grab attention, and brands that were cancelled years ago now seem like potential hits even if they only deliver a large percentage of their previous audience. "The enormous impact 'Heroes' had on the television landscape when it first launched in 2006 was eye-opening," said NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke. Original series creator Tim Kring is on board to run the show. "Heroes" lives: NBC helped kickstart the superhero TV trend in 2006 with "Heroes," an X-Men-ish action-drama about a group of people with superhuman powers.
