Authorities have strong evidence that Bashir played a role in establishing a terror cell and a militant training camp in Aceh province, said National Police spokesman Inspector General Edward Aritonang. He was detained early Monday in West Java and was later brought to the National Police Headquarters for further questioning. Police raided that camp in February and arrested dozens of militants who were allegedly planning terror attacks in Indonesia similar to those that took place in Mumbai, India, in 2008. They would not arrest him for the third time otherwise," said terrorism expert Sidney Jones of the International Crisis Group, a non-profit that works to prevent and resolve deadly conflict. -- An Islamic cleric was arrested Monday for playing a key role in the establishment of a militant training camp in Indonesia's Aceh region, authorities said.
