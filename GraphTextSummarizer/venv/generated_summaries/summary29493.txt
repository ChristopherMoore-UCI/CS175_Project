The CIA's proposed plan, according to the newspaper, was to produce the dolls, with their bright red faces and spooky green eyes, and hand them out to children in Afghanistan in hopes of turning them away from the al Qaeda leader. "The action figure idea was proposed and rejected by CIA before it got past the prototype stage," said Dean Boyd, CIA spokesman. Levine helped develop the G.I. Joe action figure. But the agency aborted the plan after reviewing three prototypes of the doll, a CIA spokesman told CNN. The spy agency began quietly developing the bin Laden doll in 2005, as first reported by The Washington Post, and recruited the help of the former head of the Hasbro toy company, Donald Levine.
