Djokovic, who had to retire with heat exhaustion against Andy Roddick when defending his 2008 crown, has become renowned for his supreme fitness levels and claims to be ready for any challenge. Wawrinka extended Djokovic in a five-set fourth round clash last year which many considered the outstanding match of 2013. If he can get the better of conditions, it is likely that both Roger Federer then Nadal would stand in his path if he wants to repeat last year's men's final showdown with Djokovic. Sharapova, playing her first grand slam since Wimbledon last year, remains wary of conditions after being reminded of her 2007 three-setter against France's Camille Pin, after which she made her outburst. -- Maria Sharapova once labeled the conditions as "inhuman" and three-time defending men's champion Novak Djokovic suffered a dramatic meltdown in a quarterfinal match in 2009 so it's with a degree of trepidation that the world's elite go into the Australian Open with a heatwave forecast for Melbourne.
