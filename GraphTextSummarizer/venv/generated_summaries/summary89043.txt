-- Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Yousuf has quit international cricket after he was hit with an indefinite suspension. "I have no issues or axes to grind with team mates, however I am disappointed with my treatment by those in authority and that is the reason why I want to retire from international cricket. "It was never my intention to suddenly stop playing international cricket like this and I feel that I still have 2 or 3 years international cricket left in me and could have gone on playing for Pakistan. A story on the PCB's official Web site quoted Yousuf as saying: "The level of support shown to me since the ban by the fans has really touched me and I appreciate all the messages of support I have received. Yousuf was given the ban earlier this month by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after they launched an inquiry into a winless tour to Australia.
