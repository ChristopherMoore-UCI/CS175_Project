Here's a look at what Obama has learned about Syria in the past year: 1) Syrian President Bashar al-Assad isn't going anywhere "I have resisted calls for military action, because we cannot resolve someone else's civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan," Obama said last year. It's true that some of Assad's opponents are extremists," Obama said of al Qaeda fighters who worked against the Syrian government. Instead, the Syrian leader got help from Hezbollah in Lebanon and, indirectly, from ISIS fighters who formed out of al Qaeda affiliates to seize the advantage over what U.S. and allied officials call the moderate opposition in Syria. -- A year later, President Barack Obama will likely talk differently about Syria. He added that failure to respond militarily to al-Assad's use of chemical weapons would allow al Qaeda to "draw strength in a more chaotic Syria."
