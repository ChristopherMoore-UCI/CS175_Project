South Korea started the match brightly and took the lead on 23 minutes after Japan defender Yasuyuki Konno brought down Manchester United star Park Ji-sung in the penalty area. Carl Valeri made it five eight minutes from time as he turned home McKay's cross and Uzbekistan's misery was complete when Kruse's shot squirmed past Juraev. Carney added the third on 65 minutes when he tucked the ball under Uzbek goalkeeper Temur Juraev after Matt McKay's precise pass. Coach Alberto Zaccheroni's side triumphed 3-0 on penalties after the game was level at 1-1 after 90 minutes and 2-2 after extra time. It was 4-0 less than ten minutes later as Australia sprang the offside trap and substitute Robbie Kruse squared for Brett Emerton to tap into an empty net.
