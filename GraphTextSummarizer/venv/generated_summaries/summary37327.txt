-- A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck early Wednesday off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, but witnesses reported only minor shaking on land. The quake was centered in the northern Indian Ocean, more than 400 km (250 miles) off northern Sumatra and more than 29 km (18 miles) beneath the surface. The quake hit at 12:37 a.m. Wednesday (1:37 p.m. Tuesday ET), according to the USGS. The region is highly active seismically, and a magnitude 9.1 quake in December 2004 generated a tsunami that killed people as far away as eastern Africa. There were no immediate reports of damage, and hotel clerks contacted by CNN reported only mild shaking.
