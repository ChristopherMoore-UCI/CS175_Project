The word usually refers to castrated men, but it has many meanings, and one of them is "an ineffectual, powerless, or unmasculine man." Of course, the Episcopal Church (to which I belong) has been open to gay marriage (and clergy, as well) for a long time. Only a week ago, former President Jimmy Carter -- a lifelong Baptist and Sunday school teacher -- spoke out for gay rights at a college in Michigan. Certainly, there has been a lot of discussion of this topic among gay Christians. Even Christians -- who once stood uniformly against same-sex marriage -- have become more comfortable with the idea, and, one by one, mainstream churches have begun to reconsider it.
