Blessings in a Backpack provides food for elementary school children across America who may otherwise have little or no food to eat on the weekends during the school year, for only $100 per child per year. Our organization has developed from feeding children in need from five schools on the weekends to creating vegetable gardens at school where they learn to grow fresh vegetables that they can then take home with them, to providing the children with a monthly allowance so they can choose their own books, to setting up field trips to broaden their horizons. We began to question how on earth children could possibly be expected to perform at school without having adequate nutrition. Thanks to the federally funded food program, many American children in need receive free breakfasts and lunches at school. But it was in 2009 when we had our first child, Leo, that the immediacy of the food-behaviour correlation, particularly in children, really jumped out at us.
