Savio had told Kernc that after Peterson left she immediately called several people, including friend and neighbor Mary Pontarelli, and told them about the knife incident. Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, whom he would later marry. Peterson, 58, is on trial, charged with the murder of Savio, his third wife, who was found dead in her dry, clean bathtub March 1, 2004. At the time of her death, which authorities initially treated as an accident, a court was mulling how the couple's marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. " Kernc testified that Savio told her verbally that Peterson threatened her with a knife, but that she didn't include it when she wrote her statement.
