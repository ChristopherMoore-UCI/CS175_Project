RISE China, the private international education company that invited me to China and for which I am a compensated senior adviser, focuses on teaching idiomatic English to Chinese students to help them get into American universities. I just returned from a trip to Beijing, where I spoke with Chinese parents about the value of American education, where we excel and where we fall short. -- American higher education is in the cross hairs of a heated national debate over the value and cost of a college degree. Not surprising was the extent to which the Chinese value education, especially primary and secondary education, and yearn for their children to attend American universities, and if possible, stay in America. Third, to the Chinese people, American universities, for all their shortcomings and blemishes, are still beacons of freedom, individualism and self-improvement.
