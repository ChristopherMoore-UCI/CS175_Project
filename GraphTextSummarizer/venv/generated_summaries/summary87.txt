On Sunday, Argentina fans, both with and without tickets, invaded Gate D of the Maracana stadium ahead of their team's 2-1 World Cup win over Bosnia-Herzegovina in Group F. An O Globo video showed fans in Argentina shirts climbing a wall and running through an open gate before stadium staff were able to close it. The Maracana suffered its second fan 'invasion' in the space of four days as Chilean fans tried to storm the stadium ahead of their team's key World Cup group game against Spain. "The organizers of the 2014 FIFA World Cup condemn these acts of violence. " CNN anchor Alex Thomas posted pictures on Instagram of a shattered glass door as well as damage to the media center. Fans without tickets tried to force entry into the stadium, breaking fences and overrunning security, while also damaging the media center.
