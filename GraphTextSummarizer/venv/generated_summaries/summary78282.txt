Rather than study World Cup football, I had to deal with the police, change locks, etc. When CNN Johannesburg Bureau Chief Kim Norgaard suggested I fly from Zurich to Cairo to cover the arrival of the World Cup trophy in Africa in the lead-up to the games in South Africa next summer, I thought he was joking. The chances are slim that either of us will ever be on a winning World Cup team, and slimmer still that either of us will become head of state. Â» Flying from Cairo to Zurich, where FIFA or the International Federation of Football Associations is headquartered, I finally found time to learn a few things about the object that would be my travel companion from Switzerland back to Egypt. As it turned out I didn't have much time to prepare because someone broke into our house in Cairo the day before I was scheduled to depart.
