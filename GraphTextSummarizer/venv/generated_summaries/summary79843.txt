None of that may have happened, however, if Lugar had paid more attention to Indiana Republicans in recent years. "It all adds up," said GOP pollster John McLaughlin, who helped Lugar in the past but is working for Mourdock this time. The operative noted that Lugar rarely if ever showed up to local Republican Party events in recent years. In contrast, the operative said, Indiana's other GOP senator, Dan Coats, assiduously courted grassroots activists and local party leaders when he decided to return to elected office in Indiana after more than a decade working as a diplomat and a Washington lobbyist. The 80-year-old pillar of Washington's foreign policy establishment lost his Indiana GOP primary battle to a younger, hungrier and more politically attuned conservative challenger, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock.
