-- The stadium at the heart of the 2012 London Olympics is set to be transformed into a football ground once the Games have finished, after English Premier League side West Ham were named as the preferred future residents of the venue on Friday. The decision ends a period of jostling between West Ham and -- Premier League and London rivals -- Tottenham Hotspur, who were also hoping to relocate to the arena after the Olympics. The news is a blow for fifth-placed top flight side Tottenham, who had wished to expand beyond their current facilities at White Hart Lane, with the financial help of American entertainment firm AEG. "We have made a unanimous recommendation to back West Ham as the long-term tenant," OPLC chairwoman Margaret Ford said at a press conference. And in Berlin the 74, 500 capacity Olympicstadion -- built for the Olympics held in the city in 1936 -- is home to German second division side Hertha BSC.
