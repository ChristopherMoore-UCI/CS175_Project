Opinion: Horse meat scandal shines spotlight on murky horse trade "Based on that testing, we learned ingredients supplied to us from one supplier in Europe tested positive for horse meat," he said. -- Fast food giant Taco Bell said Friday it has taken beef off the menu in its three UK outlets after tests on ground beef from a European supplier revealed traces of horse meat. Horse meat is not harmful in itself but authorities are concerned by its unauthorized presence in case it is tainted with a veterinary drug used to treat horses. The discovery of rogue horse meat in a wide range of beef products has thrown the European meat industry into disarray in recent weeks. Taco Bell UK has informed the UK Food Standards Agency, which has been leading the investigation into unauthorized horse meat in Britain, he said.
