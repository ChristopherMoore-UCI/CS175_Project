Civil liberties attorneys with the Institute for Justice, who recently filed a class action lawsuit against Philadelphia authorities for abusing the law, say, "Civil forfeiture is something that is an assault upon fundamental notions of private property ownership and due process. Authorities said the house was tied to illegal drugs and therefore subject to civil forfeiture. " The DA's office also says it works directly with citizens, the police, government agencies, and community groups in an effort to abate or close drug properties. Unlike criminal forfeiture, the civil law allows authorities to seize property without the owner ever being convicted or even charged. The Philadelphia District Attorney's office told CNN it seizes property only as a last resort, and added that it is limited in what it can currently say because of the pending litigation.
