Smartphone owners and younger owners (age 18-24) of any kind of cell phone are twice as likely to have had this experience. According to Pew: â€¢ 41% of cell phone owners back up at least the photos, contacts, and other files from their phone. Many mobile security services also offer location tracking for lost phones, and give you the option of remotely locking or wiping data from a lost or stolen phone. According to Pew's report, 54% of cell phone users in the U.S. have decided not to install an app once they discovered how much of their personal information it would access. Still, having a phone go missing doesn't necessarily make cell phone users more cautious.
