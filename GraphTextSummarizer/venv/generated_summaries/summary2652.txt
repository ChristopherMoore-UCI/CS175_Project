Yomken is a politically neutral organization, says Taha, but the security situation after the recent military coup that removed Mohamed Morsy as Egypt's president did paralyze work. A lack of financial support and, crucially, mentorship is something that Absi believes is holding back creative projects and nascent start-ups in the region. "The designers brought by Yomken have shown me new designs and I was convinced to try (them). "It will help democratise creativity." Absi believes the key to making this happen is education and outreach because some "creative communities are not very tech savvy ... and they don't know about the opportunity they can have from crowdfunding." Another crowdfunding platform to emerge in the region is Cairo-based Yomken. "There are many projects in the Arab world that don't have the right connections (to) fund them," said Absi.
