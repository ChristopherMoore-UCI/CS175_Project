These hopefuls failed to get any tickets during the first two rounds of ticket selling for London 2012. Organizers hope this will ease criticism they faced when many people with UK addresses were unable to buy tickets during the first two rounds, due to high demand. Most people from outside the UK will continue to have to buy tickets through authorized resellers in each country ahead of the Olympics' opening ceremony on July 27. -- British sports fans who struck out twice trying to land Olympic tickets will get a third chance starting Friday. Similarly priced tickets will be made available for access to the Wimbledon Hill and big screen during Olympic tennis matches.
