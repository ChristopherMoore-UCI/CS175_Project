"There's incident after incident within the last six months (that) might seem like small things, but when you put them all together, in a relatively short period of time, it really tells you how poorly this pipeline is being maintained," Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, told CNN in an interview to air on tonigh't "AC360" Stupak said the biggest and most troubling incident by far was a shutdown of the pipeline caused when both the main power and the backup power failed during a routine systems test at a spot called Pump Station 9, about 10 miles from Delta Junction. According to Alaska state Rep. David Guttenberg, who once worked as a construction worker for Alyeska, the company also wants to move its most valuable engineers and safety experts to company headquarters in Anchorage, far from the pipeline. CNN was told by Alyeska's chief of security in Fairbanks that a crew could videotape Pump Station 9 from the company parking lot so long as they ventured no farther. Stupak said no one from Alyeska noticed because Pump Station 9 was unmanned -- part of a plan by the pipeline operator to reduce manpower. Later, Alyeska Vice President of Operations Mike Joynor told CNN that he was unaware of the incident.
