Her father, Brian Carter, says she'd been taught about the plight of endangered animals, and burst out crying when she heard rhinos were being butchered by poachers. "If they find a rhino lying dead, they can sniff out where the poachers are," explains Alyssa Carter -- allowing rangers track poachers, just as the poachers themselves stalk prey. Picture perfect It all started in May 2013 when Carter -- then aged six-and-a-half -- came home from school and drew a picture: the same crayon image of long-horned rhino beneath a rainbow that is now stamped on her campaign's sweets and chocolate. There, across an area the size of New Jersey, park rangers fight a desperate battle with poachers to prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros, whose horn is prized for its supposed value in traditional Asian medicines. At Kruger, South Africa's largest wildlife reserve, park authorities report an increase in contact with suspected poachers, with rangers claiming before Christmas that 164 had been arrested in the park over the year.
