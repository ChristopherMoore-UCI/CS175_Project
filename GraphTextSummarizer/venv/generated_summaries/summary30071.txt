This is bare bones storytelling in more ways than one, though Carnahan can't resist injecting stray purple pronouncements of existential angst (I kept hoping that one of the guys would get hold of the letter Neeson has stashed in his pocket, the one where he tells the girl who got away he's exiled himself to live with the dregs of humanity, "Ex cons, misfits, a*******... men unfit for mankind"). Any animal expert could tell you that timber wolves are more likely to run in the opposite direction than give chase to humans. Even though nothing later comes close to it for enterprise or excitement, "The Grey" remains a genuinely gripping survival story and a refreshing change from stale urban action flicks: "Jaws" on paws. Interspersing exciting action sequences with tense slogs through hostile terrain, the movie has the structure of a classic western, with wolves standing in for outlaws or Indians. They include an angry, macho Latino (Frank Grillo), a boring nice guy (Dermot Mulroney) and an ailing black guy (Nonso Anozie) who might as well have "Kibble" tattooed to his forehead.
