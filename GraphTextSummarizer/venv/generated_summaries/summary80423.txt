As they've trickled out, accounts of the bloody attacks on the northern Nigerian town of Baga and surrounding villages have shocked even those all too used to reports of violence by Boko Haram militants. That's according to a series of satellite images released Thursday by Amnesty International, which the rights group said shows the "horrific scale" of the devastation wrought by Boko Haram militants. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. "Of all Boko Haram assaults analysed by Amnesty International, this is the largest and most destructive yet. In a rare piece of good news, Nigerian soldiers thwarted a Boko Haram attack Wednesday in the town of Biu, in southern Borno state, the military said.
