But two double-bogeys and another dropped shot in his first six holes left last weekend's World Match Play Championship runner-up struggling before he rallied with four birdies on the back nine of the revamped Wentworth course. " Zanotti, twice a runner-up in minor tour events, bounced back from four bogeys in his first seven holes to reel off five in a row and then another at 16 to also sign for a 69. Donald, who needs to finish ahead of top-ranked Lee Westwood to go to the summit for the first time, had begun the day level with the 18-year-old Italian and Spain's Alvaro Quiros. Westwood was tied for third on three under with Paraguayan surprise package Fabrizio Zanotti after a second successive 69 kept alive his hopes of a first win in the tour's flagship event. " Manassero also carded a one-over-par 72 to be five-under 208, with last season's European Tour rookie of the year mixing three bogeys with two birdies on his front nine.
