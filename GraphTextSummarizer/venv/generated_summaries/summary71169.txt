"I wish to state categorically that I have nothing to hide from the public at large, and as a proof of my bona fides, I intend to write to the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee that I shall be happy to appear before the PAC if it chooses to ask me to do so," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a speech at a national meeting of the ruling Congress party. " Opposition parties have stepped up their attacks on Singh, hailed as the father of India's economic reforms, since the country's main auditor reported in November that a sale of a second-generation wireless spectrum two years ago had been carried out at below-market prices. Raja, member of a key regional ally of Singh's Congress party, denies the charges. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report. The damning audit report came on the heels of allegations of massive fraud in sports and real estate.
