He again insisted that his plan will provide "more security and stability to those who have insurance," extend it to those who don't and slow the rate of growth in health care costs. The struggle over health care reform intensified Thursday as President Obama sought to build on what administration officials hoped was new momentum generated by his prime-time address to Congress. Businesses would also be required to either offer health care coverage to workers or contribute to covering their costs of obtaining coverage. All Americans would be required by law to have health insurance under Obama's proposal, which the administration has projected to cost $900 billion over 10 years. He reiterated his call to cap out-of-pocket costs and create a health insurance exchange in which individuals and small businesses can pool resources to help bargain for lower coverage costs.
