Garrett, 48, was arrested Monday at a downtown Los Angeles train station after police found heroin in his shoe, spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The singer did jail time four years ago after he was arrested with heroin while he stood on a subway platform at another Los Angeles transit station. Garrett was taken to the East Los Angeles sheriff's station, where he was booked and held on bond. "That was found and it was black tar heroin," Whitmore said. When deputies approached Garrett Monday morning at the Metrolink station, he was "acting in a pronounced way, shaking and sweating," Whitmore said.
