"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" reunion airs January 30, February 6, and February 13.

It's been a long time since we've seen Kim calm, in control, and subdued -- here's hoping rehab helped the troubled reality star. It's not so much of a surprise to "Housewives" fans who watched Kim's sister Kyle Richards accuse her of that very fact way back in season 1.
