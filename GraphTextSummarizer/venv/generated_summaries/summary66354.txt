Tourists stranded Ana Benavides, a stranded American tourist in nearby Acapulco, tried to leave by car. Nearby, Paulina Bravo and Teodoro Medina were cleaning up storm damage. Authorities said they hope to reopen the highway leading out of Acapulco on Friday, which would allow for thousands more to leave and quicken the flow of food and other aid to the area. An aerial survey revealed many more mudslides, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said, and there are additional reports of disappearances that authorities have not yet confirmed. The town is one of many across Mexico ravaged by multiple storms that have been battering the country.
