While students at T.C. Williams have thought about their future, many high school students have not, and leave high school unprepared for adult life. Traditionally, U.S. students receive career advice from middle and high school guidance counselors, but the report points out that under the current system, the average ratio of students to counselors is 500 to 1. "It is long past time that we broaden the range of high-quality pathways that we offer to our young people, beginning in high school," according to the Pathways to Prosperity report. "Unless we are willing to provide more flexibility and choice in the last two years of high school, and more opportunities for students to pursue program options that link work and learning, we will continue to lose far too many young people along the path to graduation," says Robert Schwartz, who heads the Pathways to Prosperity Project at Harvard. Also, the report advocates a larger role for future employers by linking classroom learning to actual jobs through paid internships, and providing more access to jobs related to the students' field of study while they are still in school.
