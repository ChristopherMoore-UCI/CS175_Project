-- Hurricane Leslie was hundreds of miles away from Bermuda Wednesday, but forecasters said the slow-moving storm could pack powerful winds as it nears the British territory. "Leslie could be a historic storm for Bermuda as it is very large and forecast to intensify rapidly as it approaches," Bermuda's Emergency Measures Organization said in a statement. The latest forecast track predicts that the storm could be within 20 miles of the island by Sunday morning, officials in Bermuda said. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), the hurricane center said. Officials said plans were in place for the storm, but advised residents to prepare for the worst.
