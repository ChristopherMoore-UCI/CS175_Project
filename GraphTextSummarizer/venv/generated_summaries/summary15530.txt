Egyptian protesters call out Morsy "These are ongoing protests about political prisoners," said Al-Qahtani, who explained that many of the demonstrators were family members of prisoners who had for years been "languishing in jail cells without due process. -- Saudi Arabian security forces dispersed and detained dozens of protesters, including women and children, who on Tuesday were urging the government to release political prisoners, according to activists. Mohammed Al-Qahtani, human rights activist and board member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, told CNN the demonstration took place in front of the offices of the Human Rights Commission on King Fahd Road in Riyadh, the country's capital. " "The government is not willing to take them to court and issue verdicts," added Al-Qahtani, a prominent Saudi activist who is currently on trial in Saudi Arabia accused of, among other things, breaking allegiance to the country's ruler and setting up an unlicensed organization. His case has brought about widespread criticism of the Saudi government by human rights groups.
