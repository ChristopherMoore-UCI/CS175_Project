-- Venezuela has revoked or denied press credentials for CNN journalists in the country, following the president's announcement he would expel CNN if it did not "rectify" its coverage of anti-government protests. " Hours later, government officials notified seven journalists for CNN International and CNN en Español that their press accreditation had been denied or revoked. While the journalists were asked to leave, CNN International and CNN en Español continue to broadcast in Venezuela. The move to revoke CNN's press credentials comes after weeks of protests that mark the largest demonstrations Maduro has faced in his 11 months in power following the death of President Hugo Chavez. "CNN has reported both sides of the tense situation in Venezuela, even with very limited access to government officials," CNN en Español said in a statement, adding that at the time its credentials were revoked, CNN was seeking an interview with the president.
