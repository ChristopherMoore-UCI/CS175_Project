The competition is in keeping with the company's goal of halving CO2 emissions by 2050, and many of the solutions could mean the future of flight is zero-emission. Overall, says Spiteri, the blend could reduce CO2 emissions by 97%. Virgin Atlantic's Sir Richard Branson is a sponsor, and according to Piccard, he is thinking of using solar power to tow aircraft onto the runway -- a process that could save up to two tons of fuel per flight.
