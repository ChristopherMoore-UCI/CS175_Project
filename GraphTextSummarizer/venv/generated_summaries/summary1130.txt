-- A militant group with links to al Qaeda claimed responsibility for a deadly wave of bombings across Iraq, strikes designed to undermine government security plans for the upcoming Arab League summit. Occurring on the ninth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the attacks were "coordinated" and launched by "Sunni lions" in Baghdad and other provinces "simultaneously," the online statement said. Al Qaeda in Iraq is a Sunni militant group in a majority Shiite country. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, made the claim in a statement posted on an al Qaeda website. While the insurgency's support and potency has eroded in Iraq, authorities believe the bombings were meant to send a message that the militant group is still able to carry out such attacks.
