That's the big guessing game for all of us and will add spice to the 2014 season." Red Bull will continue to be powered by Renault while Mercedes and Ferrari will pit their new 1.6-litre, V6 engines against the French engine manufacturer. But the car that will brush aside all others will be a car having the combination of good engine and good chassis -- if one side is letting you down you will have a problem. Adrian Newey is the man behind the Red Bull racer that has powered Sebastian Vettel and the team to four straight world championships. While these elements of the car are out of Newey's hands, the Englishman, who says he has received offers to join rival teams, remains in charge of Red Bull's car design as the team's chief technical officer. Next year, each team must package its car around a new turbo engine as well as complying with aerodynamic rule changes which will mainly affect the design of the cars' front and rear wings.
