Buffalo police said that Abdallah kept the girl in his home from July through December 2009, behind dead-bolt locks and doors with no doorknobs. The next day, Buffalo City Court Judge James A.W. McLeod set bond at $250,000 in an arraignment at which Abdallah represented himself. Abdallah was arrested Friday when police raided his home on a child-abuse allegation, Buffalo media reported. Police spokesman Michael DeGeorge said Abdallah also forced the girl to baby-sit his year-old son. Michael J. Abdallah, 26, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree rape, unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference.
