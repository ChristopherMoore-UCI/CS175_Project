-- An employee of German Bundesliga club Hoffenheim has admitted to using a device which emits a high-pitched sound to stop Borussia Dortmund fans singing offensive songs during their match at the Rhein-Neckar Arena on Saturday. "An employee of Hoffenheim admitted to using a corresponding [sound] device, on Saturday during the match against Borussia Dortmund," read a statement on Hoffenheim's official web site. An investigation launched by Hoffenheim also discovered the device was set up on four occasions last season, in matches against Mainz, Cologne, Frankfurt and once again Dortmund, but not used. The 71-year-old has overseen Hoffenheim's promotion from the eighth tier of German football to the Bundesliga and also funded the construction of the club's 30,000-seater Rhein-Neckar Arena -- which opened in January 2009. Hopp is one of the founders of German software corporation SAP AG and is the Hoffenheim's chief financial backer.
