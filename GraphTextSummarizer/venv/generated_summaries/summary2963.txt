U.S. Open champion Justin Rose was in a group tied for sixth on seven under, along with Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk and Rickie Fowler. However, Kuchar -- who can move to the top of the FedEx Cup standings above current leader Woods if he wins the $1.44 million first prize -- was caught at the top by fellow American Gary Woodland after 54 holes. "I hit a lot of good shots and made a lot of good swings," the veteran left-hander said. However, the 14-time major winner got a shot back at the eighth hole and picked up another at 13 before a strong finish left him in a tie for fourth with Englishman David Lynn, who also shot 69. Last year's FedEx Cup champion Brandt Snedeker, in his third tournament since several months off battling bone disease, missed the halfway cut by one shot after a 71.
