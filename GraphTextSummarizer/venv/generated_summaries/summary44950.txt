"Our work will not cease until the number of unaccounted-for individuals is zero," said Andrea Spillars, deputy director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety. Early Sunday, Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr told CNN the death toll was 142. The May 22 storm flattened buildings, destroyed neighborhoods and killed more people than any other U.S. tornado since modern recordkeeping began in 1950. Authorities have 146 sets of human remains, Spillars said Sunday, but some of the remains may belong to the same person and she cautioned against using that number as a death toll. Twenty-nine people remain unaccounted for, down from 43 on Sunday, according to the Missouri Department of Public Safety.
