Cashman said the Yankees will re-evaluate Rodriguez in Tampa on Thursday. -- Alex Rodriguez is taking his quest to get back on the diamond into his own hands. Rodriguez has said he hoped that after hip surgery in January he would be able to resume playing for the Yankees on July 22, after he completed a rehabilitation stint in the minors. A source close to Rodriguez told CNN that Rodriguez believes the Yankees are trying to find a way to release him and not pay the $114 million they owe on his contract.
