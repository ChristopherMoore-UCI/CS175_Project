Kasab is one of 10 Pakistani nationals who police say reigned down terror on Mumbai, India's financial capital, for four days and three nights. It's alleged Kasab and his cohorts traveled to India from Pakistan by boat for the sole purpose of attacking India. Mohammad Ajmal Kasab is charged with 12 criminal counts including murder, attempted murder, and waging war against India. Nikam said, "The terror attack was in order to capture Kashmir." Kashmir has long been a source of tension between India and Pakistan. Kazmi also argued that Kasab was under age at the time of the attacks and should be tried in Juvenile Court, but Judge M.L. Tahilyani disagreed saying Kasab was older than 17 at the time of the attack.
