Over the past decade, Rohde has shaped this material into fantastic sculptures, including a fluorescent garden filled with jewels and creatures and a pair of turquoise crystal horns which can be worn as a headpiece. Kate Rohde's giant, glowing sculptures resemble backlit jewels, as if they have been carved out of phosphorescent rock. At the same time, she is able to embrace the contradictions of working in both the art world and the luxury market, making sumptuous designs out of faux gems and applying painstaking modeling to synthetic materials. Her next exhibition at Melbourne's Karen Woodbury Gallery will have a geological focus, combining crystal structures with mixed media such as technicolor hair extensions she sources in Japan and a kind of plastic which can be dyed in hot water. In the meantime, she is busy researching ideas for new sculptures.
