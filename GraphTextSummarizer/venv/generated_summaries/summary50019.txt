The FAA is waging an education campaign on drone safety after several incidents of drones getting too close to commercial aircraft. Unmanned aircraft, such as drones, won't be allowed within 30 miles of the stadium from an hour before game time until well after the game is over, according to an FAA statement. On Super Bowl Sunday, the FAA will establish a virtual no-fly zone around the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where Super Bowl XLIX will be played. Michael Steinbach, the FBI's assistant director of counterterrorism said Super Bowl security is a huge task. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta has said pilots have reported up to 25 cases per month of drones flying above the regulated limit of 400 feet, with some flying as high as 2,000 feet in the air.
