Kerry raises idea of sanctions against Ukraine government Similar statements ensued over the past few months, with the White House saying this week the Ukraine conflict is not reminiscent of the "proxy conflicts of the Cold War era." Obama put a finer point on showdown in Kiev this week, saying he didn't view U.S. and Russian differences over Ukraine, or Syria, through that lens. -- President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin went to great lengths to portray their phone call Friday as evidence the two leaders were working together to stabilize the situation in Ukraine. There, Kerry insisted the United States was not engaged in a bidding war with Russia over Ukraine or any of the former Soviet republics. Until recently, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was able to challenge his opposition's pro-Western leanings with Russian political and financial backing, just as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in large part has been able to withstand three years of civil war and threats of American military strikes with Russian money, arms and diplomatic support. The Obama administration continues to dismiss the notion of a new Cold War with Russia.
