The Gulf oil disaster ranks as the largest recorded maritime oil spill in U.S. history -- and the largest accidental oil spill into water in world history, topped only by Iraq's intentional release of 240 million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War. Fewer people may have been affected by Love Canal than by the Gulf spill, but petroleum is "not quite as corruptive as the toxins were at Love Canal," Black said; chemicals and radioactive materials can pose a potentially greater long term risk. Local residents can be optimistic because oil is a naturally occurring substance, Black said. -- On June 15, President Barack Obama described the Gulf oil spill in a prime-time address as "the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced." Disasters are hard to rank and tricky to compare, historians say, but they cite several calamities that rival or surpass the Gulf oil spill in terms of lives lost or affected.
