Pakistani government representatives did meet the Taliban for talks on March 26, the first direct contact between the two sides. Pakistan announced a peace initiative, and a cease-fire was reached to pave the way for talks, but discussions broke down in March after Taliban attacks. At least 19 Taliban noncombatants were released earlier as a good will gesture to promote peace talks, said Shaukatullah Khan, governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. In a statement released to the news media, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, alleged the Pakistani government hadn't responded positively to the cease-fire, which began as a monthlong observance on March 1 and eventually was extended to April 10. The release came at the directive of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Khan said.
