The Joker, Batman's archenemy, has been terrorizing the Dark Knight and his allies over these past few months in a number of "Batman" comic books, and it's all coming to a head in Wednesday's issue of "Batman" #17 (published by DC Comics, which is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN). We wanted Joker for the first time ever to come after the Batman family with this murderous mission in mind. Joker sees them representing some facet of Batman's psychology. The Riddler -- who I'm about to use in a big way in 2013 -- is a manifestation of Batman's fear that he's not smart enough, he's not able to solve the puzzle in time to save the city. How much of an impact will it have on Batman and DC Comics' current universe?
