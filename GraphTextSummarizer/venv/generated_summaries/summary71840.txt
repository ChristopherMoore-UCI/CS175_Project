"The medical staff I have seen is amazing, most hospitals continue to work in this extremely difficult situation," said Colette Gadenne, emergency field coordinator for Donetsk's Doctors Without Borders. In other regions, where these materials are desperately needed due to fierce fighting, logistics are limited. Now, she spends her days in hospital, receiving care from doctors who are as concerned about their neutrality as they are about their patients. "We struggle to have access to hospitals to supply them, because of the dynamics of the conflict, it's very difficult," Gadenne told CNN. Marina was wounded in one of these hot areas where fierce fighting continues.
