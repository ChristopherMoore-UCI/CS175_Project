Leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, said they gained a valuable prize by taking Alzate prisoner. But on Tuesday, FARC leaders said no such project exists in that area and that they were also baffled what Alzate's presence there. Both Colombian government officials and rebel leaders said they did not know what Alzate was doing in a remote area of western Colombia when guerrillas captured him over the weekend. FARC leaders would not say whether they would free Alzate so that the peace talks could continue. At the beginning of the peace talks in 2012, FARC leaders said they had released all their prisoners and hostages as a sign of good faith.
