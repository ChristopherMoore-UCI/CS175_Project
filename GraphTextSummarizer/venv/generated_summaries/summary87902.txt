-- A second St. Paul, Minnesota, police officer was on leave Friday in the wake of an arrest video that showed an officer kicking a suspect who was lying on the ground. An investigation continued into the Tuesday arrest of Eric Hightower, who police had been seeking for suspicion of making terroristic threats. "Regardless of what he was getting charged with, I don't think the actions were taken appropriately for somebody who's not resisting," Hightower's cousin, Antoine Hightower, told the affiliate. KARE spoke to some of Hightower's family members, who gathered outside a courthouse where Hightower made his first appearance Friday. A call seeking comment from Hightower's attorney was not immediately returned Friday.
