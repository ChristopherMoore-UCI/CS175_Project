Last year's winner, Hull City, sit on the brink of relegation this weekend, and the challenge they face to stay up is the same one either Burnley or Sheffield United will get to face next season: global giant Manchester United before 80,000 people at Old Trafford. The massive injection of money to the victor is largely due to the lucrative television rights deals for Premier League football matches. While a 2008 study funded by MasterCard found that the winner of the Champions League could earn as much as $149m (€110m), Jones said the financial difference between winning an losing the final would be only around $6m. "In terms of financial pressure -- if a player from Sheffield or Burnley steps up to take a penalty in that match -- they have a lot more riding on it than anyone in the Champions League would," he said. The most lucrative match in world football took place at Wembley Stadium on Monday -- with Burnley defeating Sheffield United 1-0 to collect a prize which is estimated to be worth nearly $100 million -- more than any Superbowl or World Cup final. Earlier this year the Premier League secured a new set of television deals for the 2010-2013 seasons worth a record $2.70 billion (£1.782b).
