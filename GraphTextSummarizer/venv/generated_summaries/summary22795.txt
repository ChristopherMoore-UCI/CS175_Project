On Friday, Mexico said efforts against Mesa will continue in U.S. civil courts and in Mexican courts. Hernandez's parents said he was a straight-A student, but U.S. authorities described him as a repeat juvenile offender who had a history of ties to human smuggling. -- A U.S. investigation into the controversial fatal shooting of a 15-year-old Mexican boy by a U.S. Border Patrol agent has been closed without prosecution because of "insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal charges," the Justice Department announced Friday. In its decision announced Friday, the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney for western Texas said their investigation showed that Hernandez and others threw rocks at close range at the agent, who was attempting to detain a suspect in a human-smuggling operation at the border. The Mexican Embassy said it was sending a note of protest to the U.S. government to underscore its concern.
