Cavendish, the pre-race favorite on a course well-suited to his talents, timed his burst to perfection to take gold from Australia's Matthew Goss with Andre Greipel of Germany taking the bronze medal. Milan-San Remo winner Goss closed on the line while Greipel edged out Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara for the final podium spot. -- Mark Cavendish capped a superb week for Britain at the world cycling championships by winning the men's road race title Sunday with a trademark sprint finish. Tour de France hero Thomas Voeckler made a typical charge, but with time trial silver medalist Bradley Wiggins and the experienced David Millar to the fore, Britain were able to nullify his attempt. Cavendish paid tribute to his teammates after they had paced him through the majority of the 260km race over 17 laps but with a tough uphill finish.
