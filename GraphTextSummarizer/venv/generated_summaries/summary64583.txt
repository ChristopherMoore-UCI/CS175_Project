While Ravi could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison, New Jersey Superior Judge Glenn Berman instead gave him a 30-day jail sentence, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. His former roommate, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, killed himself by jumping off New York's George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River after learning Ravi had secretly recorded Clementi's intimate encounter with another man. "Based on a review of Mr. Ravi's criminal record, ICE is not initiating removal proceedings at this time," Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Ross Feinstein said Monday. The September 2010 death of Tyler Clementi, and Ravi's trial this year, thrust the issue of cyberbullying and prejudices against homosexuals into the national spotlight. Berman told the Indian national the only reason he did not recommend deportation was because the man involved in the videotaped encounter with Clementi, identified in court only as "M.B.," said in his victim impact statement that he did not believe Ravi should be made to leave the country -- and would be willing to write a letter to that effect.
