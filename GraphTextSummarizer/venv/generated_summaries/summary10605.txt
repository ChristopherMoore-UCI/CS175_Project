Greg Bernal of Florissant, Missouri, and girlfriend Janet Momphard of St. Charles, Missouri, on Tuesday hauled what is believed to be a world record catfish into their boat while fishing on the Missouri River. Zarlenga says Bernal's keeping quiet about the exact location is understandable, but he expects to see more people fishing the general area along the Missouri River for their dream catch. I'm still in shock," Bernal said Tuesday. "Back in 1995, I caught the Illinois state record catfish -- a blue that weighed 79.12 pounds," said Bernal. Tim Pruitt of Godfrey, Missouri, holds the official world record.
