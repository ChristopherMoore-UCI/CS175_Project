It's a shame," Leonardo said from the team's mid-season training camp in Doha, according to the website of French sports paper L'Equipe. " Beckham is now expected to negotiate a new contract with Los Angeles Galaxy, the Major League Soccer team he joined in 2007 and led to the MLS Cup title in November last year. The 36-year-old had been widely expected to sign for the Qatari-owned side during European football's January transfer window, but PSG sporting director Leonardo said the former England captain would likely stay in Los Angeles. Confirmation that Beckham would not join the French league leaders was not a surprise as Leonardo and new coach Carlo Ancelotti had both denied reports that a deal had been done in the past few days. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder's previous five-year deal expired on December 31, and he was tipped to return to Europe in order to secure a place in the Great Britain team for the 2012 Olympics in his native London.
