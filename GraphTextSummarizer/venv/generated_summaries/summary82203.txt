We're doing these things even though this particular plot was chosen precisely because we weren't screening for it; future al Qaeda attacks rarely look like past attacks; and the terrorist threat is far broader than attacks against airplanes. We worry about shark attacks instead of fatal dog or pig attacks -- both far more common. Our brains aren't very good at probability and risk analysis, especially when it comes to rare events. We tend to base risk analysis on personal story rather than on data. In the U.S., over 38,000 people die each year in car crashes; that's as many deaths as 9/11 each and every month, year after year.
