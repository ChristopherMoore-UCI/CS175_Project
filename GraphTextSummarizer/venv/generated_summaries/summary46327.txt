-- Peanut butter makers not affected by the deadly salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut plant are trying to get consumers to keep buying peanut butter. Tainted peanut butter and peanut paste were shipped by Peanut Corporation of America to institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons, not to grocery stores. Americans have shied away from peanut butter despite the FDA's assurances that major-label peanut butter in grocery stores is safe. Companies such as ConAgra Foods Inc. and J.M. Smucker Co. have started running ads and offering coupons, trying to lure peanut butter customers as sales have plunged at least 20 percent since the salmonella outbreak. The J.M. Smucker Company does not purchase peanuts or any ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America," its Web site says.
