The United States is already experimenting with a variation of basic income, even though most people don't realize it. Of course, all government programs have imperfections, and the basic income idea has an obvious one: There will still be people incapable of functioning in daily lifeâ€”people who will spend their money before paying for basic necessities. Due partly to technological innovation, we already have a situation where less work is spread among more people, and this phenomenon will increase in the future. As advocates of a basic income point out, nothing would keep people from working and earning as much as they want. Recently, in the face of a sputtering economy, a weak job market and rising income inequality, it has been gathering supporters at an ever-quickening pace.
