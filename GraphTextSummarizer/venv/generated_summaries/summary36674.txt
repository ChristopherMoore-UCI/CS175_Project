Other doctors had tried oral methods but failed because they had the wrong proportions, and because they were focused on trying to give every person the same "magic bullet" dosage of therapy. " "The devastating conditions suffered by the Bangladeshi refugees as they fled the war with Pakistan offered ORT (oral rehydration therapy) its definitive test," according to an August 2003 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. Nalin recognized that the volume of oral rehydration therapy required isn't the same for every patient. "When the medical team ran out of intravenous fluids at the camp, oral glucose-salt packets were used to treat (more than) 3,000 patients, resulting in a reduction in the mortality rate from 30% to only 3.6%," the journal said. A tremendous advance in hydration was invented by David Nalin, along with his colleague Richard Cash.
