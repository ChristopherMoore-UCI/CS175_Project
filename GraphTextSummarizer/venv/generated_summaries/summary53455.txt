IBM employees are being dealt a double blow, said Lee Conrad, national coordinator for Alliance@IBM, a pro-union group that has been fighting IBM's outsourcing for years. -- IBM's reported plans to lay off thousands of U.S. workers and outsource many of those jobs to India, even as the company angles for billions in stimulus money, doesn't sit well with employee rights advocates. "We're outraged that jobs cuts are happening in the U.S. and the work is being shifted offshore," Conrad said. According to Business Week, IBM has indeed been shifting jobs. Hira, author of the book "Outsourcing America," said it's not just IBM moving jobs out of the United States.
