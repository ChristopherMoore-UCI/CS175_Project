Choi had been involved in an acrimonious war of words with Iran coach Carlos Quieroz ahead of the game and home fans hurled plastic water bottles and other items onto the pitch after taking offense at a gesture directed towards Choi by the Portuguese after the match. Iran, South Korea and Australia all booked a place in next year's FIFA World Cup following a dramatic final round of group matches in the Asian qualifying competition. The home side bounced back in the second half, firing in five goals without reply, but the 5-1 final score was not enough to see Uzbekistan leapfrog South Korea. A second-half goal from Reza Ghoochannejhad was enough for Iran to beat South Korea 1-0 in Ulsan, meaning Carlos Queiroz's team finished top of Group A. Victory saw Iran reach football's premier competition for the fourth time in its history, having previously played in the first round of the 1978, 1998 and 2006 tournaments. Despite defeat, South Korea still clinched the second automatic qualification spot as Uzbekistan fell agonizingly short against Qatar, winning 5-1 but finishing third in Group A on goal difference alone.
