"This is the start of the new Manchester United," trumpeted Louis Van Gaal after his expensively rebuilt side kick started its Premier League campaign with a 4-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford Sunday. In other football action Sunday, Hanover 96 joined Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the Bundesliga after a 2-0 win over Hamburg, which left the visitors at the bottom of the table. Harry Redknapp's QPR offered little in reply but it was still a morale boosting win for Dutchman Van Gaal, who succeeded David Moyes as United manager after their poor 2013-4 campaign. First-half goals from Leon Andreasen and Artur Sobiech gave Hanover three points to move to seven points after three games with champions Bayern and Leverkusen. England captain Rooney is now the joint-third top scorer in Premier League history.
