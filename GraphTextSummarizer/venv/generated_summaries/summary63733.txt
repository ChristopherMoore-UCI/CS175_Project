The debut issue of "Party," which analysts say had to undergo major cuts to secure government approval, featured novels, essays, poems, photos and cartoons from writers and artists across the Chinese-speaking world, including a serial penned by Han. Han Han, whose blog has clocked more than 441 million hits in the past five years, announced in his latest post Tuesday that he has shut down his literary magazine "Party" after publishing just one issue. The 28-year-old best-selling author of novels and professional race car driver is one of the most recognized faces among Chinese youth. I just hope that all the people in arts, all the literati, painters, and directors can work in an unregulated and uncensored environment," Han told CNN in an interview last May. "Too many people in relevant departments of the Chinese government are capable of turning literary magazines to cultural relics," he wrote in his usual sarcastic style.
