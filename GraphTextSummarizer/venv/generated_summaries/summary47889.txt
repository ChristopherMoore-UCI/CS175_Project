" LePage agreed there's a lack of brotherly love between the two in a humorous moment during an hour-long debate, sponsored by WMTV, CNN, and WABI, along with Democratic candidate Rep. Mike Michaud. "If it was Mike Michaud versus Paul LePage, the election's over," he said about his own head-to-head strength against the six-term congressman. "The fact that the governor said last night that $100,000 is not a lot of money -- it IS a lot of money," Michaud said. Asked about the current Ebola outbreak in America, Michaud struck at the state's preparedness, criticizing LePage for leaving two top infectious disease positions open at the Maine Center for Disease Control. The candidates sparred that way as well, with LePage and Michaud saving their harshest attacks for each other, letting Cutler attack on topics he wanted or stay out of the ones he didn't.
