The pardons are "a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and Gov. Barbour should be ashamed," said state Attorney General Jim Hood. Barbour, who served eight years in office, had previously granted full pardons to three other convicted killers in 2008. Hood said he is questioning the release of many of the 175 individuals who received full pardons. Brewer shared the fears of those families watching convicted killers of their loved ones get blanket pardons and go free. Hood said Barbour violated Mississippi's Constitution because the pardon requests for many inmates were not published 30 days before they were granted, as required.
