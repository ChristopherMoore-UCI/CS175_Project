Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner officially removed Lohan from probation from two 2007 drunken driving convictions, but she remain on informal probation for two more years on last year's misdemeanor shoplifting conviction. Canadian authorities issued a permit Wednesday for Lohan to work in Toronto, where the Taylor biopic will be filmed, a source familiar with Lohan's plans said Thursday. The strict rules of formal probation that tripped up the actress and led to four probation violations in the past two years are now gone, but she could face another 245 days in jail if she is convicted of another crime before the theft probation ends on May 24, 2014. Lohan, who has been in court at least 19 times since her first arrest in May 2007, addressed the judge at the end of Thursday's hearing. Lohan's probation officer sent another good progress report to the judge, confirming that the actress has completed the 480 hours of community service and the four-times-a-month psychological counseling sessions ordered, Sautner said.
