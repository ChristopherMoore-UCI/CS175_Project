" Woods has won the British Open three times -- at Scotland's St. Andrews in 2000 and 2005, then at Hoylake in 2006. Woods has not played since he withdrew from the Players Championship in May, and is a doubt for golf's oldest major -- which is due to start at Royal St. George's in England on July 14. The tournament is returning to Sandwich in south-east England for the first time since 2003, when American Ben Curtis was a shock victor in his debut appearance at a major event. -- Former world number one Tiger Woods insists he will not rush his recovery from a knee injury, casting doubt over the 14-time major champion's participation in next month's British Open. He cited Tom Watson's performance at the 2009 British Open, where the veteran American lost out in a playoff for the Claret Jug to compatriot Stewart Cink, as an example of how age is not necessarily a barrier to success.
