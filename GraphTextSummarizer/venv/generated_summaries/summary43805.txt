The statistics on suicides among service members, many of whom had deployed to war zones, included deaths among reserve forces. For years, the Pentagon has struggled with how to identify service members at risk for suicide and to provide counseling and other services. "We are deeply saddened by this loss of life, and renew our commitment to support the military families left behind who are grieving the deaths of service members by suicide," said Bonnie Carroll, founder of TAPS. According to the Pentagon, 239 military deaths in 2012 have been confirmed as suicides and another 110 are being investigated as probable suicides. The Army had by far the highest number of suicides and probable suicides -- 182, a nuvcmber that was up from 166 in 2011.
