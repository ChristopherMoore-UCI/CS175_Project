But 35 states rely on federal exchanges to market health insurance â€” in many cases because Republican governors who oppose Obamacare refused to set up marketplaces. But conservatives might be end up frustrated because none of the fixes that have a chance of becoming law will seriously undermine Obamacare as a whole. "The prospect of that disruption is sufficiently problematic that I would not be surprised to see a lot of states adopt exchanges," said Elhauge, who authored a book on the original Obamacare Supreme Court case. Federal officials last week projected that between nine and 9.9 million people would be signed up to Obamacare in 2015, lower than the 13 million number previously projected by the Congressional Budget Office. The Supreme Court poses the gravest threat after agreeing to hear a challenge to the crucial tax credits that subsidize health coverage purchased on federal exchanges.
