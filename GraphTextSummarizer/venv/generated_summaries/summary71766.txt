Here's the full list, followed by the group's ranking for best TV shows: AFI MOVIES OF THE YEAR Argo Beasts of the Southern Wild The Dark Knight Rises Django Unchained Les Miserables Life of Pi Lincoln Moonrise Kingdom Silver Linings Playbook Zero Dark Thirty AFI TV PROGRAMS OF THE YEAR American Horror Story Breaking Bad Game Change Game of Thrones Girls Homeland Among the other movies jockeying for a slot on the best picture list are "Moonrise Kingdom," "Beasts of the Southern Wild" and "Django Unchained" â€” which are also on AFI's list. " The group doesn't choose a best picture, it only ranks the 10 best movies of the year and lists them alphabetically, and this year's list could easily mirror the eventual best-picture field for the Academy Awards. The six locks for a nomination â€” "Argo," "Les Miserables," "Life of Pi," "Lincoln," "Silver Linings Playbook" and "Zero Dark Thirty" â€” are all on AFI's list. When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expanded its best picture field three years ago, it was in part due to the feeling that "The Dark Knight" was best-picture worthy, but fell just short.
