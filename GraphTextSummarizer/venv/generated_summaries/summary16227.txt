-- A lawyer for numerous alleged victims of phone hacking by journalists has confirmed that he plans to launch legal action in the United States against media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Mark Lewis told CNN Friday he expects an initial hearing to be held in New York in about two to three months, as he seeks to begin legal claims in the United States. He added that "compensation is likely to be higher from U.S. courts than courts in the UK." John Kelly, a lawyer at Schillings law firm, which represents Steve Coogan and other suspected celebrity hacking victims, told CNN its clients have not yet joined the lawsuit against News Corp. in the United States but are interested in the idea. This summer's scandal around claims of phone hacking by journalists working for the now-defunct News of the World -- run by News International, the British arm of News Corp. -- rocked public confidence in the media, police and politicians. "We have been speaking to U.S. lawyers to make applications to U.S. courts in order to assist the investigation of this matter and are looking to pursue legal action on the basis of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, whereby a holding company can be liable for practices outside the jurisdiction where the offence is said to have taken place," Lewis said. Senior News Corp. executives have denied that wrongdoing among the company's staff was widespread.
