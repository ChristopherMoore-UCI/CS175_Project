Fans and film critics battled to be the dominant voice at the international premiere of "Fifty Shades of Grey" in Berlin Wednesday night -- and it was the unrestrained exuberance of the fans that won the day. For Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who plays submissive Anastasia Steele to Dornan's dominant Grey, it's been a long road from the film's notorious bondage dungeon, the "Red Room of Pain," to the red carpet. We do get to see the Grey butt in action, but no full-frontal nudity, a modesty which is not afforded to Dakota Johnson. Unscheduled moments of laughter punctuated Grey's post-coital visits to the piano but there were also moments of well-crafted mirth, notably a scene in which Christian and Anastasia sit at opposite ends of a business meeting room table and discuss the contract intended to govern their relationship. "It was Fifty Shades of sh*t!"
