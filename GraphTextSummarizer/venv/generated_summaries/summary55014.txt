The NFL just wasn't adding up for Ricardo Silva, so he decided to hang up his shoulder pads and head back to school -- to teach high school geometry. "My mission was to be able to play football as long as I can and then eventually I wanted to go into teaching which would be either math or social studies," says Silva who was a political science major at Virginia's Hampton University. His efforts have seemed to have already made a difference for his students, including 10th grader Eric Cary who credits Silva with helping him raise his grade from a D+ to a B in Geometry. He has intercepted passes from both of the Super Bowl quarterbacks, but Tom Brady and Russell Wilson have nothing on Mr. Silva. In school you got to motivate the young teenagers who are more interested in their social media outlets than math," says Silva.
