The Chukotka Autonomous Region government has sought help from federal authorities and asked for an icebreaker to help rescue the Belugas. Trapped whales are also susceptible to predators like polar bears and killer whales. But the Belugas' chance of swimming back to water is slim due to the vast fields of ice over the strait. In Chukotka, the last relatively successful case was recorded in 1986, when an ice-breaker helped free trapped beluga whales. -- Prisoners in ice, more than 100 Beluga whales in far eastern Russia risk death unless rescued soon.
