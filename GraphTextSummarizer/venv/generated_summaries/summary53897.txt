More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter Europe. "Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences," the refugee agency said in its statement. The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands, about 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea, the refugee agency reported. On Thursday, 195 survivors were transferred to a humanitarian aid camp close to the Tunisia-Libya border, according to a statement from the refugee agency.
