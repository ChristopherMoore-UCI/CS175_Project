That's when Portman, a former White House budget director, was thrust into the divisive national debate when he publicly acknowledged that he had changed his mind on same-sex marriage. It is budget and tax issues, not marriage and sexuality, that he is better known for. After he failed to deliver his state and Romney lost the election, Portman stepped out of the limelight and remained relatively quiet on Capitol Hill as President Barack Obama settled in for a second term. In that role, he began to hone his expertise on budget and fiscal issues. During his 12 years in the House, Portman sat on the Ways and Means and Budget committees -- two powerful budget and tax-writing panels -- and co-chaired the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service.
