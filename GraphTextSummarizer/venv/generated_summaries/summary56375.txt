-- Amy Winehouse's attempt at a European concert tour ended in Belgrade, Serbia, with a train wreck of a performance Saturday night in which she staggered around the stage and stumbled through several songs. Winehouse representative Tracey Miller did not directly confirm that the "Rehab" singer, who has a history of battling drugs and alcohol, had fallen off the wagon. When Winehouse entered a rehab program at London's Priory Clinic last month, a representative told CNN that "she wants to be ready for performances in Europe this summer and decided to seek an assessment. "Yes, Amy has cancelled appearances in Istanbul and Athens for the coming week," Miller told CNN Sunday. The audience eventually chased Winehouse off the stage with loud boos several numbers into what was supposed to be the opening show in a 12-date tour.
