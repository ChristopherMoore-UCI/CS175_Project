" Pacquiao, who is a congressman in the Philippines, is due to announce who his next opponent will be at his 32nd birthday celebrations on Friday with Shane Mosley, Juan Manuel Marquez and Andre Berto in the frame. Pacquiao's next fight is in May next year while Mayweather is due in court next month to answer charges of domestic violence. Graham explained: "There is Shane Mosley, the former WBA welterweight champion, Juan Manuel Marquez, the current WBO lightweight champion, and a dark horse candidate is Andre Berto, the former Olympian, who is undefeated but has not really fought anybody of note and has the lightest resume of the three. "[Mosley] is the best known but at the same time he is also coming off two really bad performances. "One thing for sure though is if the Floyd Mayweather fight doesn't happen he [Pacquiao] might be defined just as much for not having that fight. "But the truth is there are a lot of theories about Floyd maybe waiting for Pacquiao to be past his prime, like Sugar Ray Leonard did with Marvin Hagler in the eighties.
