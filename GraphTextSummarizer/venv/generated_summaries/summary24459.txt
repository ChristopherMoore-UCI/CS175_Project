"We don't see the differences between Obama and Bush, they both oppress Muslims, they both have blood on their hands,"  said Ismail Yusanto, a spokesman for the Muslim group in Indonesia. Muslims staged rallies across Indonesia on Sunday to protest U.S. President Barack Obama's planned visit to the southeast  Asian nation this week. With about 205 million Muslims, Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington, D.C. More than one in 10 of the world's Muslims live there. Although it has a reputation for being home to a relatively tolerant and easy-going brand of Islam, a Pew Forum analysis rates it as having high levels of legal restrictions on religion and religious social tension. Government restrictions on religion are tighter in Indonesia than in Russia or Turkey, and social tensions are higher than in Nigeria or Egypt, the think tank says.
