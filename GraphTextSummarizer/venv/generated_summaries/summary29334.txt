"You have to understand, this program was in operation 18 months or more before we had any idea it existed," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. In Mexico, the operation drew sharp criticism from top officials, who have long said that U.S. weapons are fueling the country's bloody drug war. " Rene Jaquez, the ATF's former attache in Mexico City, told CNN the operation never should have happened. -- Federal agents can't account for more than 1,400 guns after a widely criticized operation aimed at tracing the flow of weapons to Mexican drug gangs, sources with knowledge of the investigation tell CNN. The ATF operation was intended to build cases against Mexican drug cartels by allowing firearms to go from the United States into Mexico.
