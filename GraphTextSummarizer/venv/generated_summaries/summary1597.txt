It's not an overstatement that Lawrence keeps a busy schedule; for the next two years she's committed to wrapping up "The Hunger Games" franchise with "Mockingjay" parts 1 and 2, plus filming another "X-Men" movie, "X-Men: Apocalypse," all of which comes on the heels of the highly touted David O. Russell movie "American Hustle." Both the actress and her boyfriend, "X-Men: Days of Future Past" co-star Nicholas Hoult, are busy building their careers, and they've agreed it's OK to "mutually ignore each other" for a bit when necessary. The latter earned Lawrence another raft of praise and an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress, a nod that some prognosticators thought she might cinch. Well if it is a plot, Lawrence tells Marie Claire in its June issue, she'd be smarter about executing it. That kind of answer is exactly the reason fans adore Lawrence; she's uber-talented but also down-to-earth enough to freak out on a reporter who spoiled the last season of "Homeland."
