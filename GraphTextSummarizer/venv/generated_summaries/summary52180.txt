"Urban wind is not very strong, but it is very turbulent," says "Arbre Ã  Vent" engineer Julia Revuz. French company NewWind has created the "Arbre a Vent" or "Wind Tree," a 3-meter-tall generator designed for urban environments which makes the most of smaller air currents. " Other ideas for the aeroleaves include rooftop foliage installed on buildings, foliage on roadsides and the smart balcony -- where the mini turbines are attached to balcony railings. "Our technology is in the mini wind turbines (the aeroleaves)," says Revuz. Mini turbines are cheaper to produce and buy than the wind tree.
