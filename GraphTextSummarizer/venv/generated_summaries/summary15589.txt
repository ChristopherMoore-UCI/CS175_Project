"Freedom House condemns in the strongest possible terms the conviction of 43 NGO workers, including six currently with Freedom House and a former staff member, after a government-led witch-hunt intended to strangle civil society activity and limit free expression in post-revolutionary Egypt," the agency said in a prepared statement. "This prosecution had a chilling effect on the work of independent human rights and democracy promotion organizations in Egypt," said Brian Dooley, director of the organization's defenders program. An Egyptian court sentenced several dozen workers for non-governmental organizations, including Americans, to jail Tuesday in a case that has infuriated the U.S. government and democratic activists around the world. "Moreover, the decision to close these organizations' offices and seize their assets contradicts the government of Egypt's commitments to support the role of civil society as a fundamental actor in a democracy and contributor to development, especially at this critical stage in the Egyptian people's democratic transition. " He called on Egypt to "work with civic groups as they respond to the Egyptian people's aspirations for democracy as guaranteed in Egypt's new constitution.
