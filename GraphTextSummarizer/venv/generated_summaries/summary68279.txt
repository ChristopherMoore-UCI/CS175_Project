"As per the UEFA disciplinary regulations, the UEFA disciplinary inspector has the right to open disciplinary investigations and to lodge appeals against decisions taken by the control and disciplinary body," read a statement on UEFA's website. While UEFA president Michel Platini had hinted at seeking tougher sanctions, the news of an appeal came following a statement in which "the UEFA disciplinary inspector felt it necessary to immediately confirm his intention to appeal on UEFA's behalf." FARE -- a network of anti-discrimination and inclusion groups which tackles racism, xenophobia and homophobia across European football, says the latest developments are hugely encouraging "UEFA's decision to appeal is very welcome," executive director Piara Powar told the English Press Association. During the 2012 European Championship finals, Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner was fined $125,800 for exposing boxer shorts with the logo of an online betting company Earlier this year, Manchester City officials were infuriated after the club was fined $40,000 by UEFA for taking to the pitch late for a Europa League game -- which was $13,000 more than FC Porto's sanction for fans' racist abuse during a game against the English team. A leading anti-racism group has applauded UEFA's decision to appeal against sanctions handed out to the Serbian Football Association for "improper conduct" following allegations of racist chanting. "Having reviewed the motivated decisions for the sanctions imposed in this specific case, which have also been provided to all parties, the UEFA disciplinary inspector felt it necessary to immediately confirm his intention to appeal on UEFA's behalf."
