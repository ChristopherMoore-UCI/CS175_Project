There's the orchid, 'Paravanda Nelson Mandela," named after him during his 1997 visit to the botanical garden in Singapore. The apartment in "Only Fools and Horses" was called Nelson Mandela house. For anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, the varied list of namesakes keeps growing. The 'Mandela particle' got its honor in 1973 from the physics institute at Leeds University. Mandela was sentenced to 27 years in 1964 for his fight against the apartheid government in South Africa.
