The service lets Gmail users make free calls to U.S. and Canada and inexpensive calls to phones in other countries. (CNET) -- Google Wave and Google Buzz may have had troubles attracting usage, but the new ability to place calls from Gmail appears to have caught on quickly. It uses Gmail as an interface and optionally can integrate with Google Voice to receive calls as well. Given the vast number of phone calls made daily, I'm reluctant to draw any grand conclusions. To be sure, a lot of calls are placed daily in the United States, where the new Gmail feature was activated initially.
