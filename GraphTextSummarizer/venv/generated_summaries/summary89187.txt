-- Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos officially announced he will seek re-election, a decision that could affect the ongoing peace talks between the government and the FARC. Santos placed all his political capital on the negotiations with the FARC, so it's natural that he is seeking re-election, another analyst, Vicente Torrijos, said. "You elected me to strengthen the results that we had achieved in security, and we have delivered," Santos said in a televised speech Wednesday night. "He thinks that because of fragmentation among the political parties and that other political leaders also haven't consolidated supporters, he can be re-elected," political analyst Jaime Arango said. "So he is going to present himself to Colombians and the world as the peacemaker and of course this is his best calling card to aspire to this re-election," he said.
