With the advent in the 1920s of open Senate hearings of court nominees, public and press scrutiny of court diversity have become important talking points. Kagan is set to become the third woman on the current court, a move applauded by retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor and former first lady Laura Bush. Many political and legal experts expected George W. Bush to make his first court pick a Hispanic, but his two picks were white males. The 50-year-old also has no judicial experience, unlike every current member of the court, who were previously federal appeals court judges. "The whole commentary of the court has evolved away from that," said Pulitzer Prize winning author and court historian David Garrow.
