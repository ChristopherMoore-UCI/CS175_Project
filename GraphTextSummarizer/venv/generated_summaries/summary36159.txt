Iraq accused Syria of harboring Baath Party members who, it said, were financing and planning the attacks in Iraq. He said al Qaeda in Iraq has teamed up with remnants of the Baath Party -- a statement that gave more weight to the Iraqi government's claims. In the videos shown Sunday, the men said they were Baath Party members who were involved in planning and executing the October 25 bombings at government buildings. Syria refused, and the Iraqis accused Syria of supporting the August attacks by providing a refuge for Baathists who were working with al Qaeda in Iraq. After the August bombings, tensions between Iraq and neighboring Syria reached an all-time high and both countries withdrew their ambassadors.
