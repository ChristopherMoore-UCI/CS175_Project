Venezuela's Supreme Court rejected a ruling from an international human rights court Monday, all but assuring opposition candidate Leopoldo Lopez will not challenge President Hugo Chavez in next year's election. So in theory he could still compete in elections, though he would not be allowed to hold office. Lopez had been considered one of the top contenders to challenge Chavez in next year's presidential election. Chavez's government accused Lopez of corruption during his tenure as the mayor of the municipality of Chacao, and through an administrative procedure barred him in 2008 from running for public office for six years. Despite his ongoing battle with cancer, the charismatic president has said he plans to seek re-election.
