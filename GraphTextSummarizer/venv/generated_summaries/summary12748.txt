Cuz here's the buried lede in plain language: Dr. Seuss books are going digital. The e-books are the latest in a series of Seuss-related products that have appeared since Geisel died in 1991, including toys, clothing, animated stories, a Broadway musical and a Florida theme-park attraction. Geisel, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984, an Academy Award, three Emmy Awards, three Grammy Awards, and three Caldecott Honors, wrote and illustrated 44 books for children. A second wave of titles will be released in e-book form on October 22, and a third on November 5. -- Books?
