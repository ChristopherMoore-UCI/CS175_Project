Tatarko said she hopes Houzz will help more people jump from fantasizing about home improvement to picking up a hammer themselves or a phone to reach someone who uses hammers professionally. "Many times people start on the inspiration side but end up taking actions because of that," said Houzz founder Adi Tatarko. At its core, Houzz is an addictive, never-ending gallery of luscious images of home interiors and exteriors. "I think it (home improvement) was just so hard before, so people just stayed away from it." Every month, 15 million people search Houzz by room, style or metro area -- more than half through a smartphone or tablet.
