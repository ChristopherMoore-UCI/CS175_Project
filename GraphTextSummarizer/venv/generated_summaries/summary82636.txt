-- The case of a Christian woman in Sudan who was sentenced to die for refusing to renounce her faith has cast new light on the plight of persecuted Christians worldwide. Open Doors says most Christians in Saudi Arabia are expatriates from Asia or Africa. The country has arrested and deported Western Christians suspected of spreading their faith, according to a State Department report. Like people of other faiths, Christians can face discrimination, harassment, arrest, jail time and even death for what they believe. According to Open Doors, attacks and threats against Christians rose last year as Islamic terrorist groups gained more influence.
