Dr. Rick Sacra and Dr. Kent Brantly were both infected with Ebola while working in Liberia with the aid organization Serving in Mission. In addition to the blood transfusion, doctors are giving Sacra aggressive supportive care to help his immune system fight the virus, including electrolytes and IV fluids. "They are so similar it didn't surprise me that they were the same blood type," said his Sacra's spouse, Debbie Sacra. Thankful for the support, but also a little embarrassed by the all the attention, Sacra and his spouse asked that Americans remember people are struggling with Ebola in Africa too. "He wants you to share his burden for the people of Liberia and West Africa," Debbie Sacra said.
