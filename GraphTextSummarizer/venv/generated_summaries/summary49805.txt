Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says. On April 11, prosecutors in Pine County, Minnesota, issued a criminal complaint after a two-year investigation into allegations from two women about Barnard's alleged conduct while he was preaching to a religious group in Finlayson, Minnesota. Tornambe told investigators that Barnard created a group of 10 young girls and women who were known as Alamoths, or maidens. Dan Coon, a spokesman for Washington State Police, added Thursday that a detective is working with the Pine County Sheriff's Office in their search for Barnard. There are no charges against Barnard in Washington, Nelson said.
