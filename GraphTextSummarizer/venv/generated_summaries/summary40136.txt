He said ,'Please don't hold up her cancer surgery for this,' " Beaton, 59, said as she testified at a House subcommittee hearing on the terminations of individual health policies by insurance companies. Insurance companies argue rescissions are relatively rare, but Waxman said the practice saved the companies $300 million over the past five years. The witnesses charged that insurance applications are purposely long and confusing, and that companies look for any discrepancy to avoid covering expensive treatments. Members of the subcommittee grilled the CEOs on their rescission policies -- including the fact that some companies will not take on clients who have had insurance rescinded in the past -- but the companies maintained that rescission is not about cost. She and two others testified Tuesday about their experiences with insurance rescission.
