" U.S. Open latest scores Djokovic lost his first grand slam final at the 2007 U.S. Open but was able to quickly bounce back with his breakthrough win in Australia just months later. -- Novak Djokovic has already denied Andy Murray his first grand slam title once, and the world No. 2 will again stand in the Olympic gold medalist's way in Monday's U.S. Open final. Djokovic won the first four games of the fourth set against the French Open semifinalist as he won through to his ninth grand slam final. The 25-year-old will be looking to cap a season in which he won the opening major but then failed to become the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four grand slam titles when he lost to Rafael Nadal in the French Open final. "That's the first time I've met Sir Alex and first time I met Sir Sean, as well," Murray said after the James Bond actor and Manchester United football manager gatecrashed his post-match press conference on Saturday.
