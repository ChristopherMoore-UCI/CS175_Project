Providing legal status to hardworking immigrants could have allowed Bobby's father to attain a job with health benefits that could have saved Bobby's mother's life. In spite of DACA, which granted Bobby and other young people like him a temporary work permit and driver's license, the benefits of this program did not extend to his undocumented mother battling breast cancer, nor his father who was unable to find employment that would afford him health benefits. And while the President cannot bring Bobby's mother back, it is not too late to help millions of other immigrants and U.S. citizens who are fighting every day to keep their families together and their communities safe. For a start, the President should implement broad and inclusive administrative relief from deportation to parents of DACA recipients and other hardworking immigrants who are contributing to our economy and communities. These human costs in turn have ripple effects that chip away at the enormous contributions that immigrants make to our economy and communities.
