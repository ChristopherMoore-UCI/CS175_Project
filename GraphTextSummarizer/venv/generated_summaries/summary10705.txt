Sure, you could get lucky like Decatur, Georgia, resident Gregory Jarrett, and find a winning Powerball lottery ticket from the January 15 drawing on the floor of your dirty room and pocket a cool $1 million. The ticket, purchased at Dixon Landing Chevron in Milpitas, California, netted some undisclosed winner the $425 million jackpot. After all, with an estimated $60 million on the line and no winner after Wednesday's drawing, those who hope to strike it rich are still lining up at convenience stores in the hopes of scoring the lucky ticket. And you've probably daydreamed about winning the Powerball lottery and retiring to someplace where they've never even heard the words Polar Vortex. That means you have a greater chance of being killed by a shark, according to National Geographic.
