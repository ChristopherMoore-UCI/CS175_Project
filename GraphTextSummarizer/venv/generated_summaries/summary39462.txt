The junta leading Niger following last week's coup and suspension of the constitution is working to return the country to democratic rule, a United Nations official said Sunday. The new constitution already is in the works, said Djinnit, who along with representatives from the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States met with junta leaders in Niamey, Niger, on Sunday to push for a quick resolution to the conflict. "The political party is very keen to return power to civilians and transition to an all-inclusive democracy," U.N. Special Representative for West Africa Said Djinnit told CNN. Djinnit's observations back earlier reports that the situation was calm in Niger, with children returning to school and shops open for business. Tandja had been in office since 1999, but Niger's previous constitution mandated only two, five-year terms for president, according to the CIA World Fact Book.
