The book, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," includes an autograph from author J.K. Rowling. Last year, an 800-word prequel to the blockbuster Harry Potter novel series fetched nearly $50,000 for a writer's group and dyslexia charity. A first-edition Harry Potter book was sold for about $19,000, according to an auction house in Dallas, Texas. Normal copies of the Harry Potter books go for under $20, unlike the autographed first edition that sold for $19,000. It's the first book in the Harry Potter series and was published in the United States under the title "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."
