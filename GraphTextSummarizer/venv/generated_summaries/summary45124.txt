The financially-stricken side, who became the first-ever Premier League club to enter administration earlier this year, would have been gauranteed a place in Europe next season because their final opponents, Chelsea, have secured a Champions League place. A joint statement from the FA and English Premier League said: "The FA and Premier League have confirmed to the administrators of Portsmouth that they shall not consider any late application for granting of a UEFA Club Licence for the 2010-11 season." -- FA Cup finalists Portsmouth will not be allowed to play in next season's Europa League, the English Football Association (FA) have confirmed. It's wrong for the fans that they should not be allowed to support their club in Europe next season." European football's governing body UEFA had earlier revealed that the club could submit a late application before May 31 -- but the Premier League and FA have subsequently decreed that the Portsmouth's financial situation is so bad that they would not meet any of UEFA's criteria to enter.
