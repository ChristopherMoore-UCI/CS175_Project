The knife was found at the scene of the attack on Thursday, Detective Mike Pelletier told CNN, though he did not disclose details about the weapon. -- Investigators have found the knife believed to have been used in the stabbing of a University of California, Los Angeles student in a chemistry lab, authorities said Friday. The 20-year-old, whose identity has not been released, is being treated at the UCLA hospital for multiple stab wounds, including ones to her neck, sustained in the Thursday attack. Last month, Connecticut authorities found the body of a 24-year-old pharmacology graduate student inside a wall of a lab building at Yale University. A student stabbing victim is recovering at UCLA Medical Center, authorities say.
