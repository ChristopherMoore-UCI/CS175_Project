-- After her crowning in January, Katie Stam, Miss America 2009, went from beauty queen to traveling machine -- within minutes. Miss America Katie Stam is constantly on the road. But the ever chipper Miss America has a trick for getting around the wonky work hours: "If you know you only have 10 minutes, you take a quick 10 minute nap. "And so you really need to feel that you're coming home to your room, to your place where all of your things are." Stam also stresses the importance of a good night's sleep. "I change locations every two or three days, and that's exactly how it's going to be all year," Stam says.
