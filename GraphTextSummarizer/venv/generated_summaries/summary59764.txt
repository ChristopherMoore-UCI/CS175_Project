"A helicopter touched down briefly in the courtyard before taking off with the three prisoners,"  said Ann Mathieu, a spokeswoman for Quebec Provincial Police. Last year, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic. "We are talking closely with the detention center to figure out exactly how the escape transpired," Mathieu told CNN partner CBC. " A manhunt is under way for Yves Denis Yvon Lamontagne, 35,  Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49. And in France, Pascal Payet escaped not once, not twice, but three times from French prisons.
