"By designating the individuals and entities today, Treasury is sending a clear signal to the international community that Iran's attempts to evade international sanctions will not go unnoticed," Adam Szubin, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in a statement. Iran's secretive Quds Force is the elite special operations unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Iran Maritime Industrial Company SADRA and it subsidiary, Deep Offshore Technology PJS, are connected with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said. SADRA has offices in Iran and Venezuela and is owned by Khatam al-Anbiya, which the office has designated as an engineering arm of the Quds Force, the statement said. The shipping lines have "played a key role in Iran's efforts to advance its missile programs and transport other military cargoes," the Treasury Department said.
