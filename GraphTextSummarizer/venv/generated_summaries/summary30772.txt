During a long career, Dr. Dog has signed with different labels, seen members come and go and brought new ones aboard. Not until McMIcken's then-girlfriend slipped a copy of an album to My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James did the possibility of Dr. Dog becoming a touring band ever come up. Unlike bands that develop a following on the road, Dr. Dog evolved in the opposite direction. The letter also asked a lot of questions and sought details about Dr. Dog to which McMicken didn't have the answers. Liking what he heard on the album, James sent the members of Dr. Dog a "really nice letter," McMicken recalled, asking if they'd like to come on tour.
