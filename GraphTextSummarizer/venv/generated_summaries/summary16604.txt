This is one of the biggest celebrations in Sri Lanka and a pilgrimage for Sri Lankans. We filmed on the final night, which included performances by up to 50 separate dance troupes, highlighting various dance traditions in Sri Lanka. " "We decided that for this work trip, we would set aside some time for ourselves to experience what life in Sri Lanka is like," says Fernando. Any tips for photographing Sri Lanka? Fernando: Smile.
