Thiago Silva added a fourth in the 58th minute to keep the reigning champions ahead of second-placed Juventus who dropped points at home to Chievo. Barca, who were without Lionel Messi who is serving a one-match suspension for picking up five yellow cards, opened the scoring in the 42nd minute through Andres Iniesta. Instead it was Chievo who scored the game's second and final goal -- Boukary Drame netting in the 76th-minute. The home fans had to wait until the 78th minute for a breakthrough as Keita curled in a shot from the edge of the area before Xavi made sure of the three points two minutes from time. Paolo De Ceglie headed home from close range to give the hosts the lead after 18 minutes but they couldn't find a second goal to kill off the game.
