What Kim Jong Il, the current leader's father, spent during the famine years -- on weapons, luxury goods and a mausoleum for Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and the current leader's grandfather -- could have fed every last one of the victims. UN Watch, a Swiss group that monitors the U.N., recently published a call by 20 North Korean defectors, including survivors of North Korea's gulags, for the Swiss government to freeze Kim regime bank accounts. He reportedly added that Kim only served the finest liquor, just as a U.N. survey found that 84% of North Korean households have poor or "borderline" food consumption. Meanwhile, according to Kim Jong Il's former sushi chef, Kim's personal shoppers flew to Denmark for pork and to the Czech Republic for beer, and Kim Jong Il was able to purchase luxury cars and cognac from European suppliers. The practical effect of this "open-minded" business practice is to empower Kim's cronies as they purchase banned European luxury goods for the elite who help Kim cling to power through repression.
