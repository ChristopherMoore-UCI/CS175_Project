-- A paramedic who responded to a horrific, deadly fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas -- and who later spoke at a memorial for its victims -- was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for conspiring to make a pipe bomb, a prosecutor's office said. It was then that Reed became a focus of investigators, who saw the materials, including galvanized metal pipe, a fuse, coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders. DA sees no link so far between weapons possession and Texas blast Before that, authorities say, he'd bought pipe bomb components and had them shipped to his house. Reed, 31, was sentenced on those charges Wednesday afternoon in Waco, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas.
