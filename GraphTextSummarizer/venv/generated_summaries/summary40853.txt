Finally, when the other candidates teamed up on both Gingrich and Romney, as they did with health care (Bachmann's new angle of attack for the evening was calling the two "Newt Romney"), Romney needed to immediately separate himself from Gingrich. He asked Romney if he was more conservative (his potential weakness) and more electable (his potential strength) than Gingrich. Romney never mentioned his conservative principles or background, and he never attacked Gingrich on electability. Romney could have hammered home an argument that Gingrich would be a poor chief statesman because of his often-inappropriate outspokenness. If Gingrich is leading, and the voters think he and Romney are identical, then why would they vote for Romney?
