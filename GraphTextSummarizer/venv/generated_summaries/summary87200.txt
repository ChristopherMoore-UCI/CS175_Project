Watch Smith's video of chaos in streets Â» Tibetan exile groups maintain at least 80 people were killed by Chinese security forces that day, but Chinese authorities insist they acted with restraint and killed no one. Smith, who was traveling in Tibet when anti-Chinese rioting broke out Friday, returned home this week with dramatic video of the violence in  the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, which aired on Australian TV on Wednesday. The video shows Tibetans smashing windows and setting fire to Chinese shops and cars, while people are heard cheering. As armored vehicles and trucks carrying Chinese soldiers rushed past, Smith started videotaping. It also shows Chinese security forces, but no clashes between them and the rioters.
