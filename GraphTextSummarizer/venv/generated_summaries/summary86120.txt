To Hillary Clinton, U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu is the fighter for Louisiana who "refused to let Washington turn its back" on the state in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina almost 10 years ago. " Landrieu is in a different kind of fight this year -- a fight to keep her Senate seat against a stout challenge from Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. "Sen. Landrieu has had tight races in all of her races," said Fabien Levy, the campaign's spokesman. "From what I have heard, Mary's opponent didn't really lift a finger after Isaac," Clinton said, using a familiar Landrieu campaign attack that cites a 2012 no-vote against legislation that included disaster relief money for the state after Hurricane Isaac rocked the state. Cassidy has sought to tie Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who in much of Louisiana is markedly unpopular.
