The girl's father brought her to Giedrojc's home in the southwestern suburb of Oak Lawn on Sunday while he helped with repairs on a nearby home, Simonton told CNN. "Her father and grandfather had stepped out of the grandparents' house for a short time when this horrific event took place," Oak Lawn police said in a written statement on the death. Mike Kaufmann said the 61-year-old Giedrojc expressed remorse for the child's death when questioned, and investigators have found no record of previous arrests or mental illness. Alfreda Giedrojc is being held without bail after a court appearance Monday afternoon, said Tandra Simonton, a spokeswoman for the Cook County State's Attorney's office. Attempts to reach the public defender assigned to represent Giedrojc were unsuccessful Monday evening.
