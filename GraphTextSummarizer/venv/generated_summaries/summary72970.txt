Realizing there was a lack of support for young adults with cancer, Ulman and his family founded the Ulman Cancer fund for Young Adults, which provides education, support and resources to young adults with cancer and their families. " Supported by his parents, both of whom are themselves cancer survivors, Ulman recovered fully from the chondrosarcoma, but a few months later a mole on his chest was diagnosed as melanoma. The foundation caught the notice of seven-times Tour de France champion and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong and he enlisted Ulman to help run the Lance Armstrong Foundation. At 32 years old Doug Ulman is president of cancer-support charity the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Ulman is now completely cancer free but knows he is at risk of having melanoma again.
