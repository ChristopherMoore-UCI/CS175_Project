Upon learning the new anthem decree, most Chinese Internet users seem to be taking it in stride. A series of rules proposed by the government will set strict limits on when, where and how "March of the Volunteers" -- the anthem of the People's Republic since 1949 -- can be performed, state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday. At an airport ceremony welcoming the visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping this past summer, a Venezuelan military band -- led by trumpeters going either artistic or astray -- played a refreshingly different "March of the Volunteers" with a new tune, an extra section and a bit of jazz flair. Despite the government effort, Chinese people still seem to appreciate creative interpretations of their normally standardized national anthem. While the leaders appeared unfazed on the tarmac, video of the Venezuelan performance quickly went viral across Chinese cyberspace.
