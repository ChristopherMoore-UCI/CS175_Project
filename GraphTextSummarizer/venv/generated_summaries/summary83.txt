" The protesters were inside Cheney's fenced property in McLean, Virginia, when police arrived, "and the homeowners said they were not allowed to be there," said Fairfax County police spokesman Roger Henriquez. Two anti-war protesters -- one of them an 83-year-old woman -- were arrested Saturday outside the home of former Vice President Dick Cheney in suburban Washington, police said. "It's ironic and ridiculous that while the men responsible for torture are out running free and profiting from years of failed wars -- Dick Cheney has profited grossly off the Iraq War -- police were out arresting peaceful protesters who are calling for a new foreign policy based on diplomacy and compassion, " McCracken said. The group's national coordinator, Ali McCracken, said protesters met earlier in the morning outside the home of CIA Director John Brennan, who also lives in McLean. An exhaustive report released last month by the Senate Intelligence Committee found the CIA tortured suspected terrorists in a brutal and mismanaged program that produced little valuable intelligence.
