During the trip, which will last through Wednesday, they will meet with high-level officials of the communist regime, including President Raul Castro, and other Cuban citizens "to learn about new economic policies and the upcoming Party Congress, and to discuss ways to improve U.S.-Cuba relations," the Atlanta, Georgia-based center said in a written statement. -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, will travel Monday to Havana, Cuba, for a visit at the invitation of the Cuban government, the Carter Center announced Friday. In a speech broadcast live on Cuban radio and television, Carter, speaking in Spanish, called on the United States to end its "ineffective 43-year-old economic embargo" on the island. "Analysts said it was the first time in 43 years that citizens had heard any public criticism of the Cuban government, much less direct condemnation of human rights violations," Carter wrote in his report from the trip, referring to the time since Castro had been in power. He also called on then-President Fidel Castro to hold free elections, improve human rights, and allow greater civil liberties.
