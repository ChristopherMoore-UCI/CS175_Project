A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said in a prepared statement this week that members of Congress "should be held to the highest standards, and the alleged crime will be handled by the courts." "Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents," Boehner's spokesman said. -- Calling his drug possession conviction a "wake-up call," U.S. Rep. Trey Radel says he is taking a leave of absence for an unspecified time and will enter an in-patient drug treatment program. The admission Court documents say Radel gave the undercover officer $260 for the cocaine outside a restaurant, and the two got into the officer's vehicle, where the officer gave Radel the cocaine. Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents. "Your honor, I apologize for what I've done," Radel told Judge Robert Tignor in court Wednesday.
