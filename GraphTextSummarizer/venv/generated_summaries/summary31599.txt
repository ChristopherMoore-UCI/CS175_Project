Military strikes are to some extent forcing ISIS fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern Syria. Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure. A strategic shift to target the Syrian government's military infrastructure is unlikely as many regional and international state actors have a stake in Syria. Late last month, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said that without U.N. Security Council approval, the U.S. strikes lacked legitimacy. The Syrian military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake ISIS territories.
