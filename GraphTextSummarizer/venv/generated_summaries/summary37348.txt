Kim has won three times on the LPGA Tour, but is still waiting for her first major title. However, she eventually tied for fourth at 281 with Lewis (66) and Koreans Amy Yang (69) and Seo Hee-kyung (71). "Last year when I finished I was crying so hard, but this year I was happy, smiling, enjoy the crowd, enjoy walking on the 18 holes, and I think it's because I do my best every shot," she said. "I didn't think about winning today because I didn't want to expect too much, and I didn't want to let myself down," Yoo told reporters after becoming the second South Korean to win the event, following Grace Park in 2004. Yoo climbed five places to 16th in the world rankings after claiming her second victory on the LPGA Tour, having also triumphed at the 2010 Sybase Match Play Championship.
