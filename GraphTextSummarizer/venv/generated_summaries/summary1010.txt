But, as President Barack Obama warned Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday that there would be "no letup" in NATO airstrikes, Russia lashed out against the air campaign, calling the bombing of certain Tripoli targets a "flagrant deviation" from the United Nations mandate. "It is up to the Libyan people to decide when and if Colonel Gadhafi should go -- not the U.S. and the U.K." Russia's official RIA Novosti news agency reported that Gadhafi's government may ask Moscow to mediate the conflict. Zuma will meet Gadhafi Monday in "his capacity as a member of the African Union high-level panel for the resolution of the conflict in Libya," the statement said. That resolution authorized all means necessary, short of occupying forces, to enforce a no-fly zone and protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to Gadhafi. -- Explosions erupted in Tripoli for a second consecutive night Wednesday into Thursday morning as NATO jets struck a vocational secondary school, a Libyan government official said.
