Once a full-time fireman,  Skilliter, a 26-year-old Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, native, now regularly travels from East Coast to West Coast. "Ninety-five percent of hockey players wouldn't take our job," said hockey official Graham Skilliter, referring to the lower pay, heavy travel schedule, verbal abuse and stiff competition for a coveted officiating position in the NHL. Officials face a crowd of hockey fans who will never be satisfied with every call -- and fans aren't shy about voicing it. Skilliter recommends having a solid back-up career in place, because leagues can only hire a few guys at a time. Alex Stagnone's face once needed eight stitches while on the job, but he quickly returned to the ice, ready for another 20 minutes of relentless action.
