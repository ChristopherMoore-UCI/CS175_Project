" In the video, de Blasio speaks about drinking and smoking marijuana when she was in college, as well as the outpatient treatment that started her on the road to recovery. Participating in her father's campaign after completing treatment "was like the greatest thing ever," de Blasio says, although she doesn't specify that it was the mayoral race.
