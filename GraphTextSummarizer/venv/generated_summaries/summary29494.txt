Juliet Gilbert, who has just completed a PhD in social anthropology researching young women's livelihoods in Nigeria, says the "bride price is an incredibly significant part of marriage customs in Nigeria" that "should be seen as a token of respect towards and provision for family and community, rather than a monetary value placed on an individual female." The app quickly went viral after a private link was tweeted on Sunday May 25, forcing the brand to switch servers, and "Bride Price" to trend in Nigeria. Nigeria is a big, complex country, with over 200 tribes, but where I come from, the entire process of marriage is designed to show respect to the wife's family," adds Effiong. In some cases, however, families return the symbolic payment to signify that their daughter is not for sale. To begin with, the app uses the controversial term "Half-caste," which would add N50,000 ($308) to your worth, just like the answer "Lupita" -- some say this pays testament to the impact Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o has had on the perceptions of beauty and darker skinned girls.
