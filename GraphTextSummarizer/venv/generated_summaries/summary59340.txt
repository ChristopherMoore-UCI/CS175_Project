Obama appointment to labor board sparks opposition Now, Republicans and business groups criticize the Becker appointment as circumventing the Senate and bowing to pressure from labor allies. Axelrod noted that the previous administration had fewer appointees awaiting Senate confirmation at the same point after taking power. "Most of the men and women whose appointments I am announcing today were approved by Senate committees months ago, yet still await a vote of the Senate," Obama said in the statement issued Saturday. Much of the controversy over Obama's decision to use his authority to make recess appointments focused on Craig Becker, a union lawyer nominated to the National Labor Relations Board. The Constitution gives a president the power to fill vacancies without the Senate's confirmation when the legislative body is in recess.
