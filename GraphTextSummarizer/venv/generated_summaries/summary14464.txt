Security officials blamed al Qaeda. Ansaar al-Sharia has threatened to take over Aden and announce a crescent shaped Islamic emirate in south Yemen. "The government has been practicing a dangerous tactic by weakening the political security because its loyalty is not to the ruling family," said Abdul Salam Mohammed, Chairman of Abaad Strategic Center. -- A militant attack on a government vehicle in Yemen's business capital, Aden, Wednesday, killed a political security officer and injured seven others, three senior security officials said. "This is not the first time intelligence officers were attacked in Aden," said a senior security official who is not authorized to talk to media.
