-- Major League Baseball will probably move Monday to suspend New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez amid allegations involving the use of performance-enhancing drugs, two sources close to the decision told CNN on Sunday. Usually, suspensions related to drug offenses are made under the players' collective bargaining agreement, allowing suspended players to keep playing while their cases are being appealed. Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis and several men associated with it in March, alleging the clinic supplied banned performance-enhancing substances to a number of current and former professional baseball players like ex-Boston Red Sox slugger Manny Ramirez. Rodriguez may not be the only player facing suspension Monday as a result of the Biogenesis scandal, with reports of more than a dozen others possibly being punished. All about A-Rod Rodriguez has missed the entire 2013 season so far after undergoing hip surgery, and he told reporters Saturday he plans to rejoin his teammates for Monday night's game in Chicago against the White Sox.
