"Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, state officials have continued to demonize Mr. Willingham and defend the arson evidence on which he and others have been convicted," the family's petition states. The family of Cameron Todd Willingham has asked a judge to posthumously clear his name, arguing that he was put to death based on "junk science." Baird told lawyers he will issue a decision on that request next week, said Gerry Goldstein, a lawyer representing Willingham's stepmother, Eugenia Willingham, and cousin Patricia Cox. The first of three reports to reach that conclusion was sent to Gov. Rick Perry's office and submitted to appeals courts before Willingham's execution, while two others were conducted after his death. And Corsicana authorities have said that evidence beyond the testimony of state fire marshals supported Willingham's conviction.
