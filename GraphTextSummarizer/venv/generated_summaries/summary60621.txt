Sitting down with CNN -- his first interview with an international television network -- Prime Minister Naoto Kan answered wide-ranging questions from pressing economic issues leading up to the upcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit, to the diplomatic challenges from economic superpower China. Japan is in an ongoing dispute with China over islands in the east China Sea. Diplomatically, he is in the middle of a major test with China, a country wielding growing strength in the world economy, and a superpower that's just surpassed Japan in economic might. His detention drew diplomatic fire from China, resulting in the cancellation of high-level ministerial meetings, most recently the abrupt cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Kan and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Japan had little choice, he suggested, since U.S. policy has been to boost the U.S. economy.
