Daniel, who was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma eight months ago, has a tumor that is inoperable because it "grows like fingers into the brain," Chamberlin said. Â However, Daniel's biggest birthday wish was much simpler: mail. A social media campaign by family and friends brought lots of birthday cards addressed to Daniel to the Foxborough, Massachusetts, post office this past week. Â "He just loves getting mail, he's always running to the mailbox," his aunt, Gail Chamberlin, told CNN. When his family asked Daniel what he wanted for his sixth birthday, he told them he just wanted mail.
