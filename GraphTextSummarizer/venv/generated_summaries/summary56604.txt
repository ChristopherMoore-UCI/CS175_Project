Last May, College Board, which runs the SAT system, canceled an SAT testing date in South Korea after tutor companies were suspected to have illegally acquired SAT testing materials in advance and told their students what would be on the test. Thousands of Chinese and South Korean students applying for colleges and universities in the United States face an anxious wait amid claims of widespread cheating during recent SAT tests -- the measure used in the admissions process. South Korea, another country with large numbers of students studying in the United States, has been hit cheating as well, with unscrupulous tactics often blamed on intense cramming schools called "Hakwons." "Based on specific, reliable information, we have placed the scores of all students who are current residents of (South) Korea or China and sat for the October 11 international administration of the SAT on hold while we conduct an administrative review," Tom Ewing, spokesperson for test assessors the Educational Testing Service (ETS), said in a statement. "(We) strongly denounce organizations that seek to illegally obtain test materials for their own profit," added Ewing.
