But in a long-running game of "don't get mad, get even," Underwood -- with help from Doug Stamper, his subtly brutal chief of staff (Michael Kelly); Claire, his devoted and equally conniving lobbyist wife (Robin Wright); and Zoe Barnes, a pliable, ambitious reporter (Kate Mara) -- managed to knock down his obstacles and maneuver his way up the Washington food chain. Naturally, Willimon and his stars have been tight-lipped about how far Underwood will take things in a show The Kansas City Star nicknamed "Mr. Macbeth Goes to Washington." In an interview last fall with CNN, showrunner Beau Willimon explained that Underwood, at heart, is "an optimist," though he understands the darker view. When we last saw South Carolina Congressman Francis Underwood on Netflix's "House of Cards," he was being offered an appointment to the vice presidency of the United States. As Underwood noted in the very first episode as he put a wounded dog out of its misery, "I have no patience for useless things."
