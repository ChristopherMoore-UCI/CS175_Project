"From insulting women to disabled people, Kinabatangan MP Datuk Bung Mokhtar is no stranger to controversy, but now his zero common sense in attributing Germany's win to Hitler will make Malaysia the centre of a negative attention once again." By Thursday, Bung's online antics had caught the attention of the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who tweeted to his two million followers: "The comments made by Datuk Bung Moktar are unacceptable and wrong, and he will withdraw them." "Let us now look forward to two more thrilling and exciting games." It remains illegal in Germany to glorify Hitler or the Nazi Party, or to display symbols of the regime including flags, uniforms and slogans. On Wednesday, Bung defended his Hitler reference, telling Malaysia's Star Online: "I don't know what's wrong with people sometimes. " A member of the United Malays National Organization, Bung Moktar Radin posted his initial tweet on Tuesday after Germany knocked Brazil out of the World Cup with an impressive 7-1 win.
