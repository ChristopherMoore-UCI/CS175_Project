Some 24 structures in Marion County had been burned by what's being called the Hopkins Prairie Fire, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Susan Blake. The blaze around Ocala National Forest was 80% contained as of early Sunday evening, Blake added. -- A wildfire jumped a road in central Florida, scorching homes and wiping out trees as it charred more than 1,900 acres, a fire official said Sunday. A fire line has been set up around the blaze, and crews are optimistic about the situation, said Blake. Video from CNN affiliate WCJB showed ground smoldering, with most trees singed or felled, even as a few somehow still stood tall.
