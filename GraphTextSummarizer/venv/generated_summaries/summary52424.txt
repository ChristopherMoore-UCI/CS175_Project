A 2013 study found that public complaints against police officers in Rialto, California, plunged after the city's 54 frontline officers began wearing video cameras. Should police officers wear cameras to document their activities while on duty? As Austin noted, a 2013 report by the Department of Justice found that "both officers and civilians acted in a more positive manner when they were aware that a camera was present." Of course, body cameras create some thorny privacy issues, such as whether police need consent to videotape activities on private property. Amid protests following the lack of indictments in the Garner case, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in December that his police department was accelerating efforts to equip all its officers with body cameras as well. Other police departments across the U.S. are also now testing body cameras.
