The federal prosecution of former U.S. Rep. Rick Renzi of Arizona will continue, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Thursday. The charges include conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering, extortion and insurance fraud. The privilege protects lawmakers and staffers from legal action over "legislative" acts. Previous lawmakers have sought to shield themselves from prosecution using the "speech and debate" protection, including former Rep. William Jefferson, D-Louisiana. "Despite Renzi's best efforts to convince us otherwise, we agree with the district court that the alleged choices and actions for which he is being prosecuted lie beyond those limits" of protected activity, the court said in a unanimous 45-page ruling.
