Bomb belt found in Uganda attacks probe I think Uganda has been targeted for these bombings because of its activities in Somalia. (United Nations humanitarian chief Jan Egeland has described the 20-year conflict in northern Uganda between government forces and the LRA as the most neglected humanitarian crisis in the world. Vines: Al-Shabaab are the leading point of inquiry because of its previous threats against Uganda and because of its contributions to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the presence of the EU training mission in Mogadishu. "We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators; they have received their response," the statement from Al-Shabaab read in apparent reference to the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia that Uganda contributes troops to. Uganda certainly sees itself as playing a regional role: President Museveni was instrumental in pushing for U.N. sanctions on Eritrea that came into force earlier this year so clearly he has many enemies as well as friends.
