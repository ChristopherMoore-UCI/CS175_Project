Matt Szabo, spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, said providing security at the event was the city's "obligation" and its "No. 1 priority." Police closed a several-block area outside the Staples Center and closed highway exits near downtown Los Angeles during the event. Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine on Monday called for AEG, the company that owns the Staples Center, to cover all costs of the memorial, arguing the public should not foot any of the bill, according to the Los Angeles Times. Between 5,000 and 15,000 people without tickets showed support for the pop star by waiting outside the Staples Center during the service, said Jim McDonnell, an assistant Los Angeles police chief. Los Angeles Councilwoman Jan Perry said last week that the city would pay for the security efforts.
