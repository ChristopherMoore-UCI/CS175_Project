Former United midfielder David Beckham gave the bid a lift when he donned one of the scarves as he left the field after AC Milan's March 10 Champions League defeat at Old Trafford. -- The group of wealthy businessmen planning to buy English Premier League champions Manchester United has ruled out making a bid until the end of the season. The green and gold scarves that have become a symbol of their disquiet now dominate the stands at Old Trafford, while banners declaring "Love United Hate Glazer" are commonplace. United fans have shown their support for the bid with protests against the Glazer family at recent matches. The "Red Knights" consortium signaled their intention to buy out the American Glazer family on March 2 and have been recruiting new investors and working on a proposal.
