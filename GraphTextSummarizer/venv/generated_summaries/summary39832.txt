About a dozen financial backers of Romney and other major Republican donors met with Adelson in Las Vegas while they were in town for a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition to convince him to "come on board" with respect to supporting Romney. Now with Gingrich out of the race, political analysts are looking to see when Adelson will put his next big bet down -- this one on Romney. Adelson did not attend a high-profile Romney fund-raiser Tuesday night at the Trump International Hotel but later went to a smaller dessert donor reception at a private residence with Romney and Gingrich, a source familiar with the event told CNN. The key motivation for Adelson this campaign is preventing the re-election of President Barack Obama, those knowledgeable about the billionaire's thinking have said. Following an hour and a half hour meeting Tuesday afternoon with Nevada billionaire Sheldon Adelson and a few aides, the presumptive Republican nominee was assured the casino magnate was fully supportive of him.
