After raising a staggering amount of money for the general election, President-elect Barack Obama must now rake in more cash for his transition and inauguration. "I really do hope Obama sticks by his principles and does not accept corporate money, does not accept money from lobbyists, and places a very, very low ceiling on the amount of money he'd accept from individuals to pay for his inauguration," said Craig Holman, a legislative representative for Public Citizen. To make up the difference, past presidents have turned to private money and corporate cash. Watch what people will do for inauguration tickets Â» President Bush raised a record $42.8 million for his second inauguration, and according to Public Citizen, more than 90 percent of donations to his second inauguration were from executives or corporations. Obama could decide to accept corporate donations for the inauguration, but impose tighter limits.
