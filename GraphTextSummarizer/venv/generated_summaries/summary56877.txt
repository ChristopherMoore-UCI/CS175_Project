In the latest move by the central authorities to control the spread of Christianity, the governing body for religious affairs has said that it will develop "Chinese Christian theology." "The construction of Chinese Christian theology should adapt to China's national condition and integrate with Chinese culture," said Wang Zuoan, director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs. But even as the central government and the pontiff seem to be getting along better, reports have emerged that Chinese Catholics have been barred from visiting South Korea to see the pontiff. Detentions, the kidnapping of bishops, tearing down churches -- these are the actions against Christians China has been guilty of. So when Pope Francis was given permission to fly over China on Thursday on his way to South Korea, many saw it as a sign of hope for religious freedom -- especially Catholicism -- in China. Around half of more than 100 students who had planned to travel from China to South Korea to attend the Asian Youth Day event and catch a glimpse of the Pope have not made it.
