"I'm confident that if (the Indonesian president) knows what they've done and how much they have changed, I'm sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed," Myuran's mother, Raji Sukumaran, said tearfully.

" Quilty said it's not an attempt to convince the Indonesian authorities to spare them -- "that's out of my hands" -- but a personal tribute to his friend, and to show Sukumaran that he and Chan are not alone. He knows that in the days or weeks ahead, he could be led out of his cell with Andrew Chan, his co-conspirator in a failed 2005 drug plot, blindfolded and shot by an Indonesian firing squad.
