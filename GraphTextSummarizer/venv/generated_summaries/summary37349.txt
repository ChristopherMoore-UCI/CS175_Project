By early Thursday, genuine tweets about Wilson were interspersed with ads for male erectile dysfunction: "Joe Wilson Cialis $1.9 Viagra $1.1 (Web site address)" Though Wilson issued an apology, saying his emotions got the best of him, few online bought it. Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama. As soon as Rep. Joe Wilson was identified as the person whose angry and audible outburst disrupted President Obama's health care speech to Congress, condemnation was swift -- and brutal. "Joe Wilson yells 'Freebird' at concerts." Not everyone, however, was busy assigning blame to Wilson. Amid all this, the campaign of Democrat Rob Miller, who hopes to unseat the Republican Wilson in next year's midterm elections, raked in the dough: more than $200,000 from 5,000 individuals overnight and Thursday morning after Obama's speech, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
