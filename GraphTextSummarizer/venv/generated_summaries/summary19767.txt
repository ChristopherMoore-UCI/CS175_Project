" With the help of the public's PCs scientists will now start running regional climate models for the western United States, Europe and southern Africa. Using the collective power of ordinary home computers, scientists from the United Kingdom, United States and South Africa will run thousands of regional climate modeling tests which would otherwise take much longer to complete, even on the most up-to-date supercomputers. Oregon State will be examining data from models of extreme precipitations in the western United States. People interested in signing up to the project can visit http://climateprediction.net/weatherathome/ where they can download all the necessary tools to start running regional climate models from their own computers. For the regional modeling, Oxford University is being assisted by Oregon State University and South Africa's University of Cape Town.
