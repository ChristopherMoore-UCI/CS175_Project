"American Airlines is extending its previously announced schedule reductions through the first half of November by approximately 1%," said American spokesman Matt Miller in a statement. Some American customers are starting to book flights on other airlines. Some travel agents and business travelers have told CNN they can't count on American flights to take off or -- when they do take off, to land on time. Carl Jackson, a representative of the Allied Pilots Association, told CNN on Thursday as several dozen American pilots conducted an informational picket at Washington's Reagan National Airport. Although American management and pilots resumed negotiations last week, the three major American employee unions have already reached conditional agreement with US Airways, should a merger of the two airlines take place.
