-- A 6.6-magnitude earthquake struck early Sunday in the western Pacific off Papua New Guinea, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The tremor did not immediately prompt any tsunami warnings by the U.S. National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center or the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Tsunami Programme, which is affiliated with the United Nations, likewise said historical data suggests there is "no destructive widespread tsunami threat. The epicenter was about 33 kilometers south-southeast of Taron, in the eastern part of Papua New Guinea. " "However, earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a hundred kilometers of the earthquake epicenter," the IOC said in a bulletin.
