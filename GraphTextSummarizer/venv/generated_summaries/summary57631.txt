"Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds, and you would expect to see real progress for cleanup [to] happen with those dollars." Ken Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was "at a standstill" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington state's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted.
