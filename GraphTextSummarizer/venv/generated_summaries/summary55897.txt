National Transportation Safety Board officials will interview crew members on Friday, NTSB spokesman Robert Sumwalt said in Philadelphia Thursday afternoon. The NTSB will also conduct a 72-hour history to determine the mental and emotional state of the crew of boat vessels, Sumwalt said. The company's website posted this message Thursday: "Our thoughts and prayers are with our Philadelphia tour guests, crew members and their families. Alcohol tests on crew members came back negative, Sumwalt said. "We want to find out what happened and issue safety regulations so that this does not happen again," said Sumwalt, who is vice chairman of the NTSB.
