-- A New Orleans police officer was suspended Monday without pay after he posted remarks online about slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin. officer Jason Giroir wrote on the website of CNN affiliate WWL, under a news story on the case that has sparked national debate and concerns about racial profiling. Serpas said Giroir embarrassed the department by his "insensitive, harmful and offensive comments." Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed late last month as he walked back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to a convenience store. "The Internet comments written by Officer Giroir, which include the fact that he is member of the NOPD, have given me grave concern regarding his fitness for duty. Giroir admitted to the post, according to a statement from New Orleans police.
