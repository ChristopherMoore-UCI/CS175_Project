-- One British citizen was killed and another one was kidnapped overnight at a resort near Kenya's border with Somalia "We continue to advise against all but essential travel to within 30 kilometers of Kenya's border with Somalia. His wife has likely been taken by Islamic militants by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia, the source told CNN. There have been previous attacks by Somali militia into Kenya," the advisory said. CNN's David Wilkinson contributed to this report.
