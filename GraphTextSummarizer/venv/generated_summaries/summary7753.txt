" He walked into the Federal Building, where he made threats against President Obama and the federal government, KFOR reported, citing U.S. Secret Service agents. The man is accused of running his car on Friday into a controversial 6-foot-tall granite tablet of the biblical edicts erected near Oklahoma City's Capitol, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. "If our monument stands at the state Capitol, we want it to complement and contrast the Ten Commandments, with both standing unmolested as a testament to American religious freedom and tolerance." The ACLU filed suit last year against the presence of the monument on state property, and on Friday, said that it would keep fighting for its removal, because it feels it violates the Constitution. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has vowed to have the Ten Commandments monument rebuilt.
