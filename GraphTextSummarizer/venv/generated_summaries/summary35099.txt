Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother's failed vice presidential bid through appearances on "Dancing with the Stars" and a Lifetime show about raising her son, "Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp." The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film "Amazing America," Sarah Palin's show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. "He met Tripp during that time, and I've seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. Sarah Palin also congratulated the couple, noting that Meyer "flew up North" to ask Bristol Palin's father and grandfather for her hand in marriage. Wedding bells are on the horizon for Bristol Palin and 2011 Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer. Meyer, 26, proposed to Palin, 24, Friday night at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas, Palin said on her blog.
