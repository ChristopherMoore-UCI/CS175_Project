There's John Travolta kissing not actress Scarlett Johansson -- as in the original incident from Sunday's Academy Awards -- but Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un or the Statue of Liberty. Then there's Biden gripping the shoulders of Stephanie Carter, the wife of the new U.S. defense secretary, last week. Though the notion of cultural space varies with culture, Americans are undisputed champions for a large personal zone, argues University of Massachusetts, Amherst psychology professor Susan Krauss Whitbourne. That image evoked memories of former President George W. Bush's awkward shoulder massage of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the 2006 G8 summit. And although they make might for laughs by violating the unspoken rules of personal space in such egregious ways, Travolta, Biden and others are demonstrating a cultural disregard for women, she said.
