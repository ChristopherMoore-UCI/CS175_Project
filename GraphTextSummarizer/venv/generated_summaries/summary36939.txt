-- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for tighter controls over tourism and other forms of pollution in Antarctica Monday, arguing for greater global cooperation to help preserve the continent's environmental and scientific research value. At the same time, the United States is proposing new requirements for lifeboats on tourist ships "to make sure they can keep passengers alive until rescue comes," Clinton noted. A number of international scientific research stations have been established in Antarctica in part to help explore the probable causes and effects of global warming. The Dry Valley region of Antarctica has seen an increase in visits by tourists. Clinton noted that President Obama sent the U.S. Senate an amendment to the treaty Friday that would spell out how the international community should better prevent and respond to environmental emergencies in Antarctica.
