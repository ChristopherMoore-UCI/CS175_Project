Defense analyst Pervez Hoodbhoy and military officials call South Waziristan "the headquarters of the Taliban and al Qaeda," a safe haven where they are free to train and plan deadly suicide and guerilla attacks. Three times the Pakistani army has launched military offensives in South Waziristan. The much anticipated ground offense follows a recent wave of militant attacks in Pakistan that killed more than 150 security personnel and civilians. HOODBHOY: Waziristan is very important in the assertion of Pakistan's sovereignty.
