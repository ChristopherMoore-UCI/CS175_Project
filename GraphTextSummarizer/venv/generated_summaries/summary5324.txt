In an interview with MTV's Sway Calloway Thursday, Brown opened up about his own history with domestic violence in light of Rice being cut from the Baltimore Ravens and suspended from the league after a leaked video depicted the player punching his now-wife, Janay Rice. "To Ray or anybody else, because I'm not better than the next man, I can just say I've been down that road," Brown told MTV News. -- Chris Brown has some words of advice for suspended NFL player Ray Rice. "It helps me ... if I'm frustrated and I'm dealing with something, to vent and say what I'm going through so I can hear from an actual clinical person, 'This is how you should react,' or 'It's good to feel this way because feelings, emotions, and energy and emotions, are supposed to come and go. " Brown infamously attacked his former girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 on the eve of the Grammy Awards, and was sentenced to a five-year probation and 1,400 hours of community service. "It's all about the choices you do make," Brown told Calloway.
