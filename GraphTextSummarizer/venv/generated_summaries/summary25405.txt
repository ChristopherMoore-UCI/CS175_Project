Djokovic needed less than an hour and a half to see off young Russian Andrey Kuznetsov -- who upset grand slam finalist David Ferrer at Wimbledon last year -- 6-0 6-1 6-4, but defending champion Stan Wawrinka had to work somewhat harder against Romanian qualifier Marius Copil. Williams' older sister, Venus, also progressed to the third round by crushing fellow American Lauren Davis 6-2 6-3. U.S. Open finalist Kei Nishikori admitted to feeling slightly dizzy due to the conditions but still eliminated another big server, Ivan Dodig of Croatia. This was no ordinary second-round match for Serena Williams at the Australian Open, even though her opponent was ranked outside the top 200. It was the start of a 10-game run that propelled the 18-time grand slam winner to a 7-5 6-0 win on the first day of sweltering conditions -- temperatures reached almost 36 degrees Celsius in Melbourne -- at the year's opening major.
