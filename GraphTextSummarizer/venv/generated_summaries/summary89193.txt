"They're real-life stories that will save lives and save money, that will have a huge health impact by highlighting the real-life stories of people harmed by tobacco and highlighting the fact that secondhand smoke also kills, also disables, also causes tremendous suffering," Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC's director, said Thursday. The "Tips From Former Smokers" campaign, which launches Monday, includes ads featuring people such as Tiffany, 35. "There's very strong scientific evidence that ads like this make a big difference in encouraging people to quit," he said, "and a larger number of people do quit long term because of the ads. After the first "Tips" campaign last year, the number of people calling the quit line increased by 200,000, Frieden said. Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, according to the CDC, affecting 8 million people and triggering $200 million a year in health care costs.
