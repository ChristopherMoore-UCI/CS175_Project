"We were hoping for a low turnout because it would provide us with the greater chance of winning," said Cao, a lawyer and community activist. In 2005, Jefferson's private homes in Washington and New Orleans were raided, and FBI agents say they found $90,000 in cash stashed in one of his freezers. Cao conceded that low voter turnout aided his victory. Jefferson also is accused of soliciting and receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes for himself and his family in exchange for promoting their products and services to countries in Africa. Cao also may have been helped by the scandal that has plagued Jefferson.
