The agents fell under fire after responding to a sensor that had gone off near the border, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI for the Phoenix division, declined to say whether the agents involved in the incident returned fire. His death only strengthens our resolve to enforce the rule of law and bring those responsible to justice," Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar said in a statement. The agent killed was identified as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie.
