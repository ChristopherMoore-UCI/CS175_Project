After three such arrests in February 2008, Westergaard issued a statement, saying, "Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me. Over the years, Danish authorities have arrested other suspects who allegedly plotted against Westergaard's life. The incident "once again confirms the terrorist threat that is directed against Denmark and against cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, in particular," said Jakob Scharf, spokesman for the Danish Security and Intelligence Service. Danish police shot the 28-year-old suspect Friday night as he tried to enter Westergaard's home in the city of Aarhus. An ax-wielding Somali man is accused of trying to break into Westergaard's home Friday and was charged the next day with attempted assassination.
