" There were other troubling signs: One side of Christine's forehead was normal, but the other was "meaty," Vicki recalls. The indented line in Christine's forehead -- a feature found in about one-quarter of people with facial hemiatrophy -- is known as coup de sabre, a French phrase that translates as "cut of a saber" and evokes a scar that someone who has sustained a gash in a sword fight might be left with. In 2008, two and a half years after the line first appeared on Christine's face, a geneticist who specializes in facial deformities finally diagnosed her with Parry-Romberg syndrome, an extremely rare autoimmune disorder that affects roughly one in a million people. So Vicki contacted Dr. John Siebert, M.D., a plastic surgeon whose name she'd come across during her online research. "It looked like she ran into a doorjamb, which kids do," says Christine's mother, Vicki.
