"When Ronaldo won his first Champions League title with Manchester United in 2008, the English powerhouses did not have have an official Twitter account," said Barnett. Any sports star hoping to mount a challenge to Ronaldo's Facebook and Twitter supremacy clearly faces as tough a test as the hapless defenders trying to keep the prolific striker off the score sheet. For Ronaldo, his attraction is not limited to a single country or region, with research suggesting he's known by over 84% of the world's population -- giving plenty of scope still for him to increase his Facebook and Twitter fan base yet more. -- He might be fighting it out with Lionel Messi for the title of the world's top soccer player, but Cristiano Ronaldo is in a league of his very own when it comes to social media followers. "He's going down the David Beckham route and is extremely well managed." Ronaldo's physical appearance is clearly a factor in his widespread following outside of avid sports fans, but Barnett said his most popular tweets were all football related.
