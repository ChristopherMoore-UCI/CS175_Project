In Saudi Arabia, there is no law that stipulates a minimum age for marriage. Some groups, such as the HRC, advocate for setting a minimum age for marriage, though they've not said what age. She is from Al-Hurath village in Jizan province, in southwestern Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen, according to Dr. Hadi Al-Yami, the head of the Asir branch of the Human Rights Commission. Dr. Suhaila Zein al-Abedin of the Saudi National Association for Human Rights -- also a government-backed group -- voiced concern not only about the age difference, but the circumstances of the marriage. "When you consider the very large difference in age, it looks more like this was not a marriage, but like the girl was sold," al-Abedin said.
