U.S. officials imposed the curfew in response to widespread outrage over rape accusations in October against U.S. sailors on the Japanese island of Okinawa. For decades, crimes committed by U.S. troops stationed in Japan have contributed to a bumpy relationship between the Japanese people and the U.S. military. The Navy said it is "currently reviewing the incident to determine if there was a violation" of regulations for U.S. service members serving in Japan. Being off-base without permission could put Silva in breach of a standing curfew for all U.S. military service members in Japan. A U.S. sailor stands accused of ringing doorbells in the middle of the night and breaking into a 72-year-old woman's property while drunk, say police in Yokosuka, Japan.
