President Obama admitted Friday that his basketball game is suffering and he prefers golf nowadays, but for Attorney General Eric Holder it's nothing but net. In 2010, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the President received a dozen stitches after getting hit with an errant elbow during a Friday morning basketball game with White House aide Reggie Love and others at Fort McNair military base in Washington. Friday afternoon she tweeted: "I'm game LOL" In a town hall event Friday, President Obama said he's fallen a long way from his days "dominating" the court. "I've been a little busy, and what happens is that, sort of, the risk-reward ratio starts shifting." Holder, however, is seen sinking the ball with ease in a YouTube video posted Friday.
