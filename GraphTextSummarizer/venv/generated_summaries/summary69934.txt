China says its military budget will increase by 10.1% in 2015, the latest in a series of double-digit increases that will narrow the still-significant gap with the United States on defense spending. According to a budget report released at the start of China's National People's Congress - the annual meeting of the country's rubber stamp parliament -- defense spending will total 887 billion yuan ($144.2 billion) this year. It also comes amid unease among China's neighbors about the pursuit of its territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea. The increase underscores China's intention to prioritize military spending even as economic growth slows. But, while China's budget has increased by double digits every year since 2010, U.S. spending has declined since then.
