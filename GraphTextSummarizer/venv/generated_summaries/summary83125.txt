With cyber security a recognized priority at all levels of society, it is not that surprising that employers of this profession such as those I have met through playing the Challenge are on the lookout for new talent to fill increasing job vacancies. Over the past three years I have competed in a unique set of security games, backed by UK government, industry, academics and professional bodies, known as the Cyber Security Challenge. While the Challenge won't solve our recruitment issues on its own it is vital that countries like the UK look outside of the traditional academic pathways if they are to build a healthy pipeline of cyber defenders to protect internet users from those that wish them harm. While the nature of this threat landscape is uncertain, the potential damage a cyber-attack could pose to our internet-dependent telecommunications, power and even water infrastructure, has seen cyber security rise sharply up government agendas around the world in the last five years. And while there are people who like me developed this knowledge and skills off their own back, there is still limited information out there about cyber security as a career option.
