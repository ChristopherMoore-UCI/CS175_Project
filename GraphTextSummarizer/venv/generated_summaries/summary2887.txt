According to Kahn, the producer of the other "Power Rangers," Haim Saban, is "trying to shut 'Power/Rangers' down." These are not your older brother's Power Rangers. Director Joseph Kahn, known as a music video powerhouse (Taylor Swift's "Blank Space," Britney Spears' "Toxic"), told HitFix that he was unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of the Power Rangers universe but liked the challenge. The video stars James Van Der Beek and Katee Sackhoff. "Every image in 'Power/Rangers' is original footage," he posted in a series of tweets.
