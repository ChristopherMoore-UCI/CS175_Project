Strong language is nothing new for Smith, whose first film, "Clerks," put him on the map with its merrily scatological musings. "Zack and Miri" was also a possibility for an NC-17, considered the kiss of death by studios because of distributing and marketing challenges, until Smith argued its merits to the ratings board and received an R. Since "Clerks," Smith's films have been almost wistfully romantic ("Chasing Amy," "Jersey Girl") or as joyfully profane as "Clerks" ("Dogma," "Clerks II"). I think it's strange that in this day and age, the 21st century, that people are hung up on a word, and the word is "porno." I mean working with actual people with porn experience. Kevin Smith: There's a bit of language in this picture.
