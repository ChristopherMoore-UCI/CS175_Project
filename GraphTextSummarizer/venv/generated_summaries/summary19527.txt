-- Ahead of the first grand slam tournament of the year, the Australian Open, defending champion Roger Federer has exclusively told CNN's Pedro Pinto that his rivalry with Rafael Nadal is only on the tennis court -- and the pair are good friends when the action stops. " In addition to his regular backroom team -- which includes the Swiss Davis captain Severin Luthi -- Federer will also draw on the experience of renowned coach Paul Annacone, who he recruited in August last year and has overseen a definite upsurge in Federer's performances. At the end of last year, Nadal accepted the World No.2's invitation to play in the "Match for Africa" in Zurich for the Roger Federer Foundation which funds child development in Africa. Federer and Nadal did not face each other in the gulf state, but their paths have crossed 22 times since 2004, with Nadal currently leading the head-to-head 14 victories to eight. It happened when Rafa took the number one spot a couple of years ago," continued Federer.
