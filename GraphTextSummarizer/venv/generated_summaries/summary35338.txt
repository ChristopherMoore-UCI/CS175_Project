The vessels, a frigate and supply ship, are on a yearlong intelligence-gathering mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, Iranian officials have said, according to Fars. The commander of Iran's navy said Tuesday that "the presence" of the ships in the Suez means Iran can "turn threats into opportunities. In Iran, a military commander expressed patriotic pride over the development: the first Iranian vessels to sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution. Israeli President Shimon Peres, speaking on Wednesday at a meeting with government leaders, diplomats and journalists in Madrid, said that while Iran's Suez trip was a "cheap provocation," it is not by itself a serious "threat." "The real threat stands as a clear warning sign to you and the entire world -- Iran is developing nuclear weapons of mass destruction," Peres said, according to a statement from his office citing his comments. " "Iran has always proved that, with guidance of the supreme leader and awareness and intelligence of young people, has reached self-confidence, and the presence of Iran's Navy flotilla in the Suez Canal is another proof," Fars News Agency reported.
