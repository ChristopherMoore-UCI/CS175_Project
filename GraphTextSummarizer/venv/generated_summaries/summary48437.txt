Since almost 80% of military families have moved across state lines at least once in the past five years, it's no wonder military spouses have some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Over the years, the caucus, which has over 40 members, has reached out to the entire House of Representatives to address such issues as education, health care, combating stress from multiple deployments, mental health, and military spouse employment. -- Military spouse Michelle Aikman has lived through five moves with her husband and their two young children. The moving boxes, the unfamiliar surroundings, the new schools, teachers and friends -- all are the norm for Aikman, her family, and thousands of military families across the nation. Its mission is to advocate for military families like Aikman's and draw attention to the challenges they face every day.
