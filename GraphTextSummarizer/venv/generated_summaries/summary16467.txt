Boston police have seized almost a ton of marijuana in the city's largest such haul in recent memory, according to Suffolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. He also is being held in connection with an immigration violation by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, according to a news release from District Attorney Conley. Edgar Gonzalez, 40, was arraigned Thursday in Dorchester District Court, accused of trafficking in marijuana. Because of an existing immigration detainment order by U.S. Customs and Immigrations Enforcement as well as his behavior in trying to flee, officers were able to conduct a "protective sweep" of his residence, authorities said. Gonzalez's attorney, Holly Clarke, did not return calls from CNN.
