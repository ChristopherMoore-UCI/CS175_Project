In the fall of 2012, with the presidential race in full swing, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, two prominent Republican governors with well-known national ambitions, were engaged in a different kind of campaign. "Continuity is a hallmark of RGA and Governor Christie -- one of our party's strongest national leaders -- will continue the strong stewardship of Governor Jindal and prior chairmen." One senior Republican told CNN that the bout of campaigning was nothing more than "friendly competition" between the two governors. But before that line of succession was arranged, the tightly knit universe of GOP governors who comprise the RGA had to wrestle with an uncomfortable dilemma: Jindal and Christie were both gunning for the committee's top job in the same year -- 2014. Ultimately, both Jindal and Christie would each have a shot at running the RGA, Jindal in 2013 and Christie in 2014. Christie was elected vice-chairman, putting him in line to take over the RGA in 2013.
