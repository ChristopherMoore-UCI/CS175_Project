The lack of lyrics in Spain's anthem has long created awkward moments for winning Spanish athletes at the Olympics. The now-discarded winning lyrics had begun with, "Viva Espana," or "long-live Spain," and critics complained that phrase harkened back to the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, who led a military uprising in 1936 against the elected government and won a Civil War, ruling Spain until his death in 1975. The Catalans in the northeast and the Basques in the north already have their own national songs with lyrics. The president of the Spanish Olympic Committee conceded he doesn't know when there will be lyrics for the anthem, and many here say there isn't enough time to get lyrics approved before the Aug. 8 start of the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. "We will continue with the idea of an anthem with lyrics," Blanco said.
