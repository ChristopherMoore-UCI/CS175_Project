Minnesota lottery officials have set a weekly purchase limit of $50 through gas pumps and ATM machines to encourage responsible gaming, Van Petten said. This week's winning tickets for the $587.5 million Powerball jackpot were purchased at convenience stores, but Ed Van Petten, director of the Minnesota State Lottery, said sales of lottery tickets at gas pumps have been brisk. Van Petten said developers approached several states before partnering with Minnesota Lottery officials. Van Petten said South Africa is the only other place he knew of that allows lottery purchases through ATMs. The next time Minnesota drivers looking to play the Powerball lottery pay at the pump, the pump might pay them back.
