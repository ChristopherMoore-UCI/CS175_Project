Workers at the bakery said they felt betrayed when Archway at first said there would be more work in a day or two, but then changed the locks. The bakery now produces Lance cookies that are sold to big chains like Target and Wal-Mart. But production of Archway cookies is scheduled to resume soon. Some 300 workers lost their jobs when the Archway cookie factory in Ashland, Ohio, was suddenly closed by the private equity firm that owned it. Cookie production has resumed and some workers are back on the job at the Archway factory in Ashland, Ohio.
