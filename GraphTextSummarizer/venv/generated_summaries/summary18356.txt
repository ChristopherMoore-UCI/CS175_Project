Coleman will be cremated and his ashes will be put away until a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray is resolved, said Robert Jeffs, an attorney appointed temporary special administrator. It is expected to take Utah District Judge James Taylor several months to hold a trial to decide which document is Coleman's last legal will. Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage at the Provo, Utah, hospital. -- Gary Coleman's funeral, if there is one, will wait for several months while a Utah judge decides who will permanently control of the former child actor's estate, a lawyer said Wednesday. Coleman's remains are at a Utah mortuary, awaiting direction about what happens to the body.
