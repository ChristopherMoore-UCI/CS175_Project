"The former management company launched three at that time, hoping it would be the future of Hong Kong trams," says Lee. "The wet market on Chun Yeung Street used to be less organized and vendors would have their stalls set up in the middle of the tramway," says Eric Lee Tsun-lung, founder of tram fan club Hong Kong Trams Enthusiast and the mini-tram cultural museum, Hong Kong Trams Station. "The tram is such an icon of Hong Kong because it's closely associated with the big events that have happened here over the last century," says Emmanuel Vivant, director and general manager of Hong Kong Tramways. Vivant says Hong Kong Tramways is looking at dedicating a special car for tourists. Passengers lean back as a Hong Kong tram -- affectionately called "Ding Ding" by locals -- signals its slow approach to the station.
