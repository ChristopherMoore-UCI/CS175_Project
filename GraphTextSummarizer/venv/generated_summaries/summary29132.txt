WHO is not ruling out the possibility of mass Ebola vaccinations in the first half of 2015, but three conditions would have to be met, Kieny said Friday. However, he said, exit screening for those leaving hotspot countries -- which can include taking travelers' temperature, asking them to fill out a questionnaire and checking out any fever for a risk of Ebola infection -- "probably does have a quite important deterrent effect." Kieny also said WHO hopes that "a few hundred thousand doses" of Ebola vaccine will be available by the end of the first half of 2015. Health Ministry spokeswoman Markatie Daou said the dozens of people who had contact with the girl have not shown any symptom related to the virus, as of Friday.
