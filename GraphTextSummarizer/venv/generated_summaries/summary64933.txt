In a statement Thursday, the band said Rudd's absence wouldn't affect the album's release or a tour scheduled for next year. But the Crown Solicitor decided there wasn't enough evidence to justify it, attorney Paul Mabey said in a statement. "Mr. Rudd has suffered unnecessary and extremely damaging publicity as a result of widespread and sensational reporting of a very serious allegation, which on any basis was never justified. "Mr. Rudd will defend the charge of threatening to kill. The charge is now withdrawn, within 24 hours of Mr. Rudd's first appearance in court," Mabey said.
