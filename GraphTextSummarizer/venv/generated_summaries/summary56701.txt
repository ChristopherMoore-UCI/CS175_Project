(The Hollywood Reporter)Now in its third season, "House of Cards" has one of those problems that soap operas bump up against all the time: story fatigue. Instead, "House of Cards" has been the poster series for both the popularity of Netflix as a streaming service with strong original content and as a big player for the service at awards shows. Unfortunately, after holding out against the cruel intrusion of reality, at some point in season two of "House of Cards," ridiculous was the key word for pretty much everything in it. I worry that the creative forces behind "House of Cards" will blindly accept the accolades and not address the more glaring issues critics (and fans) began harping on in season two. That manipulation often comes at the expense of believability â€” because "House of Cards" refuses to restrain itself and often goes, in a parlance that Francis would approve of, balls out in an effort to make the Underwoods ridiculously ruthless and the series ridiculously entertaining.
