The 2010 World Cup finalists suffered a shock 1-0 loss to Denmark, and then were dominated in the first half by Germany before losing 2-1 as star names such as Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wes Sneijder failed to combine their undoubted talents. The Dutch need to win by two goals to have any chance of reaching the quarterfinals, while 2004 runners-up Portugal could go through with a draw if Denmark cannot beat leaders Germany. Ronaldo scored 46 goals in 38 league games as Real wrested the Spanish title off Barcelona last season, but Denmark fans chanted the name of Lionel Messi -- his rival for the title of world's best player -- in Portugal's last-gasp 3-2 victory on Wednesday. Zenden, who helped the "Oranje" reach the semifinals of Euro 2000 and 2004, said coach Bert van Marwijk might make changes against Portugal. Portugal's defensive approach under coach Paulo Bento has mystified football pundits and fans alike, especially given the glimpses of the team's undoubted attacking skills in the final 20 minutes of the 1-0 defeat by Germany.
