Jurors weighing punishment for Jeffs heard audio recordings earlier in the day that prosecutors say show he had sex with underage girls and encouraged group sex. Other recordings captured Jeffs instructing what prosecutors say were underage girls in how to please him. Jeffs was convicted last week on two counts of sexual assault on a child. Several also cried during the niece's testimony, in which she described an incident that allegedly occurred between her and Jeffs when she was 8 years old. During the first day of the sentencing hearing Friday, Jeffs said he objected to the introduction of items seized in the raid and documents that should get "religious protection."
