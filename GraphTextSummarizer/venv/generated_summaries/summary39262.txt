Bolt ran the third leg, handing off to individual bronze medallist Asafa Powell, as Olympic champions Jamaica took gold in a new championship record of 37.31 seconds. The 31-year-old, the 2004 Olympic champion and 2003 and 2005 world champion, won gold with 8.54 meters to beat South Africa's Olympic silver medalist Godfrey Mokoena (8.47m) while Australia's Mitchell Watt took bronze (8.37m). Jamiaca's victory, their seventh gold medal of the games, ensured the nation won both sprint relays after their women claimed gold in the women's 4x100m relay earlier on Saturday. But he opted to raise the bar and nailed 5.90m at his first attempt which was enough to give him the gold medal with Frenchmen Romain Mesnil and Renaud Lavillenie claiming silver and bronze. Kirui produced a sustained burst to pull clear of team-mate Emmanuel Mutai and win gold in a championship record time of two hours six minutes and 54 seconds.
