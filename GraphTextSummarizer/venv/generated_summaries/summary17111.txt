Meanwhile, Troy Barnett, who owns the K Bar Z Guest Ranch near Cody, Wyoming, heard about the missing couple when his wife spotted it on Facebook Sunday night. The sheriff says Barnett's actions saved the Wathkes' from serious harm. Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero. Monday morning, Barnett got out the snowmobile he hadn't used since last fall, made sure it was in running order, loaded it into his pickup truck and set out to look for the Wathkes. In fact, the highway was shut down in mid-September due to heavy snow, with signs posted saying so, the Park County Sheriff's Department said.
