Watch why justice nixed interracial marriage Â» McKay said her friends and family have been extremely supportive and she believes this situation occurred for a reason. When McKay replied yes, she was told, "Well, we don't do interracial weddings or marriages." McKay said she was beyond shock. The number of interracial marriages have skyrocketed, nearly quadrupling between 1970 and 2005, the most recent year for which there is census data. "We are used to the closet racism, but we're not going to tolerate that overt racism from an elected official." Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is calling to have Bardwell's license revoked, and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu is calling for his dismissal -- a notion shared by McKay. The Supreme Court struck down laws against interracial marriage in the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia case.
