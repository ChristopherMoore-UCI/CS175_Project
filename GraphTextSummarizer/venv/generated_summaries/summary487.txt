The Sinaie area, in Falluja's southeastern section, is an industrial district with factories, scrap yards and large, abandoned yards. A police official in the Anbar province city of Falluja told CNN that a large number of security forces were scouring its Sinaie district for an array of weapons -- machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. Saturday's raids in Falluja by Iraqi forces were similar to U.S.-led sweeps in the city in 2004, shown here. Violence has dropped in Iraq, and President Obama's administration has been gearing up to withdraw U.S. troops. In November of that year, U.S. and Iraqi forces attacked insurgents in Falluja, killing about 1,200 militants.
