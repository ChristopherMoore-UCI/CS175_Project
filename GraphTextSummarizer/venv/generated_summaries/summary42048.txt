New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said Wednesday that she plans a new push to repeal the state law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. In New Mexico, supporters of the licenses for undocumented immigrants argue that it's safer to have more drivers trained and insured, and opponents argue that it's a system rife with fraud. New Mexico and Washington are the only two states that grant unrestricted driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. In 2011, she said the law had turned New Mexico into a magnet for people from other states seeking a license. Illinois lawmakers approved a measure earlier this month to allow undocumented immigrants to get temporary licenses.
