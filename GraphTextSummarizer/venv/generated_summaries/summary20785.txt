A spate of killings since the weekend, including 12 on Tuesday, pushed this year's death toll higher than the 1,607 recorded murders for last year, spokesman Sergio Belmonte told CNN. -- The number of drug-related killings in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, so far this year has reached 1,647, surpassing the death toll for all of 2008, a city spokesman told CNN. Police gather at the rehab facility where 17 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, in early September. Killings in Juarez, located across the border from El Paso, Texas, began to spike in early 2008, when the Sinaloa drug cartel began a turf war with the Juarez cartel. More than 5,100 have been killed in drug-cartel violence across Mexico this year, according to a tally by the newspaper El Universal.
