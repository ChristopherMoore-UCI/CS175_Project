Based on a book about the painting called "The Mill and the Cross," Majewski's film shows Bruegel (played by Rutger Hauer) discussing the development of his work with patron Nicolaes Jonghelinck (played by Michael York). Obtaining the "key" to this aesthetic was hard work, said Majewski, because "Bruegel is a magician in creating these illusory kinds of funnels in the painting." Looking at it, according to Polish director Lech Majewski, is rather like watching a movie unfold -- which is why he has brought the painting to life in his new feature film "The Mill and the Cross." Costumes were hand-sewn by Polish seamstresses and dyed with tints made from boiled onions, beetroots and apples, as they would have been in Bruegel's day; the "right" color black was achieved by burning a candle against a pane of glass, rather than relying on computers to recreate the exact hue; and Majewski himself had to take up Bruegel's brush and complete a partially-visible tree in the top-left corner of the painting to extend the field of vision for the camera to pan across. An exhibition of Lech Majewski's work, including his film installation "Bruegel Suite," based on "The Mill and the Cross" is currently on view at The Wapping Project in London.
