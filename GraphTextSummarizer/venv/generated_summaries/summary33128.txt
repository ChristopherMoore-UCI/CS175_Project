"The brothers are ages 15 and 17 years old, and both are in police custody," Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said Tuesday, adding that the younger brother had also been charged with one count of luring. Prosecutors believe Autumn was lured this past weekend to the home of the boys' family, where they murdered her -- possibly for her BMX bike, which police found among some of the girl's belongings when they searched the site early Tuesday. Dalton said she was strangled and died from blunt-force trauma, but based on preliminary findings, there were no signs of sexual assault. "I know she's up there..." a distraught Anthony Pasquale, Autumn's father, told CNN affiliate WPVI in Philadelphia. A public viewing will be held from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, followed by a funeral Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Glassboro.
