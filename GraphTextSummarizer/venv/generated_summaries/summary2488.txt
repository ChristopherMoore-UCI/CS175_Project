Dr. Kermit Gosnell faces eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven babies and that of Gurung's mother, Karnamaya Mongar, of Virginia, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. Mongar died November 19, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by the doctor, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said following the arrest of Gosnell and before a gag order was put in place preventing attorneys and now jurors from speaking to the media. Also on trial is Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at Gosnell's clinic. If found guilty, Gosnell could be sentenced to death. Ghalley told jurors he took Mongar to Gosnell's practice two days in a row.
