Boston police Officer Justin Barrett apologized for his e-mail about Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. "If I'm charged with a crime I want a chance to answer. Barrett later sent a mass e-mail about the encounter to other officers and to the Boston Globe newspaper. Barrett said he was moved to write the note because he believed a Boston Globe column about Gates' arrest "seemed like it was biased. According to a statement from Boston police, Davis took action immediately on learning of Barrett's remarks, stripping the officer of his gun and his badge. "The choice of words were poor; but they weren't meant to characterize professor Gates as a banana-eating jungle monkey," attorney Peter Marano said.
