"Switches" designed to give police wiretapping capabilities were hacked in Greece, leading to the unlawful wiretapping of 100 senior government officials for 10 months, and a system was breached in Italy, allowing unlawful wiretaps of 6,000 Italians, said Susan Landau of Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In testimony before a House Judiciary subcommittee, FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni said it is "exponentially more difficult" to execute court-authorized wiretaps on new technology, noting that criminals can now communicate using wireless devices and anonymous avatars. Rapid advances in communications are eroding police departments' abilities to conduct wiretaps, and Congress needs to take steps to ensure that new telephone, computer and wireless systems are designed to allow lawful police access, FBI and police officials told Congress Thursday. But other witnesses cautioned that any such move could stifle innovation, place U.S. technology companies at a competitive disadvantage and unintentionally create systems vulnerable to hackers, criminals and terrorists. At issue is the diminished capability of law enforcement agencies to conduct quick wiretaps in an age of Twitter accounts, Facebook and MySpace pages, BlackBerrys, Androids, iPhones and iPads.
