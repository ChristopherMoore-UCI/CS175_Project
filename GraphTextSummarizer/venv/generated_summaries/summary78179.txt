The crew might be more familiar with riggings than roulades but Lim and Tuck have a simple message for them when it comes to cooking: "We encourage you to follow this bit of sage advice from Julia Child: 'Learn how to cook -- try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!'" Plastiki also is supplied with a nutritional guide for the crew advising them on what to eat and how to build meals that support the periods of high-level activity during the voyage. From beef bourguignon to lamb ragout and Thai chicken curry, the meals were devised by San Francisco-based foodies Jennifer Tuck and Nona Lim. But it's not a diet of ship's biscuits, limes and rum rations for David de Rothschild and the crew; their galley is complete with meals that would not look out of place at a chic San Francisco restaurant. "Our mission is to bring joy and fun back to your kitchen, or in your case, the galley," said Lim and Tuck in their specially devised food guide for the Plastiki. Of course the all important rule is all on board is to hydrate well, something the crew discovered toward the end of the first leg of the journey, when water levels on board were so low not enough could be spared to keep the on-board hydroponic garden alive.
