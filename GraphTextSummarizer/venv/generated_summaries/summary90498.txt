"But he had no idea that they were up to something like that, like bombings and everything, you know what I mean?" He told CNN affiliate WESH that Todashev and Tsarnaev had spoken by telephone about a month before the bombings. -- Deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in a 2011 gruesome triple homicide outside Boston along with a Chechen killed early Wednesday during a confrontation with the FBI and Massachusetts State Police in Orlando, Florida, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The FBI had followed Todashev for days, his friend told CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13. However, the FBI is looking into the many connections between Todashev and Tsarnaev, whose radicalization allegedly led to the Boston bombings. A federal law enforcement official has told CNN they were initially led to Todashev because they learned he knew Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar.
