A Hong Kong court on Monday said it would wait for psychological reports on a British banker who has been charged with the gruesome killings of two Indonesian women at his apartment. Body found in suitcase Jutting is accused of killing Sumarti Ningsih, 25, whose decomposing body was discovered inside a suitcase on the balcony of his high-rise apartment in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong. The grisly deaths of the two women shocked many residents of Hong Kong, where the violent crime rate is low for a city of its size. Sumarti's father has called for his daughter's killer to be executed, but Hong Kong doesn't impose the death penalty. The Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong wasn't immediately available for comment on the repatriation of the women's remains.
