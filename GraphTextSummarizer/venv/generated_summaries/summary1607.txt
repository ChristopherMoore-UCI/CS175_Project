-- Secretary of State John Kerry met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for more than three hours in Jerusalem on Friday as he pushed a new framework for a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Netanyahu named two major concerns, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told reporters. One is the threat of a nuclear Iran, and the other is the marginalization of Israel by Palestinians going outside of the peace talks and directly to the United Nations to seek statehood. Graham, who was accompanied by Sens. John McCain of Arizona and John Barrasso of Wyoming, said they shared the prime minister's concerns. Kerry's proposal is based on five months of intensive consultations with Israelis and Palestinians since the resumption of the peace process last summer.
