The congressional trip also included Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island; Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut; and Chris Coons, D-Delaware. Last autumn, Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, chairwoman of the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, placed a hold on $450 million in U.S. economic support for Egypt after that nation cracked down on democracy support groups. Egypt's president says comments he made more than two years ago that are being criticized as anti-Semitic were taken out of context, Egypt's official news agency reported Wednesday. The comments, which Morsy made as a then-leader of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, immediately raised questions about whether he can be trusted to respect Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Even as she condemned Morsy's remarks, the State Department spokeswoman noted that since he has been president, Morsy "has reaffirmed again, and again" Egypt's commitment to peace with Israel.
