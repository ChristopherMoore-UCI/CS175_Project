When school officials suspended his alleged assailant, the teenager "made numerous attempts to contact Mr. Baldwin for the purpose of instructing him to go to the school administration and tell them that the incident (assault) was ... a joke," prosecutors said. Notably, New Jersey's aggressive anti-bullying law was signed by Gov. Chis Christie on March 26, just two days before Morristown High School freshman Lennon Baldwin took his own life at his home. " Morris County prosecutors charged two juveniles and an adult, 19-year-old Michael Conway, with assault, robbery, theft and making terroristic threats against Baldwin. Prosecutors cited the new law Wednesday in announcing charges stemming from an assault on Baldwin on March 6 and the robbery of Baldwin three days later. Prosecutors said Baldwin was accosted three days later in a parking lot by the first student and two more individuals who robbed and threatened him.
