The Navy confirmed Wednesday that it did an abrupt about-face on guidance allowing same-sex marriages on military bases after receiving a flood of criticism from Capitol Hill, as well as discussions with Defense Department lawyers. "The Navy was right in their analysis last month that nothing stands in the way of operating facilities without discrimination, and further review will no doubt validate that position," said Michael Cole-Schwartz, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, which supports same-sex marriage. The guidance -- outlined in a memorandum last month from the Navy chief of chaplains, Rear Adm. M.L. Tidd -- would have eased the way for same-sex marriage ceremonies once the Pentagon scraps its present "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. Tidd said Tuesday that his memo, originally issued on April 13, was suspended "until further notice pending additional legal and policy review and inter-Departmental coordination." "At a time when the economy still needs attention, Osama bin Laden was just killed, and revolution and conflict continue to rage across a fragile Middle East, having policy makers spend valuable and limited time on whether a few gay couples may or may not use a Navy facility for a private ceremony at some point in the future is just plain silly," Nicholson said in a statement sent to CNN.
