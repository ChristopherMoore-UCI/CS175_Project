While the spokesman, Mende Omalanga, said five of the dead were United Nations peacekeepers, an official with the U.N. mission in the capital of Kinshasa contradicted the report. "No U.N. members were killed" in the explosion, said Madnodje Mounoubai. The tanker flipped over Friday afternoon, said Omalanga, the country's minister of communications. It was attempting to overtake a bus in Sange, in South Kivu province, on the country's eastern border. When oil began to spill from the overturned tanker, local residents attempted to collect the oil.
