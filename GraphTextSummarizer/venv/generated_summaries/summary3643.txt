Recently I was given the opportunity to mentor a few start-ups, and as interesting and as innovative as their ideas are, I am yet to meet a start-up in Africa that wants to build hardware that they hope will change the world. Companies that are daring to build hardware are outsourcing to China, sure it's cheaper to make things there but surely this hurts the continent's economic growth in the end, but I digress. Perhaps this is the solution: partnering with mobile operators to launch affordable smart devices make in Africa aimed at the African market. Enter the Inye tablet, built by Nigerian hardware pioneer Saheed Adepoju, the man that founded Encipher Limited, which launched Nigeria's first Android-based tablet device. The device, though designed in the Congo, was assembled in China like all major manufactures seem to do.
