Her husband called an ambulance to their Bel Air home to take the actress to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Friday afternoon, spokesman John Blanchette said. Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to a Los Angeles, California, hospital Friday because of "complications" relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, her publicist said. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge," "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953, "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil." Gabor has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
