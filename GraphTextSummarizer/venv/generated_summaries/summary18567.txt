The typhoon is forecast to move at 22 kilometers per hour into western Guangdong province and cross over to Guangxi province. An observatory bulletin issued at 10:45 a.m. local time placed the center of Typhoon Vicente 260 kilometers west of Hong Kong, with winds blowing at average speeds of 63 kilometers per hour or more from the southeast. -- Hong Kong is cleaning up Tuesday after a severe typhoon struck the city with gale-force winds and rain, shuttering much of the city and injuring at least 129 people. The tropical cyclone warning signal has since been downgraded to No. 3, which allowed the resumption of full public transportation services, but high rainstorm and landslide warnings remain in effect. Tropical cyclone warning signals are intended to warn the public of the threat of winds associated with a tropical cyclone.
