Guar gum powder, made by crushing seeds of the guar crop, is used in a number of products in the food and cosmetics industries, including ice cream, breads, pastries, lipsticks and even diapers. Guar gum powder has unique binding, thickening and emulsifying qualities which make it ideal for fracking, explains B.D. Agarwal, the founder and managing director of Vikas WSP, an Indian company that specializes in producing the product. Since 90% of the world's guar is grown in the desert belt of northwest India, local farmers in this poor area are enjoying the benefit of the guar rush. The 35-year-old farmer from Sri Ganganagar, a district in Rajasthan, northwest India, says life has never been better. In May this year, Vikas gave 15 kilograms of guar seeds to 200,000 farmers and guaranteed them returns.
