After a succession of speeches from South Carolina Republican notables like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Gov. Nikki Haley, Rubio took the stage in Anderson to applause, but was quickly interrupted by a group of protestors -- self-identified DREAMers, young immigrants brought to the country illegally as minors -- who loudly heckled the senator for abandoning last year's sweeping immigration package when it was met with harsh resistance on the right. In his first trip to South Carolina since addressing a GOP fundraiser in Columbia two summers ago, Rubio spent the day in a series of closed-door sessions with influential local activists and potential financial backers, specifically courting the Christian conservatives who dominate grassroots Republican politics in the South Carolina upstate. A plugged-in Republican operative turned to a reporter and observed dryly, "I couldn't think of a better way to make Rubio look good in South Carolina." " Rubio, too, held a Greenville fundraiser for his political operation, Reclaim America PAC, which has so far spent half a million dollars on behalf of Republican candidates in 2014. -- Marco Rubio came to South Carolina this week hoping to win over the kind of conservative hardliners who turned on him last year as the Senate immigration reform bill he sponsored hit a roadblock in the Republican-controlled House.
