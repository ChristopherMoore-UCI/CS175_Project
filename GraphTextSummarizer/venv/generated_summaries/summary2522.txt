Suarez makes international return Luis Suarez returned to international football for the first time since biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil earlier this year and set up Uruguay's only goal in a 1-1 friendly draw against Saudi Arabia Friday. While not a competitive fixture, the result marks Brazil's third consecutive win since its disastrous exit at the hands of Germany at the 2014 World Cup. Goals either side of half-time from Diego Tardelli were enough to ensure Brazil trumped its great South American rival for the first time since 2012. Substitute Naif Hazazi equalized for Saudi Arabia in the closing minutes to deny Uruguay victory. Suarez's 47th minute strike rebounded off the post before being turned in to his own goal by Saudi defender Hassan Muath Fallatah.
