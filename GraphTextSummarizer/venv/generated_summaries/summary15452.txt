At some point later, a guard at St. Bernard found a person matching Bullock's description on the premises and told him to leave, police said. That community -- including members of St. Bernard Parish, students and staff at Humboldt State University where Freed taught, and residents throughout greater Eureka -- was still hurting Friday, as it tried to make sense of the violent death of the popular priest. Humboldt County's chief probation officer, William Damiano, said Bullock's case never fell under his department, and as such Bullock didn't have to do things like check in regularly with a probation officer. John Chiv said he and other St. Bernard parishioners are shocked and angered by Freed's death, especially given how it happened. Bullock apparently drove 45 minutes from the parish to a family member's house in that car, police said.
