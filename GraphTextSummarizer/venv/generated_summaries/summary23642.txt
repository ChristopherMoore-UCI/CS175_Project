-- A fast-food worker whose run-in with two unruly customers was captured on cell phone video last month will not be indicted on assault charges, prosecutors said Saturday. Authorities identified the women as Denise Darbeau and Rachael Edwards, who authorities say each face pending charges of menacing, criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct. A grand jury voted against indicting Rayon McIntosh, who was seen allegedly swinging a metal object against two patrons at a McDonald's restaurant in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. He had been charged with felony assault, according to Joan Vollero, spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office. "Inappropriate behavior in the United States of America is not supposed to be met with deadly force.
