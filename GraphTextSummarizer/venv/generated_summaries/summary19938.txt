Providing an awesome experience for true movie fans is the reason we opened the first Alamo Drafthouse back in the mid-'90s, and it is the exact same philosophy we adhere to today. If the movie is a non-crossover kids movie, we sometimes flex this age down to 3 and up, and we also have select "Baby Day" screenings each week for infants and small children. We had no desire to make movies, but we sure as heck loved to go to the cinema and watch them in the right environment. In the first couple of months of operation, we came up with some very simple guidelines that all of our theaters still adhere to today. The insistence on these simple policies is one of the main reasons people are loyal to our cinemas today.
