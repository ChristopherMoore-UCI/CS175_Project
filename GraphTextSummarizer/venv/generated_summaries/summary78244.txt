-- Three-time Formula One world champion Niki Lauda has tipped Fernando Alonso to clinch a 16th drivers' title for Ferrari his season. " Lauda also singled out former Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen for praise. Rumors have suggested Ferrari may look to replace Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa for the 2013 season, with Sauber's Sergio Perez mooted as a potential successor to the Brazilian. Alonso: "Ferrari must improve" "He is making all the right moves," Lauda, who won the drivers' title twice with Ferrari, told the sport's official website. Raikkonen was the last Ferrari driver to win the championship when he fended off competition from Alonso -- then racing for McLaren -- and Briton Lewis Hamilton, who is still driving for the British team, to clinch the 2007 crown.
