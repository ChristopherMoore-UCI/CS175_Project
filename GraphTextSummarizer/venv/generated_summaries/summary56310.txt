"Legislation or regulation does not address the practice or prohibit funeral professionals from filling a cavity with newspaper," the Georgia Board of Funeral Service said in a letter addressed to Johnson's mother. That complaint alleged that Harrington Funeral Home mishandled the body and specifically accuses director Antonio Harrington of helping obscure the teen's cause of death. Replacing the internal organs of Kendrick Johnson -- the south Georgia teen found dead in his high school gym a year ago -- with newspaper is not a "best practice" for any mortician, but it's not illegal either, a state board wrote Thursday. CNN examined the 522-page police file and found that investigators spoke to 111 people, including 18 on the day Johnson's body was found. However, the funeral home's attorney, Roy Copeland, told CNN in October that coroner Bill Watson has already called the "accusations and innuendo regarding Mr. Harrington's involvement in the disposition of young Mr. Johnson's internal organs ... baseless."
