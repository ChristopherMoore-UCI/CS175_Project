The world No. 1 won eight titles in a row at Monte Carlo between 2005 and 2012 before his triumphant run was halted by Novak Djokovic in last year's final. Rafael Nadal suffered only his third defeat in 11 years at the Monte Carlo Masters Friday losing in straight sets to fellow Spaniard David Ferrer. The 32-year-old Ferrer produced a typically energetic performance to take the quarterfinal match 7-6 (7/1) 6-4 marking the first time he has beaten Nadal on clay in over a decade. He did much better than me, so I just congratulate him." World No. 6, Ferrer, will now face Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka in the semifinal Saturday. Elsewhere Roger Federer defeated home favorite Jo Wilfred Tsonga 2-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 to set up an enticing semifinal match against Novak Djokovic.
