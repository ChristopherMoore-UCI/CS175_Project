"Since debuting in 2008, Katniss Everdeen and the Hunger Games have taken the world by storm, much as Harry Potter did a decade before," said Sara Nelson, the editorial director of books and Kindle at Amazon, which is the largest bookseller in the United States. Author J.K. Rowling penned the Harry Potter series about a boy wizard by the same name and his friends at Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards. The Hunger Games trilogy has surpassed the Harry Potter books to become the best-selling series on Amazon.com, the company announced Friday. Katniss is the Hunger Games heroine, whose prowess with arrows and boys has made her the envy of millions of fans. She is the star of the books in Suzanne Collins' trilogy, "The Hunger Games," "Catching Fire" and "Mockingjay."
