U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has unveiled an iPhone app called Operation Predator that asks the public for help in gathering information on suspected child sexual predators, including those who are fugitives. The app includes photos of fugitives and asks for help in trying to find suspected child predators for criminal prosecution. Under the alerts section there are images and names of people who are wanted for crimes such as possession of child pornography. A news section has updates on recent cases involving sexual predators, including the ICE's various projects and sentencing for captured criminals. A "John Doe" is wanted for producing child pornography that involved the sexual abuse of a girl between 10 and 12 years old.
