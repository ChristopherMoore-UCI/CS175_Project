"Since the controversy involving Yoo, the issue of military service has been taken extremely seriously and people have stricter standards toward TV stars," Korean pop columnist Moon Han-pyeong told South Korean newspaper Joongang Daily. The fallout With the closure of their unit, the 16 celebrity soldiers will be sent to regular military units -- with eight of them facing punishment for violating military rules. In a similar vein, athletes are exempted from army service if they medal at the Olympic Games or win gold medals in the Asian Games. The backlash was immediate and furious, with the public demanding disciplinary action and musing about the integrity of military service. The history First formed 16 years ago, the celebrity unit acted as the military's public relations office, and was comprised of singers, actors and comedians who used their various "skills" in public capacities such as concerts for soldiers or military broadcasts.
