Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating at the crash site, and National Transportation Safety Board members were on the way to the scene, said Harrison, New York, Police Chief Anthony Marraccini. -- Richard Rockefeller, son of philanthropist David Rockefeller and great-grandson of Standard Oil founder and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, was killed Friday in the crash of a single-engine plane in Westchester County, New York, a family representative and airport officials said. Rockefeller, 65, was the only one aboard the Piper PA-46-500TP Meridian aircraft when it crashed at 8:08 a.m. Friday less than a mile from takeoff at an airport near White Plains, airport manager Peter Scherrer said after the crash. "This is a terrible tragedy," the Rockefeller family said in a statement released by spokesman Fraser P. Seitel. Rockefeller was headed to Portland, Maine, after flying into New York on Thursday for his father's 99th birthday, he said.
