Azarenka will play former No. 1 Serena Williams in Sunday's final after the American beat Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka 7-6 (5), 6-0. " Their last meeting ended in a 6-1, 7-6 (5) win for Williams in the U.S. Open third round last year. The 30-year-old Williams hasn't lost a clay-court match this season after winning the title in Charleston last month. Williams didn't face a break point in her semifinal against the big-hitting Hradecka and came through a tight opening set before sweeping through the second in 24 minutes. Azarenka had already ended Radwanska's title hopes this year in Sydney, Melbourne, Doha, Indian Wells and Stuttgart.
