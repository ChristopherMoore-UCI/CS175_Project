President Barack Obama visited Monday with the family of TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was killed at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this month. Hernandez is the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty. A gunman stormed a terminal at the airport on November 1, killing Hernandez and injuring several others. The President also met with Tony Grigsby and James Speer -- two other TSA officers who were wounded in the November 1 shooting incident. Officers shot suspect Paul Ciancia multiple times during the assault.
