Rangers went into administration on February 14 this year following court action from UK tax officials. SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster and his Scottish Football Association counterpart Stewart Regan both lobbied for Rangers to be placed in the SFL Division One so they could secure a quick return to the top flight, but their pleas were ignored. -- Glasgow Rangers, the one-time giants of Scottish football, have been humbled in their debut at the basement of the country's football league. After the game, Rangers manager Ally McCoist told BBC Radio Scotland: "I felt we defended appallingly to be honest. The club only managed a 2-2 draw in their first game away at Peterhead, a team without any full-time players which has spent much of its time in the bottom division which Rangers have now joined following their collapse with debts of over $200 million earlier this year.
