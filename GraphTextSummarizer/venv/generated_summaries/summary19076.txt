The former student's name was not released by the school, but an Oregon State Police log says that 19-year-old Kendra Jane Sunderland of Corvallis was cited for public indecency in connection with a video posted to a pornographic site along with the claim that it was shot in an Oregon State library. Valley Library occupies more than 340,000 square feet and is routinely patrolled by members of the Department of Public Safety and Oregon State Police troopers as well as by two security guards, who patrol the library during overnight hours.â€‹ The woman was cited for public indecency and released, according to Steve Clark, Oregon State vice president of university relations. A 19-year-old woman was cited Tuesday evening for allegedly using the university library at the campus in Corvallis, Oregon, as a backdrop to shoot an adult video last year. And it definitely does not represent the values of the more than 30,000 students and 5,000 employees that make up Oregon State University," said Clark.
