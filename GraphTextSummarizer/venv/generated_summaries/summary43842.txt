Virginia State Police on Friday identified Ross Truett Ashley, 22, as the man who killed Virginia Tech Police Officer Deriek Crouse and then himself about 30 minutes later. -- A 22-year-old Virginia man stole a Mercedes SUV at gunpoint the day before he shot dead a Virginia Tech police officer and then took his own life, police said Friday. Citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the university said "no additional information on Mr. Ashley can be provided." Radford President Penny Kyle said counseling would be made available to that university's students, akin to services offered at Virginia Tech. "Once again, the campus and the community that we love so well have been visited by senseless violence and tragic loss," Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger said in a statement. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose daughter attends Virginia Tech, lauded the communications effort.
