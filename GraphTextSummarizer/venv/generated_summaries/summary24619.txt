The new album is full of catchy Christian pop tunes such as "My Deliverer," "Dance Dance Dance" and "Freedom Song," and power ballads such as "Not Guilty." It follows a successful debut CD, "True Beauty," of which Entertainment Weekly said, "Plus-size powerhouse Mandisa ... realizes her considerable pipes and self-righteousness are best suited to Christian pop." I want to please him and to show him that I am doing well." Mandisa, whose full name is Mandisa Hundley, said that her faith in God has guided her new lifestyle. Mandisa said that when she went to put together a CD of songs to help comfort her friend, she couldn't find anything from the child's point of view. -- Simon Cowell may not recognize "American Idol" alumna Mandisa the next time he sees her.
