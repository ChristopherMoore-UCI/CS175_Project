More than 200 inmates, some of whom were jailed on terrorism charges, broke free from the maximum-security facility Thursday when the "water supply was cut off because of a power outage," said Ronny Sompie, the National Police Spokesman Brigadier General. Last month, Indonesian police foiled a plot to bomb the Myanmar Embassy in Jakarta, according to local media reports. We're still waiting for the data from prison officials," Sompie said. -- Indonesian police are searching for potentially hundreds of escaped inmates following a deadly prison riot in Medan, the capital of the province of North Sumatra. The planned attack was reportedly in retribution for violence against Muslim Rohingya by majority Buddhists in Myanmar.
