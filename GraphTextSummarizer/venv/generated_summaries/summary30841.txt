"They primarily deal with who financed 9/11, and they point a strong finger at Saudi Arabia," former Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida told CNN's Michael Smercornish over the weekend. Graham, along with Rep. Walter Jones (R-North Carolina) and Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts) will hold a news conference Wednesday asking Obama to declassify those remaining pages of the 832-page 9/11 report. It's been more than a decade since the 9/11 report was released, and the leader behind the effort is pushing President Barack Obama to hand over the final 28 pages to the American public. Those redacted pages from the congressional investigation into the attacks specifically focus on the role of foreign governments in the al Qaeda plot. The government feared releasing them "could adversely affect ongoing counterterrorism efforts," according to a letter from the  Senate Intelligence Committee.
