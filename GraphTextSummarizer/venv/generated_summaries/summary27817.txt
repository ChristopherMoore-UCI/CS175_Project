Israeli police officer killed, 13 hurt in driver's rampage Also in eastern Jerusalem on Wednesday, a Palestinian man drove a van into pedestrians at a rail station, killing an Israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people, police said. At the compound -- the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest in Islam -- groups of Palestinian youths threw stones and set off fireworks at Israeli police officers when the site was opened to visitors, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. Police shot and killed the attacker, identified by Israeli authorities as a member of the Islamist Hamas movement and a resident of the Shuafat Palestinian refugee camp in eastern Jerusalem, Samri said. The October 29 shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in Jerusalem and prompted Israeli authorities to close the holy site for one day -- a move that a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called a "declaration of war.
