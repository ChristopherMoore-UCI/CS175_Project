" Federer's 7-6 (7-0) 6-2 6-3 victory over Andrey Golubev -- previously unbeaten in the competition this season -- gave him the record for most Davis Cup wins by a Swiss player, putting him past the 34 recorded by Jakob Hlasek. Fabio Fognini handed two-time grand slam champion Andy Murray his first singles defeat in 19 Davis Cup matches, a run stretching back to 2005, winning 6-3 6-3 6-4 to delight the home crowd in Naples. Hlasek was part of the only Swiss team to reach the final, losing to a star-studded U.S. team in 1992. The Swiss will next play Italy, who also came from 2-1 down to end Britain's hopes of a first semifinal appearance since the World Group concept was introduced in 1981. "I'm just so proud of my players, because coming from 2-0 down on the first day was not easy," said France captain Arnaud Clement, who played in the team's 2010 final defeat against Serbia.
