Dart said the scope of the investigation has broadened to include "Babyland," a section of the cemetery intended for children. -- A Cook County cemetery where hundreds of graves were dug up and allegedly resold has been declared a crime scene, meaning that relatives of people believed buried there will not be allowed to visit for several days, an official said Friday. "It would be the height of irresponsibility for me to invite people in, to raise expectations and then crash them," Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart told reporters in a news conference held at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. He had said earlier this week that the number of disturbed graves was around 300, but said Friday that number was sure to rise. Dart said he himself walked through the cemetery on Friday and what he saw was disturbing.
