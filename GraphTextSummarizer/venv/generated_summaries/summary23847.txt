Glen Campbell cancels tour dates "Mrs. Jackson is extremely lucid and does a great job caring for Michael's children," Sanders said Wednesday. The letter mostly repeats allegations made by family members, but it also threatens new legal action against Branca, an entertainment lawyer, and McClain, a music executive, who worked with Jackson at several points in his career. " "Anyone who actually knows me knows my only loyalty in this matter is to Mrs. Jackson, and the public record of my success for her speaks for itself," Sanders said. Jackie, Marlon and La Toya Jackson did not sign it, nor did parents Joe and Katherine Jackson. The siblings also attacked Sanders, Katherine Jackson's manager, Lowell Henry, and adviser Trent Jackson for discouraging her from joining their challenge of the will's validity.
