"Gone Girl" star Affleck took umbrage at the pair's contention that Islam is, in Harris' words, a "mother lode of bad ideas" and that liberals are squeamish about criticizing Islam for stances on women and LGBT issues because people "have been sold this meme of Islamophobia, where every criticism gets confused with bigotry toward Muslims as people." " After some crosstalk, Harris chimed in with his view that "we're misled to think that the fundamentalists (in Islam) are the fringe," as Maher added that moderate Muslims are afraid to speak out. Ben Affleck's appearance on Bill Maher's "Real Time" on Friday turned into a somewhat heated discussion when Maher and author Sam Harris voiced their opinions on Islam. Affleck said Harris -- a neuroscientist known for works criticizing religion -- and Maher were guilty of using a broad brush themselves. Affleck responded that a better idea would be to criticize the Muslims who hold such views, not the whole religion.
