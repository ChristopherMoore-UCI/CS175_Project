The Lisbon Treaty, in addition to streamlining EU decision-making and creating an EU council president and foreign minister, would introduce rotating representatives for member countries in the EU Commission, the union's executive branch, and would change the voting weights of countries on certain issues. Poland recently won an opt-out over social issues including gay marriage; Britain won assurances that EU law would not prevail over its own legal system. The treaty would also give national parliaments veto power over some proposed changes to EU policy. The Czech Republic isn't the only EU country to demand an exemption before ratifying the treaty. Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said he welcomed the Czech court's decision.
