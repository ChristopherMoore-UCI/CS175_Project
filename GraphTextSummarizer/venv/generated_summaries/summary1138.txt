Japanese media reported that Sugimoto had been planning to leave Japan for Turkey later this month and then head across the border into Syria. "Ministry officials and police officers told me that unless I returned my passport, I would be arrested," he told Japanese television. The Foreign Ministry said that before Saturday's visit, officials had repeatedly asked Sugimoto to refrain from traveling to Syria, warning of the risk of capture by ISIS militants. "But at the same time, the government has the extremely important duty to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens who travel or live abroad. "We understand that the freedom of reporting, news gathering and travel should be respected as much as possible," Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Monday.
