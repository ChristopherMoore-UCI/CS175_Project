I've run endless miles, biked endless hills, swum endless laps. We all joined this program for different reasons, but the one thing that united us is that we wanted to take steps toward better health through a more active lifestyle, for ourselves and for the people we love. I have more goals to set and more success to achieve. Over the years, everyone in the Fit Nation family has achieved great success, but in many cases, the pounds don't always dramatically disappear. Setting goals is really pretty simple, when you think about it.
