" Human rights groups have consistently criticized Guantanamo's very existence, the mistreatment of detainees and their lack of access to legal recourse. Attorneys specializing in human rights issues have devoted thousands of hours to petitions in federal court to win the release of detainees. The prevailing climate is a far cry from the executive order Obama signed two days after taking office that pledged to close Guantanamo by January 2010, as he declared that the "existence of Guantanamo Bay likely created more terrorists around the world than it detained. Under international law, the United States cannot hand over any detainees likely to suffer torture, and the United Nations reported last year that detainees in Afghan custody are routinely subject to such treatment. Unable to fulfill his election pledge to close Guantanamo, Obama explored the option of trying more accused terrorists in federal court, only to run into a political firestorm.
