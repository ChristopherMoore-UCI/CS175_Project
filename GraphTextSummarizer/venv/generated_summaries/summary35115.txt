The suit owned by  Prime Minister Narendra Modi got tongues wagging when he wore it to a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama last month. Modi held similar auctions when he was the chief minister of Gujarat and raised funds for the education of young girls in the state. Other items include gifts and mementos that Modi received from foreign dignitaries and national leaders. According to organizers, the auction which is being held in Modi's home state of Gujarat has been extremely successful. The proceeds of this year's auction are supposed to go toward Modi's ambitious pet project of cleaning India's holy river, the Ganges.
