PlayStation internet services went offline on Wednesday and have remained down. Sony also offers subscription programs called PlayStation Plus, which provides access to exclusive games, and Qriocity, which offers on-demand music and movies over the internet. A Sony spokesman in Tokyo, where the company is headquartered, said investigations haven't uncovered whether the intruders gained access to personal information or credit card numbers, according to a report from technology news service IDG. The PlayStation Network is a free utility that lets gamers communicate and play with each other, as well as download games and movies. In several public statements, with one as recent as Monday, Sony has said the persistent downtime was due to an "external intrusion," but has not provided a target date for when services will return.
