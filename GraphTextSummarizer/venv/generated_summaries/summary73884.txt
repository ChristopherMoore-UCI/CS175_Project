Connie Culp knew of the Cleveland Clinic's interest in face transplants and approached the medical staff, doctors said at a news conference Tuesday. After monitoring Culp's progress, doctors say they will remove the excess tissue and tighten her jawline in future surgeries. Dr. Maria Siemionow, the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital's director of plastic surgery research and head of microsurgery training, had more than 20 years of experience in complex transplants. Transplant patients must take immune-suppressing drugs throughout their lifetime to prevent tissue rejection. At this point, all the transplanted parts of Culp's face are functioning except for her facial nerves, which are growing about an inch a month.
