Kauto Star has turned to equestrian sport and dressage since his retirement from racing, memories of his dominance still fresh in the memory. Silviniaco Conti completed the double at the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park in the style of which former stablemate and steeplechase legend Kauto Star would be proud. It came on the day a statue in honor of five-time winner Kauto Star was unveiled at the London track, both horses trained by Paul Nicholls, who has now saddled the winner nine times in the King George. Fancied Irish runner Champagne Fever faded to finish fourth under jockey Ruby Walsh after running too strongly in the opening stages. But Silviniaco Conti was just as sure footed over the big fences to win ahead of 7-1 chance Dynaste, while another Nicholls runner Al Ferof, was third for the second successive year.
