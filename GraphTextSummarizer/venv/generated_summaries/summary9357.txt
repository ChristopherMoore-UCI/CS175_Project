There's also the LG G Watch R and Moto 360, two newish devices that are aiming to have a more fashionable design and take advantage of Google's Android Wear platform. Apple was granted a patent for a smartwatch in July -- with a touch screen, an accelerometer, a GPS receiver, Bluetooth and alerts via vibration. Pebble connects to an iPhone or Android phone via Bluetooth and has a growing selection of its own apps. So far, smartwatches haven't caught on widely in the way smartphones and tablets have. A year after releasing its first smartwatch, Samsung unveiled its third device in the line last week.
