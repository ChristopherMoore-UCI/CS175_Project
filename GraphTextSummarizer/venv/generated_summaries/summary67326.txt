President Barack Obama's upcoming budget plan, which according to senior administration officials will include proposed changes to Social Security and Medicare plus some new tax increases in an effort for the president to reach a deal with Republicans on deficit reduction, quickly drew criticism from liberal groups on Friday.

Obama seeks $100m to unlock mysteries of the brain Proponents say chained CPI is a more accurate way to measure inflation than the way it's done now, which they say overstates growth in consumer prices. For Social Security, Obama plans to propose a switch to a key Republican request called "chained CPI," which is an inflation formula. " "Millions of MoveOn members did not work night and day to put President Obama into office so that he could propose policies that would hurt some of our most vulnerable people," read a statement from Anna Galland, executive director of the group.
