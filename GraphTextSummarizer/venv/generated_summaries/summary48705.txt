Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. "Coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams," says 14-year-old starter Creighton Avery, who has known Turk since he was 9. He talked about what it took to be in the NBA: that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at, and personality and character weeded many good players out.
