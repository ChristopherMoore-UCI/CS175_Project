-- The captain of an Italian cruise ship foiled an attack by pirates off the coast of Somalia on Saturday by ordering his security crew to fire back, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. The cruise ship Melody, which is owned by an Italian company, was on its way back to Italy after a cruise, ANSA said. The area hardest hit off the coasts of Somalia and Kenya, including the Gulf of Aden, is more than 1.1 million square miles -- four times the size of the state of Texas. Piracy is rampant off the coast of Somalia despite the presence of foreign navies. Six armed pirates in a speedboat attacked the ship, which had about 1,500 people onboard, ANSA said.
