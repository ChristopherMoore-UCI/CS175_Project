Harrods was founded by London grocer Charles Henry Harrod, who originally set up shop in east London. -- Mohamed al Fayed, whose son died in the car crash that killed Princess Diana, has sold the iconic British department store Harrods, the advisers to the sale announced Saturday. "Qatar Holding was specifically chosen by the (al Fayed family) as they had both the vision and financial capacity to support the long-term successful growth of Harrods." Qatar Holding is a fully owned affiliate of Qatar Petroleum, a state-owned company based in Doha. It was in the mid-1980s that al Fayed bought Harrods, a high-end department store in London's exclusive Knightsbridge neighborhood. Under al Fayed, Harrods went through a major refurbishment that included constructing the Egyptian Escalator, a $30 million "homage to ancient Egypt."
