Donations from the public helped pay for the family's travel to Canada, and Concordia University has set up an award in Lin's name to assist Chinese students. Authorities were tipped to the case after finding Lin's torso in May behind a Montreal apartment where Magnotta lived. -- A human head found in a Montreal park this week belongs to Jun Lin, the Chinese university student killed and dismembered in May, police said Wednesday. Lin, 33, was a student at Montreal's Concordia University. Police say Magnotta mailed other parts of Lin's body to Canadian politicians in Ottawa and to two schools in Vancouver.
