The Indian nuclear market is a rich prize, and the agreement could open the way for U.S. companies to earn billions of dollars building nuclear power plants in India. President Bush, who supports the deal, meets with India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week. "I believe that this new era will bring increased stability and progress in South Asia." India and Pakistan have fought several wars since they became independent in 1947, and both countries have tested nuclear weapons.

The Senate approved a controversial nuclear deal with India on Wednesday, clearing the way for the United States to export nuclear know-how to India after a ban lasting decades.
