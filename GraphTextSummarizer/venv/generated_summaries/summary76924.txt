She also confirmed the plane lacked either a Ground Proximity Warning System or an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. -- Federal investigators, joined by local officials and others, spread across Alaska on Thursday seeking the cause of a plane crash that killed five people, including former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens. There was no new information on what caused the plane to crash Monday on a rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska, killing Stevens and four others. O'Keefe remained in critical condition on Thursday, according to Kirsten Schultz, a spokeswoman for Providence Alaska Medical Center. The longest-serving Republican senator in U.S. history, Stevens lost his 2008 re-election bid to then-Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich after being convicted on charges of making false statements on financial disclosure forms.
