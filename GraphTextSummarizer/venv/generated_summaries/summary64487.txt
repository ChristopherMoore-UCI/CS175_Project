Such a board should follow simplified procedures, as parole boards do in prisons, rather than those of civilian courts or military commissions. It also holds for terrorists who are willing to commit suicide attacks: They cannot be tried, and they pay no mind to what might be done to them after their assault. They cannot have it both ways: flout the rules of war and seek the benefits of these rules as prisoners of war. This is particularly evident when we concern ourselves with terrorists who may acquire weapons of mass destruction. Some terrorists are to be tried in civilian courts -- as long as they are not in New York, or maybe only if the civilian courts are located on a military base.
