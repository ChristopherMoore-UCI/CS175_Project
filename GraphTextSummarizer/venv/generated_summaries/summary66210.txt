"In our discussions with Mike, we both came to the conclusion that he should remain off the air while focusing on his affairs," NBC spokesman Chris McCloskey said in a statement. In 1979, Milbury participated in a hockey brawl when he joined his Bruins teammates in going into the stands to fight with fans in New York's Madison Square Garden. Milbury, 59, will be charged with one count each of assault and battery on a child, threatening to commit a crime and disorderly conduct, the Brookline, Massachusetts, police said Friday. Daniel Rabinovitz, Milbury's Boston-based attorney, said Friday that his client "denies any allegations that there was an assault of any kind." "He simply intervened in an altercation between his son and an opposing player," Rabinovitz said by e-mail. Milbury is an assistant coach for one of the pee wee hockey teams that had been playing, according to a police statement.
