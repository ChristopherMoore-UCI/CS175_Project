"Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm," the police chief said Thursday. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. But it was too late, police said.
