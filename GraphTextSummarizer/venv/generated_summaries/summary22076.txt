-- Catania manager Rolando Maran was not even alive the last time his club claimed a home win over AC Milan in the top-flight. It was not until the second period that Milan really began to exert its dominance and even then it took the sending off of Pablo Barrientos to inspire them. Milan stuns leaders Juventus Milan, looking for back-to-back wins in Serie A for the first time this season following its victory against Juventus last week, looked lethargic in the opening exchanges. What a contrast to that of a few days earlier when Catania pulled off a famous victory, courtesy of a goal from Bruno Petroni -- a player on loan from AC's famous rivals, Internazionale. Maran was born on July 14, 1963, just two months after Catania had pulled off victory against a Milan team which would go on to win the European Cup three days later.
