-- Massive mudslides in northwestern China have killed 337 people, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Monday. But the county still needs 441 tons of drinking water and 22 tons of instant food, said a spokesman with the prefecture's government, according to Xinhua. "Currently the key tasks and challenges are: expanding the scope for search and rescue; dealing with the barrier lake (caused by mudslides) in a timely and scientific manner; cleaning the sludge and resuming the supply of drinking water," Wen said Monday, according to Xinhua. The county needs an estimated 11,023 tons of water and 551 tons of instant food in the next 25 days, Xinhua reported. A total of 600 soldiers arrived in Zhouqu County to perform relief work, Xinhua said.
