-- Three representatives of the Economic Community of West African States and an African Union representative met twice Monday with self-declared Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo in an attempt to persuade him to step down, but there was no indication late in the day that they were near their goal. The official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, said "If President Gbagbo is looking for a dignified exit, we remain open to help him with that, but there's no indication that he's prepared to leave at this point." On Sunday, Gbagbo cabinet minister Charles Ble Goude reversed his call for Ivorians to surround the hotel "to give a chance for peace and the negotiations that are going on." After the meeting, Ouattara told reporters that Gbagbo must leave immediately. He said the Ivory Coast's people "have spoken clearly" in the runoff, which international observers say Gbagbo lost to his challenger, Ouattara.
