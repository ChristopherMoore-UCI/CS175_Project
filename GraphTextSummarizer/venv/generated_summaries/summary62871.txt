"Our channel was temporarily compromised, but we have since restored our original line-up of the best classic Sesame Street video clips featuring Cookie Monster, Big Bird, Grover, Oscar the Grouch, and the rest of the fuzzy, feathered, and googly-eyed friends you remember from childhood." YouTube, which routinely declines to comment on individual user accounts, issued a brief statement Sunday noting that the Google-owned video site prohibits graphic content and removes inappropriate posts as soon as they become aware of them. "We apologize for any inconvenience our audience may have experienced yesterday on our Sesame Street YouTube channel," read a message on the channel's home page, which appeared to have been restored around 11 a.m. ET. Users who accessed the account earlier had found explicit sex videos instead of Muppets. The message on "Sesame Street's" page also noted that parents who want to watch videos with their children "in a safe, child-friendly environment" can also do so on the show's website. "I work hard to make quality gameplay videos, and most important I respect the community guidelines."
