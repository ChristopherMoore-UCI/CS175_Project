-- After the horrific shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, a parade of self-appointed experts tried to insinuate that people with autism are prone to inexplicable acts of violence because they lack the ability for empathy and social connection. I only hoped that the searches indicated that people wanted to find out the truth: that autism is not connected with violent acts. Most people with autism who I know of are deeply sensitive and ethical; we just have trouble reading social signals. But the repetition of damaging stereotypes means more needs to be done to address the myths and stigma around autism, which puts people who are already at a high risk for bullying in even more danger. With my friend Dan Grover, we built WrongPlanet.net, a community for people who wanted to share their personal experiences with autism.
