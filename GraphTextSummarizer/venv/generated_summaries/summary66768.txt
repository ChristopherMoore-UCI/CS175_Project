Barbie Latza Nadeau, Rome bureau chief for Newsweek and author of "Angel Face: Sex, Murder, and the Inside Story of Amanda Knox," told CNN that Knox's book demonstrates she has a "selective memory. "[I hope] that eventually I can have their permission to pay respects." Knox and boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted in the 2007 rape and slashing death of 21-year-old Kercher at Knox and Kercher's apartment in Perugia, Italy. Knox explains how she was drawn to Sollecito because he reminded her of Harry Potter and how they stayed in smoking marijuana, having sex and watching "Amelie" the night Kercher was killed. "I wasn't there," Knox told Sawyer, referring to the night of Kercher's murder. After Kercher's murder, Knox was filmed smooching on Sollecito outside the murder scene.
