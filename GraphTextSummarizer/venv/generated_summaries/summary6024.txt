The network confirmed via Twitter on Sunday that Zendaya, the 17-year-old Disney actress and singer tapped to portray Aaliyah in the TV movie, has exited the project. Yet from the beginning, the teen star made it clear that Aaliyah has been a lifelong inspiration for her, and she told MTV News on the BET Awards red carpet that she wasn't sure the biopic would do justice to her idol. If she is going to do it, she wants to do it right." Aaliyah, born Aaliyah Dana Haughton, was killed in a 2001 plane crash at the age of 22. "We are sad Zendaya will no longer portray Aaliyah," Lifetime said. I've been into Aaliyah since I was little, so there wasn't too much getting into character.
