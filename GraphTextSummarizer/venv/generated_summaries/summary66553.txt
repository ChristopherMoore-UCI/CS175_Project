Like children all over the world, Haiti's children are resilient and brave, but they are also children, our children. Nevertheless they are children, Haiti's future. Some kids do fall prey to the local restav√®k system of child labor, but others are taken into loving homes, sharing equally the little bit their guardians have. Like most other children, they adore seeing their faces reflected in the back of a digital camera. Haiti's children have suffered more than any child, or adult, should have to, yet they still represent the best that Haiti has to offer.
