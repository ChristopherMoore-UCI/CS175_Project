Chum is a mixture of blood and dead fish parts, which is used to lure sharks. "It is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioral experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic (white tipped) shark was triggered by an activity, most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area. She called for help, and a lifeguard brought her to shore, but she had lost too much blood and resuscitation efforts failed, Van Lysebettens said. Van Lysebettens said the reason behind the shark attacks needs to be determined in order to stop it. " Several divers in the area saw carcasses of dead sheep in the water last week, Van Lysebettens said.
