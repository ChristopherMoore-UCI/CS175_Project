-- Singer Celine Dion is 14 weeks pregnant with twins after years of trying to expand her family, her representative said Sunday. Dion, who completed a world tour last year, will return to Las Vegas, Nevada, next March to begin a three-year residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Dion, 42, and her husband-manager Rene Angelil, 68, will find out next month the gender of their twins, representative Kim Jakwerth said. A new Harris Poll released in May named Dion, a Canadian, as America's favorite singer. The pregnancy was the result of her sixth in-vitro fertilization attempt, Jakwerth said.
