Talking about Syria last year, President Barack Obama said "a red line for us is, we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized." The Pentagon says it's "ready to go" if it gets orders to carry out a military strike in response to Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons against its own people. "The use of chemical weapons is contrary to the standards adopted by the vast majority of nations and international efforts since World War I to eliminate the use of such weapons. Surrounding Syria are Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan, Israel and Turkey. If Syria uses chemical weapons in the civil war, the United States will have to do something.
