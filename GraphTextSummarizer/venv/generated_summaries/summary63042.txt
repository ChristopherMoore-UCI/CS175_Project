"Travel to Pakistan is becoming a big concern for Swedish counter-terrorism services," Swedish terrorism expert Ranstorp told CNN. According to Taarnby, more than 20 Swedish citizens are believed by Swedish security services to be fighting with Al Shabaab in Somalia. Swedish counter-terrorism sources tell CNN more than 100 are being monitored. In another link to Pakistan, Swedish counter-terrorism sources tell CNN that a Swedish militant -- still being monitored by security services in the country -- played a key role in a terrorist network linked to David Headley, an American Jihadist, plotting an attack against a Danish newspaper last year. And a few weeks ago Al Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia, released a video in which a Swedish member exhorted Swedish militants to kill Vilks.
