-- The mayor of North Chicago placed the city's police chief on leave and hired a retired officer to lead an investigation into six cases of alleged excessive use of force by police over the past 18 months. But Rockingham expressed confidence in police, whose job is to maintain order among the 36,000 residents of North Chicago, where the average income was $17,685, according to the 2010 Census. But why did it take someone dying before someone finally did something?" In a case that occurred last October, Christopher Harper, 31, of Waukegan, said he was preparing to leave his job as a bouncer at a North Chicago bar when a policeman pulled up shortly before midnight. "I think that we, as the city of North Chicago, do need to make sure that the residents and people who are coming into our community are being handled properly," he said. O'Connor said the North Chicago Police Department has a problem with a group of officers that have repeatedly beat people.
