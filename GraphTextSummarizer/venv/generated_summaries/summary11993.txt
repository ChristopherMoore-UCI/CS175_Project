Transportation Security Administration spokesman Jon Allen said the Transportation Security Administration, along with more than a dozen federal and state agencies, were conducting counter-terrorism exercises Tuesday when agents discovered the men. The men were illegal immigrants, said ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez. Gonzalez said five of the men were from Mexico and one man was from El Salvador. The men were handed over to two federal agencies -- Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Allen said. Gonzalez previously said all the men had been processed for removal from the United States, but she later clarified the statement.
