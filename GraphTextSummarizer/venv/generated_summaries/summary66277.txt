Authorities have said there's no reason to believe the shooting was connected with demonstrations over the August police shooting of Brown. Eight people were arrested outside the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department on Sunday night when demonstrations grew violent yet again, police say. While previous protests at the police station have been largely peaceful, some demonstrators among a crowd of about 150 people began throwing rocks and bottles at officers around 10 p.m., according to CNN affiliate KTVI. Protests erupted last month following Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson's fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. The officer was wearing a body camera at the time of the shooting, according to the Saint Louis County sheriff's office, but it was "not activated," officials said.
