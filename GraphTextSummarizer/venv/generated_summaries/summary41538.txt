The suicide attack was launched at the shrine of a revered Sufi Muslim saint, Abdullah Shah Ghazi, said Zulfiqar Ali Mirza, interior minister of Sindh province. Karachi and Sindh residents make pilgrimages to the shrine to offer prayers. Mirza has ordered the closing of Karachi shrines until further notice. Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, is located in Sindh province. Saghir Ahmed, Sindh's health minister, told CNN that the victims have been brought to hospitals in Karachi and 60 people are being treated for injuries.
