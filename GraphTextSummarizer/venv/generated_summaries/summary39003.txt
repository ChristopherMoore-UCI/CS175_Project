-- Protesters gathered in lower Manhattan mid-day Sunday to demonstrate against plans to build a mosque near the site of Ground Zero, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed by Islamist hijackers on September 11, 2001. The project has the backing of the Community Board of lower Manhattan. "Lower Manhattan should be made into a shrine for the people who died there," said Michael Valentin, a retired city detective who worked at ground zero. The project calls for a 13-story community center including a mosque, performing art center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. iReport: Protests against mosque near Ground Zero
