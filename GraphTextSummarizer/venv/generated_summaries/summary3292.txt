"Despite being an expensive country, Norway builds some of the cheapest tunnels," says Alun Thomas, head of tunnels at engineering consultancy Ramboll. "This tunnel defined the term 'mega project,'" says Matt Sykes, tunnel expert and director at engineering company Arup. "For me it emphasizes how tunnel construction can enhance the environment as well as bringing huge benefits for society. "The sheer length of tunnel -- which takes 20 minutes to drive through -- led to innovation in the use of behavioral science and driver psychology in the design to reduce driver fatigue and improve safety," says Sykes. "This resulted in large, colorfully lit caverns every six kilometers, providing points of interest and a unique driver experience." Length: 24.5 kilometers (15.2 miles) Fast fact: Engineers separated the tunnel into different sections to give the illusion that drivers are traveling through a number of smaller tunnels.
