But with Facebook, Leibovich said, the military can "check whether a person is taking photos on Shabbat (the Jewish sabbath), whether they are wearing something that is not modest or updating their status on Shabbat." About 1,000 female Israelis in the past two years who had claimed to be orthodox have had to "rephrase their religious declarations" and do their military service after being found out, Israeli military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich told CNN. Leibovich said checking Facebook is just one tactic used to uncover false religious claims. The army says it checks the home pages of those who have sought an exemption from military service because they are orthodox -- religiously observant. Military service is obligatory for Israelis from the age of 18.
