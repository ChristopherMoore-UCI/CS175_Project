-- An anonymous video that appears to show several police officers torturing young male suspects in Argentina has outraged many people in the South American country. Maria del Carmen Verdu, the director of an organization that monitors police brutality, known by its Spanish acronym CORREPI, said such incidents are common throughout Argentina. "Torture is a common tool which is applied constantly in many detention centers and even to suspects held at police station cells before their court appearance," Verdu said. Sylvester told CNN affiliate Canal 13 that officials acted quickly because, "We, the government of Salta province, are strongly convinced that these police officers are not representative of who we truly are and we are not going to tolerate under any circumstances that officers commit this kind of crime." The police source said, "I don't agree that it's a common occurrence, but I can't deny that this happens either." Argentines are especially sensitive to police and military brutality.
