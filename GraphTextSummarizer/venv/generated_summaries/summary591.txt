"Continued growth of the top 20 clubs during 2010-11 emphasizes the strength of football's top clubs, especially in these tough economic times," Deloitte partner Dan Jones said. "Whilst revenue growth has slowed from 8% in 2009-10 to 3% in 2010-11, their large and loyal supporter bases, ability to drive strong broadcast audiences and continuing attraction to corporate partners has made them relatively resilient to the economic downturn. Premier League champions United were third on the list, having generated €367 million ($486 million), up from €349.8 million. The European economy may be experiencing a downturn, but the continent's wealthiest football clubs have once again bucked the trend according to financial adviser Deloitte. Chelsea, backed by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, saw revenue fall from €255.9 million in 2009-10 to €249.8 million ($330 million).
