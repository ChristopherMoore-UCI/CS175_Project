Online wedding albums are kept private unless couples enable social sharing, which allows guests to share photos and videos back out to their existing social networks. According to a recent survey from wedding site TheKnot.com, 19% of couples are using wedding apps to crowdsource their photos and another 41% are considering doing so. The app lets guests upload images directly to a private album viewable online by the bride and groom, wedding guests and other invitees. "A lot of couples are creating their own custom hashtags for their wedding and then encouraging guests to take photos and upload them to Instagram and sometimes Twitter," said Anja Winikka, site director for TheKnot.com. Increasingly, couples are crowdsourcing their wedding photography through WedPics and similar photo-sharing apps such as Capsule, Wedding Party, Guest Shots and AppilyWed.
