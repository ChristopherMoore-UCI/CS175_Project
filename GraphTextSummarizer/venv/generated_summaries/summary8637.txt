Light is the most important factor in photography, Pirila said, and camera obscura attracted her because of its play with light. Pirila decided to explore camera obscura after seeing black-and-white images by Abelardo Morell in a magazine. Before working with the technique, Pirila had worked with pinhole cameras, which are essentially camera obscura on a smaller scale. Regardless, models must hold a pose for a relatively long time for a picture to be taken in this space with low light. Since 1996, photographer Marja Pirila has been working on her "Interior/Exterior" project, using an old technique that is the basis of all photography to create complex, layered works.
