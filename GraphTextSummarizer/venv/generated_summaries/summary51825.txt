Shortly after O.J. Simpson was charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, gruesome killings turned into a manhunt. Approximately 6:45 p.m. on June 17, 1994, police saw Simpson on the expressway in a white Ford Bronco driven by his best friend and former teammate, Al Cowlings. During the chase, on the phone with LAPD Detective Tom Lange, Simpson said, "...you let the police know, you let them all know, I wasn't running." The Bronco chase dominated sports coverage on a day with major sports news. Big shift in attitude toward O.J. Simpson Simpson's white Bronco chase came in sixth, behind the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the death of Osama bin Laden.
