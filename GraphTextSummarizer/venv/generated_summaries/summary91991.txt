How can insurance companies make health care cheaper so that they can deliver lower premiums to people and attract more business? Insurance companies like it because it means they can pay less, charge lower premiums and sell more policies. If we want guaranteed issue and community ratings (so that no one can be denied insurance and no one can be charged more for being sick), then insurance companies must use other strategies to save money. In the past, insurance companies could have set lower annual or lifetime limits, which confines their risk and allows them to sell insurance at a lower price. In order to make insurance cost less, private insurance companies have to make use of the tools available to them.
