The development comes four months after a group of 31 North Koreans accidentally crossed over into South Korean waters on a fishing boat. -- Nine North Koreans defected to the South by boat over the weekend, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday. The nine defectors made the journey in an engineless boat and are being questioned by South Korean authorities about their motives and their route, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. There are currently more than 20,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, according to the South's Unification Ministry. Four members of that group decided to defect to the South, despite Pyongyang's demands that they all be repatriated to the North, the South Korean Red Cross said in March.
