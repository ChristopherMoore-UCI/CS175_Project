"The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups,"  the FBI said in a statement. FBI agents interviewed one of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings two years ago, but found no connection with terror groups. The FBI said it took a number of investigative steps to check on the request, including looking at his travel history, checking databases for derogatory information and searching for Web postings. " U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Friday that information that Tsarnaev had been interviewed by the FBI in the past was disturbing. Agents also interviewed Tsarnaev's family members, the FBI said, but did not detect terrorist activity.
