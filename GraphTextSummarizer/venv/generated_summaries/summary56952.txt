The Canadians take a 2-1 lead into Sunday's deciding singles matches after Daniel Nestor and Vasek Pospisil clinched a five-set win in Saturday's doubles match up against Nenad Zimonjic and Ilija Bozoljac. Stepanek beat Juan Monaco in straight sets in Friday's opening singles match before Tomas Berdych made it 2-0 with a four-set win over Leonardo Mayer. Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek took just over two hours to beat Argentine pair Carlos Berlocq and Horacio Zeballos in straight sets, 6-3 6-4 6-2. The 6-7 6-4 3-6 7-6 10-8 victory gives Canada a great chance of making their first Davis Cup final. Milos Raonic will lead his countrymen into new territory if he can overcome world No.1 Novak Djokovic in the Belgrade Arena in the first singles match.
