We urgently need to foster national debates involving businesses, education specialists and young people themselves to build the skilled workforce Africa requires to compete globally. The result is that political power lies in the hands of aging leaders who have little knowledge or interest in the ambitions and concerns of younger generations -- and sadly even less interest in passing on the reins of leadership. Even in countries where leaders do not confuse their own interests with those of their country, our young people can find themselves locked out of decision-making and debate. In a world changing with breakneck speed, it is young people who are best equipped to identify and deliver fresh solutions to our problems. But we will only fully reap these benefits if we listen to young people, engage with them and provide the education, skills and support they need to prosper.
