An American diplomat has described the violence in Kenya's Rift Valley as "clear ethnic cleansing" aimed at chasing out members of the Kikuyu tribe who are loyal to President Mwai Kibaki. "Kenya, which has long been a stable and peaceful country, today is in turmoil with innocent men, women and children being hounded and killed," Annan told Kenya's National Assembly before heading into talks with Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga. Since the election, a spasm of political violence has taken on ethnic overtones as supporters of Kibaki, a member of the Kikuyu tribe, battle with followers of Odinga, from the Luo tribe. However, U.S. envoy Jendayi Frazer said she did not believe the ethnic clashes that have brought Kenya to its knees following disputed elections last month could be classed as genocide. They do not expect the sanctions to target Kibaki or Odinga, the officials said, but rather those on both sides who are instigating the violence.
