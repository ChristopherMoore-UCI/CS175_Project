Cobb County Police said the purpose of the search warrants was to find blood, DNA, writings and photographs relating to child abuse, child neglect, homicide to children and cruelty to children. The child's mother had wanted to obtain photos of her son from seized computers for use at the funeral, but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, the attorney for Harris. The father, Justin Ross Harris, 33, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty in the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper Harris. The suspect in a Georgia toddler's death told police he used the Internet to research child deaths inside vehicles, a search warrant said. The family will speak when they can." Contacted by CNN via e-mail, she wrote back, "No one is allowed to comment right now." 'The manner of death is homicide' As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media.
