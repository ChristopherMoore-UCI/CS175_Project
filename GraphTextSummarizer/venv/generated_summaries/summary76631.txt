"I would call him a pioneer in health care, I would call him a pioneer as a human being, and also as a doctor," says restaurant owner and longtime friend Julio Pe√±a, who has been benefiting from Dr. Dave's services for quite a while. "Over the past ten years, I've seen many patients that work in restaurants, and there were always two things in common: They had no real access to any kind of medical care, and they also waited a long time to come see a doctor," Ores says. With health care currently a hot-button political issue, Dr. Dave sees this local, not-for-profit health system as a model for how national health care in America could work. "Obviously we want to take care of our people, but financially we're only capable of doing so much," says restaurant owner Billy Gilroy. In return, their workers can go see Dr. Dave with any kind of health issue they may have.
