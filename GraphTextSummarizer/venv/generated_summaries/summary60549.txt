The Gen Y -- or millennial -- generation's lack of religious affiliation, indifference to political parties and strong liberal views are a contrast to previous generations. I spent the early part of my career working on progressive policies and cause campaigns geared toward youth and diverse communities. Unlike previous generations, we actually like our parents and grandparents -- perhaps because we're still living with them. Thus the joke about "waiting for the older generation to die off" to see our political and social goals realized isn't just crass: It not a realistic path to social change. Today, just a half-century after interracial marriages were illegal in one-third of the states, nearly 1 in 6 newlyweds marry across racial lines.
