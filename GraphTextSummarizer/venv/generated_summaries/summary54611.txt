Work groups focused on mood disorders, personality disorders, anxiety disorders and so on are equally invested in this process. As a group of clinician scientists who have devoted our professional lives to the problem of autism and related disorders, we've been given an extraordinary opportunity to update and improve how autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is diagnosed. The DSM is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States. Now five years in to this "nonburdensome" process, our work group has spent nearly 2,500 person-hours in meetings and another 3,500 hours on teleconferences discussing refinements to the diagnostic criteria for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, Asperger's disorder will become autism spectrum disorder.
