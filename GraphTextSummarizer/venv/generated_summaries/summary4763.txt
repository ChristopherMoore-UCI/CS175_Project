Slater was arrested at his home and charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and criminal trespass, said Helen Peterson at the Queens District Attorney's Office. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said it "appears" Steven Slater was quitting. Peterson said the second degree criminal mischief and first degree reckless endangerment charges are felonies that could land Slater in jail for up to seven years. Jet Blue public affairs would not respond to that claim. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that it "appears" the flight attendant quit his job in a very dramatic way.
