Frankie Dettori performs his signature "flying dismount" after winning all seven races at Ascot, September 28, 1996. In 2001, Ascot erected its own monument to Frankie Dettori; a lifesize bronze statue of the jockey at the entrance to the famous racecourse. " Among the crowd was Nick Smith, head of public relations for Ascot racecourse. It happened in the summer of 1996 at Royal Ascot, the British racecourse founded in 1711 by Queen Anne who considered it the ideal place for "horses to gallop at full stretch. " "It took races off the sports pages and onto the front pages," says Robin Oakley, CNN's European Political Editor and avid racing fan.
