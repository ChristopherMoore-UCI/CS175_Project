That's the moment I live for." 'House of Cards': Season 2 brings more dirty dealing Spacey said that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, both in attendance, were "instrumental" in developing the role of Frank Underwood, although McCarthy wasn't initially willing to work with him. -- Washingtonians from both sides of the aisle gathered this week to see actor Kevin Spacey in concert, a benefit for the Kevin Spacey Foundation. Although both McCarthy and Hoyer came out publicly against the show's portrayal of Congress, Spacey said, "You've gotta thank Frank Underwood for getting both sides of the aisle to agree on something." Spacey's next project will use his distinctive voice in a different way, starring alongside Alec Baldwin in Dreamworks' animated feature "Boss Baby." "Good evening and welcome to an evening to benefit the Frank Underwood Super PAC," Spacey joked to the sold-out crowd, with a guest list including Dr. Jill Biden, several members of Congress and business leaders. During his performance Monday night, at Washington's Sidney Harman Hall, he threw in Underwood impersonations among his set list, which ranged from Sinatra to "Piano Man," and an "All Night Long" duet with Jeff Goldblum.
