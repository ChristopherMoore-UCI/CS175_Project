The new ultra-light E-Ink-based product arrived just weeks after Amazon introduced its newest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, confirming the second fact. The book retailer confirmed the first fact on Wednesday by introducing a completely redesigned Nook GlowLight e-reader. Purpose-built devices such as the GlowLight and Paperwhite clearly have a place in the tablet world, and while neither Barnes & Noble nor Amazon divulge its e-reader sales, it's clear that both companies are fully committed to the category, and customers are still buying them. With the exception of its shape, Barnes & Noble's new GlowLight looks almost nothing like its predecessor. Last year, the company introduced curated shopping options on its Nook tablets; that experience has been recreated on the GlowLight in its Now on Nook section.
