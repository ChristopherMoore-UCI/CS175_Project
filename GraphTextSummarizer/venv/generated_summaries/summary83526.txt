At each stop, the tour highlighted members of Congress "who have voted for higher spending, higher taxes, and government intervention in the lives of American families and businesses," according to The Tea Party Express Web site. The conservative advocacy group Tea Party Express massed at the U.S. Capitol on Saturday to protest health care reform, higher taxes and what they see as out-of-control government spending. Although Tea Party Express tour was funded by Our Country Deserves Better, a conservative political action committee, Williams said his organization is nonpartisan, and that the rallies are not aimed at one politician over another, namely Obama. The tea party movement gained momentum this year; several parties were held across the country this summer to protest Obama and the Democrats' economic stimulus plans, among other things. Activists said the TEA Party Day -- an acronym for "Taxed Enough Already" -- was in response to runaway government spending.
