Facing political pressure, Madhav Kumar Nepal announced Wednesday that he is resigning as Nepal's prime minister. The Maoists declined to join the next coalition government under Nepal's leadership, upset that the government was not making moves to integrate about 19,000 former rebels into the Nepalese army. The Maoists were the largest party in the previous coalition government, but their leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- commonly known as Prachanda -- resigned as prime minister a year ago because the president overturned his decision to fire a senrio military official.

In a 20-minute televised address, Nepal said he wanted to avert crisis and find "political resolution to the peace process and the drafting of the new constitution.
