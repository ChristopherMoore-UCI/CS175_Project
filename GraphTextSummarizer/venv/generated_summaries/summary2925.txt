Bonnie made landfall as a tropical storm earlier Friday near Biscayne Bay in southeastern Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. As of 11 p.m. ET, the system was moving through the eastern Gulf after crossing southern Florida earlier Friday. The storm also slowed business in southern Florida. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services encouraged residents Friday to prepare for the storm by pre-applying for Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, previously known as Disaster Food Stamps. Still, the hurricane center said the system may slow, and a tropical storm warning is in effect from Destin, Florida, to Morgan City, Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain.
