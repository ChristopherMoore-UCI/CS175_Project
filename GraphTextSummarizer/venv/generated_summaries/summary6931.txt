"The day has sadly witnessed many violations observed, documented and announced by the campaign, led by banning Sabahy delegates from entering polling centers, collective voting, physical assaults against delegates and lawyers, let alone some cases of intervention by police and army forces," it said in a statement. Tamarod has blamed the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, which had held a small protest in Kerdassa earlier in the day. Public service ads, media campaigns and the electoral ads of the el-Sisi campaign stressed that voting is a patriotic duty. Egypt's state-run news agency MENA reported clashes in a polling station at Umraniya district but said they didn't disrupt the vote. A man working for el-Sisi's campaign was fatally shot near Cairo on Monday, Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said.
