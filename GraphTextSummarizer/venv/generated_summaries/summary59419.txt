Eric Naposki and Nanette Packard McNeal face the possibility of life sentences over the shooting of Bill McLaughlin, according to the Orange County, California, district attorney. The Orange County officials said new evidence prompted the arrests of the two suspects, who were charged with special circumstances murder for financial gain. Orange County authorities have asked that he be sent to California to face trial. Packard McNeal met McLaughlin after she ran a personal ad that said, "I know how to take care of my man if he knows how to take care of me," the district attorney said in a statement. Authorities said Packard McNeal persuaded her ex-boyfriend to kill McLaughlin so she could claim a $1 million life insurance policy, inherit $150,000 and get the right to live in his beach house for a year.
