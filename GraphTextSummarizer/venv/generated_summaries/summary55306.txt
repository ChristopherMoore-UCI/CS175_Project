Janice Hahn, the U.S. representative for Paez's district, told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" that she had written a letter to outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Beatriz Paez filed a complaint Wednesday with police in South Gate, just south of Los Angeles. A California woman who was recording police activity said she was terrified when a deputy U.S. marshal walked toward her, grabbed her cell phone out of her hands and smashed it with his foot. Paez said she was out walking Sunday when she noticed what looked like an arrest several houses up the street. She called the marshal's actions illegal because Paez wasn't hindering an investigation or arrest.
