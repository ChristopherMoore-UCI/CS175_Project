"However, within this extremely severe context, the government (of Japan) has been requesting cooperation from the government of Jordan and will continue making the utmost effort for swift release of Mr. Goto." The latest demand: Bring convicted terrorist Sajida al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset Thursday, or Jordanian ISIS hostage Moaz al-Kassasbeh will be executed "immediately." Last week, the group demanded $200 million from Japan in exchange for Goto and fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor. A  post from the group on Tuesday announced that time was suddenly in short supply for Goto and the Jordanian pilot. The Japanese government said there was no evidence so far that it wasn't Goto speaking in Tuesday's video, which was posted to YouTube and distributed on social media by known ISIS supporters.
