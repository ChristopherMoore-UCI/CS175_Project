Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky founds the Second Mile, a charity to help troubled youths. Sandusky jumps to his feet and tells the coach the two were just working on wrestling moves, the coach later recalls in grand jury testimony. In grand jury testimony, the principal, Steven Turchetta, recalls Sandusky's behavior as suspicious and says Sandusky was often "clingy" and "needy" when a student no longer wanted to spend time with him. Penn State police and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare investigate an incident in which the mother of an 11-year-old boy reported that Sandusky had showered with her son and may have had inappropriate conduct with him.
