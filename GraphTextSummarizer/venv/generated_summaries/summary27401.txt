The Drug Enforcement Administration describes Caro Quintero as fugitive from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on felony murder and kidnapping charges, in addition to other criminal charges. Mexico's high court has overturned a lower court ruling that freed Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero, 61, once leader of Mexico's now-defunct Guadalajara Cartel, is accused in the 1985 kidnapping and killing of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. The Mexican Supreme Court's decision came a day after U.S. authorities said they would pay up to $5 million for information leading to Caro Quintero's arrest or conviction. After a meeting in Washington in September, Mexican Attorney General JesÃºs Murillo Karam promised that authorities in his country would reapprehend Caro Quintero.
