We've grown used to living without reality coordinates that can be tested not with further keystrokes but with a good swift kick to the tires. The story of Manti Te'o and his putative online dead girlfriend (may she, or this tale, rest in peace) has a kind of oily vodka shimmer to it that transcends hypothetical naked ambition for the Heisman Trophy and girlfriends with leukemia. But what I note about it is the flash of winking mirrors, the reflections that stand in for authenticated reality. We wouldn't buy a car without test-driving it, and we ought not to rely on the flash of mirrors for our take on reality. Somewhere in these flashing mirrors, we mistake the flash-lit celebrity, the lightning-strike story, for confirmed reality.
