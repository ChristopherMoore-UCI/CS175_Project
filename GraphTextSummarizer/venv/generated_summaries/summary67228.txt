An exchange of gunfire between two men broke out in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood around 9 p.m. Monday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference. -- Three people were killed and two police officers were injured in a gun fight in Brooklyn Monday evening -- the latest bloodshed in a violent holiday weekend in New York City that saw at least 48 people shot. Johnson died after Webster shot him in the neck, while Webster was killed by police, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. A bullet Webster fired "struck an innocent 56-year-old woman sitting on her stoop two doors down," Bloomberg said. After rushing to the scene, officer Omar Medina "was hit by bullet fragments in his left arm and chest," Bloomberg said.
