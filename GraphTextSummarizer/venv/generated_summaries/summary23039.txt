A senior German counterterrorism source told CNN on Thursday that the German Interior Ministry warning was linked to recent threats to the country from al Qaeda in Pakistan.

"Air Berlin has confirmed that there was no explosive material in the laptop bag found in Namibia," Sabina Teller, spokeswoman for Air Berlin, told CNN. It landed safely in Munich after a six- or seven-hour delay, said Air Berlin spokeswoman Silke Manitz.
