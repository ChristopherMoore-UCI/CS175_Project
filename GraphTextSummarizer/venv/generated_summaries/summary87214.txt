Ever since World War II, automated navigation systems in airplanes have used female voices, which stand out in the male-dominated cockpit. Whatever our gender, we also want female assistants, just like Joan and Peggy eventually have when they become powerful. Also, let's not forget that everyone roots for the female characters Joan Holloway and Peggy Olson, both of whom begin the show as assistants. But in 2014, assistants are about as rare as those IBM Selectric typewriters from Season 1, so we'll take the next best thing: the virtual version. If all the assistants on Mad Men were men, everyone would want a male virtual assistant right now.
