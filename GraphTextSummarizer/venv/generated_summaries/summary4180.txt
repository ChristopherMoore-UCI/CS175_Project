Boston Logan International Airport remained open, but most flights have been canceled, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said. They departed Chicago with a new crew at 8:05 a.m. Monday and landed in Los Angeles at 10:11 a.m., according to FlightAware.com. That's why the crew made the decision to divert to Chicago O'Hare International Airport that night and informed the passengers hours prior to takeoff, Lupica said. The first officer was going to exceed his allotted work time, as dictated by the Federal Aviation Administration, if he flew the entire route, American spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. FlightAware.com showed more than 700 flights within, into and out of the United States canceled for Sunday, on top of the more than 1,500 flights scheduled to be scrubbed Monday.
