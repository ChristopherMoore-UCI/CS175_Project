There were many Republicans who supported immigration reform in the mid-1960s. Other Republicans also believed that immigration had always made this nation strong. As Bush's situation makes clear, immigration reform will be among the toughest tests Republicans face in the coming year as they try to strengthen their image with the electorate and make sure they are not totally out of step with the major demographic trends shaping America. When Congress passed immigration reform in 1965, almost 85% of the Republicans voted yes. As new debates arose over immigration in the 1980s, the party continued to hear from Republican voices in favor of liberalized immigration policies.
