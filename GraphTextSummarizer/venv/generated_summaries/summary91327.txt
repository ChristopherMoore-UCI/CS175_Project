Fisher, who only knows a few Spanish words, said he's still not sure what he'll say when they meet face-to-face. It appeared likely that it would reach the miners ahead of the Plan A drill, normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines and the Plan C method, normally used to drill for oil. "You look down at your feet and you realize that 2,000 feet below us, there's 33 guys that are in a whole hell of a lot worse situation than we are." Depending on whether engineers decide to encase the rescue shaft with steel casing, the 33 miners could be extracted from the collapsed San Jose gold and copper mine between two and 10 days after breakthrough. Meanwhile, Fisher and a small crew of American drillers are the tip of the spear for Plan B, one of the three drilling teams racing to rescue the miners buried 2,300 feet below the ground. Fisher is based in Berlin, Pennsylvania, in the heart of the state's mining country, thousands of miles from Chile.
