-- Twenty years ago, singer/songwriter Cassandra Wilson signed a lucrative recording deal with Blue Note Records and subsequently released her seminal recording "Blue Light 'til Dawn." Nine albums (seven solo studio recordings) by Wilson have been released on the storied record label since then, she's remained an in-demand concert headliner globally, and she shares in the Pulitzer Prize-winning glory of fellow Delta native and jazz great Wynton Marsalis for the 1997 jazz oratorio "Blood On The Fields." Wilson is currently in New York readying an eight-show stint at the famous Blue Note Jazz Club, where she has performed to sold-out audiences in for years. Wilson recently launched her own Twitter account (@reallycassandra) where she informs her thousands of followers about her latest whereabouts and publicly muses with fellow jazz musicians like Dianne Reeves. "I'm sure you're aware of all the stuff that Blue Note had been going through and switching owners," Wilson said.
