In Giza, security forces fired tear gas at Morsy supporters to disperse their march there, Ahram Online reported. Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with opponents in parts of Cairo after Morsy loyalists tore down posters supporting the proposed constitution, on which Egyptians will vote Tuesday and Wednesday, the semiofficial Ahram Online news outlet reported. Morsy's supporters say that the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Muslim Brotherhood supporters have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month.
