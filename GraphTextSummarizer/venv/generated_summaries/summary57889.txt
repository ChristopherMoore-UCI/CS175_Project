Scientists classify solar flares by size, in much the same way they do tornadoes or earthquakes: X-class flares are the biggest and are major events that can trigger planetwide radio blackouts; M-class flares are medium-size ones; and C-class flares are small, with few noticeable consequences here on Earth. To see more about how the flares may affect Earth, visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center, the U.S. government's official source for space weather forecasts and alerts. The short-lived explosions were expected to disrupt high-frequency radio communications on Earth, although NASA scientists said they pose no threat to humans. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to affect humans, but when intense enough, the explosions can disturb GPS and communications signals, NASA said. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation that send gases, plasma and other matter into the solar system.
