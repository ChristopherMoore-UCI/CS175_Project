-- News International chief James Murdoch rejected allegations Thursday his company behaved like a Mafia organization over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. Public outrage over the scandal later led News International to close the best-selling tabloid in July and abandon a bid to take over British broadcaster BSkyB. Questioning Murdoch about why so little information was shared, Labour Member of Parliament Tom Watson suggested the company operated an "omerta" code of silence. Amid a storm of outrage and a boycott by advertisers, News of the World was closed down shortly afterwards while chief executive Rebekah Brooks and long-time Murdoch aide Les Hinton resigned. Murdoch's position at the helm of News International is widely believed to have been jeopardized by the scandal, which has cost its parent company $150 million. Amid the furore, the Murdochs abandoned their attempt to buy the shares they did not own in British broadcaster BSkyB. Thursday's hearing came only days after News International admitted the Sunday tabloid hired a private detective to spy on lawyers defending hacking victims.
