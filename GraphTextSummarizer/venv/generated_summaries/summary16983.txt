In April: Court seemingly at odds over cell phones and searches Opinion: What Scalia knows about illegal searches Cevallos: Cell phone ruling keeps cops out of your business By a 9-0 vote, the justices said smart phones and other electronic devices were not in the same category as wallets, briefcases, and vehicles -- all currently subject to limited initial examination by law enforcement. Home searches generally require warrants and are given greater constitutional protection than vehicles or a person in public. "We will make use of whatever technology is available to preserve evidence on cell phones while seeking a warrant, and we will assist our agents in determining when exigent circumstances or another applicable exception to the warrant requirement will permit them to search the phone immediately without a warrant," Canale said. Generally such searches are permitted if there is "probable cause" that a crime has been committed, to ensure officers' safety and prevent destruction of evidence.
