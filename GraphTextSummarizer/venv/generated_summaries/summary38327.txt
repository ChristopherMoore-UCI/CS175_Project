In 2007, Chiquita pleaded guilty and paid a $25 million fine for violating U.S. antiterrorism laws when it provided payments to the right-wing paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, known as the AUC. A lawsuit Wolf filed on behalf family members of 677 victims in March alleged that Chiquita officials "were aware that their acts and omissions assisted in the violations of international law" and "acted willfully, wantonly and recklessly, with the intent to aid the terrorist acts of the AUC. " Under the guise of protecting the Colombian public from leftist rebel groups, the AUC committed numerous human rights abuses, according to the U.S. State Department and Human Rights Watch. As part of those proceedings, Chiquita acknowledged that it had also made payments to the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- known as the FARC -- from 1989 to at least 1997. In a motion filed this month asking the judge to dismiss the lawsuits, Chiquita argued that the suits did not show any connection between Chiquita and violence in Colombia "apart from the one fact that Chiquita has admitted -- that it authorized its Colombian subsidiary to accede to the extortion demands of right-wing and left-wing armed groups in Colombia in order to prevent retaliation against its employees.
