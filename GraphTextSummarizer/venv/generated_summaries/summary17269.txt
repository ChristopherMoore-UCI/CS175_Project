CNN International is inviting you to join the global discussion on climate change by using ECOSPHERE, a digital tool that will visualize Twitter conversations around the Earth Summit in a stunning evolving environment. It was recently awarded with two Cannes Lions at the 59th International Festival of Creativity -- Silver Lion in the "Publications & Media" category and Bronze Lion in the "Best Integrated Campaign Led by Promotion and Activation" category. The ECOSPHERE takes thousands of tweets from around the world and visualizes them in real time in the form of an evolving digital garden. Submitted tweets are scanned for keywords and then grouped together into specific topics or discussions. Users can explore the lush 3D environment by zooming in on the different branches while a separate time line documents the development of the discussions and the ECOSPHERE environment itself.
