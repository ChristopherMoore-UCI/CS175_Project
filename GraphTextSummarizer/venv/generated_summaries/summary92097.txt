Of course, as Cyrus has peeled off the layers of adolescence -- along with several layers of her actual clothes -- many have "tsked" at her seemingly new image: There are the references to marijuana (super lemon haze is said to be her strain of choice); the sexually suggestive music videos; the risquÃ©, semi-nude photos - not to mention her "Wrecking Ball" video - both courtesy of Terry Richardson. According to Steven Peterman, an executive producer on Cyrus' old show, "Hannah Montana," that sort of risk-taking is nothing new. In CNN's "The Life of Miley Cyrus," which examines Cyrus' music, message and personal journey, insiders who've intimately come to know the singer/actress say that her transition from a childhood of ATVs and cheerleading to adult superstardom was no accident. Photos: Child star transformations When Cyrus was first auditioning for the part, "she was the least likely person to get this job," Peterman continued. Cyrus herself has never been "squeaky clean" -- even before she turned 18, her actual image was occasionally at odds with the image those parents paying for tickets to "Hannah Montana" concerts expected.
