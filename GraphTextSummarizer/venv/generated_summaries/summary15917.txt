ISIS, also known as ISIL, has seized large swaths of land as part of its effort to create a caliphate -- an Islamic state -- that stretches from western Syria to eastern Iraq. The United States has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, which has seized control of large areas of northern Iraq and Syria. ISIS says it downed Syrian fighter jet But in Syria, ISIS claimed a victory of its own. President Barack Obama announced last week that the United States would lead "a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat" and that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS would expand from Iraq into Syria. That sound indicates the Peshmerga forces have reached the areas where ISIS fighters are holed up, he said.
