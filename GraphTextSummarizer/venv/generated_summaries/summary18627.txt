As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. Even more broken hopes and dreams.
