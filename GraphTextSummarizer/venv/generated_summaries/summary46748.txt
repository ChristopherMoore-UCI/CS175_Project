For him and other Kings' fanatics across Southern California and in the team's growing and crazed diaspora, the championship -- the first for the Kings since they began play in 1967 -- ended decades of futility for a franchise struggling for success in a sport typically associated with frigid temperatures and icy lakes. They dominated the Devils, a three-time Stanley Cup champion, in the first three games of the series, but New Jersey, with great players such as Ilya Kovalchuk, Patrik Elias, and Zach Parise, didn't say die. The scrappy Kings grabbed the National Hockey League's prestigious Stanley Cup with a 6-1 win over the New Jersey Devils. The pace of the game was set in the first period, when the Kings scored three goals during a five-minute power play in the first period after the Devils' Steve Bernier was ejected for boarding. "I'm probably going to watch the Kings Stanley Cup DVD everyday until next season starts," one person said on the Facebook fan page.
