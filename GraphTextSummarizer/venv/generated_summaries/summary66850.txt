"Hotel lobbies have seen many new trends over the last few years, from a private living room concept to a front desk free space," says Rome-based tour operator Uri Harash, founder of Perfetto Traveler. Southern Ocean Lodge, Kangaroo Island, Australia Sunshine the Boomer Roo, a giant sculpture crafted from discarded farm machinery by local artist Indiana James, greets guests as they enter the open lobby at this Kangaroo Island resort. Aria Hotel, Las Vegas While the City of Sin is full of impressive lobbies—at the artful Cosmopolitan and glittering Wynn, among others—the Aria entryway in Las Vegas' $8.5 billion CityCenter campus deserves a shout-out for its sophistication and dedication to sustainability. It might look like a polished museum, but you're in the hotel's lobby, a place where celebrations are held, aperitifs served and new guests welcomed with cocktails and room keys. To that end its lobby, which shares a sprawling open layout with a lounge and bar, has panoramic views of Torres del Paine Park and Lake Sarmiento.
