Gross actually called Van Hollen on his cell phone from Cuba in October before the midterms to wish him luck in his re-election. Gross's wife Judy, his attorney Gilbert, Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and an Obama administration national security official arrived at Andrews in Wednesday's pre-dawn hours to board a plane headed for Havana. "I'll believe it when I see it," Gross finally said, according to family spokeswoman Jill Zuckman. Two planes -- one to pick up Gross in Havana and one to deliver Cuban prisoners released by the United States -- ended up on the tarmac at the same time, Van Hollen said. Gross, who lived in Maryland, is a Van Hollen constituent who had gone door to door for Van Hollen's first campaign for Congress.
