Jackson lawyers argued that Murray was influenced by a conflict of interest -- created by his arrangement with AEG Live -- to continue dangerous propofol infusions to help Jackson rest for rehearsals. " AEG exec feared Michael Jackson would sabotage his comeback tour AEG Live executives did not tell Ortega about the incident when they approached him days later to direct the show, he said. " Ortega sent a series of e-mails that night and the next morning to AEG Live executives warning that they needed professional help for Jackson. Ortega testified that he was called to a meeting with AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips, Jackson and Murray at Jackson's home on June 20, hours after he sent those e-mails. "Our boy is gone" Ortega was standing on the Staples Center stage in Los Angeles the next day when he got a call from AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware telling him Jackson was dead.
