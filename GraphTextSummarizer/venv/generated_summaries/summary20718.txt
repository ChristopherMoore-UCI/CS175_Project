Thai authorities have also requested U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to revoke Nenkham's visa, DSI's Pengdit told CNN, and will ask U.S. authorities to arrest and remand him into Thai custody. A female plaintiff who claimed Nenkham had sex with her when she was 14 years old submitted a request for a DNA test for her 11-year old son, says Tharit Pengdit, Director General of the Department of Special Investigation. Authorities also estimate at least 300 million baht, or nearly $10 million, have disappeared from Nenkham's bank accounts in recent days. Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), a division of the Ministry of Justice, tells CNN it believes the video was shot by one of the monks on the plane, passed around and posted anonymously. Nenkham, who also goes by the name Weerapol Sukpol, now faces charges of violating Thailand's computer crime act by posting "deceitful information," having sex with a minor and rape, authorities say.
