Sevilla beat Benfica in a penalty shootout to win the Europa League Wednesday with La Liga rivals Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid guaranteed to claim the Champions League crown. Lima forced a fingertip save from Beto when he sent a fizzing long range effort in the Sevilla keeper's direction but the Spaniard's defense held firm -- and the match went into extra time. Jorge Jesus' side had not lost a match on their way to Wednesday's Europa League final while Sevilla had scored 22 goals on their rockier road to the showdown. Spain are an unstoppable force in European football. Sevilla edged out their Portuguese rivals 4-2 on penalties after a tense 120 minutes of play at the Juventus Stadium in Turin.
