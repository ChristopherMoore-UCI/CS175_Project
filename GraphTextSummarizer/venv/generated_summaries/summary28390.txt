"The only children with ADHD who were not at increased risk for depression were those without a depressed mother and who exhibited very few symptoms of other types of mental health problems," says the senior author of the study, Benjamin Lahey, Ph.D., a psychologist and professor of epidemiology at the University of Chicago. And in another new study, which appears in the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine, researchers at New York University report that teenagers with ADHD are about twice as likely to have problems with alcohol and drugs in their 30s than those without the disorder. Previous studies have estimated that anywhere from 16 percent to 37 percent of adults with ADHD have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder or dysthymia, a milder form of depression. However, this study is the first to examine the risk factors for depression in very young children with ADHD, and the first to follow children for an extended period of time. Early intervention and treatment are important, as the risk of depression and other health problems associated with ADHD can last well into adulthood.
