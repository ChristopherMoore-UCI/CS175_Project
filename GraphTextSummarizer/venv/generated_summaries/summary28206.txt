Don't let Muslims and Arabs off the hook Arab governments, the Arab League, the head of Al-Azhar University in Cairo and various Muslim clerics have issued statements denouncing the  Paris attacks, and various Arab and Muslim leaders attended yesterday's national rally in Paris. A perfect storm of jihadi fantasies driven by hatred and triumphalism, and growing Shia-Sunni divisions, have combined with a dysfunctional Arab world that offers up either no governance or bad governance. The failures of Arab and Muslim governments are to blame for jihadi terror. Ironically, the same democratic values and freedom of expression and movement that the West defends will be used by jihadis -- and the alienated Muslim communities on which they feed -- to sustain their radical effort. There were a number of grim surprises from the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, including their brutality, the inability of French intelligence to track known jihadis, and now of course the puzzling, indeed incomprehensible, fact that the Obama administration failed to send a high level representative to yesterday's national anti-terror rally in Paris.
