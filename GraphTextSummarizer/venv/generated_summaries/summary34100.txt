-- A frog that eats birds and a gecko with leopard stripes are among the 163 new species discovered last year in the Greater Mekong region of southeast Asia, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund. But the rapid pace of development in the Mekong region, coupled with the effects of climate change, are threatening to drive the species into extinction, Chungyalpa said. The WWF says it supports the idea of an agreement among the Mekong countries on how to respond to infrastructure development and climate change in terms of protecting its natural resources and people. "As we become familiar with more species in the region, our understanding of climate change and how it impacts these new species is changing," she said. Scientists believe the high number of species unique to the island might be due to the long separation of the island from continental Vietnam, the report says.
