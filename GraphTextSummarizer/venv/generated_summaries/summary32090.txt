Swedish authorities arrested Assange "in absentia" last month on charges of rape and molestation. -- The rape case involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is being reopened, Swedish prosecutors said Wednesday. " Prosecutors questioned Assange for about an hour on Monday, though only about the complaint of molestation, Silbersky told CNN. The allegations follow WikiLeaks' release last month of 76,000 pages of U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan.
