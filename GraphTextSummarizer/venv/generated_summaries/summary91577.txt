-- Vice President Joe Biden kicks off a two-day swing Wednesday through the eastern edge of the must-win battleground state of Ohio, an area that President Barack Obama is unlikely to visit this election year. "It speaks to President Obama's vulnerability that the campaign has to rely on Vice President Biden to campaign in key states like Ohio because Obama can't identify with voters. Which is why Biden may come in so handy in blue-collar areas in eastern Ohio, western and central Pennsylvania, and in parts of Michigan. In blue-collar swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, Joe Biden is a tremendous asset to Obama who, at times, makes voters feel like he is president of the elite, for the elite, and by the elite," added Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney's 2008 nomination bid, but who stayed neutral in this year's battle for the GOP nomination. Beck predicted that Romney will likely not "be able to connect with (eastern Ohio voters) well either" ahead of the November election.
