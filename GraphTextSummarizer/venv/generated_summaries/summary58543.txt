-- Ernie Els insists his game is in good shape despite missing the cut at the Scottish Open days before his title defense at the British Open begins. His overall score was also at two under, 10 shots behind surprise leader Chris Doak of Scotland. He leads four golfers by a shot, with Phil Mickelson -- the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 8 -- four shots behind Doak. First-round leader John Parry is tied for 13th with Mickelson. Doak, though, made his maiden appearance at a major at last month's U.S. Open at Merion.
