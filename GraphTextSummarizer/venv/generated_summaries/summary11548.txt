In a new TV ad airing in Iowa, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney stepped up his attacks on rival Mike Huckabee, this time accusing the former Arkansas governor of being soft on crime. Huckabee received more commutation and pardon requests than Romney did and rejected 78 percent of them, according to The Washington Post. One commutation request Huckabee rejected as governor was that of convicted rapist Wayne DuMond. No, it was Gov. Huckabee," Romney told host Tim Russert. With the crucial Iowa caucuses a little more than two weeks away, the Romney ad, titled "Choice: Judgment," attempts to contrast his record as Massachusetts governor with Huckabee's in Arkansas. The statistics cited in Romney's ad come from a recent Associated Press examination of Huckabee's record of commutations and pardons.
