-- Mathieu Flamini scored the winner nine minutes from time as a second-string AC Milan side beat third division Novara 2-1 at the San Siro on Wednesday to reach the Coppa Italia quarterfinals. Diego scored the opener as a full-strength Juve blew away Napoli's 14-match unbeaten run under coach Walter Mazzarri, although he did rest many first team regulars. Veteran striker Filippo Inzaghi opened the scoring on 12 minutes but in the first minute of the second period Pablo Gonzalez stunned the home fans by drawing Novara level. Meanwhile, Juventus bounced back from their weekend humbling as an Alessandro Del Piero double, one from the penalty spot, helped them to a 3-0 victory over 10-man Napoli in Turin -- easing the pressure on under-fire coach Ciro Ferrara. Milan coach Leonardo made 11 changes to the side that won 3-0 at Juventus on Sunday with Ronaldinho, David Beckham, Andrea Pirlo and Alessandro Nesta not even included on the bench.
