New York may be the "city that never sleeps" but that won't come as a shock to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who are still new parents and are expecting another baby in April. On Monday that will involve everything from a children's craft group in Harlem, a conservation reception with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, to an NBA game where they're likely to rub shoulders with Beyonc√© and husband Jay Z. On Tuesday, their plans include a moment of reflection at the September 11 memorial and a glittering charity dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art. Their spokesman tells me: "The Duke and Duchess are looking forward to their visit enormously, especially as neither have visited New York or Washington in any capacity before. It may be reminiscent of Princess Diana's first visit to New York.
