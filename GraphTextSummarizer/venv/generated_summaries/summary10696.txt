The two countries have veto power when it comes to U.N. voting at the Security Council so a Syria resolution pushed by the UK and France has stalled. The Europeans were glum, avoiding reporters' eyes, while the Russian U.N. ambassador was confident, smiling and remarking "no news is good news." "We do think the Council has to act .. it's simply sending a message," said French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud. Brazil's foreign minister Antonio Patriota said concerns with the Libya resolution was "influencing the way delegations look" at other resolutions, like Syria. "The Security Council has failed to react to Syria which is both extraordinary and disappointing," said Carne Ross, a former UK diplomat at the U.N. He now recommends citizens go around the U.N. deadlock by using websites to highlight Syrian or other government repression, and encourage more boycotts of products from companies involved with "problem" nations.
