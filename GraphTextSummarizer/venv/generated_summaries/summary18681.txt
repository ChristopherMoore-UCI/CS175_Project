Heavy news media coverage of terrible crashes in the '90s, like ValuJet Flight 592 near Miami and TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, "allowed safety to really go to the top of the agenda in the aviation discussion," says Goelz, giving the NTSB more influence to push Washington and the airlines toward more safety improvements. That tragedy offered the industry a warning about how a shifting economy can affect airline safety, says Voss. "It's really pretty amazing -- not just the year-to-year safety record -- but when you consider that air travel involves doing some fairly risky things, like flying an aircraft in bad weather and all kinds of conditions," says Bill Voss of the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit group focusing on safety research and advocacy. A combination of improvements introduced and implemented in the '80s and '90s gets credit -- including innovations in pilot training, better sharing of safety solutions, and technological advances. "That all comes from CRM -- which is saying that everybody's got a responsibility for safety."
