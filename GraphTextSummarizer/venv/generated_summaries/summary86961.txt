The plane had been flying over the area in order to provide security for Wednesday's visit by President Juan Manuel Santos to the nearby town of Toribio. -- The bodies of two pilots who were aboard a Colombian Air Force plane when it crashed Wednesday in a rebel zone in southwestern Colombia were retrieved Thursday. The plane had been supporting troops fighting rebels in the mountains near the town of Jambalo in Cauca province. After the handover, a group of about 10 FARC rebels attacked army positions, firing homemade mortars called tatucos from atop a mountain upon which a 30-foot wooden cross had been erected. Firefighters found the remains of one of the plane's pilots at the crash site; FARC rebels had removed the body of the other pilot and turned it over to the Red Cross.
