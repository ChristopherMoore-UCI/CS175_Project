In return, Ukraine was offered security assurances by Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States in a document that highlighted the inviolability of Ukraine's existing borders and its sovereignty, called for the abstention from forceful actions that could threaten Ukraine's territorial integrity and prohibited economic pressure being placed on Ukraine. Russian aggression against Ukraine, first in Crimea and soon after in eastern regions of Ukraine, has created an unprecedented challenge to international peace. -- Twenty years ago this month, Ukraine, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States signed an agreement that represented a major step in global anti-proliferation efforts. It is that realization that has prompted Ukraine in recent months to push for closer integration with NATO, a cause that is popular both with the Ukrainian people and which is also gaining political support. As part of the agreement, Ukraine willingly gave up more than 1,000 strategic and 2,500 tactical nuclear weapons, and agreed to the destruction of 176 silos used to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles.
