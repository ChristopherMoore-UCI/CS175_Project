"It's an outrage," Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said at a news conference, who DC news station WTTG reports has apologized to Marie Mills. She took the step toward retirement five days after Marie Mills held her elderly father in the street and screamed for help. According to the Mills family, those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911. Lt. Kellene Davis -- who commanded the station at the center of the incident -- filed papers on Thursday to retire from the District of Columbia's Fire and EMS Department, said Keith St. Clair, a spokesman for Washington's deputy mayor for public safety. There are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need, he told CNN Thursday.
