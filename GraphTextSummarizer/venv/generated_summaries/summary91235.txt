As psychedelic illuminations and the reds, whites and blues of the Union Jack lit up the facade of the palace, McCartney played some of his greatest hits to an audience that included Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne. "We are now celebrating the life and service of a very special person over the past 60 years," her son, Prince Charles told 18,000 ticket-holding guests, millions more watching on television and crowds packed into the nearby Mall thoroughfare. "As a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us, for inspiring us with your selfless devotion to duty and for making us proud to be British." -- With a military band, a string orchestra and electric guitars on full blast, London's Buckingham Palace was transformed into a rock venue on Monday as some of the biggest names in music celebrated Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee. She used a symbolic crystal "diamond" to trigger a laser that ignited a "national beacon" as 4,200 celebration fires blazed in communities across the UK and Commonwealth nations as far away as New Zealand and Tonga. According to British media reports, she wore earplugs at a similar event in 2002 to mark 50 years of her reign.
