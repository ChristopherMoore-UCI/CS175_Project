Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa hit the post for dominant Dortmund before it was Goetze who set the stadium alight as he played a one-two with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and chipped Jaroslav Drobny in the Hamburg goal for the second. Hamburg, who were second best for most of the match played before a capacity 80,720 crowd at Signal Iduna Park, grabbed a late consolation from midfielder Robert Tesche. Reigning Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund opened the new season with a convincing 3-1 home win over SV Hamburg Friday night. We took the foot off the gas a little in the closing stages, but there is plenty to be positive about," Dortmund defender Mats Hummels told AFP. Tesche headed home Hamburg's goal on 79 minutes after Kagawa had earlier cleared off the line.
