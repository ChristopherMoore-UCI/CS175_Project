The bills propose new enforcement tactics to be carried out by Internet intermediaries -- Internet service providers, search engines, payment processors and ad networks -- against foreign websites that flagrantly infringe U.S. intellectual property rights. The Obama administration said it would oppose legislation that risks online censorship of lawful activity, inhibits innovation or creates new cybersecurity risks -- all charges that have been levied against PIPA and SOPA. In addition, a group of six Republicans -- including co-sponsors of the legislation -- sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urging him not to proceed to a vote on the Protect IP Act, or PIPA, citing the public outcry as well as their own concerns. Large social media sites and online communities have spread the word, and thousands of Internet users have kept up a steady stream of calls and tweets at their senators and representatives. While the actions vary from site to site -- some are shutting down, some are turning their pages black -- the message is clear: Neither the Senate's Protect IP Act nor the House's Stop Online Piracy Act represents a consensus view on how to address online piracy without undermining the open Internet, and neither should be rushed to a vote.
