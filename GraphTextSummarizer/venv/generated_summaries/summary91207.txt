Los Angeles Fire Department Assistant Chief Patrick Butler, who wouldn't identify Ford as the patient, said the pilot suffered moderate trauma and was "alert and conscious" when he was taken to the hospital. The 72-year-old actor was in a two-seat, single-engine 1942 military trainer that went down on Penmar Golf Course near Santa Monica Airport. He said the pilot, the only person on board, was in fair to moderate condition. There have been many complaints about the air traffic and golfers and neighbors say aircraft fly too close to homes. Santa Monica Airport is a small facility with one runway, originally built in 1919.
