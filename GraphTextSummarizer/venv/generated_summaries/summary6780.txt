The latest string of fatal shark attacks in Western Australia is creating a climate of fear that could haphazardly undo a very important environmental law that protects great white sharks. If Mr. Moore has his way, hundreds if not thousands of sharks will be killed in Australia. By fishing for the great white shark, the bycatch will surely be a bunch of other shark species that have never had a history of munching on people. For humans and sharks to coexist is for us to respect their place on Earth. Great whites tracked off of Australia's northwestern coast have been known to travel to South Africa, and have been recorded traveling more than 12,000 miles in just nine months.
