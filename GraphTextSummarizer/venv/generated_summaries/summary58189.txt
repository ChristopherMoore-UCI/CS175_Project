The president's complete focus on Syria not only means he will have fewer opportunities to talk to the public about domestic priorities, but the media is focused on the drama building in Congress, too, drowning out any coverage of health care. Congressional scholar Thomas Mann with the Brookings Institution said there could be a "silver lining" to Syria crowding out immigration and health care. Obama canceled a speech to the annual AFL-CIO conference in California, an opportunity to discuss domestic issues, including health care. Both raising the debt limit and passing mandatory government spending bills are common duties of Congress that have been fraught with crippling partisanship in recent years. Obama's push for military intervention against Bashar al-Assad's regime over alleged chemical weapons use could push aside his top priorities on immigration and health care.
