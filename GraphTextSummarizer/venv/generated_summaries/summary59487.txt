Staying in shape and getting enough exercise were now big problems. Needless to say, staying in shape and getting enough exercise were not problems I had to deal with. Playing sports helped me develop friendships, hone my skills and stay in great shape. My sudden cardiac arrest in October 2011 created a daily reminder of my health and my need for exercise, but my selection to the CNN Fit Nation team pushed me to think deeper about where I am right now, where I've been and where I hope to go. My access to team sports was dwindling, and there was an extreme unlikelihood that the NFL and NBA would be knocking on my door any time soon.
