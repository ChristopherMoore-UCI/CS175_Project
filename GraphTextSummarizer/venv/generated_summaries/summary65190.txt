Georgia revised its system by creating a taxpayer-funded public defender system in 2003, and an office to deal just with death penalty cases, which generally undergo greater judicial scrutiny and take longer to work their way through the courts. Another $30 million raised from court fees and fines was diverted by the state legislature to a general fund, creating more budget uncertainty for the defender office. -- Troubling questions over Georgia's controversial death penalty system will remain unresolved for now, after the Supreme Court declined Monday to review an appeal from a death-row inmate who received unwanted help from state prosecutors on his legal representation. The state justices also said Weis was partly to blame for the delays because of his unwillingness to work with his legal team, and should have accepted the public defenders. That case ate up $3 million in state funds, nearly draining the new office's budget.
