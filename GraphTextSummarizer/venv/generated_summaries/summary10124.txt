The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution last week aimed at combating piracy along the Horn of Africa by allowing military forces to chase pirate onto land in cases of "hot pursuit. Among the victims of pirate attacks have been cargo ships, oil tankers and luxury yachts. -- Two Chinese destroyers and a supply ship set sail Friday for the Gulf of Aden on a mission to protect Chinese merchant ships from an increasing number of pirate attacks occurring in the waters off Somalia, state media reported. " The Security Council resolution, which passed unanimously, expands upon existing counter-piracy tools, including a stipulation that would allow for national and regional military forces to chase pirates onto land -- specifically into Somalia, where many of the pirates have their bases. They will will join a multinational naval force already patrolling the area, including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India.
