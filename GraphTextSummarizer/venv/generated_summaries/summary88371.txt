Blackwater lost its contract to guard U.S. staff in Iraq there after Iraq's government refused to renew its operating license. Darby Holladay, a State Department duty officer, said the civil settlement was reached Wednesday for 288 violations between 2003 and 2009, when the company personnel were guarding U.S. staff overseas. " But the violations, he said, "did not involve sensitive technologies or cause known harm to U.S. national security." Also, Holladay said, there were violations "of provisos or limitations on export licenses. Company spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke also said the settlement "will resolve outstanding allegations, continues external compliance oversight, and continues and improves compliance measures.
