READ MORE: Hong Kong press freedom at all-time low Calls for electoral reform The city is also facing an impending showdown with Beijing over electoral reform. Pan-democrat Hong Kongers want the city's general population to be able to nominate and elect its next chief executive, but Hong Kong's pro-Beijing politicians have argued that a small committee should select only candidates who "love China." In February, journalists organized a 6,500-person rally decrying what they said were increasing levels of coercion against Hong Kong press. This year, French-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Hong Kong 61st worldwide in press freedom  â€” a precipitous drop from its 18th place ranking in 2002. Days after the rally, a prominent Hong Kong news editor known for his hard-hitting coverage of China was stabbed by unidentified assailants.
