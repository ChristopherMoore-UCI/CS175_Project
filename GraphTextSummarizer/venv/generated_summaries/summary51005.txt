After jurors left the courtroom, Kennedy friends and family members, including her 85-year-old mother, Ethel Kennedy, applauded. "The dispute is this: Whether the prosecution has proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Kennedy operated her vehicle while she was aware that she had ingested zolpidem and, after becoming aware, she continued intentionally to drive. Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was acquitted in New York on Friday of charges of driving under the influence of a drug. Lefcourt told jurors there's no disputing that Kennedy ingested zolpidem and was "out of it" the morning of the crash. Kennedy said she made cappuccino, had some carrots, prepared bags for the gym and office and had no problem leaving her apartment and getting to her vehicle the morning of the accident.
