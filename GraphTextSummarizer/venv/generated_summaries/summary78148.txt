See copy of court papers and police affidavit Mashburn said that while Nolen was employed at the plant, he made statements "saying he didn't like white people," which prompted Johnson to file a complaint with the plant's human resources department. -- Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder and attempted murder in the beheading of a 54-year-old woman last week at his former workplace in Oklahoma and in the stabbing attack on another woman, said Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn. Nolen was trying "to get revenge on certain people he felt responsible" for his job loss, Mashburn said. The large kitchen knife used in the attack came from Nolen's home, Mashburn said. The FBI is also investigating the attack because Nolen "was saying Arabic terms in the attack," Mashburn said.
