The four-year old was part of a sweep of people tested for the illness because they'd come into close contact with the first reported case in Beijing. Authorities took throat swabs from a group of people connected to 24 poultry farmers in Naidong Village, Cuigezhuang County in Beijing's Chaoyang District, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. The team includes Chinese experts on epidemiology, laboratory tests and clinical treatment, as well as experts and officials from the U.S, the European Union and the WHO, who will "assess the outbreak and the response to guide further the prevention and control measures," WHO spokesman Glenn Thomas told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday. Authorities are monitoring more than 1,000 people who have come into close contact with confirmed cases, but O'Leary stressed "so far there's no evidence of ongoing or sustained human-to-human transition of the virus. Meanwhile, a number of international experts have arrived in China, at the invitation of the Chinese government, to help local health authorities trace the source of the illness, the WHO said.
