-- Liverpool's Spain striker Fernando Torres may miss the struggling English Premier League club's derby clash with city rivals Everton later this month after suffering another injury setback. After their latest defeat, the five-time European champions have picked up only one win from seven league matches, dropping into the relegation zone below Everton on goal difference. Alex may then also miss Chelsea's trip to Aston Villa and the Champions League clash with Russian side Spartak Moscow. "He will have intensive treatment over the next couple of weeks, but it is too early to say if he will be fit for the game against Everton." Meanwhile, Brazil defender Alex will miss the international friendlies against Iran on Thursday and Ukraine on Monday after injuring his thigh in Chelsea's win over Arsenal on Sunday.
