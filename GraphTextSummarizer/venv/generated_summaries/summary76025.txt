-- Philadelphia's Catholic archbishop announced Friday that five priests will not be reinstated following a church investigation into accusations of child sex abuse, though the men have a right to an appeal. Monsignor William Lynn, once a longtime supervisor of Philadelphia priests, is suspected of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children. Dozens of priests were placed on administrative leave after the release of a 2011 grand jury report that blamed the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for failing to prevent the sexual abuse of children. From 1992 until 2004, Lynn was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children. "During that time, dealing with sexual abuse and protecting children has been, and will remain, a top priority for me and for this archdiocese."
