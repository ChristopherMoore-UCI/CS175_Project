Police said Geddy L. Kramer, 19, wounded six people at a FedEx package and delivery facility in Kennesaw, Georgia, on Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself. "First and foremost, our family would like to express our deepest sympathies and condolences to the victims of ... (the) tragedy and their families," Geddy's family wrote in a statement released Tuesday by police in nearby Acworth, where Kramer lived. Three other patients -- a 52-year-old woman, a 22-year-old man and a 38-year-old man -- were listed in stable condition Tuesday evening. The six wounded workers were taken to a hospital, where one of them, a 28-year-old man, was in critical condition Tuesday evening, the hospital said. -- The family of the FedEx worker who police say went on a shooting rampage at his suburban Atlanta workplace before committing suicide has offered its "deepest sympathies and condolences" to the victims.
