After whizzing across the Pacific, the shadow emerged over northern California and southern Oregon, where thousands of people attended parties to watch the event, the first to appear in the United States since 1994. Patrick Wiggins, a NASA ambassador in Salt Lake City, said he always looked forward to seeing people's reactions to such events. Events were held at schools and museums in Japan, while many more people took in the unusual astronomical event at home or on street corners. Aaron Lin, an 8th-grade student from Moraga, California, said a tree in his family's yard had served as unexpected natural viewing device on Sunday. The sun appeared as a thin ring behind the moon to people in a narrow path along the center of the track, which began in southern China.
