Obama pushes for congressional action Obama is seeking congressional approval for possible U.S. military strikes against Syria, although no vote is expected until after lawmakers reconvene from recess on Monday. He said that action against Syria without U.N. Security Council approval would be illegal. Afterward, Obama described the exchange on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Russia as "candid" -- but acknowledged that Putin was unlikely to support his call for military action against Syria. But he said divisions arose over whether military action against Syria must be authorized by the U.N. Security Council, where Russia has blocked action. Obama: 'World cannot stand idly by' "If we are serious about upholding a ban on chemical weapons use, then an international response is required, and that will not come through Security Council action."
