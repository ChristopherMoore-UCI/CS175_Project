The social-networking site has just started surfacing the data about what users are mentioning in public Facebook posts, and CNN producers noticed that "Breaking Bad" came up as a popular subject among Facebook's community over a given 24-hour period. Facebook is abuzz with talk about "Breaking Bad." But "Breaking Bad" seems to be a fan favorite at the Emmys, and many people will be hoping for it to win. Although not a scientifically verifiable indicator in any way, Facebook chatter gives a glimpse into what real people are actually talking about. Facebook is one of the places people go to discuss their lunches, puppies, politics and, yes, the TV shows they love (or love to hate).
