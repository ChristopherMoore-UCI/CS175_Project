Mitchell, a judge from Thomas County, is presiding over the case after Lowndes County Superior Court judges recused themselves from all proceedings involving the Johnsons in order to maintain fairness. A clerk in Mitchell's office referred questions to Lowndes County Clerk Beth Copeland Green, who had not returned messages as of late Tuesday afternoon. The demonstration was planned after Johnson's parents became frustrated with the lack of information they had received from local investigators regarding their son, who was found dead inside a rolled gym mat at his South Georgia high school in January 2013, King said. Johnson's parents, who have been steadfast in their claim that their son's death was no accident, filed a wide-ranging $100 million lawsuit this month, alleging former classmates beat their son to death inside the high school gym. Exactly what happened is unclear, as The Valdosta Daily Times reported that its reporter, a citizen journalist and two television reporters were escorted out of the courtroom by a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office deputy who said she was following State Court Judge Mark Mitchell's order and offered no further explanation.
