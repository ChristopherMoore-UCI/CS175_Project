The 10 episodes of "Bosch" will be available for streaming on Amazon Prime on Friday. The Amazon series centers on Harry Bosch, the fictional LAPD homicide detective who is the hero of Michael Connelly's series of dark crime novels. " Connelly said he oversaw every aspect of the series, hiring the creative team, helping write the scripts and even giving his say on the cast, which includes Titus Welliver, Jamie Hector, Amy Aquino and Lance Reddick. And he said he likes the idea of Harry Bosch "joining the new wave" of streaming series. The series is a bit of a gamble for Amazon and Connelly, but he calls the project a "no-brainer."
