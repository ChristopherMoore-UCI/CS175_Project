I learned more from Justice Ginsburg about opera in our meeting than I had from a lifetime of going to operas again and again. As the oldest justice, Ginsburg's health in particular, and those of her benchmates, has been closely watched by some Washington insiders, since high court vacancies have recently created a high-stakes, politically-charged environment. "In the world we live in today, a world which is increasingly shaped, I should say surreptitiously, by the current (conservative majority) Supreme Court, I would like to see something that would bring to a new generation a biography -- a film or otherwise -- of the life of William O. Douglas," Baldwin told a Washington audience. "I sat down with Justice Ginsburg, and we tried to focus on arias that would work well as a springboard to the discussion," said Martin. "Justice Ginsburg came up with a well-thought out, well-crafted legal solution." "He didn't have to empanel the court-martial on the ship," said Ginsburg.
