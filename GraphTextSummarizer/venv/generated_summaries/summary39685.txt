Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Michael Brown before Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown in August, told remarkably similar stories in an interview with county and federal authorities in August and in testimony to the grand jury in September. Johnson at first said Brown told Wilson he wasn't armed as they tussled at the car and again before the fatal volley of shots. â€¢ Johnson was worried about the police after the theft, but Brown didn't seem fazed, even when Wilson pulled up to them several blocks from the store and told them to "get the f*** on the sidewalk." Wilson pulled off but quickly reversed and tried to exit his car, but  the car door bounced off of Brown and Johnson. Brown and Johnson took off running and Wilson didn't immediately pursue them.
