Hue is, in many ways, a city of ghosts, of memories and spirits -- and we play on that in Sunday's episode. In the weeks following the initial North Vietnamese taking of the city of Hue, many hundreds -- if not thousands -- of citizens, deemed dangerous or counterrevolutionary or otherwise undesirable, were summarily executed and buried in unmarked mass graves by the communist forces. The Vietnamese are largely ancestor worshippers. When the United States Marines and army of South Vietnam retook the city, it was only at the end of brutal, house-to-house fighting and finally, airstrikes, that Hue was retaken -- flattening much of the city in the process. I don't want you to think that this episode of "Parts Unknown" is some kind of a bummer -- a depressing discussion of a war about which there are still strong feelings and disagreements here.
