The incident began around 11:36 a.m. (12:36 p.m. ET), when West Memphis patrolman Bill Evans made a traffic stop on a white minivan traveling eastbound on I-40 at Airport Road, said Bill Sadler, public information officer for the Arkansas State Police. Paudert was the son of Police Chief Bob Paudert, said West Memphis Police Department Assistant Chief Mike Allen. In a statement posted on his website, Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said Paudert and Evans "died upholding their duty to serve and protect the residents of West Memphis." Both wounded officers were taken to Regional Medical Center at Memphis, where they were in critical condition, said hospital spokeswoman Vivian Crawford. -- Two police officers were fatally shot and another two were wounded Thursday in two separate shootings allegedly by the same suspects in West Memphis, Arkansas, police said.
