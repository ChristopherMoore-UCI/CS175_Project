Once youth have mapped their area, they populate the map with data on service delivery such as access to water points, clean water and hygiene facilities. Across the continent, platforms are being developed that enable citizens to use SMS from basic phones to report challenges in service delivery. This is providing a powerful opportunity for citizens to access critical information about their parliaments and to report on human rights violations, corruption and poor service delivery. In Northern Uganda, the brutal Lord's Resistance Army conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, leaving infrastructure and service delivery in dire straits. The team has since produced a whole series of images that breakdown the Nigerian budget by state and sector, enabling citizens to better understand the country's budget and to utilize this information to ensure that allocated funds are translated into improved services.
