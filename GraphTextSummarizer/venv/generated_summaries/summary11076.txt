" Tuesday's test was the first time De Villota had been behind the wheel of the MR01 car, and Booth said Marussia officials are investigating the accident. De Villota was recruited by UK-based Marussia -- formerly known as Virgin Racing -- in March, having driven in Spanish Formula Three, the Euroseries 3000 and the Daytona 24 Hours. "We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving, and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams," team principal John Booth said. -- Maria de Villota has lost her right eye after a crash at a test event, her Formula One team, Marussia, announced Wednesday. The Madrid native is the daughter of former F1 driver Emilio de Villota, who raced between 1976 and 1982.
