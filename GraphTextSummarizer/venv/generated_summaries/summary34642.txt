Although there are hours of bare-knuckle geek brawling to be done over whether Gates and Microsoft or rival Steve Jobs and Apple were the true innovators on early computer interfaces, there's no question as to who succeeded in making software for the masses. For millions of people in the nearly four decades since he co-founded Microsoft, Gates has defined the entire field. They both see things that others don't see, and they're both very demanding." As the years went on, Microsoft products continued to become more ubiquitous -- so much so that the company's seeming stranglehold on the computing world led to monopoly claims and antitrust lawsuits in the late '90s and early 2000s. Whether browsing the Web on Internet Explorer on a PC running Windows or working up a PowerPoint presentation with Microsoft Office before taking a break to game on the Xbox, there are many among us whose entire digital experience have been filtered through products Gates helped create. By making software a money-maker for itself and third-party developers, Microsoft helped retailers sell computers for less, making them accessible to more of the public.
