His penchant for speaking his mind has seen him accuse referee Anders Frisk of consorting with then Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard at half-time during a Champions League tie (the official later retired due to the aftermath, having received death threats). But his most bitter rivalry has been with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. After Manchester United grabbed a late equalizer at home to Sunderland, Ferguson in his post-match press conference proceeded to label referee Alan Wiley unfit in comparison to continental officials. After the match both coaches and players exchanged words before a slice of pizza was allegedly flung into Ferguson's face -- the incident has been referred to as 'Pizzagate' or the 'Battle of the Buffet' ever since. In recent years, Wenger has been involved in touchline confrontations with Tottenham Hotspur counterpart Martin Jol and West Ham's Alan Pardew, and exchanged words with Jose Mourinho.
