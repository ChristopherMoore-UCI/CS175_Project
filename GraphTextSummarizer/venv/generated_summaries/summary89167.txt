-- Ryder Cup hero Graeme McDowell has revealed he will join the U.S. PGA Tour next year, but Europe teammate Lee Westwood insists he will not be switching allegiance. Westwood is paired with Ryder Cup teammate Rory McIlroy for Thursday's opening round at Gleneagles, and the 21-year-old Northern Irishman revealed that he will be cutting back his schedule next year. " But world No. 2 Westwood, who can topple Tiger Woods from the top of the rankings if he finishes first or second at the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland this week, has decided to stay on the European Tour -- which he won last year. "I think they [the PGA Tour] would like me to go and be a member there, but as of Monday evening I became an individual again and I do what's right for Lee Westwood now. " The 37-year-old could end Woods' five-year reign even if he took the next fortnight off, but has decided to defend his Portugal Masters title next week as well.
