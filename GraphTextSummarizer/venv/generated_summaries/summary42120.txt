I volunteer as the chairman of the American Red Cross Southern Region Blood Services board of directors and am a member of the American Red Cross Metropolitan Atlanta Chapter board of directors. I have made it my mission to raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and increase blood collections. I serve as SunTrust Bank Inc.'s corporate champion on the American Red Cross life board. It is not uncommon to experience critical blood shortages in the middle of the summer and during the winter holidays. In these roles, I commit to hosting blood drives throughout the year but most importantly during critical times in late June and December.
