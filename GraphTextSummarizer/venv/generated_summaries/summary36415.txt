In his final year of residency, the memo said, Hasan saw 30 patients in 38 weeks and was required to use elective class time to make up the lost clinic time. " "The faculty has serious concerns about CPT Hasan's professionalism and work ethic," said the memo, signed by Maj. Scott Moran, the residency program's director. Hasan's supervisor at Fort Hood Army Post, Col. Kimberly Kesling, has said that Hasan's evaluations from Walter Reed contained some information that concerned her, but the concerns triggered an approach to integrate Hasan into the staff that she said had been successful. Hasan, still hospitalized in Texas, has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder in the November 5 shooting at Fort Hood. The document said Hasan's remediation on that problem was successful but added that he was placed on administrative probation at the end of the year for not taking and passing the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination.
