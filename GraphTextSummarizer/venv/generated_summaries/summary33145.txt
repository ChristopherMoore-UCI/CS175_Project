In "Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest," actor Michael Rapaport tries out his directorial chops by attempting to document the rise, fall, rise (again) and fall (again) of the seminal New York hip-hop group, achieving mixed results. If your idea of hip-hop is confined to Snoop Dawg, NWA or Public Enemy, then you'll also benefit from spending a little time with Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White, aka A Tribe Called Quest. In the latter, he's seen wearing an LA Lakers uniform, and Q-Tip questions him about his allegiance to his hometown New York Knicks and their new star, Amar'e Stoudemire. It's a complex story involving music, family, history and the greater world of New York hip-hop (which is in and of itself worth of a film), and what it comes down to is that Rapaport had so many directions to choose, so much footage to watch, that the film suffers from the overload. Clearly charismatic and talented men, the four members of Tribe (White left the group for a significant stretch during its heyday but rejoined them for occasional reunion tours) have a lot to say about how they met, how they worked together and how they broke up, but the film never really pieces this together in any sort of narrative that can be closely followed.
