It was there that I found people who were just like me -- game show fans who loved talking about game shows past, present and future. As for me, I don't know what my future in game shows holds, as I haven't been impressed with the programs that have aired in recent years. I've been told that I'm obsessed with game shows. I can't pinpoint the exact date I suddenly got interested in game shows, but family members insist it started while I was a crawling toddler. To me, game shows were the place to go to see magic and happiness occur on a daily basis.
