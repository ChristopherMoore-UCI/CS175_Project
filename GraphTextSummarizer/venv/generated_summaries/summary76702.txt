Like most coastal scientists familiar with the Mississippi River delta, I am convinced that this high spring discharge played an important role in keeping oil from penetrating deep into our marshes during the first full month of the spill. Today, every drop of water that goes down either the Mississippi or the Atchafalaya marches to the orders of the U.S. Army, which traditionally seeks to maintain a constant 70-to-30 percent split -- with the larger amount going to the main-stem Mississippi -- between the two river branches, by adjusting the gates at Old River on a daily basis. We don't know whether it will be tomorrow's high tide or one next week that brings in the next big dollop of oil, but increasing flow down the river past New Orleans sure makes sense right now. Similarly, outflows from both banks of the channel through the gates of the Davis Pond and Caernarvon diversions and other engineered openings have helped to keep oil out of adjacent marshes and in the open bays where it could be collected. The Mississippi divides to create its delta upstream of Baton Rouge at a place called Old River.
