Republican Dan Sullivan has defeated incumbent Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska, CNN projects Wednesday. For most of the contest, polling data showed him trailing Sullivan, leading Republicans to identify the state as an opportunity to gain a Senate seat on the hunt to wrest back control of the upper chamber. Begich, a first-term incumbent, faced off against Sullivan, a first-time candidate originally from Ohio, who sought to nationalize the race by calling the senator a "rubber stamp" for President Barack Obama, who polls poorly in the deeply red state. An updated vote tally from the Alaska Division of Elections has Sullivan leading Begich, 48.6% to 45.4%, as of Wednesday morning. As a senator, Begich voted for Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, which has become a lightning-rod issue in the state and in other competitive races across the country.
