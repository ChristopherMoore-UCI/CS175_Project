The controversial church, based in Topeka, has made its name by staging protests at funerals of people who died of AIDS, gay people, soldiers and even Coretta Scott King. "Today we have joined together to provide some small measure of comfort for families grieving over the lost of a loved one," said Democratic state Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed emergency legislation Tuesday that bars protests within 300 feet of a funeral and within an hour from its beginning or end. " "Protesting or picketing outside the funeral of an innocent victim is despicable," said Republican state House Speaker Kirk Adams. The angel action is part of a larger effort, organized by Chelsea Cohen, a 20-year-old University of Arizona senior, aimed at showing what she said are Tucson's true colors.
