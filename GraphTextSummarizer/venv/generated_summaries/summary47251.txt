Paris was taking part in a world-record attempt for most skydivers changing from one formation to another in a one jump, according to a blog post by the jump's organizing group, World Team. Her main parachute was released too low to the ground for the reserve chute to work, said the group, which calls itself "a highly skilled international team of skydivers and support personnel" on its Facebook page. A German skydiver who was participating in a 222-person jump in Arizona was killed Thursday when her main parachute malfunctioned, officials said. Police in Eloy said Diana Paris, 46, of Berlin, was killed Thursday morning. Paris had more than 1,500 jumps, her husband told police.
