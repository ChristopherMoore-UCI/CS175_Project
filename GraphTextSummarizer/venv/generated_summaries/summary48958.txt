Sherwood Anderson Best known for his collection of short stories, Winesburg, Ohio, and for mentoring such literary heavyweights as Hemingway, Faulkner and Steinbeck, Anderson had a knack for unexpected exits. Charles Dickens reportedly gave Edgar Allan Poe "the bird" idea for famous poem. In 1916, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest civilian appointment, years before the height of her literary career. Flannery O'Connor, author of 32 short stories including "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" and "Everything That Rises Must Converge," developed a love for birds at a very young age. Later, he wound up in New York City, where he penned hundreds of best-selling books for and about young boys, which went on to grace the shelves of homes, schools and church libraries across America.
