The flight was supposed to take passengers to Bear Mountain Lodge off Alaska's Chinitna Bay, about 80 miles southwest of Soldotna, the lodge's co-owner, Mac McGahan, told CNN on Monday. The single-engine de Havilland DHC-3 Otter "struck the runway and burned" around 11:20 a.m. Sunday at the Soldotna Airport, about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage, the Federal Aviation Administration said, citing local law enforcement officials. By the time firefighters and medics arrived, the aircraft was engulfed, Soldotna police said. -- All 10 people aboard an air taxi were killed when it crashed and burst into flames at a small airport on southern Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, authorities said. The company, based in Nikiski, Alaska, was established in 1991, according to Alaska's Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing.
