"I believe wholeheartedly that in terms of human progress, arts education and arts and cultural expression is a key part of how great societies develop," says Kelly. "We are also working with all kinds of urban artists -- hip-hop artists, graffiti artists, parkour, BMX riders -- sort of merging of culture, leisure and art so that young people have a route in [to the arts] via the thing that excites them." Today Kelly, 59, is the artistic director of Britain's beloved cultural institution -- London's Southbank Centre. So far, during her tenure as head of Southbank Centre and a once wayward teen herself -- she has made it her mission to provide a space for young people to express themselves. In 1997 she received the honor of Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to British arts and culture.
