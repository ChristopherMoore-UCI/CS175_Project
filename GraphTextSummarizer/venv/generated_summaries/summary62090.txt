Clinton is followed by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush with 18%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with 14% and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders  with 11%. According to a CNBC survey, Hillary Clinton -- with 31% support -- would be the top choice for people with "investable assets of $1 million or more" if the 2016 election were held today. In 2008 and 2012, Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney had support of most millionaires in their respective elections. What's more, the support of more millionaires has not always been indicative of electoral success. Both went on to lose to President Barack Obama, who had the support of most people with $30 million or more.
