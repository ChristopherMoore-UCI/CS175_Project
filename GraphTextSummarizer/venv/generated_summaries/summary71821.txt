In other words, the study shows that people are quicker to dismiss the suffering of blacks than of whites because black people have historically suffered more challenges like "higher rates of diseases, disability and premature death." Researchers found that participants believed that black people felt less physical pain when subjected to the same injury as white people because blacks "have faced more hardship." If we don't get past the knee jerking defensiveness when discussing race, we will likely be burying more Trayvon Martins. I heard repeatedly the statement from some Zimmerman supporters -- including a radio show host on Monday morning who is far from being a racist -- that "94% of black murder victims were killed by other blacks." So instead of being empathetic to the Martin family -- whose son Trayvon was killed by Zimmerman -- the words discounted the killing by essentially saying that black people kill each other so much so why should we care about this one black kid?
