After the California vandalism, Arkansas also saw last year "multiple attacks on power lines and grid infrastructure that led to millions of dollars in damage and brief power outages," Waxman said. Nonetheless, Wellinghoff is urging Congress to fill a void in federal law that he says doesn't empower any federal agency to demand better security around electrical substations, which he describes as barely protected with a chain-link fence and cameras. PG&E officials said they have redundancies built into their electric grid "that enable us to reroute power around damaged equipment and help keep the lights on for our customers," said spokesman Brian Swanson. "Since the incident occurred, PG&E has worked aggressively with federal and local agencies to improve substation security throughout our system," Swanson said. So far, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, has joined the call for improved security. The matter was addressed at a December hearing of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which Waxman is the ranking member.
