Scientists learned to turn the clock back on skin cells so they're like embryos -- with stem cells that have the same "blank slate" properties like embryonic stem cells -- but without the controversy. Embryonic stem cells come from 4-or 5-day-old fertilized eggs and have the ability to turn into any type of cell in the body. Researchers have developed another source of stem cells: skin cells. Since human embryonic stem cells were first discovered in 1998, researchers have been trying to take these unique cells and coax them into becoming cells for every part of the body, which then could be used to repair damage or regenerate tissue. Embryonic stem cells are the controversial ones because they're harvested from leftover IVF embryos, which are then destroyed in the process.
