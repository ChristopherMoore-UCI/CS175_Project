-- Prince William of Wales slipped a gold ring onto the finger of Catherine Middleton Friday, and the couple vowed to love, comfort, honor and to keep each other in London's biggest royal wedding in three decades. Royal wedding: Hats galore The prince and duchess went inside to a lunchtime reception for 650 people, hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. Buckingham Palace responded that Major was invited not because he was a Tory but because he was appointed guardian of Prince William and his younger brother Prince Harry when their mother Diana died in a car crash in 1997. He's the older son of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales; a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II; a military search-and-rescue helicopter pilot and, by one recent measure, the most popular member of the royal family. The guests included "Mr. Bean" actor Rowan Atkinson, a personal friend of Prince Charles; and former British Prime Minister John Major.
