"This notorious leader of the extremely violent Norte Valle Cartel is where he belongs: behind bars for murder, drug trafficking and racketeering," acting Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a news release. Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez had faced 15 criminal charges, said Montoya's Miami attorney, Bill Clay. "As is often the case in plea agreements, there are concessions and benefits a defendant gets," Clay told CNN. -- A former kingpin for a Colombian drug cartel pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court to charges of drug trafficking, obstruction of justice by murder and racketeering, federal officials said. In one, prosecuted by the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, Montoya admitted to one count of conspiracy to import more than 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder, federal officials said. Montoya is the fourth member of his family to be convicted as part of the Florida case, officials said Tuesday.
