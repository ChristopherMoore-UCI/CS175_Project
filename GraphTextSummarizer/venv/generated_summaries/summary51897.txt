Authorities: Georgia courthouse attacker prepared to inflict mayhem Wild car chase ends with suspect shot to death near U.S. Capitol President's restricted airspace violated three times in less than 24 hours The U.S. Capitol was briefly evacuated Saturday afternoon when a small aircraft entered restricted airspace, authorities said. NORAD says two F-16 fighter jets intercepted the plane around 1:30 p.m. after it entered restricted airspace and was out of communication with air traffic control. The Capitol was briefly cleared and the White House was temporarily locked down when a single-engine plane wandered into restricted airspace in April 2009. A U.S. official told CNN that the pilot's destination was Mount Airy, where he was going to meet his daughter.
