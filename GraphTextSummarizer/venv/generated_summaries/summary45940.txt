Now that U.S. planes are bombing Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, forces in northern Iraq and aid is finally reaching the persecuted religious minorities stranded in the wilderness, Obama's defenders could argue that he's displaying exactly the kind of leadership Clinton accuses him of lacking. (A spokesman for Clinton said Tuesday that Clinton "called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership," according to Politico.) In the absence of any serious Democratic opposition, Hillary Clinton appears to have decided to run against Barack Obama in the 2016 primaries. At the time the interview was conducted, poor Clinton could not have known that events were about to blunt her criticism. "Maliki was willing to accept a deal with U.S. forces if it was worth it to him â€” the problem was that the Obama administration wanted a small force so that it could say it had ended the war," he writes.
