Rodríguez told CNN her pictures would be wrongly used mainly in two ways: An unauthorized picture could be used to lure Internet users to an X-rated site, taking advantage of her popularity in Argentina, or within adult websites that contain pornographic images of other people. " But Raúl Castex, an attorney representing Rodríguez, said search engines have more power to block content than they were willing to admit in court. "Search engines can find, with their own, diligently designed techniques, websites linked to child pornography they normally block," Castex said. Rodríguez says the case goes beyond her reputation and honor. Rodríguez is often mistaken by the media for another model from Argentina by the same name who works in Italy.
