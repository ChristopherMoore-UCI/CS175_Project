Foreign Minister Kim Sung Hwan promised that South Korea and the United States "will show a decisive response" if North Korea moves to "provoke again." "He can continue the model of the past and eventually North Korea will change, because at some point people cannot live under such oppressive conditions -- starving to death, being put into gulags and having their basic human rights denied," she said. -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that North Korea's new leader, Kim Jung Un, "has a choice to make" -- become a "transformative leader" or continue the Communist nation's existing policies, which she predicted would lead to its demise. Referring to Kim Jong Un, Clinton expressed "hope that the new leadership in Pyongyang will live up to its agreements, will not engage in threats and provocations (and) will put the North Korean people first." "Rather than spending money on implements of war, feed your people, provide education and health care, and lift your people out of poverty and isolation," she advised North Korea's new leader. The 29-year-old Kim Jong Un became North Korea's most powerful figure about six months ago, following the death of his father Kim Jong Il.
