Those opposed to Morsy are a broad group, from youth groups and political coalitions to average citizens and Mubarak loyalists keen to return to power. The protests are the latest to wrack the country in what has proved a dramatic, often bloody, two years since the country's 2011 revolution ousted former President Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was appointing minsters and lead figures in the government that are exclusively from the Muslim Brotherhood [Islamist movement backing Morsy that has risen to power since the fall of Mubarak]. The country has been rocked in recent days by protesters demanding the resignation of former President Mohamed Morsy, with demonstrations at times threatening to spiral out of control as the pro- and anti-government sides clash violently, at times fatally, over the country's young democracy. We suffered under military rule in the period following Mubarak's resignation, and I don't want to experience that again.
