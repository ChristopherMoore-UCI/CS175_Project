Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi said parliamentary elections would go ahead as planned Monday, and that he would not allow the military "to be pressured by any individual or entity," state media reported. Ballot boxes will be locked at 7 p.m. Monday and new boxes will be used on Tuesday, Ahmed Al Zind, head of Judicial Club, told reporters Saturday. The high military council decided Friday to extend voting to two days for each stage of the parliamentary elections, scheduled to begin Monday, according to state-run Egypt TV. -- Streets in Egypt's capital remained tense Sunday a day ahead of elections. The elections will also be observed by a delegation from the International Republican Institute as well as a U.S. congressional delegation "to identify and evaluate strengths and weaknesses in Egypt's election system, including campaign regulations, the balloting process, vote tabulation and reporting," the institute said Friday.
