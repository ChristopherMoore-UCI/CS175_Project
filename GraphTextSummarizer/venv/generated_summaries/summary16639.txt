Hezbollah and its pro-Syrian allies now form a majority in Lebanon's Parliament. The Hezbollah domination was seen as a huge comeback for Syria, which, said Singh, has never really accepted Lebanon as a sovereign state and has asserted its influence in Lebanon for years. A United Nations-backed special tribunal issued indictments Thursday for four members of the Shiite militant Hezbollah movement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, said a high-placed source in the Lebanese army. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also made it clear that the group would not tolerate accusations against its own. His death prompted mass protests known as the Cedar Revolution that led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops, in Lebanon for almost three decades.
