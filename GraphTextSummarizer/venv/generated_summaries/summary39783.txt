That's how friends describe Jenny Sanford, the wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who confessed to the nation in a rambling news conference that he was having an affair with a woman in Argentina. Jenny Sanford was more than a visible first lady of South Carolina; she was involved in the finances of her husband's office to an extent that drew heated criticism from his opponents. She is not going to humiliate herself by standing next to a story," said Cyndi Mosteller, a friend of the Sanfords since 1992 and the former first vice chairwoman of the South Carolina GOP. Jenny Sanford, here with her husband, was a Wall Street executive before she married Mark Sanford. " Mosteller's brother-in-law was with Jenny Sanford on Thursday as the e-mails penned to "Maria" became public.
