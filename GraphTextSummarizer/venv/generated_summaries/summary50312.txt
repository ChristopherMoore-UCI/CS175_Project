With Aranda's blessing, Mabe and other school officials enlisted Katarina's teachers to help create a short documentary about Katarina and what it was like living with alopecia. -- Middle schooler Katarina Lucardie didn't expect to see her classmates cry when she decided to show them her big secret. The following week, Katarina came to school with a hat instead of a wig. She sported a medium-length black wig throughout much of elementary school, but after graduating, she approached her mom and said she wanted to stop wearing it in middle school. Mabe had similar concerns that Katarina might get picked on but worked with other teachers and the administration at Skyview Middle School to figure out how to share Katarina's story with the rest of her peers.
