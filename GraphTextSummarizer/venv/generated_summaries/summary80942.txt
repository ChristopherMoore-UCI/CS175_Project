Saturday was debut day for little Bao Bao the panda at the National Zoo in Washington. Bao Bao (pronounced bow-BOW) inspired lengthy lines, but visitors like Becky Moyer and her family said the three-hour drive worth it. A note on the zoo's website says Bao Bao may not always be visible during visiting hours because she and her mother, Mei Xiang, will have access to the privacy of their den, where Bao Bao has spent most of her time until now. Bao Bao means "precious" or "treasure" in Mandarin. At this stage of her life, 5-month-old Bao Bao's hobbies are mainly eating bamboo and lounging.
