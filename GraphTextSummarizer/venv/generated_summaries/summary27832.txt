(The opinion just expressed is solely the opinion of the writer and some very huge men who play center or were protected by centers). I knew the QB shouted audibles -- changed plays on the fly. Nobody said center. He played center for the Ohio State Buckeyes a long time ago. But a guy so determined to play center for the college of his choice that he paid full tuition and tried out for the team as a walk-on.
