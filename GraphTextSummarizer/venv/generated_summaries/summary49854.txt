" Barnett envisions people using Shweeb -- which uses no fuel, no batteries and has no emissions -- for short trips in major urban centers where residential towers are relatively close to central business districts. Lang said he sees light-rail trains and plug-in hybrid vehicles, not Shweeb, as the future of urban transit because they fit existing expectations and institutions. Out of those frequent discussions evolved Barnett's idea for Shweeb, a system of personal, pedal-powered monorail pods that he hopes can one day become an alternative form of urban transit. Barnett's vision received a significant boost last month when Google awarded Shweeb $1 million for research and development. Barnett said the first concern people usually have about Shweeb is that it might be hard work, but he said it's anything but.
