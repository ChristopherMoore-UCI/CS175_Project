RZA, whose real name is Robert Diggs and whose stage name is pronounced "Rizza," also talked about his role in the death of his cousin, Russell Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard or ODB. RZA writes in the book that he once witnessed ODB force his own son to watch him do drugs. RZA beckoned, according to "The Tao of Wu" (Riverhead). The year before the group formed in 1993, RZA was acquitted on an attempted murder charge that could have put him behind bars for eight years, he writes in "The Tao of Wu," out Thursday. If RZA, left, had been jailed or Method Man killed, Wu-Tang may have never formed, RZA says.
