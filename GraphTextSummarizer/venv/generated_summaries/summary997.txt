-- Nine Japanese auto parts manufacturers and two executives have agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $740 million in criminal fines as part of an ongoing price fixing investigation, the Justice Department said on Thursday. Affected parts have included seat belts, radiators, wipers, air conditioning systems, power window motors, and power steering parts, the Justice Department said. The companies in the latest case fixed prices in 30 different car parts sold to the big Detroit automakers and admitted fixing prices on products sold to U.S. subsidiaries of the major Japanese car companies. The overall probe, the largest criminal investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust division, has so far resulted in more than $1.6 billion in fines and criminal convictions of 17 executives. "As a result of these conspiracies, Americans paid more for their cars," Attorney General Eric Holder said.
