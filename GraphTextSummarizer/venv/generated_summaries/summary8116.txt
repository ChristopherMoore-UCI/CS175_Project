The Anglican Communion News Service lists church districts that have women bishops including New Zealand and Polynesia, Australia, Canada, the Episcopal Church, Cuba, Southern Africa, Ireland and South India. Reform, an Anglican evangelical network that has opposed the introduction of women bishops, warned that Lane's appointment would strain relations in the diocese. "We have known since July that the Church of England would seek to appoint women to the episcopate -- against the biblical model of good church leadership," Rod Thomas, chairman of Reform, said in a statement. But most of all I am thankful to God." Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby -- who has backed allowing women to be bishops -- said he was delighted by her selection. Downing Street announced that the Rev. Libby Lane, who was been a priest since 1994, will be the new bishop of Stockport, in northern England.
