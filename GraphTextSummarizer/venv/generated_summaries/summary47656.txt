Scottish auction house Convery, which was involved in both those sales, said it was a new world-record price for a football medal at auction. Convery said the shirt worn by Ball in 1966 -- and subsequently swapped after the match with Stiles -- was sold for £51,755 ($86,000) at the same auction, which attracted worldwide interest from regions including Australia, Chile and the Far East. United paid £188,200 ($297,000) for the 68-year-old's medal, which surpassed the £165,00 (£260,000) paid for the medal owned by Stiles' 1966 teammate Alan Ball in 2005. Stiles played 395 times for United from 1960-71 during a 15-year career that later saw him join Middlesbrough and Preston. Nobby Stiles, a member of England's winning team in 1966, received a total of £424,438 ($669,000) after putting his collection of memorabilia up for sale.
