30 years of AIDS moments to remember When asked about whether a ribbon was enough, the late Rodger McFarlane, executive director of Broadway Cares, who along with Tom Viola of Equity Fights AIDS worked immediately with Visual AIDS to place them in the public, said, "I never want this to seem like anything more than visibility. We always hope any profits were used to benefit services for people living with HIV, or towards research for a vaccine, treatments, and a cure, or for effective prevention campaigns that emphasis harm reduction, treatment access, and universal health care. Signed by Patrick, Tom, and Rodger on behalf of "The Ribbon Project," it explained that "by wearing the red ribbon we demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS; support of the on-going efforts of their caretakers and service organizations; and advocacy for a coordinated response from our government for the research that will lead to effective treatments, vaccines, and ultimately, a cure." And in a series of meetings in April and May of 1991 members of the Visual AIDS Artists' Caucus decided that a piece of grosgrain ribbon, twisted in a simple loop and hand-stitched to a gold safety pin, would be an appropriate icon to show support and compassion for those with AIDS and their caregivers. These New York City artists were compelled to collaboratively create a symbol that was easy to reproduce, that would be cheap, and that would make people think about AIDS.
