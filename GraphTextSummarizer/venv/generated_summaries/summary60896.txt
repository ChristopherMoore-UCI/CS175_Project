The rainbow flag was raised outside City Hall during ceremony Friday, the same day as the Opening Ceremony in Russia. The threat comes amid a raging debate about the raising of the rainbow flag at Toronto's City Hall in support of gay athletes in the Sochi Games. -- Toronto police Friday were investigating a threat against controversial Mayor Rob Ford, a police spokesman said. His problems began in May, when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier, in winter 2012. Ford has ignored calls for him to resign or enter rehab and has said he will run for re-election in October.
