Steve Morrish, managing director of SISHA, said that many orphanages in Cambodia were unregulated and had a financial incentive to increase the number of children they look after as it means they receive more funding from international donors. The Love in Action orphanage in Phnom Penh was raided on Friday by local officials and staff from Australian anti-trafficking group South East Asia Investigations into Social and Humanitarian Activities (SISHA), SISHA said. In interviews, children said they had been physically abused by staff at the orphanage. "They call themselves orphanages but in many cases the children are not orphans. The raid came after two groups of children recently fled from the orphanage and reported that they were beaten and neglected.
