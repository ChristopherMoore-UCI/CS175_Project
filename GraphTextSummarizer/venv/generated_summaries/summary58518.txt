Professional and technical staff recruiters seek out potential job candidates, interviewing and screening them for job openings within the company. Employee benefits planning analysts deal with the company's employee-benefits program, usually creating its health insurance and pension plans. Compensation supervisors oversee the pay practice area of compensation, including wage, salary, incentive and executive compensation.
