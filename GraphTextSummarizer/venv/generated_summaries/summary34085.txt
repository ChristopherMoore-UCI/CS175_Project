"A lot of the locals here believe that the tall mountains on the Big Island shield them from hurricanes, but in 24 hours this theory could be proven wrong." Customers formed lines from the front to the back of a Cost-U-Less store on Tuesday, clearing shelves of bottled water and stocking up on other supplies. There's Hurricane Iselle, which looks like it will smack into the Big Island on Thursday night, and the less threatening Hurricane Julio, due a few days later. "Tropical storm conditions are expected on the Big Island of Hawaii Thursday, with hurricane conditions expected Thursday night," the center advised. Island Air will do the same for passengers ticketed from Thursday though Tuesday. Delta said it would waive fees for reservation changes for Thursday and Friday, but fare increases could apply.
