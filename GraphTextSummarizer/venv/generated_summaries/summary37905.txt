Myers had been wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet since a June arrest for unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest. The day after Michael Brown was killed by a police officer, Syreeta Myers drove from her South City home to the northwest suburb of Ferguson. The officer was in his car and chased Myers and the two others because he thought one of them had a handgun, police said. He tussled with Myers, police said, and then Myers fired three shots at the officer. Myers may not be a Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown or any of the others on the list of slain, unarmed black men in America.
