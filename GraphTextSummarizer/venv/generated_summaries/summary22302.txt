" A team of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors landed in Syria this week to begin probing chemical weapons allegations, and the U.N. Security Council planned a meeting on Wednesday to address the issue. -- The Obama administration is likely to come under new pressure to take more decisive steps in Syria following opposition claims that Bashar al-Assad's government used chemical weapons to kill more than 1,000 people. This is the second time the administration has faced questions about chemical weapons use in Syria. And we are hopeful that the Assad regime will follow through on what they have claimed previously, that they are interested in a credible investigation that gets to the bottom of reports that chemical weapons have been used," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. According to experts who have traveled to Syria during the war, opposition groups have little faith in the United States.
