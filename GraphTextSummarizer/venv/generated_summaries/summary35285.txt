-- Rumors that Apple is preparing major design changes with iOS 7 continue to heat up, with new reports suggesting a more muted and flat design aesthetic. According to 9to5 Mac's sources, many of the textures currently present in iOS â€” linen on the notifications panel and leather in the calendar app â€” will be replaced with flat black and white colors. While we previously heard rumors that Ive was planning a broad UI (user interface) overhaul with iOS 7, we didn't have many specific details. By most accounts, Ive is not a fan of the skeuomorphic heavy design cues that currently dominate iOS. The report suggests that all apps will share a similar white base each with its own unique color scheme.
