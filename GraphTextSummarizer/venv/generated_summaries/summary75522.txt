The statement was made in the presence of an FBI agent, who was in the room during the visit under special restrictions, according to documents filed in federal court in Boston on Friday. -- Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev made a "statement to his detriment" during a prison visit by his sister, federal prosecutors said in a court document. The defense motion claims the SAMs "impose extraordinary and severe restrictions impairing the ability of defense counsel to provide competent representation." Tsarnaev, 20, is being held without bail on federal charges in connection with the April 15 bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 250 others. The government said the FBI agent was in "a legally obtained vantage point making his ability to see and hear all which occurred lawful." Authorities allege Tsarnaev, a Chechnya-born American, and his brother, Tamerlan, planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon before allegedly killing a police officer three days later. Federal prosecutors said last month they'll seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in "an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner."
