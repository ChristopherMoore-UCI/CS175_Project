Why Iraq War was fought for oil Article 1 makes clear that the main purpose of the U.N. is to "maintain international peace and security and to that end to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace" and to act in accordance with justice and the principles of international law. I believe George W. Bush and Tony Blair should be tried for war crimes as defined by international law. The whole episode regarding the Iraq War is a tawdry tale that has subverted the rule of law and tarnished the reputation of international law. This argument, which was false, became the main basis for invasion because the only other route to war had been closed off by international law. Four transgressions were agreed -- war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression.
