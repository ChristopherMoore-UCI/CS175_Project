In addition to Bay, "Turtles" screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec are also returning to write the sequel. Bay played that part in Friday's "Turtles," which earned $65 million at the weekend box office and debuted at No. 1. It isn't clear whether "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" director Jonathan Liebesman will be back as well. According to reports, Paramount has scheduled a "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" sequel for 2016, with Michael Bay once again serving as producer. In a statement, Paramount Film Group President Adam Goodman said that "launching a new take on the 'Turtles' into the feature film world was a daunting task," but the enthusiastic response from moviegoers has left the studio feeling positive as they approach another installment.
