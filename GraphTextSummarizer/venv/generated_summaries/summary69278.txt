This recent drop in gas prices makes the point even more starkly: Gas prices and U.S. drilling have little to do with each other. Despite record U.S. oil production, crude prices began 2012 with record prices around the nation and softened sharply this month. Statistical analysis shows that more oil production in the United States does not mean lower prices at the pump. And luckily, after months of sky-high gas prices at the pump, they will find lower gas prices. Instead of policies that increase our addiction to oil, we need policies that increase our transportation choices, not limit them to oil and gas.
