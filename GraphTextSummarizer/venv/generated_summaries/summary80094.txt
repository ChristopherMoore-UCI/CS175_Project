The health of a tech giant's CEO may bear extra scrutiny at a time Silicon Valley is still recovering from the death last fall of Apple chief Steve Jobs. -- Google will kick off its annual I/O developers' conference Wednesday in San Francisco, but CEO Larry Page won't be speaking there. "Not being able to speak hardly puts someone on the same path as Steve Jobs, nor does it keep him from making key decisions or pointing his company in the right direction. This means he can't do any public speaking engagements for the time being, including today's shareholder meeting, I/O next week and our earnings call in mid July. Left to explain Page's unexpected absence at the shareholder's meeting, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told attendees that Page had "lost his voice" and "can't do any public speaking engagements for the time being."
