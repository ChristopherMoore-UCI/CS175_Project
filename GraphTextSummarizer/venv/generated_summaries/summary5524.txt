Libya's state-run news agency, LANA, reported that masked gunmen in a car with tinted windows opened fire and killed Greub, who headed the Red Cross' unit based about 150 miles (245 kilometers) away in Misrata. A Red Cross official who had worked in Iraq, Sudan, Yemen and Gaza was shot dead Wednesday in Libya, the organization said. The Red Cross has had a permanent presence in Libya since 2011, working with the Libyan Red Crescent to administer first aid and help those injured or displaced by violence. "Michael was a devoted humanitarian who spent many years of his life helping others." Gunmen attacked the vehicle of Michael Greub, 42, around midday as he left a meeting with two colleagues in the Mediterranean Sea city of Sirte, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
