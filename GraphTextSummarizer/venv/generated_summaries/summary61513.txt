That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends discouraging screen time for children younger than 2 and setting limits on time and content for older children. Adding to the confusion is the ubiquitous and persuasive marketing of screen products as educational for young children -- even for babies -- and that digital media are a often a surefire way for overstressed parents to keep their children occupied. Time with screens takes them away from those crucial activities. Limited time with quality screen media and technology can be educational for preschoolers. As a psychologist and director of an advocacy organization focused on children and families, I frequently speak to parents about the impact of media and technology on young children.
