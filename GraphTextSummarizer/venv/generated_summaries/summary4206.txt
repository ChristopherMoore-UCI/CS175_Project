According to NASA, it will float about 120,000 feet above Earth to observe the comet -- and other science targets -- using a telescope and other instruments. For those who want to try to track Comet ISON themselves, NASA has some tips on its Comet ISON website. "It's possible that water and organic chemicals on comets may have played an important role in the evolution of life on Earth." Comet enthusiasts hope they will be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes. The space agency plans to launch a balloon -- yes, a balloon -- to study Comet ISON, the much-hyped comet that many hope will put on a big sky show in coming months.
