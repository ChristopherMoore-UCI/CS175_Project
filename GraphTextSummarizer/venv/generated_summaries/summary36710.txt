Although prosecutors are often accused of controlling grand jury proceedings, the institution was actually created by the Founding Fathers to provide a wall of citizen protection against overzealous prosecutors. In most states, the grand jury sits for a month or more, hearing snippets of many cases each day. In such cases, a wise prosecutor will present as much evidence as possible, revealing both sides of the case. The colonists were tired of their British overlords' abuse of law enforcement and were intent on making sure that ordinary citizens would have to approve indictments in any federal criminal case in the newly minted American democracy. Make no mistake though, grand jurors often rebel and proceed on their own independent course.
