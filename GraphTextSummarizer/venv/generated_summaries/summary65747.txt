Google on Wednesday announced Knowledge Graph, a significant change to how search results are delivered that the company believes will make their search engine think more like a human. So, in the above example, boxes will appear with separate results for the hockey team, basketball team and TV show. "The web pages we [currently] return for the search 'kings,' they're all good," Jack Menzel, director of product management at Google, told CNN in an interview. Menzel says the initial version of Knowledge Graph has information on 500 million people, places and things and uses 3.5 billion defining attributes and connections to create categories for them. With Knowledge Graph, which will begin rolling out to some users immediately, results will be arranged according to categories with which the search term has been associated.
