Gibson's bitter child custody battle with former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva ended last year with a court settlement, but not before the actor entered a "no contest" plea to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to a 2010 incident involving Grigorieva. At one point, Gibson wrote Eszterhas a note apologizing for one of his outbursts, saying, "I have a vast reservoir of rage-filled puss that from time to time spills out" and that "the devil seems to afflict me thru anger and my tongue," Eszterhas says. In discussing Jewish people, Gibson regularly used the terms "Hebes," "oven-dodgers," and "Jew-boys," Eszterhas alleges. Gibson's letter says Eszterhas "only had a problem with me after Warner Brothers rejected your (Eszterhas') script. Gibson once told the 15-year-old that he wanted to perform a sex act on Grigorieva and "stab her to death while I'm doing it," Eszterhas alleges.
