It's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport. Graeme Le Saux: The culture of football back in the 80s was very different, something I found very hard to relate to and subsequently I found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people. There may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment. It used to baffle me when I first started playing that you'd have Chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the Chelsea's team. But sometimes I think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual.
