If Cato's board members truly care about the institute's future, they should demand that Crane and Levy stop this scorched-earth public relations fight, which is weakening the organization and harming its reputation, and force immediate negotiations. Charles and David Koch were willing to keep the 2011 Cato board in place without making any changes, but Crane and Levy demanded an immediate vote on directors. Crane and Levy do not want this because, with the recent death of one of Cato's shareholders, they are concerned that they will lose control of Cato. It is Crane and Levy's concern about their control of Cato, rather than concern for the good of the organization, that is driving the dispute. I currently serve on the board of Cato, and have worked with libertarian organizations for more than 20 years, including Mercatus Center and the Institute for Humane Studies.
