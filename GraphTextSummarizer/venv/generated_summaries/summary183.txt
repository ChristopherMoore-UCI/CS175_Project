This weekend, Jesse Anderson wrote on his blog that a computerized simulation of the theoretical simian typing pool has completed "A Lover's Complaint," a narrative poem that appeared in a book of The Bard's sonnets. When a chunk of text matches a word used in Shakespeare's catalogue, it gets crossed off of a database of the plays and poems. "This is the first time a work of Shakespeare has actually been randomly reproduced," Anderson wrote. "The monkeys will continue typing away until every work of Shakespeare is randomly created," Anderson wrote. Based on a page updating the project's progress, several more works might be checked off the list soon.
