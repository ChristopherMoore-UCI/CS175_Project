Puerto Ricans have a higher rate of alcohol abuse than other Latinos, says Dr. Raul Caetano, who has studied alcohol abuse in minority groups for the University of Texas. " While liver disease results from long-term abuse, Arroyo said, not enough research has been done as to whether higher rates of hepatitis C and fatty liver disease among Latinos weaken the liver and increase the rates of cirrhosis. Some of the problem may begin on the island and get worse as Puerto Ricans move stateside, says Hector Diaz, who co-authored a 2005 book on alcohol abuse among Puerto Ricans. Alcohol abuse is often a disease that can hide in plain sight in Latino communities, says Judith Arroyo, who studies minority health disparities for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Im describes cirrhosis as a particularly cruel disease because it's caused by scarring in the liver as it's trying to regenerate and maintain its function against the onslaught of abuse.
