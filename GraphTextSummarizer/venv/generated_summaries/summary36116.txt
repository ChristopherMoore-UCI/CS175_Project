Chinese media accounts on documents approved during the plenum signal significant changes: Prickly issues China's top leaders have been deliberating these prickly issues for years, but decisions have been put off for lack of consensus or political will. Xi is expected to play a leading role in the two groups, even though Premier Li Keqiang may head the economic reform commission. The most significant endorsement came from Wu Jinglian, the octogenarian guru of the Deng's reform program who also served as doctoral degree adviser of Premier Li Keqiang at Peking University. Speaking in Beijing this week, Wu said the system set up by China in 1978 when China embarked on reform and opening was "the initial primary-stage version of market economy for the late 21st century, which still took on many vestiges of the old system. Still, unless and until there is fundamental political reform, China will remain a nation more dependent on the power of a single leader, a charismatic strongman, than on institutions.
