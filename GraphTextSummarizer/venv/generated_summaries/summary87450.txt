Reed had been arrested in the death of an Indian County business owner, WPBF said In Ohio, Reed faces charges of receiving stolen property, failure to comply with a police officer, carrying a concealed weapon and having a weapon under disability, according to Cincinnati affiliate WLWT and Warren County's website. According to Indian County Sheriff Deryl Loar, Reed was arrested after the chase ended in a crash in Warren County, north of Cincinnati. Rondell Reed, 52, escaped with his cellmate, Leviticus Taylor, Monday from the Indian County Jail, officials said. Loar said corrections deputies performed hourly checks of Reed and Taylor in their cells, but items they used to create dummies gave the appearance that they were tucked in their sheets when in fact they were making their getaway, WPBF reported. Taylor, 25, who was quickly captured, was convicted of murder last month, according to CNN West Palm Beach affiliate WPBF.
