-- World champion Jenson Button returned to form after his third lap retirement at the Monaco Grand Prix, by leading opening practice ahead of Sunday's Turkish Grand Prix at Istanbul Park. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso came home fifth fastest -- half-a-second off the pace -- while the Mercedes duo of Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher were sixth and seventh respectively, followed by the Renaults of Robert Kubica and Vitaly Petrov. Hamilton could not repeat his time in the afternoon, finishing fourth quickest after the Red Bulls of Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel -- who currently share the lead in the world drivers' championship. Button, who is aiming for his third race victory of the season, clocked one minute 28.28 seconds beating the morning time of McLaren teammate and fellow-Briton Lewis Hamilton. "There is still more to come, which is always the case after a Friday," Button told the official Formula One Web site.
