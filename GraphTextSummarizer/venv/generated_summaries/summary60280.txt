Trips to both locations were about a 25-minute drive from our Sedona hotel. Grand Canyon to Sedona (119 miles): The diverse landscape during our southbound road trip between the Grand Canyon's South Rim and Sedona kept us busy with our cameras. (As are many girls trips!) I selected a package called New Beginnings, where I received a psychic reading, followed by a one-hour massage. Sedona is filled with art galleries, boutiques, New Age metaphysical shops, antiques and even an outdoor shopping mall. Sedona area Sedona's main attraction is no doubt its stunning array of red sandstone formations, enveloped in the area's celebrated spiritual energy.
