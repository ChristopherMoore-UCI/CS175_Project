School officials say AMIkids operates 56 facilities across the nation and works with local school districts to educate students who have been expelled or suspended from schools elsewhere. "It is a tragedy for us," said school Vice President Shawna Vercher. Teachers at AMIkids schools are trained in crisis control, officials said. The incident occurred Thursday morning inside the front door of the city's AMIkids Infinity School and prompted authorities to rush the teens to a nearby hospital, according to police spokesman Mike Sullivan. The process, which includes the use of an electronic wand to screen entrants, takes place between the first and second set of school doors.
