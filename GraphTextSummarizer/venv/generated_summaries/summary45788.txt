White House threatens vetoes on eve of meeting with lawmakers Ten Democrats and one independent joined all of the chamber's Republicans in backing the bill -- suggesting there are enough votes to approve it, a major milestone for a bill that had cleared the House but stalled in the Senate in previous years. "But we're going to the floor with an open amendment process, trying to foster more bipartisanship ... so that we can pass this measure and other measures and either override the veto or attach the bill to other legislation that will get 67 votes." The Keystone bill's sponsor, Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, told "Fox News Sunday" this weekend that he hopes the amendment process will attract more Democratic supporters to the bill. The Senate is likely to consider amendments to the bill this week and next week, with a final vote coming sometime around Obama's State of the Union speech. But the pipeline's supporters will need 67 votes -- a two-thirds majority -- to override an Obama veto.
