Transportation for people who hate walking Shiny, futuristic smart cars were on display from big companies such as Audi, Toyota and Ford. There were plenty of generic 5-inch smartphones, cheap tablets and ginormous televisions, as well as prototypes of fun, futuristic technology like the 20-inch 4K tablet from Panasonic or the self-driving car from Audi. Overhyped pricey TVs Televisions are the biggest product category at the Consumer Electronics Show, with major companies such as Samsung, Sharp, Sony and Panasonic using the occasion to launch their latest and greatest screens. The big hardware feature pushed at last week's show was the Ultra High-Definition 4K screen, which offers a crisper picture than traditional HD displays. Some big companies introduced cool audio products, but the big trend continued to be celebrity-endorsed headphones.
