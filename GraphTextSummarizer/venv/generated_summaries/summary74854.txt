In that regard, should the criteria to halt flights be different for Ben Gurion Airport than it is for Cairo International Airport? In light of the now-lifted FAA ban on flights into Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, it seems that the resources available will have to include intelligence on airborne hostile activity. Checking the weather display for our departure from JFK Airport in New York to London's Heathrow Airport, an awkward blob of green, yellow, and red is sprawled diagonally across most of the New England coastline. and I have to incorporate missile threats into pre-flight planning. One rocket is launched from Gaza and lands within a mile of Ben Gurion Airport.
