-- The Israel Defense Forces arrested two people it identified as responsible for the massacre of an Israeli family in the West Bank settlement of Itamar, officials said Sunday. "For the country, the fact that we promised and carried out the promise is witness to the fact that no such murder will ever leave our daily agenda," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. "The murders of five family members including a 3-month (old) baby constitute a crossing of all red lines," Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich said. The two suspects, Amjad Awad. 19. and Hakim Awad, 28, were caught in the nearby Palestinian village of Awarta, Israeli General Security Services said. The pair are accused of killing Udi and Ruth Fogel and three of their children last month.
