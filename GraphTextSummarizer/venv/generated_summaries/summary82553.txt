" Salad girl to White House chef Feeding the U.S. president is a long way from Comerford's first job working as a "salad girl" in Chicago hotels -- then a 23-year-old newly-arrived to the U.S. Her older brother Juanito Pasia remembers driving her to-and-from work at the Sheraton hotel near O'Hare Airport in his blue Ford van, where she would make caesar and cob salads. Then in 1995, White House chef Walter Scheib recruited Comerford to work under the Clinton administration. "We still cook American food at its finest -- American regional cuisine and American products," said Comerford. It was one of the biggest events Comerford has hosted in her 19 years at the White House, and all the food that can be, is prepared two days in advance The menu however, is a delicate document requiring weeks of research into different guests dietary requirements, before it is given to the First Lady for approval. " While foul-mouthed celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White have made a name for themselves as the genius "enfant terribles" of the culinary world -- serving up incomparable food with dollops of expletives -- Comerford takes a different approach.
