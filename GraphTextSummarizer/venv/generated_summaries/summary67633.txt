Shimizu pointed the finger at the national government, saying Tokyo's leaders just want to get the town to accept radiation-contaminated debris on an interim basis, without offering any long-term plan to manage all the evacuees. After the wife reported him missing, officers and volunteer firefighters in the town of Namie organized a search, police said. While no deaths have been directly attributed to the nuclear disaster, the resulting release of radioactivity forced residents of several towns near the plant to flee their homes, and a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) zone around the plant remains closed to the public. The death is yet another sad reminder how the March 11, 2011, disaster in Japan continues to claim victims. He said he knew of four or five people in Namie who had committed suicide and more than 100 who had died of illness during the evacuation.
