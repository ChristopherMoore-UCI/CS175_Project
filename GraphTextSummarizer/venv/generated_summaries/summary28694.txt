In France, Strauss-Kahn is among a number of people charged with aggravated pimping in an investigation into sex parties at the Hotel Carlton, in the northern city of Lille. The appointment will be announced next week, an official in the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister's Office told CNN. CNN affiliate BFM-TV said a trial was likely to be held next year. The 64-year-old told CNN he sometimes gives advice for free to less economically developed countries and had recently been working with the government of South Sudan. "The exact details still have to be worked out, but we will have more information on Tuesday," the official said.
