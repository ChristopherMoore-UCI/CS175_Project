"She told the probation officer that she intended to do well on probation," Plessinger said of Anthony. This backed up a ruling earlier this month by Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr., who said Strickland's verbal order was binding and ordered Anthony to report for probation in Florida on the bad-check charge by Friday. Anthony previously had been sentenced to one year of probation, which including monthly check-in meetings plus "random contacts" in the public. Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland had earlier ordered Anthony to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter, but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed, instructing that Anthony would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial. But Anthony's lawyers contended that she couldn't be required to serve probation, arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from Strickland.
