This weekend, the film notched yet another impressive achievement: it climbed to number one with an estimated $12.4 million (a 25 percent drop) in its third frame, becoming the first film since "True Grit" to hop to first place in its third weekend. Gerard Butler's new surfing drama "Chasing Mavericks," meanwhile, tanked in twelfth place with $2.2 million from 2,006 theaters, giving it a $1,099 per theater average. The pricey novel adaptation "Cloud Atlas" finished in third place with a weak $9.4 million. Though it is running a tad behind Affleck's last directorial effort, The Town, which had earned $64.1 million at the same point in its run en route to a $92.2 million finish, Argo is enjoying much better week-to-week holds. After debuting at number two with $19.5 million, Warner Bros.' Oscar contender dropped by just 16 percent last weekend to $16.4 million.
