CNN and other media outlets cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because Syria has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, has said about 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown on opposition last March. Syria says results will be available Monday from its referendum on changes to the country's constitution, a vote taken as government troops continued pounding the opposition stronghold of Homs and other cities. Al-Assad's family has ruled Syria for four decades. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the president is using the referendum "to get people to leave the streets" after a nearly year-long uprising.
