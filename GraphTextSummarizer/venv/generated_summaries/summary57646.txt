Nash filed a claim in November 2009, seeking permission to sue Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for damages, Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr. said in a memorandum of decision. The attack left Nash without a nose, eyelids, lips or hands, said attorney Matthew Newman. Family spokesman Ara Chekmayan said: "We feel that the state Department of Environmental Protection failed to protect Charla from a known danger and today she has been denied the right to seek compensation for the catastrophic and irreversible damage inflicted upon her. "Our only option is to ask the Connecticut General Assembly to review the claim commissioner's decision," Newman said. Two years after the attack, Nash became the third person to receive a full face transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
