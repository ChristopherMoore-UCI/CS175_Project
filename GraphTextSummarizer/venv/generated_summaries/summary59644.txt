There were also sentry dogs who guarded bases, tracker dogs who followed the trail of enemies and mine and booby trap dogs who sniffed out dangers hidden beneath the ground. Later, galvanized by the attention earned through the documentary, Vietnam War dog handlers began to call for change. Back then, dogs sent abroad were retrained and returned to civilian life, but that practice had changed by the time U.S. forces entered Vietnam, Lemish said. Dogs have long served with the U.S. military, said Lemish, who also wrote "War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism." The American K-9 corps, Lemish said, really began during World War II, when, among other tasks, thousands of dogs donated by civilians patrolled shorelines.
