The blaze was one in a string of 11 fires in east Texas churches this year. Another string of suspicious church fires took place in the 1990s and led to the enactment of the 1996 Church Arson Prevention Act, which provided funding for investigations and assistance to congregations. A similar string of church arsons occurred in 2006 in rural communities outside of Birmingham, Alabama. At Russell Memorial, meanwhile, church members are counting their blessings in the face of tragedy. Eight have been ruled arson, leaving residents and churches on edge as authorities work to find the person -- or persons -- responsible.
