(Evan went into the engineering program at the University of Virginia, and Eric chose pre-med/medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University.) Life-threatening allergies were much less common when we went to school, so we really stood out as the "strange twins with allergies" -- those guys who had to sit at a separate table by themselves at lunchtime. The idea to develop a new epinephrine auto-injector (commonly known as an EpiPen), specifically designed for the needs of patients like us, came about the summer after we graduated high school. We are fortunate to work with a team of industry veterans who are just as committed to patients as we are. -- As young children, the stress and burden of our life-threatening allergies to a range of common foods, including nuts, seafood, shellfish, eggs and other substances, really fell on our parents more than us.
