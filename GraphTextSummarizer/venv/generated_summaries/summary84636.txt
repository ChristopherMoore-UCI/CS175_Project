More than 900,000 people have access to safe drinking water, but that still falls short of the goal of providing water to 1.1 million. As thousands of Haitians gathered in the center of Port-au-Prince to remember what was lost that day, Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF, spoke to CNN's "American Morning" about the situation. Kathleen Strottman, executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, estimates that there were more than 900 orphans in the process of being adopted into American homes when the quake struck. Bottom line: One month after the most devastating earthquake in Haiti's history, the available numbers show a nation with great needs. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that more than 400 agencies were registered with the Haitian government to do work in Haiti before the quake.
