" House Republican aides recognize that there will be increased pressure on Boehner and other GOP leaders to force a standoff with the president at the end of September over funding for his signature health care law. "We've got a strategy," Boehner told House Republicans at their last meeting before the summer break, according to another GOP source in the meeting, adding that the Republican effort over July to delay key provisions of Obamacare has "arguably been the most important moment in the three years since the law was signed." "The best and last chance for House Republicans to stand up and thwart this law before its new entitlements kick in is during the upcoming funding debate, and the House should live up to the moment and pass a bill funding the government but denying any funding for Obamacare," the letter states. Opinion: Explain Obamacare at last Boehner promised his colleagues more of those votes though he didn't specifically comment on the push to strip Obamacare funding as part of any stopgap spending bill. These describe the plan to hold more Obamacare votes designed to pick off Democratic support for the law, step up oversight about the administration's implementation of the law and ramp up communications efforts around the issue.
