The Pakistani army has been conducting a ground offensive aimed at clearing out Taliban and other militants in the loosely governed tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan. The military's statement didn't specify whether any of those killed were Taliban members or say whether the ambush was linked to Tuesday's deadly attack by the group on a school in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Dozens of militants were killed in crackdowns across Pakistan on Friday, officials said, days after the Pakistani Taliban massacred nearly 150 people at a school. They also said it was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen and their children during a recent offensive by Pakistan's military. The Pakistani Taliban, which has close ties with its namesake in Afghanistan, has long taken credit for an extensive list of assaults on civilians and security forces in Pakistan.
