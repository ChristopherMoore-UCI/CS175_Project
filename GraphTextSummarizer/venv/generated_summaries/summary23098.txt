"This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside," Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN last week. Because of the location of the incident, Sahd said, there was little risk to employees. The waste generally consists of clothing, tools, equipment, sludge, soil or other materials contaminated with man-made radioactive elements that are heavier than uranium. An alarm late on February 14 indicated higher than usual levels of airborne radiation and led to a first-of-its-kind response since the nuclear disposal facility began accepting waste in 1999. He said the facility's ventilation system, which monitors air quality, automatically switched to "filtration mode" when the leak was discovered.
