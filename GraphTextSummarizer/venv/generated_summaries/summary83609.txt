"The FBI both misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press and created a situation where our credibility could have been undermined on a large scale," AP General Counsel Karen Kaiser wrote. However, AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll slammed the agency's tactics, according to an AP report. Comey's letter said the methods used in the case were "proper and appropriate" under Justice Department and FBI guidelines at the time -- but acknowledged that higher approval levels would probably be needed for the use of such a technique today. The AP also asked for policies to ensure the department does not impersonate other news organizations in the future. "This latest revelation of how the FBI misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press doubles our concern and outrage, expressed earlier to Attorney General Eric Holder, about how the agency's unacceptable tactics undermine AP and the vital distinction between the government and the press," Carroll said in a statement.
