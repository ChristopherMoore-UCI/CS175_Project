In a pre-emptive move, West Virginia state Rep. Gary G. Howell introduced legislation Friday that would amend existing laws against texting while driving to prohibit "using a wearable computer with head mounted display." If passed, the law would make West Virginia the first U.S. state to ban motorists from wearing Google Glass while driving, a Google spokesman said. Google Glass has generated a lot of buzz in tech circles and beyond, with many wondering aloud about its practical applications, potential privacy concerns and its promise, for better or worse, of constant connectedness. Asked about the proposed West Virginia law, a Google spokesman sent the following statement: "We are putting a lot of thought into the design of Glass because new technologies always raise new issues. " For example, Google has said its Glass headset could offer turn-by-turn navigation, with voice commands, to enhance the driving experience.
