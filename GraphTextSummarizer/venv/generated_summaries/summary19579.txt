Airlines regularly make errors resulting in mispriced fares being issued, sometimes honoring them but often not. "I've been on a lot of crazy mistake fares in the past that did work out, the airlines did honor them," said Kelly, who recounts how he recently flew round trips from New York to Stockholm and Copenhagen on three consecutive weekends for $138 a trip. Kelly said he was optimistic that although the fares were clearly issued in error, United would be required to honor the tickets following a recent ruling on "mistake fares" by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Airline responses to pricing mistakes are unpredictable. But he also knew from first-hand experience that "error fares" -- rock-bottom fares mistakenly issued by carriers -- can sometimes be recognized as good for travel by airlines.
