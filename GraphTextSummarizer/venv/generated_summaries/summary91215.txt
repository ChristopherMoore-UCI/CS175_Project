Overall, this entire camera experience is a lot snappier than photo features on the iPhone and Android devices. Oh, yeah -- and just like the iPhone, there's no support for Adobe Flash on Windows Phone 7 (yet), so Hulu junkies won't be thrilled. WIRED Gorgeous tile-based UI laced with large, smooth text doesn't rip off the iPhone's app interface. The e-mail app in general looks great: Facebook integration comes into play here, too, so when you load an e-mail it's accompanied with the sender's Facebook portrait as well. Provides a rich dose of social savvy thanks to tight Facebook integration.
