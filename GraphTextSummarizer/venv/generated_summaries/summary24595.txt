"He's so meticulous," author Max Brooks said of "Recorded Attacks" illustrator Ibraim Roberson: "The Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks," the latest in the series of zombie chronicles by author Max Brooks, is a graphic novel that looks at the undead menace throughout history. "It's never a bad thing to put zombies and ninjas together," said Brooks, whose father is comedy legend Mel Brooks. Next up for Brooks, he said, is a writing project he deems "top secret" and a comic-book mini-series for IDW Publishing detailing the classic comic/action figure characters of "G.I. Joe. "They're up-close and personal stories for G.I. Joe and Cobra characters." " And in a move sure to please genre fans -- Brooks might say "genre nerds" -- there's even a scrap in feudal Japan between zombies and ninjas.
