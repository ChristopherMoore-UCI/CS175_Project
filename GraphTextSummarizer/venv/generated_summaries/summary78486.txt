-- Fighting between Kurdish rebels and government troops in southeastern Turkey left more than two dozen dead Tuesday, according to reports from officials and a news agency. Recently, there has been movement on restarting a peace process, with the head of Turkey's leading opposition party signaling his willingness to work toward a resolution with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan recently announced that students could elect to take Kurdish language lessons under a new educational reform package. Leyla Zana, a leading Kurdish politician and a member of the opposition Kurdish BDP, told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet last week that she hopes that Erdogan will act to solve the Kurdish issue, saying that "he is powerful enough to do so." Eight more rebels died in a counterattack by Turkish forces, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
