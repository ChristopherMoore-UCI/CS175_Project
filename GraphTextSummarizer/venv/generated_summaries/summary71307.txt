Salaita believed the principles of academic freedom "would permit him to share his views without fear of censure or reprisal," said Azmy. But on August 1, 2014, Salaita received a letter from Chancellor Dr. Phyllis Wise terminating the appointment. In October 2013, the university offered Salaita a tenured position in the American Indian Studies program, which Salaita accepted, according to Azmy. By then, Azmy said, Salaita had resigned from his tenured position at Virginia Tech, rented his home in Virginia and was preparing to move his family to Illinois. Azmy said he believes the reason was Salaita's "political expressions" in social media.
