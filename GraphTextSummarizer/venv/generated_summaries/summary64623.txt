-- When film documentarian Maria Agui Carter and other Latino producers banded together 13 years ago to address their underrepresentation in mass media, the mission seemed daunting and desperate, Carter said. "We used to be few hundred people that started in 1999, very frustrated at lack of access, trying to kick down the doors" of major media and film making outlets, Carter told CNN. "There are great improvements in the representation of Latinos, especially in television, but there are very few directors, vice presidents and above, film and TV executives and very few at the major and mini-major studios and few in the (talent) agencies and the management companies," Carter said. "It's a deeply empowering moment because it's the one time of year when Latinos in the media gather into one community," said Carter, who also writes, directs and produces documentaries and feature films through her firm Iguana Films. The group points out how the presence of minority industry writers in film and television has been stuck at 6% since 1999 and the percentage of minority directors is even smaller.
