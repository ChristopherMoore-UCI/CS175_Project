Last Wednesday, the NATAS revealed that it had selected a foursome with a mighty social reach: Vine star Brittany Furlan, style vlogger Lauren Elizabeth, beauty vlogger Jessica Harlow, and Meghan Rosette, who vlogs about style and beauty. After a red carpet show criticized as amateurish and occasionally downright offensive, some irate viewers are demanding that NATAS issue an apology for Furlan, Elizabeth, Harlow, and Rosette's antics. Among the offenses the women committed, as outlined by TVLine's Matt Mitovich: Furlan "literally came onto, and hard, every male in attendance, to a degree that makes E!'s Giuliana Rancic look positively demure" (see, for example, this interaction with Mario Lopez); Harlow called The Bold and the Beautiful's Lawrence Saint-Victor "a beautiful chocolate man" before asking, apropos of nothing, "What's it like to be a black man on a soap opera these days?" A few weeks before the ceremony, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences issued a casting call for social media mavens to host the event's live-streamed red carpet preshow. This year, some real-life drama surrounds the soap-focused Daytime Emmy Awards.
