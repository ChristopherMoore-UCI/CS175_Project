"The 26 people released from custody due to clemency is just slightly more than one-tenth of 1 percent of those incarcerated." Hood said he is questioning the release of many of the 175 individuals who received full pardons. The pardons are "a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and Governor Barbour should be ashamed," Hood said. Hood said Barbour violated the state's constitution because the pardon requests for many inmates were not published 30 days before they were granted, as required. The four murderers who received full pardons last week -- David Gatlin, Joseph Ozment, Charles Hooker and Anthony McCray -- were cited in Green's order. Barbour, who served eight years in the governor's office, had previously granted full pardons to three other convicted killers in 2008.
