One of them, Maj. Mark Todd, testified that he found extra magazines and a second handgun, a revolver, after Hasan was shot four times. Nidal Hasan was brought down by police fire. During the period of the final shots, Todd made repeated calls for Hasan to drop his gun. Asked whether he knew if he hit Hasan, Todd replied, "I see [sic] him wince a couple of times." In the end, Hasan fell to the ground, and Todd ran up, kicked his gun away, turned him over on his stomach and searched him.
