Ian Redmond of Britain died after he was attacked by a shark Tuesday off Anse Lazio beach on the island of Praslin, authorities said. Authorities in the Seychelles, an Indian Ocean archipelago, have issued a temporary ban on entering the water in five areas following two fatal shark attacks this month -- the one on Redmond and another two weeks ago. French newspaper Le Figaro reported that a 36-year-old French man was badly bitten on the legs and died as he dived off the same beach in early August. He worked tirelessly to give us both a wonderful married life and home and I want to thank him for nine years of joy," his wife, Gemma Redmond, said. -- The wife of a man killed by a shark during their honeymoon in the Seychelles islands paid tribute to him Wednesday, calling him a devoted husband and "best friend."
