But at least they made the cut as defending champion Miguel Angel Jimenez, American star Bubba Watson and last week's winner Pablo Larrazabal did not survive for the weekend. James Morrison was hospitalized on Tuesday night with a recurrence of Crohn's disease but after a second successive 66 has taken the halfway lead in the French Open at Le Golf National near Paris. England's Mark Foster, who challenged at the BMW International last week, continued his good form to be four shots back in third after shooting a second straight 68. But showing incredible resolve, he has a one-shot advantage joint overnight leader Richard Green of Australia after Fridays' play. World number four Martin Kaymer of Germany is also way off the pace on two under, one better than former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie, whose chances of claiming a British Open spot by a high finish look over.
