Katey Sagal has gone on to lead roles in TV hits such as "Futurama" and "8 Simple Rules," and currently stars in the FX drama "Sons Of Anarchy," which kicked off its seventh and final season earlier this month, to record ratings. When he shared news of the pitch on Facebook Thursday, he added in the caption, "Would be nice, wouldn't it?" "Married ... with Children" premiered in 1987 and went on to have 11 seasons, becoming the first prime-time series to air on Fox and one of the network's first breakout hits. "Married ... with Children" is just the latest '90s series that could have a revival. Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind the original series, is said to be shopping a pitch for a spinoff series centered on David Faustino's girl-crazy Bud Bundy. And last month, TV Guide reported that a "Full House" reboot is in the works with some of the original actors reprising their roles.
