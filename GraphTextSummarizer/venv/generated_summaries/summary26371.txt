They all benefited from a lapse by overall World Cup points leader Marcel Hirscher of Austria, who was fastest on the first leg, but skied off the course second time down when looking set to win his second gold in Colorado. Shiffrin scored the fastest first run time by 0.4 seconds but had to make up 0.38 seconds in the closing stages of her second outing to take gold and ensure she matched her medal-winning achievements of Schladming in 2013. U.S. teenager Mikaela Shiffrin successfully defended her slalom title at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Beaver Creek, Colorado, Saturday by the slimmest of margins. Baptiste clocked an aggregate time of one minute 57.47 seconds over the two runs to beat German skier Fritz Dopfer by 0.35 seconds. Another German, World Cup slalom leader Felix Neureuther took the bronze.
