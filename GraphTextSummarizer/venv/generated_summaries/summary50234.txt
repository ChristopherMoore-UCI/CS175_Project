Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill told reporters on Tuesday evening that the cruise line is using its full resources to assist passengers and family members in a "very challenging" situation. Passenger Ann Barlow said the staff on the Triumph was doing a good job, but flooded rooms, hot, humid conditions, long lines for food and overwhelming odors were making things tough for passengers. Passengers will get a free flight home, a full refund for their trip and most expenses aboard, and a credit for another cruise, Carnival said. Carnival said it will provide 20 charter flights Friday to get disembarked passengers to Houston so they can take other flights home. The incident has forced Carnival to cancel the ship's next two departures, refund bookings for those trips and offer those passengers discounts on future cruises.
