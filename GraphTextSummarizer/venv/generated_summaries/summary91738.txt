-- The Obama administration says that Pakistan was not involved or given advance warning about the operation that killed Osama bin Laden, but top U.S. officials said the al Qaeda leader never would have been found and killed without the counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries over the past few years. Officials do believe that al Qaeda in Pakistan has suffered a huge disruption, having lost a charasmatic leader such as bin Laden. Several officials predict Pakistan will go through a period of soul-searching about the fact bin Laden was hiding in their country in plain sight as well as the fact the U.S. killed him on their soil. We think it is in the best interest of the security and safety of the United States." Officials maintain that the relationship with Islamabad is complicated, fraught with difficulties and mistrust, but the fact that Pakistan has allowed the U.S. counterterrorism operative to operate on its soil, albeit with only a tacit endorsement, is critical to the type of operations that led to finding bin Laden. The U.S. never told Pakistan about its suspicions that bin Laden was hiding out at the compound, officials said.
