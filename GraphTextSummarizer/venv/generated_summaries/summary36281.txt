Observers say, however, that abuse of women remains common in the post-Taliban era and is often accepted in conservative and traditional families, where women are barred from education and commonly subjected to domestic violence. A total of 171 women and girls were hospitalized Tuesday, and four remained semi-conscious in the hospital Wednesday, Dr. Hafizullah Safi said. Some 25 women and girls returned to the hospital Wednesday morning, complaining of more stomach pains, fever and vomiting. During the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001, many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school, though the schools began reopening after the regime was toppled by the U.S.-led invasion. Police took the school employees into custody in the town of Rostaq, district administrator Moelam Hussein said.
