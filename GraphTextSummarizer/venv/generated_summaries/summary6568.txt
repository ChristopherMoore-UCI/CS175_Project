The state's House in March passed a measure to start requiring license applicants to have Social Security cards, which are available only to legal residents. -- New Mexico -- one of three states that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses -- is debating whether to change the practice. Republican Susana Martinez, the nation's first Latina governor, campaigned on a promise to stop undocumented immigrants from getting licenses. It was intended to offer undocumented immigrants "the opportunity to buy insurance, register their vehicles and have a driving record available to all law enforcement," said Marcela Diaz of Somos Un Pueblo Unido (We Are a United People). Aiming to expose residency fraud, officials began sending letters in July to 10,000 of the more than 84,000 immigrants who have been issued a license without a Social Security number.
