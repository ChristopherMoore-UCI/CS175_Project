ExxonMobil affiliates filed the ICSID arbitration case against Venezuela in September 2007 over the Cerro Negro Project, which was a joint venture until the Venezuelan government took over ExxonMobil's 42% interest in June of that year. Venezuela -- along with allies Bolivia and Nicaragua -- has said in the past that it would withdraw from the convention that created the ICSID, arguing that the international body gives transnational companies a gateway to violate national sovereignty. -- When the World Bank's arbitration body weighs in on a dispute between Venezuela and ExxonMobil, President Hugo Chavez says he won't respect the decision. Chavez, who has nationalized numerous industries and land holdings during his 13-year tenure, said Sunday that he supported Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's proposal to create a new arbitration body "where we can settle whatever differences there are between governments and companies in Latin America." Venezuela argued that taking over the project and others in Orinoco belt was its sovereign right.
