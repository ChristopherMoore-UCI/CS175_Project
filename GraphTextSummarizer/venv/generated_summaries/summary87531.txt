The television ads, which will air in Alaska, Arkansas, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire, link Democratic candidates in each race to President Barack Obama, reinforcing Republican messaging throughout the 2014 midterm season that has pushed the Democratic candidates in each of those states to keep their distance from the President. And the voters go on to say in similar form that, "A vote for [insert Democratic candidate here] is a vote for President Obama." A super PAC backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch is dropping $6.5 million into six competitive Senate races in a final ad push to send Republican candidates to the upper chamber. The ads also close by directly endorsing the Republican candidate for Senate in each race, a push not seen from groups in the Koch political network before 2014. And while super PACs, unlike nonprofit issues groups, are required to disclose their donors, super PACs can also directly support individual candidates.
