Hoffman "didn't deserve what he got," a close friend, Kaylah Ensign, told CNN affiliate KGW. Hoffman had one sister and three brothers, plus a number of foster brothers and sisters. Emilio Hoffman was shot in a locker room at Reynolds High School in Troutdale. "He was a sweet boy," friend Savannah Rowe told CNN. The 14-year-old victim of Tuesday's school shooting in Oregon was a sweet kid who sometimes put on a tough front, friends said.
