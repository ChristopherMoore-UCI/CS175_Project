The United States imposed the embargo against Cuba in 1961 after Castro's government began seizing private land and nationalizing private companies, and Havana levied heavy taxes on American goods. -- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said he acknowledges the persecution of gays and lesbians during the Revolution in his country, according to a newspaper interview published Tuesday. In the La Jornada interview, Fidel Castro also talked about the impact of the five-decade U.S. embargo on Cuba. Castro told journalist Carmen Lira Saade from the Mexican daily La Jornada. "We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death, that we didn't pay it enough attention," Castro said of the way gays and lesbians were treated.
