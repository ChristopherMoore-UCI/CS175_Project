Debois was arrested at about 8:30 p.m. on Thursday on Pennsylvania Avenue near the North Lawn of the White House after she was spotted with a gun holstered under her shirt, Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said. Secret Service agents searched her home in Michigan on Friday. CNN affiliate WJRT said reporters saw agents remove a long gun from the house and another item that was wrapped in plastic. Debois, who was initially identified by authorities as April Lenhart, made her first court appearance on Friday in Superior Court. The people rallying outside the White House were moved off of Pennsylvania Avenue as the arrest was made, Donovan said.
