The CEO of AltaRock, Susan Petty, said in a company blog post that "creating multiple reservoirs from a single injection multiplies the amount of energy that can be extracted from each production well," and will "extend the life of the well and increase the energy recovery from each well, significantly improving the economics of enhanced geothermal system power generation." One of the most substantial indicators of the viability of alternative energies can be seen in the growth in investment from venture capitalists and other private investors. However many experts, McDowall included, believe that this may change by 2025 when alternative energies could finally stop being regarded as "alternative." Whether the technique can yield significant energy return, and be conducted safely is still a matter of debate as heated as the Newberry volcano itself. "In the year 2000, most alternative energy technologies were considered niche options that might one day show promise -- now they're multi-billion dollar industries, significant enough to precipitate serious trade disputes between the US, EU and China," McDowall says.
