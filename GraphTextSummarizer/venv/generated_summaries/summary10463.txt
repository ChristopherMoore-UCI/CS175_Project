So by asking Romney more questions, the other candidates gave him even more time to present his case to the public. The only two people to get significant air time in the first hour were Romney and Herman Cain. It gave air time to someone Romney does not think will be a factor, thereby taking time away from his main rivals. Ron Paul asked Cain about his time spent chairing a Federal Reserve Bank, which is a negative with Paul. Perry asked Romney a question about health care, but he failed to have depth in his question or attack.
