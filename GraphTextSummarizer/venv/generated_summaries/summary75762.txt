Photos: Hollywood takes on Wall Street The film, which also stars Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, portrays Belfort's world and the people who worked for him in what was a fraudulent stock enterprise. The real 'Wolf of Wall Street' on Leo DiCaprio's portrayal Throw in a steady stream of salaciousness with stunning strippers and call girls, ungodly quantities of Quaaludes, cocaine and assorted excesses that rivaled Sodom and Gomorrah and you have something close to describing Jordan Belfort's life. In the 1990s, Jordan Belfort was already the self-proclaimed king of the world, raking in nearly a million dollars a week, all the while fashioning himself an ultra-hip, white Ferrari Testarossa-driving Don Johnson from Miami Vice. The three-hour Martin Scorsese-directed epic based on Belfort's life and bestselling book, "The Wolf of Wall Street," premieres on December 25. In more than 2Â½ hours of home videos obtained by CNN from a 1991 party in the Hamptons and another on his yacht, Belfort appears downright giddy, reminiscent of one of his favorite movie characters, Gordon Gekko from the film "Wall Street."
