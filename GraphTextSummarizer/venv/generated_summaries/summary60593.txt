When 'life support' is really 'death support' Jahi was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on December 12, three days after tonsil surgery. A judge's ruling will allow a hospital to disconnect life support machines at 5 p.m. Monday from the 13-year-old girl, whom doctors declared brain dead after she suffered complications from tonsil surgery earlier this month. Family members and hospital officials fought over her future in court. A statement released by family members Saturday and provided to KGO says they are weighing several options. Jahi's family, who wants to transfer her somewhere else, told CNN affiliate KGO that they spent Sunday working the phones, trying to line up another option.
