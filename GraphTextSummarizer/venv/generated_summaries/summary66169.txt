David Craig says there's growing support for recognition of gay unions and gay marriage. In addition, the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act by Congress in 1996 denies civil unions what Barack Obama's campaign described as the more than 1,100 benefits of marriage including immigration, taxation, Social Security and veteran's benefits. We believe that to deny gays and lesbians that right, and the 1,400 state and federal legal and economic benefits of marriage, is discrimination and in violation of the 14th Amendment. We were featured in a couple of books on gay marriage because the concept was so new at the time. It found increased backing for inheritance and other rights and found that 39 percent favor gay marriage.
