Sea The Stars showed a blistering turn of pace to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and confirm his status as one of the greatest race horses in history. It was the fifth consecutive win for the three-year-old colt, including the 2,000 Guineas and English Derby, as he claimed Europe's premier flat race on Sunday. The Stars finishes clear of the field to win Europe's top horse race. He relegated Youmzain, ridden by the returning Kieren Fallon, into second place with seven-time Arc winning trainer Andre Fabre's Cavalryman, under Frankie Dettori, in third. Trained in Ireland by John Oxx, Sea The Stars was boxed in approaching the final furlong, but jockey Mick Kinane found a gap before bursting clear of the field.
