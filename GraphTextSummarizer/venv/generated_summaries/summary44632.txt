"Prince William has gone shooting -- a day before launching a campaign to stop wildlife being killed," the popular tabloid said. " The video, which was recorded in November, ends with the pair saying the phrase "Let's unite for wildlife!" It acknowledges the United States is "among the world's major markets for wildlife and wildlife products, both legal and illegal" but also points to demand for ivory and rhino horn in Asia, "from a rapidly expanding wealthy class that views these commodities as luxury goods that enhance social status." United for Wildlife will also bolster efforts to bring those involved in the illegal wildlife trade to justice and to support local communities whose livelihoods are affected by the trade, it said. The conference is part of a week of events aimed at galvanizing efforts to halt the slaughter of endangered animals for their bones, hides or tusks -- much in demand in parts of Asia.
