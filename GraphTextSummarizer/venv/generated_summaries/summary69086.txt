-- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez heads home Thursday after undergoing five days of medical tests in Cuba. Chavez has been in Cuba for undisclosed medical tests since Saturday. The president has undergone treatments in both Venezuela and Cuba. Last month, the president was in Cuba for what he said was his fourth and possibly final round of chemotherapy. Chavez has pledged to run for re-election next year, dismissing speculation that his illness would force him out of politics.
