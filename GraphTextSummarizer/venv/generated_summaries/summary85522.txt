Sure, there are conservative professors, just like there were black baseball players in the 1950s. The Supreme Court has stated clearly that the First Amendment prohibits a state from basing hiring decisions on political beliefs or associations. During the faculty meeting to vote on whether Wagner should be hired, it was mentioned that she holds conservative beliefs. In a federal case heard this week, Wagner claimed that the state school violated her First Amendment rights by rejecting her because she's a Republican. Meanwhile, the two people hired at the school's writing center instead of Wagner were less qualified and less experienced and had received lower student evaluation scores.
