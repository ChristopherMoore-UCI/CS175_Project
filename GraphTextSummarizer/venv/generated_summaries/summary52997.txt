The last time we saw him on our TV sets, T. R. Knight was playing "Grey's Anatomy"'s beloved Dr. George O'Malley before he met an untimely end in 2009. He didn't get to sink his teeth into his role(s) as much as I'd hoped because a lot of the episode was devoted to initiating new detectives Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish); plus, his characters' Southern accent sounded a bit inconsistent -- anyone else notice that? And, as it turns out, the dichotomy makes even more sense as, in a twist typical of this long-in-the-tooth series, Knight is pulling a Sarah Michelle Gellar and playing estranged identical twins, one of whom has a seemingly charmed life whereas the other's is in serious shambles. In his first television role since (he's been continuing a successful stage career), Knight plays somewhat against type: George O'Malley was the bumbling, baby-faced surgeon with a nervous smile and horrible luck with women; his latest character, Gabriel Thomas from last night's "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," is an alleged (SPOILER ALERT!) It's rather inspired to cast an actor so associated with a recognizably benevolent character in such a disturbing role (sort of the effect Elijah Wood had as the expressionless, evil Kevin in "Sin City").
