But in a remarkably fast fall from grace, Driscoll resigned Tuesday as pastor of Mars Hill Church, a congregation he founded 18 years ago and turned into a force in the mostly secular Pacific Northwest. In that letter, obtained by Religion News Service, Driscoll says: "Recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for Mars Hill." Before his resignation, a number of Mars Hills leaders fled the church, saying that Driscoll was not fit for leadership. " "While the discussion board itself was a bad idea," Driscoll said in a letter obtained by Christianity Today, "my decision to attack critics who were posting there (I did so by posting under the character 'William Wallace II') was an even worse idea." For all that, though -- or maybe, because of all that --  Driscoll was pretty successful by many measures.
