As to her situation, Sullivan said she accepts the apology from Augusta National officials. Sullivan responded by citing federal law that mandates equal access for reporters to get into such locker rooms, whatever their gender. Tara Sullivan, a reporter with The Bergen (New Jersey) Record, tried to join other reporters Sunday evening in the club's locker room to interview Rory McElroy, a 21-year-old from Northern Ireland who gave up a big lead at the close of the four-day competition. "It's (the club's) responsibility that the tournament security week personnel ... are informed of what the policies are," said Sullivan, who vowed to be back at Augusta National to cover her fifth Masters next spring. On Monday, an official with the Augusta, Georgia, golf club explained that the guard had acted in error -- saying that, even though there are no female members in the club, female reporters have been and should be given the same access as men to do their jobs.
