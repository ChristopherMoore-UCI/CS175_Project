It is widely expected that the tribunal will indict members of the militant Shiite Muslim group for the 2005 killing of Hariri's father, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. But recently, Jumblatt has become increasingly neutral, and now, he could play a decisive role in deciding who will be Lebanon's next prime minister, given the small majority that Hariri's alliance retains in the 128-seat parliament. After the government collapsed, Lebanese President Michel Suleiman asked Saad Hariri to stay on as caretaker prime minister. Members of Hezbollah forced the collapse of Lebanon's Western-backed government last week because of now-caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri's continued cooperation with the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. In the past, Jumblatt has supported the tribunal, and his 11-member parliamentary bloc was officially part of Hariri's March 14 alliance.
