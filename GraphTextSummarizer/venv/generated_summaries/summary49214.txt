The evidence seems to suggest that despite the professed wishes of cinema-deprived travelers, where airport cinemas exist already, people aren't really that bothered. But despite being open to the general public, not just fliers, up to 40% of the audience are airport and airline staff, says Kathe Lin, deputy marketing manager at UA Cinema Circuit, which operates the IMAX in Hong Kong. Kudos to Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore, which all have cinemas in their international airports already. No, it seems people are resigned to the fact that airports must be endured rather than enjoyed, and a good movie is the most we can even wish for, let alone expect. Aren't airports most often sites of flustered, sweaty travelers rushing between gates, or tense mothers squawking at their children to "sit still!"
