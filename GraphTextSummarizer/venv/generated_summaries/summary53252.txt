The same assumption goes for duplicate accounts as well -- Facebook relies on users to merge accounts and report fake profiles. For organizations and businesses registered for the social network, Facebook distinguishes their accounts as "profiles" rather than "user pages," and does not count them as active users. With profiles of the departed presumably being left untouched, with social bots soon to be plaguing the network, and with duplicate accounts running amok, how can Facebook ever provide an accurate "active" usership count? But for duplicate and fake accounts, keeping them accountable is more difficult, as users might be willing to log in to multiple accounts. Beyond the deceased, there are endless duplicate accounts -- Entrustet found that 150% of 20- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. are on Facebook -- not exactly a plausible tally.
