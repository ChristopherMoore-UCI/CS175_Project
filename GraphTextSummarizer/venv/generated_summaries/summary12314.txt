On Thursday, a door malfunction locked the captain out of the cockpit on Delta Air Lines Flight 1651 from Minneapolis/St. Paul before final approach into McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. The first officer "alerted the airport to an 'emergency in-air' at approximately 12:10 p.m PT" and made an unassisted landing, McCarran spokeswoman Christine Crews said. "A commercial aircraft can be landed with one pilot at the control and Delta pilots are fully trained to do so if the situation were to occur," a Delta representative said in a statement. The door will be evaluated by Delta maintenance technicians." That's why aircraft have co-pilots.
