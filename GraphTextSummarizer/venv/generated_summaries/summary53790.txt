A default on Greek debt instruments was near to certain, Moody's said in an announcement published to its website Monday. The IFF has indicated that private creditors holding Greek debt instruments would likely take losses over 20%, Moody's said. The EU bailout to Greece protected all countries holding Europe's common currency the euro, Moody's said, by "containing the severe near-term contagion risk that would likely have followed a disorderly payment default or large haircut on existing Greek debt." -- International credit rating agency Moody's announced Monday it has once again downgraded Greek's sovereign debt rating - just four days after European leaders agreed on a second bailout for the debt-strapped nation. "Moody's Investors Service has today downgraded Greece's local- and foreign-currency bond ratings to Ca from Caa1," Moody's said, calling the probability of a default on Greek government bonds "virtually 100%."
