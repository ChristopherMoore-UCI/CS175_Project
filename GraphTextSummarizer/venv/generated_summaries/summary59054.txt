Christian Jebsen talks to CNN » The global market for wood products from tropical forests is estimated to be worth some $20 billion each year, according to the International Tropical Timber Organization. "The U.S. decking market, which is using toxic impregnated, metal-based wood modification methods, together with tropical wood, is [worth] about five billion dollars, so the market is obviously enormous," Jebsen said. "The logging doesn't necessarily end up in the total clearance of an area, it just opens up the area, it takes out all the valuable trees and makes it much easier." Kebony's move into the global wood market follows more than a decade of research started in the late 1990s by Canadian scientist Marc Schneider of the University of New Brunswick. Clearing land for agriculture and the collection of wood for fuel are the main drivers, but Løvold said the lucrative market for hardwood provides a compelling incentive for loggers to move into previously untouched areas. In reality, it was manufactured in Norway, in a five-day process that instills all the qualities of rare, tropical hardwood into sustainable softwood.
