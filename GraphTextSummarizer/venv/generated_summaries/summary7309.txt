The lanky cane provides cover for immigrants crossing the border illegally and poses a danger to Border Patrol agents trying to stop them, said Chuck Prichard, spokesman for CBP's Laredo sector. Johnson-Castro of the Rio Grande International Study Center said the concerns of Nuevo Laredo citizens are warranted because the effects of such widespread use of imazapyr are unclear. A Border Patrol agent moves through dense cane on the banks of the Rio Grande near Laredo, Texas, last year. Applying herbicides on a 1.1-mile stretch of the U.S. side of the river was part of a test project, Prichard said, but the CBP decided to postpone the $2.1 million experiment to address community concerns. And earlier this month, about 70 students from Texas A&M International University manually were able to clear about an acre of cane in fewer than three hours.
