The network was full of news on Saturday, announcing new seasons for hit series "Empire," "Gotham" and "Brooklyn Nine-Nine." Fox Television Group co-chairmen and CEOs Gary Newman and Dana Walden confirmed rumors on Saturday that the network is interested in reviving the hit science fiction drama, "The X-Files." The comments at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour were widely reported by such outlets as Variety, Entertainment Weekly and Deadline. Casting has also begun for "Grease Live" (Julianne Hough and Vanessa Hudgens) and horror comedy "Scream Queens" (Lea Michele, Joe Mangianello and Ariana Grande). Critics and viewers raved over the summer 2014 reboot of "24" -- so much so that Fox has said it would be interested in continuing that series with or without star Kiefer Sutherland.
