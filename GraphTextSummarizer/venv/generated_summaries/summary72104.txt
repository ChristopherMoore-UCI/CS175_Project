-- Kremlin critic and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, released from more than 10 years of imprisonment in Russia last week, praised the two freed Pussy Riot rockers for enduring months of hell in prison. A new amnesty law introduced by President Vladimir Putin allowed two members of Pussy Riot to leave prison on Monday, two months before the end of their two-year sentences for a performance critical of Putin. " The "Arctic 30" Russia has dropped its case against at least one of the Greenpeace "Arctic 30," the environmental group said Tuesday on its Arctic Sunrise Twitter feed. And last week, Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky, who had been jailed since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. According to Greenpeace, crew members of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise were peacefully protesting at an oil rig to bring attention to the threat of oil drilling and climate change.
