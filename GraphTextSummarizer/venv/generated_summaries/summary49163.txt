Watch Ortega express his surprise at Paris Jackson's tribute Â» Ortega, a longtime Jackson colleague who helped design the singer's 1990s tours, said planners left the end of the show open for family members to speak if they wished to, but he was surprised when the Jackson clan -- among them, his siblings and children -- went onstage for the two last songs, "We Are the World" and "Heal the World. Marlon Jackson told the crowd that his sister, pop star Janet Jackson, wished to say some words. Paris Jackson, 11, is consoled by her uncle Marlon Jackson after delivering a tearful tribute to her father. But to many, Paris' tribute cast Jackson in the one role few have experienced him as: a father. Born to two mothers -- Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe and an unidentified woman who reportedly served as a surrogate -- Jackson's three children lived and traveled the world with him, their faces often covered by veils and masks when appearing in public.
