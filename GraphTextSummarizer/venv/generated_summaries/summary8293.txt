A suppository is "a small piece of medicated substance, usually conical, ovoid, or cylindrical, introduced into a body passage, as the rectum or vagina, where body heat causes it to melt," according to Webster's New World College Dictionary. -- Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott set social media abuzz on Monday with a memorable slip of the tongue. "No one -- however smart, however well-educated, however experienced -- is the suppository of all wisdom," Abbott told a Liberal Party event in the city of Melbourne. The night before, he had been engaged in a televised debate with his key opponent, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Labor. As news of Abbott's unfortunate utterance filtered out, social media users quickly seized on the gaffe.
