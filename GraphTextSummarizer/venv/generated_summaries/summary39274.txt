"If PGA Tour bought (sic) European Tour things like Ryder Cup rivalry would be gone," the 2010 PGA Championship winner said via his official Twitter account. The chief executive of golf's European Tour has dismissed reports the organization could be bought out by its American counterpart the PGA Tour. " PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem also denied the reports, but did say collaboration between the two bodies could increase revenue for the sport. The European Tour, founded in 1972, has recently seen top golfers like British duo Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood head across the Atlantic to play on the more lucrative PGA Tour. "The European Tour has collaborated with the PGA Tour and all other members of the International Federation of PGA Tours on many ventures since we worked together on the formation of the World Golf Championships in 1999," added Europe's chief executive George O'Grady.
