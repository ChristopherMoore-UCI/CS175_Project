This followed an alleged altercation between the 26-year-old Harwell and another enlisted officer, whom Johannson identified as Petty Officer 2nd Class Justin Powell. Michael "Jake" Johannson, commanding officer for Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads, announced that the suspect --  Petty Officer 3rd Class Wilbur Harwell -- was apprehended "without incident" in Virginia Beach. The Navy captain did not detail how Harwell traveled the 20 miles east from where the stabbing occurred at the Portsmouth annex to Virginia Beach, though he noted he believes the suspect was alone at the time. Johannson said early Friday evening that Powell was in critical condition at a nearby hospital after undergoing surgery.
