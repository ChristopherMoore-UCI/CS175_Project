Authorities were searching for Breeann Rodriguez's body and bicycle in an undisclosed area in Dunklin County, the Senath Police Department and Dunklin County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The city, which has about 1,800 residents according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is in southeast Missouri's "bootheel" about 40 miles northeast of Jonesboro, Arkansas, and 90 miles north of Memphis, Tennessee. Digital billboards with the girl's picture have been displayed in Jonesboro and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, about 100 miles north of where she went missing. Senath police Chief Omar Karnes described the training wheels as "items of interest." A $45,000 reward -- $25,000 from the FBI and $20,000 from the Senath Marshal's office -- was offered for information leading to Breeann's recovery and the prosecution of those responsible.
