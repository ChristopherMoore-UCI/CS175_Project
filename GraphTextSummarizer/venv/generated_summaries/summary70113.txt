Fierce fighting raged on the outskirts of Tripoli on Sunday as militias continued to battle for control of the airport in what's being called the worst fighting in Libya since the 2011 revolution. Clashes were concentrated around the airport, the airport road and a number of residential areas where militias have fought over the past week, residents said. Abdulaziz said Libya needed more international support and asked the United Nations to consider a "stabilization and institution-building mission." The United Nations and other international organizations and businesses have temporarily evacuated staff from Libya. The latest assaults were launched by militias from the city of Misrata and an Islamist militia umbrella group in the capital known as the "Libyan Revolutionaries Operations Room."
