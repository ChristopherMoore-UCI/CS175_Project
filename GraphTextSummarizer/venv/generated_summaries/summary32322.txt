South Korea's ruling Grand National Party said the statement was "a step forward" from past statements, but "not enough to allay" Korean anger, the country's Yonhap news agency said. The statement "has no mention of illegitimacy of the forced annexation and Koreans forced to work as sex slaves or manual laborers by the Japanese army," Ahn Hyoung-hwan, a spokesman of the party, said, according to Yonhap. Kan also said Japan will hand over precious cultural artifacts that South Korea has been demanding. -- Japan apologized once again to South Korea on Tuesday for colonizing the Korean peninsula for more than three decades in the early 1900s. During that time, Japan's military is accused of forcing about 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, to serve as sex slaves.
