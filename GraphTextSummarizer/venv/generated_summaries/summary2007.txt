" While the study suggests that closing areas to fishing, banning some types of fishing gear and changing fishing quotas have long-term benefits, they also come with short-term costs to fishers. In Kenya, scientists, managers, and local communities teamed up to close some key areas to fishing and restrict certain types of fishing gear. " "Across all regions we are still seeing a troubling trend of increasing stock collapse," said Boris Worm, of Dalhousie University and co-author of the report. "We know that more fish can be harvested with less fishing effort and less impact on the environment, if we first slow down and allow over-fished populations to rebuild," said Jeremy Collie from the University of Rhode Island, another author of the report. While the report found that stock collapse is an increasing international trend, the scientists involved believe there are positive signs that rebuilding the ocean's depleted fish stocks is possible.
