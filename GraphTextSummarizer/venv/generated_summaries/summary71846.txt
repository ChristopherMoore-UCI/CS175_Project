Here's the second thing: It's not respectful to lump together Latino U.S. citizens with Latino illegal immigrants. Some readers figured out the difference between U.S Latino citizens and illegal immigrants and tried to explain it to others: "Just for the record, not every Latino in America is illegal. Many readers thought that I was demanding respect for illegal immigrants who can't vote: "How about the illegals start respecting our laws first off? This is the issue I see coming up with some who advocate for illegal immigrants: a lack of respect for our country's laws...." -- If they did, they would know how ridiculous it is to treat U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants as if they are one and the same.
