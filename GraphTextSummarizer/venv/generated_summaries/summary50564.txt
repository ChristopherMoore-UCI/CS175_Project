The political party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been granted permission to register for future elections in Myanmar, according to Suu Kyi's lawyer. The party announced last month that it had decided to re-enter politics in Myanmar, also known as Burma, and that Suu Kyi will run in the next parliamentary elections, as yet unscheduled. Nyan Win, who is also spokesman for the National League for Democracy party, told CNN that Myanmar's electoral commission granted the permission, and the NLD party will formally submit its registration "as early as next week." The new government freed dozens of political prisoners in October following the earlier release of Nobel Peace Laureate Suu Kyi. Ruled by that junta since 1962, Myanmar is now under a new president, a former general elected in March of this year.
