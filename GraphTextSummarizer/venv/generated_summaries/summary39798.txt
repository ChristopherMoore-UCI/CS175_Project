Interactive: See how Rosetta chases the comet across the solar system Scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets and perhaps whether they brought water to the Earth or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life. Matt Taylor says it is unlikely that you will be able to see comet 67P with the naked eye but you can follow the progress of the mission on Rosetta's blog and find out more with CNN's interactive coverage. Previous missions have performed comet fly-bys It's these processes that Rosetta scientists hope to be able to study from close proximity. As comets approach the sun, any ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail.
