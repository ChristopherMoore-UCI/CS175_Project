-- Richard Kiel, the actor best known for playing the James Bond villain "Jaws," died Wednesday at a Fresno, California hospital, St. Agnes Medical Center spokeswoman Kelley Sanchez said. Kiel first encountered Moore's James Bond in 1977's "The Spy Who Loved Me," where his silent hitman Jaws repeatedly menaced Bond with his sharp metal teeth. He and Bond battled each other in a opening skydiving sequence and in a memorable scene atop an aerial tram in Rio de Janeiro. Later, Jaws switched allegiances to Bond upon learning that his employer, the villain Drax, planned to exterminate him. "His family was the most important thing in his life and we are happy that his last days were spent surrounded by family and close friends.
