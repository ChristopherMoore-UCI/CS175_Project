" Former Barcelona forward Eto'o is set to become the latest star name to join Dagestan-based Anzhi, who have already signed winger Yuri Zhirkov from Chelsea and attacking midfielder Balazs Dzsudzsak from PSV Eindhoven during this transfer window. -- Samuel Eto'o has edged towards a move away from Inter Milan, after it was announced that a deal has been agreed to sell the Cameroon striker to Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala. Eto'o won multiple honors during his stay at the Nou Camp, including three Spanish Primera Liga titles and two European Champions League triumphs. Inter signed Eto'o in 2009, with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic moving in the opposite direction, and he helped the Nerazzurri claim Italian Serie A and  Champions League glory in 2010. Eto'o, 30, will undergo a medical with Anzhi on Wednesday before putting pen-to-paper on a three-year contract.
