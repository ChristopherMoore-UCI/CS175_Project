Gouker, who was Zwicker's stepfather, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, and was sentenced July 26 to life in prison. Young's aunt, Cynthia Guenther, took the stand Thursday in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky, to describe her nephew's demeanor at Zwicker's funeral, calling him "very sad, very distraught, teary-eyed. " The social worker who visited Young's home once every month between 2007 and 2012 also testified Thursday that she witnessed Young and Zwicker together on two occasions. Young, who did not testify in his own defense, is charged with complicity to murder for his alleged role in the slaying of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011. Prosecutors say the 17-year-old acted in concert with his father, Josh Gouker, to kill Zwicker, 14.
