"Guests are seeking the guidance of concierges now, more than ever, to help them filter the barrage of information and to seek personal insight." "Never hesitate to go to your concierge, even if you think your request is impossible," said Breve, who has been making the impossible possible for more than 25 years, primarily as senior concierge at the Ritz-Carlton on Canal Street. All major resorts and five-star hotels provide concierge services to their guests. Having ready answers for day-to-day demands is also critical for concierge success. "Whether on business or leisure travel, no one wants to spend too much time trying to coordinate, plan, organize, et cetera," said Jeanne Mills, president of the U.S. branch of Les Clefs d'Or (The Gold Keys), an international organization of professional concierges with more than 3,000 members worldwide. Hotel concierges also cater to people visiting their properties for special events, such as business conferences or weddings.
