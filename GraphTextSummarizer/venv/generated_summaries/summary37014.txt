The Hollywood star ceremony was timed to coincide with this week's release of "Listen to Me: Buddy Holly," a tribute album of his songs performed by 16 artists, including Ringo Starr, Stevie Nick, Brian Wilson, Jackson Browne, Chris Isaak, Linda Ronstadt and Lyle Lovett. -- Buddy Holly finally got his star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame on Wednesday, which would have been the singer-songwriter's 75th birthday. "It's never too late when you get a fantastic thing to happen," his widow, Maria Elena Holly, told CNN after unveiling the star on the sidewalk along Vine Street at the entrance to the historic Capitol Records building. Holly was just 22 when he was killed in a plane crash, along with musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. " Busey is working with T Bone Burnett on an album of Holly songs, which he said he would also perform in a tour.
