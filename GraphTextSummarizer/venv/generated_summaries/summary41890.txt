"Shortly after I arrived, there were still birds falling from the sky," said commission wildlife officer Robby King in the statement. Birds fell over about a one-mile area, the commission said in a statement. The firm's workers will go door-to-door and pick up birds still in yards and on rooftops. Rowe said Sunday there was evidence that large fireworks may have played a role. The dead birds will be sent for testing to labs at the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission and the National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin.
