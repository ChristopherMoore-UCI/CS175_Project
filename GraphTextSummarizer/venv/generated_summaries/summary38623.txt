"The reasons provided to Agent Dodson were predictions of 'a negative impact on morale' in his field division at Phoenix, and 'a detrimental effect [sic] on [ATF] relationships' with other agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the ACLU said in the letter. ACLU lawyers said the ATF's actions on Dodson's publication request are an unconstitutional censorship of his freedom of speech. "Given the national attention to both the "Fast and Furious" operation and ATF practices more broadly, ATF faces an extremely high burden in demonstrating that its interests outweigh Agent Dodson's right to speak and the public's right to hear his views about 'Operation Fast and Furious,'" the ACLU lawyers said in their letter which was written on Dodson's behalf. John Dodson, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was among several agents who claimed whistleblower status in order to provide information to Congress about the agency. But his efforts were blocked by agency supervisors, who have oversight on any outside employment by agents, the ACLU said in the letter protesting the restriction.
