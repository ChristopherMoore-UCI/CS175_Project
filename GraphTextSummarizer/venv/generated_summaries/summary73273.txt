It's obvious what's driving iPhone customers toward Cydia: Apple's rejections and restrictions of major iPhone apps. Though some developers say they're having better experiences selling apps through Cydia, it's unlikely they will succeed on a longer term, said Rana Sobhany, vice president of Medialets, an iPhone app analytics company. -- Apple is the exclusive gatekeeper to its iPhone App Store, able to reject apps at will -- as it did July 28 with Google Voice. Only five months old, his app store Cydia specializes in selling apps that Apple would reject or ban (or already has). Some would-be iPhone developers, rejected by Apple, are turning to an unauthorized app store called Cydia.
