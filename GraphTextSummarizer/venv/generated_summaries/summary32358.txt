Since the heist, Swedish police have been criticized for storing their helicopters at an unguarded heliport in the Stockholm archipelago, which enabled the thieves easily to put the police helicopter out of commission. Stockholm police said the heist had been elaborate. "It's an enormous piece of puzzle, and we don't want to miss anything," Anders Buren, head of police operations, told TV4. Swedish media also criticized police for not shooting at the thieves as they escaped in their helicopter. They brought a lot of firepower with them, among other things automatic weapons," Anders Bjargard from the Stockholm police, told TV4.
