Using the last name Csizsik, Csizsik-Csatary arrived in Canada in 1949, telling immigration officials he was Yugoslavian, according to The Toronto Star newspaper. He also played a role in "deportations to the Ukraine to be killed -- 300 Jews," Zuroff said. " "This new evidence strengthens the already very strong case against Csatary and reinforces our insistence that he be held accountable for his crimes," Zuroff said in the statement. Csizsik-Csatary returned to Hungary upon leaving Canada, Zuroff said. It was further alleged that he participated in the internment and deportation of thousands of Hungarian Jews to concentration camps.
