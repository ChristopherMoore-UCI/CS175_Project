Militants shot down a Ukrainian military helicopter late Tuesday afternoon in eastern Ukraine, less than a week after Ukraine's President declared a cease-fire in Kiev's fight against pro-Russian separatists, a Ukrainian anti-terror spokesman said. Russia's annexation of Crimea and the pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine came after Ukraine's Parliament ousted Viktor Yanukovych from the presidency on February 22. Ukraine's government in Kiev has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russia separatists, who have led uprisings in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. All nine people who were aboard the Mi-8 helicopter near Slovyansk are believed to have died, said Vladislav Seleznev, spokesman for Ukraine's anti-terror operation. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week welcomed the cease-fire and said it "should be used to begin constructive negotiations and political compromises between the opponent parties in eastern Ukraine," according to the Kremlin.
