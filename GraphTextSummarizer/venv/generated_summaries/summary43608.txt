-- President Barack Obama on Wednesday issued new orders aimed at speeding up transportation projects he says will put construction workers back on the job, using the opportunity to blast congressional Republicans who have blocked similar legislation. Standing before the aging Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Potomac River, Obama again criticized Republicans who have blocked the jobs bill he put forward in September, telling an audience of construction workers, "There's work to be done. Republicans filibustered the Senate version of the president's $447 billion jobs proposal in mid-October, while a $35 billion measure that would have forestalled layoffs of state and local government workers like teachers and police officers was blocked a few days later. There are workers ready to do it. Meanwhile, he criticized the House of Representatives for spending time to debate measures like establishing a commemorative baseball coin and a resolution reaffirming "In God We Trust" as the official U.S. motto.
