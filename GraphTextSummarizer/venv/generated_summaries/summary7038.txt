Mikes Jones with Bay District Schools in Panama City told HLN "Prime News" he was afraid the system's superintendent was dead after Clay Duke, 56, pointed a handgun at the leader and opened fire Tuesday afternoon. He ordered the room cleared of everyone but six men and got into a discourse with board members and Husfelt about several issues, including the termination of Duke's wife. Jones told reporters he feels Husfelt deserved the accolades for asking Duke to let the other school board members go. It was a gun battle," Mike Jones told reporters about his encounter with Duke. A chilling video of the meeting, from a live internet feed provided by CNN affiliates WJHG and WMBB, shows Husfelt attempting to reason with Duke.
