-- An Alaska Airlines flight was diverted to Portland, Oregon, after the captain lost consciousness and the first officer was forced to take over, an airline spokesman said. The captain was likely suffering from food poisoning or the flu, Alaska Airlines said Friday. The incident occurred Thursday night on Flight 473 from Los Angeles to Seattle, airline spokesman Paul McElroy said. The condition of the captain was not immediately available, but he "is doing better today," airline spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. The airline did not release the name of the captain but said he has been flying with Alaska for 28 years.
