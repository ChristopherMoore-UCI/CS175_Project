Hong Kong protesters bid camp farewell Demand to be heard Demands for democracy are in reality demands to be heard. Pro-government supporters have transformed from being rather passionless parrots of the Beijing line into fire-breathing zealots demanding Hong Kong police bash the heads of anyone stepping into the streets. Chauffeured cars Hong Kong needs central and local government officials who understand life's daily pressures and stress points. Perhaps Hong Kong should imitate what President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption policies have unleashed on the mainland: Officials getting out of their chauffeured cars, giving up their maid service and joining the rest of us standing in long lines. The "Occupy Central" protests make the upcoming annual policy address by the city's leader, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, in mid January the most critical since Hong Kong reunified with China in 1997.
