He added that "pregnant women have tolerated the vaccine well, and no safety concerns have arisen." Pregnant women are considered to be among the highest at risk for serious complications of this new flu strain. Children, pregnant women, young people should be getting vaccinated. In a news conference Monday at the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said out of about 100 pregnant women who participated in trial studies, over 90 percent showed a robust immune response to a single 15-microgram dose of the H1N1 vaccine. Schuchat reassured the public that more vaccines would be made available within the next few weeks, as demand for shots continues to rise. "With seasonal flu," said Schuchat, "Ninety percent of the deaths every year are in people over the age of 65."
