Last year, lawyers said Gadhafi was in isolation except for visits from officials. The battle continues over which court should try the son of deceased Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Libya has consistently challenged the ICC's demand to try Gadhafi, saying the Hague-based court does not have jurisdiction in the case. The pre-trial chamber of the court questioned Libya's ability to prosecute the younger Gadhafi, saying the nation's judicial institutions are not well-established following the uprising. Saif Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, was seized by militants in November 2011 as he tried to flee the nation.
