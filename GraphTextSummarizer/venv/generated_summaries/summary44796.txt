The project is directed by Sebastian Thrun, who also co-founded Google Street View. Google has already been testing the cars on the road in Nevada, which passed a law last year authorizing driverless vehicles. Gov. Edmund "Jerry" Brown signed the autonomous-vehicles bill into law Tuesday afternoon alongside Google co-founder Sergey Brin and State Sen. Alex Padilla, who authored the bill, at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. Brin, who sported a pair of Google glasses at the media event without comment, said the cars could address a variety of current transportation issues. Google is the most visible company working on these types of vehicles, but similar projects are under way at other organizations, including Caltech.
