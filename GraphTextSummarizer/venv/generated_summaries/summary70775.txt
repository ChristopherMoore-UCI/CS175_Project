Germany took the lead just after the halftime break with Mittag tapping in from close range after excellent work by Okoyino da Mbabi. It was enough to give Germany an unprecedented sixth straight European Championship crown, with the last two under legendary former player and now head coach Silvia Neid. An uneventful first half came to life when Norway were awarded the first of their penalties as Catherine Dekkerhus hit the turf under challenge from Celia Okoyino da Mbabi. Angerer kept out spot kicks in either half with substitute Anja Mittag scoring the only goal of the match in Solna in Sweden just after the break. The result also continued two-time winner Norway's losing run in Euro finals to Germany, this there fourth and doubly frustrating thanks to Angerer's heroics.
