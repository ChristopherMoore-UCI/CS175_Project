Dawood told CNN this and similar sentences contribute to the closure of political space and dissuade youth from constructive political engagement. Prominent Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah was sentenced Monday to five years in prison and fined $13,000 on charges of protesting and assaulting police. and today we get these sentences," said Khaled Dawood, spokesman of the Constitution Party, in reference to el-Sisi's speech the night before in which he announced the imminent release of youth wrongfully held in prisons. Activists who refuse to recognize the legislation say the police violated the law by using excessive force. Several other prominent activists -- including his youngest sister Sanaa and Ahmed Maher, co-founder of the April 6 Youth Movement -- have been convicted of violating the protest law.
