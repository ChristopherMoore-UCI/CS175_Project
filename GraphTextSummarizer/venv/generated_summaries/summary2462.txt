-- A strong 6.5-magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico on Saturday night, killing two people and startling residents as far away as Mexico City, state media reported. It struck in Guerrero state at 7:47 p.m. local time, about 100 miles south-southwest of the capital, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of major damage in the capital, but several areas were without power, Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard wrote on his Twitter page soon after the quake. One person was killed when a rock fell on a vehicle, while another was crushed by a collapsed house, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing civil protection officials in Guerrero. Lorena Isla, a CNN iReporter in San Jeronimo Lidice, on the outskirts of Mexico City, took video of chandeliers swaying at her home.
