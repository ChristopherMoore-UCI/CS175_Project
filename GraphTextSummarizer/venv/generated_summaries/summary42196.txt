This year's captain Paul McGinley personifies that team dynamic. Since becoming a Ryder Cup hero in his debut in 2002, the Dubliner has not been part of a losing team, either as a player or vice-captain. Nine Ryder Cups have been played since Tom Watson last captained America to victory at the Belfry in 1993, and Team Europe has won seven of them. Hard to explain, but it is there and it's the fuel for the engine that is European team golf. Given Europe's strong record over the last two decades, the burning question is how will Team USA perform under the captaincy of the great Watson?
