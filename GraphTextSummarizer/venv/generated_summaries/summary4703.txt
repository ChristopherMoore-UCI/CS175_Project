Rep. Michael Grimm announced late Monday night plans to resign from Congress, after pleading guilty to a felony tax evasion charge last week. His re-election and subsequent guilty plea created problems for Boehner, who — along with then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor — in 2010 promised to institute a "zero tolerance" policy for ethics violations within the GOP caucus, which had dogged the party and contributed to its steep losses in the 2006 and 2008 elections. A Republican congressional source said Boehner and Grimm spoke Monday before Grimm announced his plans to resign. But Grimm's guilty plea wasn't the only headache he's caused Boehner over the past year. House Speaker John Boehner called Grimm's decision to step down "honorable" in a statement on Tuesday.
