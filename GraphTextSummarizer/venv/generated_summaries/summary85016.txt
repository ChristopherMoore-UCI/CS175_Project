-- Militants in Pakistan's tribal region attacked a truck carrying supplies for NATO troops in Afghanistan -- killing the driver and his assistant, officials said Friday. The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms, using Pakistani trucks and drivers. Pakistan had closed off the crossing after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. The latest suspected drone strike came Friday when four alleged militants were killed in North Waziristan, two Pakistani intelligence officials said. Gunmen opened fire and threw petrol bombs, setting the truck and its container on fire, said Muhammad Arshad Khan, a senior government official in Khyber Agency.
