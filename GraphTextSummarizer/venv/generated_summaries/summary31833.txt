The celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before, during and after the total eclipse, giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the "blood moon" nickname. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The third blood moon in a four-part series was the shortest eclipse of the bunch, but still a sweet treat for early risers in North America. NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a "tetrad." tweeted Ryan Hoke, a meteorologist for CNN affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Kentucky, showing a picture of a reddish partial moon in a blue dawn sky.
