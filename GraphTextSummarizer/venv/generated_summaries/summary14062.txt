-- As Formula One racer Jules Bianchi continues to fight for his life in a Japanese hospital, his Marussia team says it has been angered by "a number of media reports" into the cause of the accident. Earlier, Bianchi's Marussia team made its own tribute with its sole driver in the Russian race, Max Chilton, holding a pit board which read, "Racing for Jules." "Jules remains in a critical but stable condition in the Intensive Care Unit of Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi. The vehicle was removing Adrian Sutil's Sauber which had left the track on the preceding lap, prompting double yellow flags to be waved to warn drivers to slow down and be prepared to stop. "The Bianchi family continue to be comforted by the thoughts and prayers of Jules' man fans and the motor sport community."
