The staff at the Turtle Hospital sees many accidental injuries, "animals tied up in fishing line or hit by a boat," Moretti said. The shooting of the turtle had to be deliberate, said Rich Moretti, who runs the Turtle Hospital in Marathon. "This has to be one of the luckiest turtles in history," said veterinarian Doug Mader. Much of the money came from local commercial fishermen and boat captains. Under a beautiful blue September morning sky, Sara was released near the Seven Mile Bridge in Marathon.
