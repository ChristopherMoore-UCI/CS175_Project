Gergen: CIA chief Brennan, more credible than torture report? Nor can we expect anything of the scale and scope of CIA reform from a Congress that can barely pass a budget. In the movie "Zero Dark Thirty," torture is shown as allowing U.S. agents to find and kill Osama bin Laden. There have been a variety of proposals put onto the table, ranging from the appointment of an independent prosecutor to look into the role of high-level Bush administration officials to strict prohibitions on the kinds of facilities that the CIA can maintain to compensation for victims of enhanced interrogation. As Steve Mufson recounted in The Washington Post, Obama rejected creating a "truth commission" to investigate the CIA's use of torture or the pursuit of any criminal prosecutions.
