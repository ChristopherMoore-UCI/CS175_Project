His performance, one of the many peaks of the 1970 eponymous documentary about that festival, "Woodstock," was the first thing most people of a certain age thought of when they heard the news of Cocker's death at 70 from lung cancer. It was what Monday's CBS Evening News broadcast mentioned first and foremost when mentioning Cocker's passing and the film clip accompanied many tweets and posts on social media. Then Joe Cocker started to sing a song that, it's safe to say, everybody within hearing range of that stage knew by heart. That little ditty Ringo Star introduced to the world became, in Cocker's fitful, jerking hands, an epic flag waver, a soul-music anthem. The cameras that captured that transfixing performance for all time stayed on him for practically the entire song, drifting up and down Cocker's spasmodic form, focusing on his hands as they mimed an invisible instrument wrenching every lick, spin and extended variation he could summon through the vibrant coarseness of his voice.
