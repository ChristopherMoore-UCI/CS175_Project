Scotland to leave UK? 8 things to know John Major: Scottish people 'fed a load of pap' Former Prime Minister John Major also made an impassioned plea for Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom, telling CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the Scottish people have been hoodwinked. " In his own open letter to Scottish voters, Salmond urged them to look past what he called the "increasingly desperate and absurd scare stories" of the pro-union "no" campaign, and think of Scotland's future.

"Know that by voting 'Yes', what we take into our hands is a responsibility like no other -- the responsibility to work together to make Scotland the nation it can be."
