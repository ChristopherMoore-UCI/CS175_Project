"So here, on the southeast side of the jump, just by the kickoff lip, has a good view of the valley -- which means the other 180 degrees I can fill with multiple frames of the skier at different points all the way down the hill," explains Stuart, as he puts down his bag to survey the surroundings. "The tools are fantastic for taking distortion out of the lens, lining the images up and detecting where they match -- they'll detect points that are exactly the same in two images ... and will line up from these control points -- it does a lot of the heavy lifting for you but it also makes lots of mistakes which I then fix by hand," says Stuart as he manipulates the final product before filing down to Getty offices in time for the deadline. We need to chose a position that will optimize the panorama," Stuart tells CNN. She refers to a map of the giant jump center where photographer positions are labeled and then fields questions from the 20-or-so snappers present who will be recording tonight's event for countless newspapers, websites and magazines around the world. The message has the desired effect on a writer adopting the role of photographer for one night only.
