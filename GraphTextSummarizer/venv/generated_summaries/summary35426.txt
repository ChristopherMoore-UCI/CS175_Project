A maritime security source aware of the situation said Sunday that Islamic militants probably took Judith Tebbut by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia. Owino told CNN that the search was focused on the border regions of Kenya and Somalia and through a "significant network" of contacts across the border. David Tebbut was shot dead and his wife, Judith Tebbut, was abducted, police said. An English couple staying at a remote safari lodge on the coast, near the border with Somalia were attacked early Sunday. The couple had arrived at the hotel Saturday afternoon after spending a week in the Masai Mara game reserve in southwestern Kenya.
