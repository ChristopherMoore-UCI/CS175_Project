Local authorities are investigating if the pair had anything to do with Tuesday's shooting near Naco, Arizona, where Border Patrol agents came under fire after responding to a sensor that had gone off nearby. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other federal officials will meet with Ivie's family "to express their condolences," said department spokesman Matt Chandler. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI's Phoenix division, has declined to say if the Border Patrol agents involved in the incident returned fire. He was released from the hospital Wednesday, said Jeremy Copeland, an agent with the Tucson Sector of U.S. Border Patrol. U.S. authorities have identified the agent killed as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie.
