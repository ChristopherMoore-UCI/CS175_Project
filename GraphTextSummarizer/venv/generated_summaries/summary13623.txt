-- England coach Roy Hodgson has overlooked experienced international Rio Ferdinand for a second time after electing to call up Liverpool defender Martin Kelly as a replacement for the injured Gary Cahill. Croatia striker Ivica Olic has been ruled out with a hamstring injury, and coach Slaven Bilic has replaced him with Nikola Kalinic of Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. France coach Laurent Blanc also faces injury worries ahead of the opening Group D match against England in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk on June 11. Chelsea's Cahill suffered a double jaw fracture in England's 1-0 win over Belgium on Saturday, but instead of turning to Ferdinand, who has 81 caps, Hodgson drafted in Kelly -- who only made his international debut last month. When Hodgson named his 23-man Euro 2012 squad last month he said he omitted the 33-year-old for "footballing reasons," having been asked if it was because of John Terry's impending court case for allegedly abusing Ferdinand's younger brother Anton.
