While U.S. advisers are on the ground assisting security forces, Iraq is increasingly relying on Iranian-backed Shiite militias to stave off radical Sunni ISIS militants -- especially around the capital. Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Israel and Libya. As if the civil war wasn't enough, the radical Sunni group Islamic State in Iraq in Syria is using this opportunity to carve its own swath of territory from the Iraq border to deep inside Syria. ISIS now controls land on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border -- opening the floodgates for weapons and fighters between the two countries. "One of the problems you've got now is a caliphate that includes part of Syria, part of Iraq, and you've got literally thousands of jihadist wannabes flooding into that part of the world from Europe -- some of them probably from the United States -- who want to participate in that conflict," Cheney told CNN's Jake Tapper.
