The official stressed Belgian authorities are investigating all possible angles, including Islamist terrorism, neo-Nazi attack, and other categories. -- Belgian police are now confident that a shooter who killed three people at the Jewish Museum of Belgium was carrying a camera to record the attack, a senior Belgian law enforcement official told CNN Tuesday. With regard to the threat from Islamist terrorism, he noted there has been longstanding concern over the 100 or so Belgian Islamist extremists who received training in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region over the years, and high current concern over several hundred who have more recently traveled to fight in Syria. Photographs and video released by Belgian police show the man wearing a cap and blue shirt, carrying two bags over his shoulder. The concern is they might be able to use skills acquired there to launch attacks back home.
