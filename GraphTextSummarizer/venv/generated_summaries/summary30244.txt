" While Masri acknowledges that Rawabi does not represent the answer to all the problems facing a peace settlement, saying he "didn't design it thinking Israel and Palestine would kiss and be happy," he does harbor hopes that economic development will play a favorable role. "Even if it got constructed and filled to capacity and became a thriving city, it will not change the underlying geo-political realities where Palestine is divided between two different governments, or address the settlements, which remain the biggest hurdle," says Kamran Bokhari, the vice president of Middle Eastern and South Asian affairs for Stratfor, a global intelligence company.

Bokhari also questions whether the Palestinian economy is strong enough to fill the units, the first 700 of which went on sale last month.
