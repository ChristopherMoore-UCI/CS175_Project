That came because of Hariri's cooperation with the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is expected to indict Hezbollah members in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the father of Saad Hariri. Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006 that devastated southern Lebanon. He was making reference to confrontations between security forces and protesters across Lebanon and the attack on an Al-Jazeera news network crew and the burning of one of its trucks in Tripoli, in northern Lebanon. Lebanon's president, Michel Suleiman, appointed Najib Mikati to lead the country's government, a step seen by supporters of caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Western-backed Future Movement as a power grab by the Iranian-backed Shiite movement. Hariri urged demonstrators on the "Day of Rage" to show restraint and calm as protests sprang up across Lebanon amid the country's uncertain future.
