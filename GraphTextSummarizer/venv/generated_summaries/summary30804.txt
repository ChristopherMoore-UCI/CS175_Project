-- Police in Jackson, Mississippi, have prepared an arrest warrant for former television host Gary Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, police spokesman Colendula Green told CNN. " Collins is known for being a TV and radio personality, and is married to former Miss America Mary Anne Mobley. " Green agreed that the ex-actor had provided his contact information but said Jackson Police have cited Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, a misdemeanor. The victim "had been stopped at a red light and was rear-ended by a white Jeep, driven by Gary Collins," Green said. After calling the police, Collins left because he had been waiting for some time and he thought he had done all that was required, Royals said.
