"Drive" features an all-star cast, including Hollywood hunk Ryan Gosling in the starring role as Sallis describes, "a guy who does stunt driving for movies by day and drives for criminals at night." Or as someone once described noir fiction: "force of circumstances driving protagonists to the commission of dreadful acts. Kinda south, kinda west, kinda old, kinda ageless, kinda middle America, kinda Hispanic.... CNN: You're something of a renaissance man, beyond your crime novels, you're also a poet, a translator, a biographer, a musician and a teacher. Not just a writer, Sallis is also a poet, professor and musician. It's an astonishingly fine movie, one that will be talked about and referenced, I suspect, for many years.
