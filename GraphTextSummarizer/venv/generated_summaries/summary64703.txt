Shortly after 12:10 a.m. ET, Facebook and Instagram went down, leaving millions of users around the world briefly unable to post selfies or humblebrag. Users across Asia, Australia and New Zealand also reported having trouble logging on. Without Facebook, how are you supposed to know which friends are having birthdays? It ran the gamut of emotions.
