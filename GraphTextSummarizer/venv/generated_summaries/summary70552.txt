In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. Pakistan is one of three countries in the world where polio has yet to be eradicated. Attacks like these have become a frequent occurrence in some parts of Pakistan and have left 10 workers dead.
