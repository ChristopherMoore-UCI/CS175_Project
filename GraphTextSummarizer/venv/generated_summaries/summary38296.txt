In an effort to curb demand, Education for Nature Vietnam also has posted banners in markets telling people that buying and selling pangolin scales is illegal and that the scales are "not a magic medicine," said Doug Hendrie, the group's chief technical adviser. Pangolin scales are used in traditional medicine and were openly available in markets when I visited Vietnam in February 2014. She continues: "If you buy pangolin scales or eat pangolin meat in restaurants, you are directly supporting these criminal networks." And in June, two tons of pangolin scales were seized in Hong Kong, according to that non-profit group. "Our native species, the pangolin, is being threatened by hunters and traders who defy the law to profit from nature, regardless of the cost to Vietnam's environment," the newscaster, Hoai Anh, who was described to me as "the female Anderson Cooper of Vietnam," says in the clip.
