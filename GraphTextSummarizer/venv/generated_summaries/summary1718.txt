Pakistani military officials say the withdrawal of U.S. troops has provided insurgents in the mountainous areas of eastern Afghanistan with safe havens that are used to launch cross-border attacks against Pakistani security forces. Saturday's attacks were the latest in a series of recent cross-border assaults from Afghanistan's Pech Valley and the provinces of Kunar and Nuristan, all areas from which U.S. troops began pulling out earlier this year as part of a strategy designed to bolster security in more populated areas of Afghanistan. The Pakistani military said the militants were reported to be from Dir, Swat and Bajaur, three areas in northwest Pakistan where the military has sought over the past two years to remove insurgents. -- At least 25 security personnel were killed when between 200 and 300 militants attacked border posts along Pakistan's border with Agfhanistan, Pakistan's military said Saturday. The attacks have raised tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with each country accusing the other of not doing enough to secure its border region.
