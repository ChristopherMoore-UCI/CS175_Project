Consider this a grab for attention more than anything; Playboy editorial director Jimmy Jellinek was quoted byMSNBC saying, "In today's print environment you have to create newsstand events." " Those are the words of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, whose magazine will soon include a centerfold playmate photographed naked and in 3-D. The 3-D centerfold will appear in the June issue, which hits newsstands this Friday. Hefner actually commissioned a Chicago photographer to take 3-D photos of naked women back in the 50s, but he decided against running the images when he realized how expensive it would be to include 3-D glasses with each copy of the magazine, MSNBC claims. Though the magazine's gimmick is obviously inspired by the increasing popularity of 3-D films like "Avatar," Hefner said that the appeal of 3-D movies is lost on him personally. This time, HBO is promoting its sexy Southern vampire TV show "True Blood" by sponsoring the glasses.
