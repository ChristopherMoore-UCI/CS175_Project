-- It was only after I joined CNN on May 8, 1990, that I got to know Ted Turner and learn TV news and life lessons from him. Nowadays, that sounds so obvious, especially to all of us at CNN -- the world's news leader when it comes to breaking news. He would always remind all of us at CNN that we work for a "news" organization and when there's breaking news, that takes priority. In short, Ted did for television news what Bill Gates and Steve Jobs did for computers and the Internet. In recent weeks and months, I've been thinking of those lessons as I worked on our new CNN one-hour documentary: "Ted Turner: The Maverick Man."
