"The work at the crime scene is finished; however, our investigation is not over," said ATF Special Agent in Charge Carlos A. Canino in the release. Arsonists started a huge December 8 blaze that destroyed a downtown apartment building under construction and damaged nearby buildings, the Los Angeles Fire Department said Thursday in a news release. The Fire Department said it seeks information about two "potential witnesses" seen in video footage. Security camera video of the two witnesses can be viewed at the Fire Department website. The fire was investigated by the Los Angeles Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
