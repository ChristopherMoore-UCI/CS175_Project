"I can remember asking my mom and dad for LJN figures straight off the shelves when I was about 8 or so," said Daniel Epps, a 34-year old, decades-long fan of WWE figures from Gloversville, New York. "The different classes of action figures are executed excellently, with different accessories and ranges of articulation, making a figure of the more expensive class truly seem worth it." Hasbro took over production of the WWE figures in 1990, adding moving arms and spring loaded movements. " Nabil Carrillo, a 19-year old from Orlando, Florida, who collects WWE, Star Wars, Marvel Universe and other action figures, believes that the WWE figures by Mattel can't be compared with any other figure when it comes to detail. Fans around the world couldn't wait get their hands on toy company LJN's first line of WWE action figures. Sure, these tiny wrestlers were made of hard plastic and had zero moveable joints, but these were WWE action figures.
