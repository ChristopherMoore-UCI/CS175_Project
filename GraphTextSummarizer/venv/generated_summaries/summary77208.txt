Willke wrote that rape pregnancies are "extremely rare" and that the stress of rape helps prevent pregnancy. Their conclusion contradicts a statement made last weekend by Rep. Todd Akin, R-Missouri, who suggested in an interview with CNN affiliate KTVI that rape rarely results in pregnancy. While the stress associated with rape may not lower a victim's risk of becoming pregnant, rapists often do not ejaculate, thereby decreasing their victims' risk of pregnancy, said Phelan. A woman's chances of becoming pregnant are the same after rape as they are after consensual sex, according to medical experts and published studies. A 1996 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology estimated 32,101 pregnancies in the United States each year result from rape.
