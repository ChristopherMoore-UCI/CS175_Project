In Washington, Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, told reporters Monday that U.S. embassies are under instructions not to ask Fulbright scholars or Peace Corps volunteers to act "in any way, shape or form" on behalf of the U.S. government as intelligence agents. The U.S. Embassy in Bolivia said in a statement Monday that Peace Corps volunteers had been mistakenly given a security briefing in July meant for embassy staff asking them to report "suspicious activities," The Associated Press reported, though Goldman said "nobody at the embassy has ever asked American citizens to participate in intelligence activities here. Bolivia President Evo Morales declared a U.S. diplomat "undesirable" Monday amid allegations that the United States asked a visiting scholar and Peace Corps volunteers to keep tabs on Cubans and Venezuelans in Bolivia. U.S. officials admitted that someone at the embassy made an inappropriate suggestion, the information agency reported, but the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Philip S. Goldberg, denied Monday that the embassy asked anyone to spy. " It was unclear Monday whether the Bolivian government would seek the expulsion of any U.S. Embassy employees in light of the president's declaration of Cooper as an "undesirable" person.
