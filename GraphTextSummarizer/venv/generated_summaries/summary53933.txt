Her victory made her the first woman ever to win two Olympic long-distance gold medals, and cemented her place as an Ethiopian national icon alongside fellow running legend Haile Gebreselassie (Addis Ababa city council subsequently named a school in her honor). In one of the most thrilling 10,000-meter races of all time Tulu overtook South Africa's Elana Meyer just before the bell, running the final lap in 64 seconds to win by 30 meters, in the process becoming the first ever black African woman to win Olympic gold. The race over, she waited at the line for Meyer, a white south African, the two women embracing before joining hands and setting off on an emotional lap of honor together draped in their respective national flags, a gesture that seemed to symbolize hope for a new Africa. In addition to her two Olympic titles Tulu has won a World Championship gold medal (2001), three World Cross Country titles and the London Marathon (2000). In the final, however, she came a disappointing eighth, leading many pundits to dismiss her chances of success at the following year's Barcelona Olympics.
