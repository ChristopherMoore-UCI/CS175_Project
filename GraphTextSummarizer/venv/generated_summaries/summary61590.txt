Stephanie Kercher, the victim's sister, demurred when asked if the family is ready to forgive Meredith's killer or killers. Not knowing why one jury two years ago convicted Knox and Sollecito of murder, sexual assault and other crimes related to Kercher's killing, while another said Monday they are innocent is "the greatest disappointment," Stephanie Kercher said. Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were dramatically cleared of the murder Monday, in a jury ruling that left Knox sobbing and almost unable to walk out of the court unaided. -- Murder victim Meredith Kercher's family cannot forgive anyone until they know the truth about her killing, Kercher's sister said Tuesday as Amanda Knox flew out of Italy, a free woman after four years. Kercher's mother, meanwhile, did not speak ill of Knox, even when asked what she thought of the American's assertion that her life had been destroyed by the ordeal.
