For its part, the TTP has developed both its alliances and capabilities closer to home, most notably joining forces with al Qaeda for the attack on a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan that killed seven CIA employees and contractors last December. Before he was killed by a drone strike last year, the group's then leader, Baitullah Mehsud (no direct relation to Hakimullah or Qari Hussain) told reporters: "Very soon we will take revenge from Amer­ica, not in Afghanistan but in Wash­ing­ton, which will amaze the entire world." They were under pledge to Baitullah Mehsud, and TTP has already claimed responsibility because of Spain's military presence in Afghanistan." But it was the Taliban's widening campaign against the state that led the Pakistani army to launch major offensives last year in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. The TTP's ambitions were at first confined to the tribal territories bordering Afghanistan.
