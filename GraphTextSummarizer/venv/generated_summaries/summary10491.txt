Only five acres were still burning Monday evening, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director James Bassham told CNN affiliate WATE. "Propane tanks have been exploding," Pigeon Forge Fire Chief Tony Watson said Sunday. Pigeon Forge, in eastern Tennessee, is best known for singer Dolly Parton's theme park, Dollywood, which was not affected by the fire. -- Heavy rains doused most of a wildfire that had damaged more than 35 buildings near the Tennessee resort town of Pigeon Forge, allowing authorities Monday to take firefighters off the line. About 150 people were evacuated Sunday and the American Red Cross opened a shelter at the Pigeon Forge Community Center.
