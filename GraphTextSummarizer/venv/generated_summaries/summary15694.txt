Schalke, who reached the semifinals of the Champions League this season, will play second division Duisburg in next Saturday's German Cup final. Hannover will also be playing in Europe's second-tier competition next season, finishing two points clear of Mainz after a 3-1 win over sixth-placed Nuremberg. Leverkusen needed a point in the final match of the Bundesliga season at Freiburg to clinch second place ahead of Bayern and condemn the defending champions to the qualifying rounds of the 2011-12 Champions League. It was an eventful closing round as champions Borussia Dortmund sent Eintracht Frankfurt down to the second division with a 3-1 home win, while 2009 champions Cologne earlier announced that former Copenhagen coach Stale Solbakken will take charge next season.
