What am I going to do?" As Arrick looked around the streets of New York and mulled his options, he marveled how the city's vast array of bakeries and cupcake shops kept growing and making money during a recession. While most cupcakes are, stereotypically, feminine or frilly, Arrick is keenly aware that he himself is playing on stereotypes with his use of bacon, beer and in-your-face manly advertising. Arrick said his growth is limited by storage and oven space, but he hopes to start shipping orders outside New York by the end of this year. His New York cupcake company, Butch Bakery, is an anomaly in a world seemingly dominated by all things dainty and cute. "The ones with alcohol are actually pretty potent," said David Barrineau, who ordered Butch cupcakes as a joke for the men and women in his advertising agency.
