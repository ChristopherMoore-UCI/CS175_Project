-- Youngster Thibaut Pinot claimed the eighth stage of the Tour de France as Bradley Wiggins retained his overall lead for Team Sky. Pinot, from France, is the Tour's youngest rider at 22 and held on after hitting the front with 2km to go, despite the overall leaders desperately trying to hunt him down. After Saturday's strong performance from Team Sky, which saw Wiggins take the yellow jersey and teammate Chris Froome win the stage, Wiggins survived a late attack on his lead. "It's a dream come true," Pinot told reporters, of his maiden stage win on what is his debut Tour. Though Cadel Evans finished second to FDJ-Bigmat's Pinot, he wasn't able to shave off any of Bradley Wiggin's lead as the Briton preserved his ten second advantage. Evans, riding for the BMC team, and Italian Vincenzo Nibali, of Liquigas, cranked up the pressure in the final stages but Wiggins did enough to record the same time and keep his nose in front.
