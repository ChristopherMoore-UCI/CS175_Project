Lala was wounded in the attack and told authorities he played dead to fool his captors, Last week, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa revealed that a man from Honduras had also survived the attack. In El Salvador, authorities have started an investigation to identify who were the Salvadorans' guides as they headed north through Mexico. The growing reach of drug cartels has increased the risk for migrants crossing through Mexico to get to the United States, Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights said. In Ecuador, authorities detained a man they say was responsible for coordinating Lala's passage to Mexico. "He is already in the United States and fortunately avoided being killed," President Mauricio Funes told reporters Sunday as the remains of 11 Salvadorans who were killed in last month's massacre were returned to their families in a somber ceremony.
