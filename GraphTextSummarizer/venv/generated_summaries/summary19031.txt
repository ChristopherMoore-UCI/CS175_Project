The facility is surrounded by pro-Russian civilians who call themselves a "civil defense group," backed up by masked, armed men in green combat fatigues, presumed to be Russian soldiers. Shiroki, 35, from Yalta, opposes the Russian invasion, and the proposed rejoining of Crimea to Russia. Biscuits with Crimean jam were served up at a pro-Russian militia recruitment center, with a portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin watching over. One of Shiroki's friends brought food to Ukrainian soldiers at a military base in Perevalnoe, near Simferopol, and told Shiroki he was stopped by soldiers about 20 times on the way. "He says that Russia is more rich than Ukraine and we will have stability," Shiroki said.
