Payroll taxes, cut to 4.2% from 6.2% last year, would be lowered to 3.1% to provide middle-class families with up to $1,500 more in their paychecks next year. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that the question is whether "it is worth giving 160 million Americans, taxpayers, a tax break of $1,500 by asking 300,000 Americans to pay a little more." Both Carney and Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York noted that the issue is turning in their favor, with Republican opposition to the Democratic plan softening. Despite the outcome of the votes, a softening of Republican opposition to extending the lower payroll tax rate raised expectations for eventual congressional passage of a compromise plan. The GOP opposition wavered Wednesday when Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said his party would support an extension of the payroll tax cut, but opposed a tax increase to pay for it. House Republican leaders are working on their own proposal to extend unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut, but several GOP aides told CNN it was unclear if these extensions would be rolled into one bill or end up as separate legislative proposals.
