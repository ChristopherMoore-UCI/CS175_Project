-- Embattled Romanian President Traian Basescu declared victory late Sunday after low voter turnout appeared to doom a referendum on whether to remove him from office. Ponta succeeded in getting lawmakers to not only suspend Basescu, but to remove both speakers of parliament and replace them with allies. Basescu has been suspended since the USL-led parliament voted to impeach him in early July, saying he overstepped his authority by ordering wage and benefit cuts for public workers. " After the polls closed at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), he said voters had rejected a "coup" by Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the interim president, Crin Antonescu. That led Ponta to say Basescu "should strongly consider whether he is still legitimate or not in the office.
