"The Republicans continue to cling to this really Paleozoic commitment (to oppose same-sex marriage)... even going so far as saying we should... explore amending the Constitution to prohibit people from being able to marry who they love," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Tuesday on MSNBC's "The Daily Rundown." Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was on the same MSNBC program Tuesday before Wasserman Schultz. While a wave of Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama didn't start endorsing same-sex marriage until the past two years, Wasserman Schultz blasted Republicans for long being "completely out of touch with the issues that are the most important to voters right now. GOP's position Republicans largely stayed quiet on the issue, though Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and some social conservative leaders expressed outrage by what they described as the courts' judicial activism. " Her comments came after a Supreme Court decision Monday effectively cleared the way for same-sex marriage in five states and possibly an additional six states located in the same circuit appeals courts.
