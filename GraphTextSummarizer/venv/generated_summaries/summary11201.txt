A few days earlier than planned, the Obama administration announced Wednesday that nearly 365,000 people signed up for health coverage under new exchanges created by Obamacare in the first two months of enrollment. " Sebelius shot back that health insurance under Obamacare remained private policies, requiring people to pay up before they get a card from the insurance company proving they were covered. Hours ahead of her appearance Wednesday before a House subcommittee certain to grill her on the botched launch of the Obamacare website, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced an internal review of what happened and why. "Every major promise the administration made about the ACA, from being able to keep your health plan if you like it, to being able to keep your doctor if you want to, the very premise of health reform in the first place, that the Affordable Care Act would make health coverage more affordable, has proven to be wrong," Pitts said. Some Republicans were concerned about problems with the "back-end" operations of the HealthCare.gov website, such as transmitting correct enrollment information to insurance companies.
