Indiana Senate race tighter after Lugar's defeat Already, nearly half a dozen moderate senators in both parties are retiring this year. In the case of Lugar, his opponent, Richard Mourdock, argued successfully to Indiana GOP voters that Lugar, a moderate, too often supported President Barack Obama's agenda. But the fact of the matter is that people like me -- and I think also people like Richard Mourdock, people that actually had tea party support -- we love this country. To win in Democratic Massachusetts, the Republican plays up crossing party lines, in this new ad called "Independent." But U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican swept into office on the tea party wave two years ago, suggested Lugar's harsh words for many in his party were mostly about his own personal loss.
