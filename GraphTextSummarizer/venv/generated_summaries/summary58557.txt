Jamie Waylett, 22, who appeared as Hogwarts school bully Vincent Crabbe in six Harry Potter films, was found guilty of violent disorder at Wood Green Crown Court, in north London. Rioting first broke out in Tottenham, north London, in the wake of a peaceful protest over the fatal shooting of a local man by police. He also pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods during rioting last August, according to court documents posted online. According to London's Metropolitan Police, across the city there were more than 3,800 arrests for a variety of offenses, including burglary, arson and violent disorder. "Anyone watching the footage in this case can only imagine the mayhem that took place on the streets," Judge Simon Carr said, according to court documents.
