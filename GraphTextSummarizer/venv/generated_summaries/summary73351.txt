The trainer was treated and released from the hospital after the incident earlier this month, MGM Resorts spokesman Gordon Absher said in a statement Wednesday. The male lion then shifts his body weight and looks at the trainer nearest to him before the camera turns its focus to the other lion and second trainer. "Incidents where animal handlers are bitten are very rare," Absher said, adding that the trainer "is in good health and anxious to return to work." -- MGM Resorts defended its safety practices Wednesday after amateur video surfaced showing a lion attacking its trainer inside its habitat at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, as horrified visitors to the hotel looked on. MGM's Absher defended the lion habitat in his statement Wednesday, saying the handlers "uphold the highest safety standards at all times."
