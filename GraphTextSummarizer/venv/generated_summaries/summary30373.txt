" Nadal, who was beaten in last year's final by Novak Djokovic, missed large spells of the 2007 season due to knee problems and had to withdraw from the 2008 end-of-season championship plus the Davis Cup final due to similar troubles. However, he managed to play a full clay-court season, winning three titles before clinching a record seventh French Open at Roland Garros. The French Open champion has a history of knee problems, and has not played since a surprise second-round defeat at Wimbledon in June. "I am very sad to announce that I am still not ready to play and have to withdraw from this year's U.S. Open in NYC," Nadal told the U.S. Open website ahead of the season's final grand slam, which runs from August 27-September 9. In 2009, Nadal was unable to defend his Wimbledon title after he was diagnosed with tendinitis in both knees, and he has occasionally missed tournaments since to try to manage the problem.
