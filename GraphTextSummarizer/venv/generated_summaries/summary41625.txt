Now Facebook says it's implementing new standards for which pages or groups may have advertising placed on them. In May, Facebook was targeted by a coalition of women's organizations complaining about pages or groups that seemed to celebrate or make light of violence against women. -- Starting Monday, Facebook will no longer allow ads on pages that contain sexual or violent content. "Our goal is to both preserve the freedoms of sharing on Facebook but also protect people and brands from certain types of content," the post reads. As part of the campaign, the groups petitioned Facebook advertisers.
