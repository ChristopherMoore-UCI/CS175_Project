Red Bull driver Vettel has finished in the top-two in 10 of the season's opening 11 races, but two-time world champion Alonso has vowed to give his all in the year's remaining eight rounds in an attempt to catch the German. The Spaniard Alonso sits fourth in the drivers' standings, 89 points behind current leader and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel. " Alonso has picked up only one race win in 2011, at July's British Grand Prix, but he has set his sights on an improved run of form when the sport returns from its mid-season break in Belgium later this month. "In Spa [the home of the Belgian Grand Prix] I have never won in Formula One and it would be nice to do that, then comes Monza which is special and I would like to feel again the amazing feeling I got from it last year. -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso has said the Italian team have a "moral obligation" to keep fighting for the 2011 Formula One world championship until the end of the season.
