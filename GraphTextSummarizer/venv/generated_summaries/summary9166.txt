And if you were already adding poor countries, shouldn't we add agencies that address poor country concerns? Accordingly, President Valery Giscard D'Estaing proposed a new kind of summit for the leaders of the world's six largest economies: two days at a location outside a capital city, to be followed by a bland communique that sent the message: "If we told you what we discussed at our confidential talks, then they would not be confidential talks, would they?" The first meeting was held at Rambouillet, some 25 miles outside of Paris. Then the leaders of Britain and other major countries could organize amongst themselves some informal talks, no particular agenda, just get-to-know-you, hear what's on your mind ... And yes, sometimes they scheduled bilateral meetings to discuss particular pieces of business. Yes, the leaders encountered each other at the U.N. General Assembly and other big useless crushes.
