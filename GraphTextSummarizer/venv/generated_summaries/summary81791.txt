While the United States is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- U.S. officials usually do not comment on suspected drone strikes. -- Two suspected drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region Wednesday killed eight suspected militants, intelligence officials said. In the first incident, one missile was fired on a militant hideout in the area of Mir Ali of North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, the two intelligence officials said. The drone fired two missiles at a vehicle in the Data Khel area of North Waziristan. Later, a second suspected U.S. drone strike killed three individuals believed to be militants, the officials said.
