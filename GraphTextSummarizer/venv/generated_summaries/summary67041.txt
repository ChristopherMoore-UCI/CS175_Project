The Dutch may not have been producing the free flowing football of their qualifying group but offered a threat at set pieces with Rafael van der Vaart producing a curling effort from the right which van Nistelrooy should have converted. Both sides were relying on the counter attack in a cagey tactical affair and just after the half hour mark a classic Russian break saw Arshavin bear down on the Dutch goal to send in a low curler which Edwin van der Sar tipped around the post. The Dutch keeper then had to be alert to keep out Pavlyuchenko for a second goal and Russia looked to be holding on for victory until van Nistelrooy struck in typical style with five minutes remaining. Roman Pavlyuchenko put Guus Hiddink's men ahead in the the 56th minute and they looked to be going through in normal time until Ruud van Nistelrooy stole an 86th minute equalizer for the Dutch. Arshavin fittingly sealed victory as he received the ball from a throw-in and somehow beat van der Sar at the near post.
