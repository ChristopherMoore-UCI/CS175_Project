These and many other universities have also become involved with the HathiTrust, an organization set up to help them archive and distribute digital works; the HathiTrust is also named as a defendant. If attempts to locate and contact any copyright holders fail, and the work is no longer commercially available, the Hathitrust will start providing digital copies to students without restrictions. The suit suggests that the security of this archive is also suspect, and may allow the mass release of copyrighted work. These libraries partnered with Google to get their book digitization efforts off the ground and, in return, Google has provided them with digital copies of the works. Now, several groups that represent book authors have filed suit against those universities, attempting to block both digital lending and an orphaned works project.
