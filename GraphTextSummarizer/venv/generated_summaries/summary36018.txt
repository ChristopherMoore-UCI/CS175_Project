Wilmore hosted a 10-minute panel discussion on the "state of protests" in the nation, featuring U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, rapper/activist Talib Kweli, comedian Bill Burr and show contributor Shenaz Treasury. After success as a writer for "In Living Color," "Sister, Sister" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," he turned producer with "The PJs," the animated Eddie Murphy show, and the offbeat "Bernie Mac Show." "I knew Hollywood wasn't going to find me," he told New York magazine of his acting years, when the standard casting call wanted black men closer to Eddie Murphy's fast-talking types. Making a point about the perception of black men in America, Wilmore asked the sharp-dressed senator from New Jersey a rhetorical question. This film's message is as poignant today as it was when I was a kid," he said, as he prepared to dress down the Academy Awards and its snub of black talent in this year's nomination.
