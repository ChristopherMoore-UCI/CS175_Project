The wreck occurred in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh state, said Atul Fulzele, the district police chief. More than 105,000 people were killed in traffic crashes in 2006, according to World Health Organization report released this year. At least 29 passengers were killed and 20 others injured as a bus fell into a gorge in northern India Friday, police said. About half a million people are injured by traffic crashes that year, the report said. The India government said this year it has launched a campaign to reduce road-crash deaths by 50 per cent by 2012.
