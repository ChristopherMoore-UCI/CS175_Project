He also said it was "absolutely clear" that Ahmadinejad's chief rival in the election, Mir Hossein Moussavi, has "captured the imagination or the spirit of forces within Iran" and has become a representative of street protesters, who have clashed with security forces. Ahmadinejad's remarks raised the issue of the new dynamics between longtime adversaries Iran and the United States. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad chided President Obama on Saturday for "meddling" in Iran. Ahmadinejad spoke a day after Obama discussed the unrest in Iran during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama said he and Merkel "share the belief that what's happened in Iran is unacceptable when it comes to violence against its own citizens."
