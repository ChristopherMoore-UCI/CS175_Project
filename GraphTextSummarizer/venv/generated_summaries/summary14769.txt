The Daily Telegraph claims a company owned by former Executive Committee member Jack Warner invoiced one owned by Qatar's former FIFA vice-president and Asian football chief Mohammed Bin Hammam for a substantial sum of funds within a month of the 2022 voting decision. -- Leading former FIFA insider Alexandra Wrage is calling for a new vote over the selection of the 2022 World Cup hosts given the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision to award Qatar the event. FIFA's Ethics Committee, headed by the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York -- Michael Garcia -- is also busy, currently investigating allegations of corruption regarding the vote for the 2022 World Cup site. The Qatari World Cup committee as well as prominent FIFA officials have steadfastly denied the allegations. Yet former member Wrage -- an anti-corruption authority who resigned in April 2013 over frustration at what she described as FIFA's resistance to reform -- believes drastic action is needed to correct the decision to award the tournament to Qatar.
