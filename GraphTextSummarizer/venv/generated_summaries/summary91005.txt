On Tuesday night, Weiner tried painting the rivals on stage with him as all coming from the same political establishment that has long governed New York. About halfway through the debate, Weiner said, "My fellow New Yorkers, this is the problem," referring to his rivals, who had just been arguing with one another on stage. While being mayor of New York is indeed akin to being in the eye of a media storm, what's happening to candidate Weiner is different. -- When the doors opened onto WABC's New York studios after the televised Democratic mayoral debate Tuesday night, reporters rushed in to surround two people. "Not for nothing," countered City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, "you were in government your whole career until you had to resign from government, so I'm not sure why you're finger-pointing at people in government."
