Next up, Disney will re-release "Monsters, Inc." (out Dec. 19), and next year will bring 3-D re-releases of two more Star Wars films, as well as Jurassic Park and The Little Mermaid â€” and those are just the films we've already heard about. Though the family film, which was converted into 3-D for less than $5 million, was expected to top the chart, Nemo was unable to match the numbers of Disney's recent 3-D re-releases "The Lion King," which debuted with $30.2 million in September 2011, or even Beauty and the Beast, which began with $17.8 million earlier this year. Audiences issued the film a "C+" CinemaScore grade Disney's 3-D re-release "Finding Nemo" made a more modest splash in second place with $17.5 million. The original Resident Evil earned $17.7 million in 2002. "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" grossed $23.0 million in 2004.
