New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took on the role of the consoler on Tuesday in the wake of the weekend's shooting of two New York police officers, following in the footsteps of many before him that have had to knit the city back together following tragedy. The ANSWER Coalition, a protest group in New York City, said de Blasio's call for a hiatus to the protests was "misguided" and "meant to chill the expression of free speech rights." "Instead of remaining silent, it is all the more important for people around the country to stay active and demand an end to the epidemic of police violence that is ravaging black and Latino communities throughout the United States," the statement said, noting that a protest planned for Tuesday evening would go on. He also faces frustration from his progressive base as well, which helped elect him on a platform of police reform and has increased calls for action in the wake of the recent killings of two unarmed African-American men at the hands of white police officers. And police officers turned their backs on de Blasio this weekend as he entered the hospital where the bodies of the officers lay. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another expected presidential contender, dodged a question on whether de Blasio was to blame for an anti-police atmosphere in New York City, saying in an interview it's not the time for politics.
