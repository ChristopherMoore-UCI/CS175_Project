The congregation enjoyed it so much that it was repeated during Christmas services, and "Jingle Bells" took off from there. Then there are Jimmy Boyd's "All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth", The Singing Dogs version of "Jingle Bells" and Homer and Jethro's "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer." Among the most familiar are the pop songs: "Santa Claus is Coming To Town," which the Four Seasons, Bruce Springsteen and Bing Crosby all performed; Gene Autry's "Here Comes Santa Claus"; Elvis Presley's "Blue Christmas"; and Brenda Lee's "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree." Then there's a good Christmas story. If there were a marketing campaign for Christmas, it would be the most successful campaign ever devised.
