Theirs is the state where our historic civil rights movement began, where King and his followers developed a model of nonviolent activism that changed not only Birmingham and Alabama and the South, but our entire nation. This week, a delegation of African American labor and civil rights leaders are visiting Alabama to support Latino families who face hostilities all too familiar to what King saw in 1963. "Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application," King also wrote in "Letter From Birmingham Jail," where he was imprisoned for nonviolent civil disobedience. In these harsh economic times, we are more than ever wearing the "single garment of destiny" of which King wrote in his "Letter From Birmingham Jail." When families are threatened if they dare organize or speak out, America is threatened.
