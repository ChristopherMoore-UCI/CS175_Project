The 29-year-old is facing a charge of affray after an incident in the early hours of December 29, when he attacked businessman Marcus McGee following a dispute about the music that was being played. They had been involved in an argument after Gerrard tried to change the music on the bar's sound system, but McGee would not let him, the UK Press Association reported. Gerrard said that his friends had earlier told him to "forget" the argument, but he felt he needed to confront McGee. " Gerrard said he was unaware that his friend John Doran had already punched McGee when he himself started to hit the 34-year-old. Gerrard, who denies the charge, told a judge on Thursday that he was sorry about his actions in Southport's Lounge Inn, but at the time he thought McGee was going to attack him.
