On a recent morning, 380 new patients registered for treatment -- most of them women and children, suffering from diarrhea and heat stroke. This is Jalozai refugee camp near Peshawar, suddenly almost a city in its own right as thousands flee the violence raging between the Pakistani army and Taliban fighters. These children are among the thousands of refugees this month at the Jalozai camp in western Pakistan. "They are complaining of fear, phobias, palpitations and all symptoms seem to have started since they arrive in this camp," said Abid Farooqi, with the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. The United Nations estimates that it's the biggest movement of people in Pakistan since the country was formed in 1947.
