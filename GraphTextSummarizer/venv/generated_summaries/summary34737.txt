"I believe in the words of Dr. King that there is such a thing as being too late." Actions taken so far In June 2013, Obama announced a plan to cut carbon pollution, including directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to establish new emission standards for active coal plants in the United States, and working with other countries including China and India -- two of the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases -- to establish new plans for addressing pollution globally.

He also announced measures to help developing countries better prepare for climate change. President Barack Obama told a United Nations meeting on Tuesday that pollution must be contained to address climate change.
