"Breast-feeding is welcome anywhere at the airport, but the Mamava unit will provide a comfortable place for nursing mothers who might want more privacy (or for babies who might need fewer distractions)," the company said. Mamava hopes to put pods in other airports or public places like conference centers and malls, Mayer says. A bathroom stall is often the only option, but it's less than desirable -- imagine sitting on a public toilet while balancing a pump (or baby), listening to the sound of flushing toilets all around and knowing other women can hear the kshhh-kshhh of the pump every few seconds. She had to find ways of pumping while at trade shows, airports, corporate retreats, baseball games and rafting trips, so she began thinking of a product that would make things easier for other mothers facing the same challenges. -- It's a pod-like structure a bit larger than a photo booth, and a Vermont company is hoping it will make life a little easier for nursing mothers who are away from home.
