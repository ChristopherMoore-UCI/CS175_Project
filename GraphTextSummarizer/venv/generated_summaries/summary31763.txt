In the countryside of central and southern Peru where the rebels were strongest, Sendero waged an assassination campaign against government officials, the heads of state-owned farming collectives, business owners and even peasants who opposed the guerrillas. A turning point came in September 1992, when the government captured Sendero leader Abimael Guzman in a Lima apartment. Perhaps most famously, Sendero set off a bomb outside the U.S. Embassy in Lima in March 2002, a few days before President George W. Bush was to visit. Peruvian officials now say Fujimori took the war against the Sendero too far, and he was convicted this year of human rights abuses. And that idea, Alexander, Aronson and others say, has its roots in poor economic conditions and the lack of social justice.
