A week after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spent his time locking in support from the Republican establishment's top GOP donors, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney set fire to the political world on Friday when he signaled to a roomful of donors that he's seriously considering a 2016 presidential bid. But like a pair of other Republican governors with presidential ambitions, Walker could face some questions on his handling of his state's economy in an eventual campaign. Paul Ryan a no-go As Romney is jumping back in, his former running mate Rep. Paul Ryan is shutting down speculation over a presidential run of his own. The move could set up a battle of political heavyweights between the Romney and Bush operations -- one few expected just last week. Romney is also headed to a Republican National Committee meeting near San Diego this week, a get together that will include other potential 2016ers including Ben Carson, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Gov. Rick Perry.
