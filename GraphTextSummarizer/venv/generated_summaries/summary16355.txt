Horner, whose best finish in the Tour de France is 10th place, also played a similar role for the now disgraced Lance Armstrong with the Astana and RadioShack squads, but has achieved his best results since his infamous compatriot retired. The oldest rider in today's professional peloton is Germany's Jens Voigt, who turns 42 on Tuesday, but now rides as a support rider for Horner's RadioShack team. At an age when most professional sportsmen are long retired, Horner has claimed one of cycling's three Grand Tours, the other races being the famed Tour de France and the Giro. Australian Michael Matthews won the final stage after a bunch sprint, but all the focus was on Horner in the red jersey of overall leader as he finished safely in the main bunch. Initially taking the lead on the third of 21 stages, Horner battled 2010 Vuelta winner Nibali throughout the three-week long endurance test.
