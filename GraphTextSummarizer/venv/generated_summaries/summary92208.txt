The tribunal says it asked Lebanese authorities on June 30 to arrest Badreddine, Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hussein Hassan Oneissi and Assad Hassan Sabra. Prosecutors concede in the indictment that the charges are based heavily on circumstantial evidence, but they argue that such information "can be stronger than direct evidence" because it does not rely on things like potentially faulty witness accounts. -- The special court trying to bring the killers of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to justice published Wednesday previously secret details of the case against four men it has charged. Cassese issued the statement after Lebanese authorities told him they had been unable to serve the accused warrants and arrest them. Badreddine was the ringleader, prosecutors charge.
