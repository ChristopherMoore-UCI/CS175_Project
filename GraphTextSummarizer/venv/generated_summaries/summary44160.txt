Despite steep decreases in state funding for universities, state and federal agencies provide the largest share of money to public universities for research and related activities. Flagship public universities educate more of the brightest high school students than private universities in many states. Leaders of public universities in other states face equally strong pressures to go. University leaders are an endangered species because they are wedged between opposing and powerful pressures that are undermining public universities. Reforms to public universities are indeed necessary, but they will not emerge effectively from political attacks and vindictive cuts.
