These are neighborhoods around Colorado Springs, where a strange takeover of tumbleweeds started last week. Unusually high winds are blamed for the influx of tumbleweeds into neighborhoods south of Colorado Springs, according to CNN's affiliate KCNC-TV. Whitney Grant, 27, also a Colorado Springs resident, says tumbleweeds are a familiar sight. Colorado residents are using rakes and even snowplows to clean up these pesky, dried plants, especially because they can pose a fire hazard during dry conditions. Askew, who works for the U.S. military, has been living in the area for 14 years and said he has never seen tumbleweeds like this before.
