Looking to turn a few degrees in his long-awaited "pivot to Asia," President Barack Obama embarks on Tuesday on a four-country tour of the region in the hopes of convincing Pacific allies the United States remains focused on them. While there aren't any major announcements expected on this week's trip, Obama officials hope the visits will yield progress toward showing America's commitment to each country, and the region as a whole. But like Obama's last attempts to renew diplomatic and economic attention on Asia, this trip comes amid distractions: unrest in Ukraine, recent transportation disasters at two of his stops, and wary lawmakers back home who aren't on board with Obama's plan to expand trade. "Strong messaging on the U.S. commitment to the region I think is an important way to try to compensate or try to fill that gap." Administration officials say U.S. alliances in Asia have remained strong despite several years of flashpoints in other parts of the world. Last week, Obama said the tragedy was "heartbreaking."
