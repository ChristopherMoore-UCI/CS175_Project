-- A suspected U.S. drone struck and killed targets in Pakistan's tribal region Friday, the first such attack since American troops killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden north of Islamabad earlier this week. The U.S. operation targeting bin Laden intensified discord and highlighted the mistrust between Pakistan and the United States, which did not inform the Pakistanis of the raid in the military garrison town of Abbottabad. Last month, 44 people were killed in a drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region and the government of Pakistan formally asked the U.S. government for an apology. Two Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN that 12 suspected militants were killed in the assault in the Data Khel region of North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. Imran Khan -- head of a right-wing political party in Pakistan -- has warned that his party and followers will disrupt the flow of supplies through Pakistan to NATO troops in Afghanistan if the strikes aren't stopped.
