-- President Barack Obama got a second term from voters and another chance with Chief Justice John Roberts. They were concerned enough about the small stumble in the sequencing of words on the inaugural platform that Obama and Roberts went through it again the next day in private in the White House Map Room - just to make sure they were square with the Constitution. That was not the case four years ago when Obama and Roberts also performed the honor twice. During that inaugural, Obama and Roberts fumbled the oath before 1.8 million people. It all started when Roberts recited a seven-word phrase, but Obama broke in halfway through and repeated the first three words.
