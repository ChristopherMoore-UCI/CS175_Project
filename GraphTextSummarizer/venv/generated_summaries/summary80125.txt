"Even with the SR-71, at Mach 3, there was still time to notify that the plane was coming, but at Mach 6, there is no reaction time to hide a mobile target," Brad Leland,  Lockheed Martin's program manager for hypersonics, told Aviation Week and Space Technology. "Speed is the new stealth," Aviation Week quoted Al Romig, engineering and advanced systems vice president at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division, as saying. A smaller-scale model of the SR-72 could begin testing in five years and be in the air in 10, Leland told Aviation Week. All that changes with the SR-72," Lockheed Martin says. "We have been continuing to invest company funds, and we are kind of at a point where the next steps would require large-scale testing, which would significantly increase the level of investment we've had to make to-date," Leland told Aviation Week.
