I felt the need to defend my intentions and stand up for my honor and convince every single naysayer that "Sweetness" was a detailed, exhaustively researched biography that delves into the ... blah, blah, blah. The portrait of Payton that already existed in the popular consciousness had been an overly simplistic (ie: mindless) one: The hard-nosed gridiron warrior who cracked lots of jokes and always had time for the fans. He went on to star at Jackson State University, where his brightest moment came not on the football field, but as a finalist on the Soul Train National College Dance Championship (he and his partner, Mary Jones, finished second -- a setback that haunted Payton as much as his failure to score a touchdown in Super Bowl XX). When he retired after the 1987 season, Payton found himself searching for meaning in places where no meaning could be found. -- human, immediately rubbed many football fans (and, in particular, Chicago fans) the wrong way.
