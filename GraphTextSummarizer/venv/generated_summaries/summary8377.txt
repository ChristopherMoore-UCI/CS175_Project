Only two presidential sons have followed their fathers to the White House (John Quincy Adams and George W. Bush), and just one presidential family -- the Bushes -- has sent sons to the governor's mansion (Jeb Bush in Florida and George Bush in Texas). Kennedy's older sister, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, failed in her attempt to move from lieutenant governor of Maryland to governor, even though registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans 2-1, Wead said. It's a two-edged sword," said Doug Wead, a presidential historian and former adviser to President George H.W. Bush. Faced with complaints that his father, George H.W. Bush, reneged on his tax pledge and failed to bring an end to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, "the son tied all the loose ends and cleaned the slate, but at a great cost," Wead said. More recently, when George W. Bush took office, "he fought his father's old battles literally," Wead said.
