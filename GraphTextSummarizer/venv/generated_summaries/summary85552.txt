FIFA approved tougher penalties for racist behavior, including possible relegation, in a move that one anti-racism organization said will bring soccer "in line" with other sports. "FIFA is setting an example to bring football in line with other sports which don't have problems around discrimination and unacceptable behavior." "It is something the organization has been campaigning on, and stricter punishments for discrimination more generally, for many years," chair Lord Herman Ouseley said on Kick It Out's Web site. Kick It Out, the anti-racist body, welcomed Friday's development. "There have been despicable events this year that have cast a long shadow over football and the rest of society," FIFA president Sepp Blatter said.
