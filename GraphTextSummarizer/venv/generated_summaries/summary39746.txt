Berlusconi turns Italy into a political Circus Maximus Editors' Note: This article has been edited to remove plagiarized content after CNN discovered multiple instances of plagiarism by Marie-Louise Gumuchian, a former CNN news editor. The Italian Senate voted Wednesday to expel former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from parliament after his conviction for tax fraud. Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in October last year over deals involving Mediaset, and the verdict was upheld in August. For years, he has also been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached the Italian courts. At a news conference Tuesday, Berlusconi's lawyers dismissed as "an absolutely unreal possibility" that he could face further criminal charges for other cases.
