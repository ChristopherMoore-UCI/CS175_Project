"Why should courts differentiate flooding from the myriad other instances of government occupation or invasion of property?" The dispute is narrow and unique in many ways, but could clarify the standards for determining the scope, length of time, and impact of government actions affecting many property owners -- private and public. "Removing temporary flooding from Taking Clause inspection would be out of sync with our recognition that, as a rule, temporary takings may be compensable," said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Constitution's Fifth Amendment forbids "private property be taken for public use without just compensation." The Obama administration on Tuesday lost a Supreme Court fight over property rights that centered on a series of federally controlled and managed floods that caused major timber damage along an Arkansas river. Even thought the land in question is state property, all sides have treated the land as "private" in nature for purposes of settling the "takings" dispute.
