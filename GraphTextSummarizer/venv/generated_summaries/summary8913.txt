Others sentenced include a former Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate spokeswoman, Sevgi Erenerol, who got a life sentence; Kemal Guruz, former head of Turkey's Council of Higher Education, who received a sentence of 13 years; author Ergun Poyraz, 29 years and seven months; Istanbul government official Gurbuz Capan, one year and three months; and academician Umit Sayin, four years. More than 60 of the 267 suspects have been in detention -- in some cases for years -- as the court case has slowly proceeded. The military people with life sentences include retired Gens. Supporters of the process say the once-dominant military has a half-century history of overthrowing at least four governments in Turkey and meddling in civilian political affairs. The former head of Turkey's military was sentenced to life in prison Monday in the controversial Ergenekon case.
