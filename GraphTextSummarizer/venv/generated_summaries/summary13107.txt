Same-sex couples marry in Michigan before court halts licenses Appeals court scrutinizes Virginia same-sex marriage ban Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond, said Friday that he expects more challenges in state courts to same-sex marriage prohibitions. "Plaintiffs have preferred to sue in federal courts in the apparent belief that they are a more favorable venue, or that federal judges will view their rights more broadly," said Tobias. But it's similar to a spate of federal rulings in recent months that have struck down other states' bans on same-sex marriage. Arkansas' Supreme Court on Friday afternoon stopped any more same-sex marriages in the state, a court spokeswoman said, leaving the legal status of more than 400 gay and lesbian couples who got marriage licenses in limbo.
