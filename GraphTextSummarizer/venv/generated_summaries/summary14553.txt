Parks and Wildlife Service spokesman Chris Arthur said it was not unusual for whales and dolphins to strand together. Over 90 percent of Australia's mass whale strandings occur in Tasmania, according to the Parks and Wildlife Service. Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service said the whales had been put back to sea at high tide. The 54 pilot whales were among a group of 192 that beached themselves a day earlier on King island, which lies between Tasmania and the southeastern tip of Australia. In November 2004, a group of 97 long-finned whales and bottle nosed dolphins beached at Sea Elephant Bay in King Island.
