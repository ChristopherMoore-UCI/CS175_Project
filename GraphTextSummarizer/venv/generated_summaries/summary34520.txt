" Liverpool must now wait and see how Manchester City gets on against Aston Villa on Wednesday night. "It is 99 goals we have scored, which is a phenomenal achievement by the team -- but you have to defend," Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told the BBC. Victory for City would leave it requiring victory in its final home game against West Ham to seal the title. And with just two minutes of normal time remaining, Gayle lashed home an unlikely equalizer to break Liverpool hearts. But Palace hit back in style -- scoring three dramatic, late goals to snatch a point and leave Manchester City in pole position to win its second Premier League crown.
