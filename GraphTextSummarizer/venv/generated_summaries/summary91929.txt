As well as legacy-building, the likelihood of Obama concentrating more on foreign policy also reflects domestic U.S. politics. Intensified U.S. focus on the Middle East has accentuated a shift, common to many recent re-elected presidents, of increased focus on foreign policy in second terms of office. Many re-elected presidents in the post-war era have, like Obama, found it difficult to acquire domestic policy momentum. Since he was elected in 2008, Asia in general, and China in particular, has assumed greater importance in U.S. policy. Another factor encouraging foreign policy focus in second terms is the fact that re-elected presidents have often been impacted by domestic scandals in recent decades.
