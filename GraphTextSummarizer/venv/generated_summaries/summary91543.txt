Lebanon's national news agency said a southern Lebanese army post came under fire from Israeli forces, prompting Lebanese soldiers to fire back. Israeli and Lebanese forces traded fire Monday, with each blaming the other for the exchange. Fifteen Israeli soldiers advanced 50 meters inside Lebanese territories, security sources told the news agency. Israel said its soldiers were fired upon while on routine patrol along Lebanon's border. UNIFIL troops are deployed along the Blue Line separating Lebanon and Israel to reduce tensions between the two sides.
