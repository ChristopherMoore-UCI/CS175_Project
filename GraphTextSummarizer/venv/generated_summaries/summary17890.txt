Pakistan, India hit by deadly flooding Flooding last year killed 470 people and impacted 9.1 million others, Kamal said. -- Floods resulting from monsoon rains have killed 422 people and left nearly 3,000 injured across Pakistan, a disaster agency spokesman said Saturday. Pakistan has suffered a series of devastating inundations, affecting millions of people, in recent years. In the worst-affected area of Sindh province, in southeastern Pakistan, the waters submerged more than 4.5 million acres of farming land, damaging an estimated 80% of cash crops. Much of the land inundated in 2010 was in Punjab province, Pakistan's breadbasket, where many people live off the soil and their livestock.
