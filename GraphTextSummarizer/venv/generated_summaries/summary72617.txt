"The second-class treatment of Filipino World War II veterans is another example from this historical period. The U.S. military promised full veterans benefits to Filipinos who volunteered to fight. Some historians say financial concerns were paramount: The cost of funding full veterans benefits to all those Filipinos, particularly in the wake of the costly war, would have been a heavy burden. Families of deceased veterans are not eligible to receive the money. "There can be no question but that the Philippine veteran is entitled to benefits bearing a reasonable relation to those received by the America veteran, with whom he fought side by side," he said.
