Meanwhile, Calderon's administration has said it is dealing severe blows to organized crime, citing such examples as the seizure of an estimated $12 billion in drugs. -- As criticism of his war on organized crime mounts, Mexican President Felipe Calderon is under increasing pressure to introduce a new security policy. Mexican Secretary of Public Security Genaro Garcia Luna has also proposed eliminating 2,000 local councils to strengthen security in areas with a strong presence of organized crime. Calderon, whose term ends in 2012, has proposed a plan to eliminate more than 2,000 local police forces, combine them with state law enforcement agencies and unite them under federal control. "This initiative is a response to the people's demand to have reliable police, and the necessity to strengthen the institutions of security in order to face the criminals that plague Mexico," he said earlier this year.
