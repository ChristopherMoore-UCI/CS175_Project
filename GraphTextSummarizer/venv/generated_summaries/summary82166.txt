Communist Party leaders have often acknowledged that corruption is so endemic that, in Xi's words, "Corruption could lead to the collapse of the Party [Communist Party of China] and the downfall of the State Zhou Yongkang, 71, who used to be one of the most powerful Communist Party politicians in China is now under investigation for corruption. The fact that the announcement of Zhou's investigation did not make a huge destabilizing impact in China shows that the public has been prepared for it, or the public has been made to believe that corruption is so pervasive amongst senior part officials that it is no longer shocking. By targeting Zhou, Xi is showing his resolve to target not only "flies" (minor officials) but also "tigers" (senior officials). Is this move politically motivated simply to get rid of Xi's real or potential political enemies, and if so, could that trigger panic or destabilization within the Communist Party leadership?
