" In Washington, as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe conducts a state visit to the United States, former Korean sex slave Lee Yong-soo makes a tearful plea to him, demanding an official apology for Japan's sexual enslavement of an estimated 200,000 comfort women, mostly Korean and Chinese. "When it comes to the comfort women sex slave system, it is pretty much unique to Japan. They fear his government is trying to whitewash the past, to appease conservatives who feel comfort women were paid prostitutes, not victims of official military policy. "If we didn't go, we'd be considered traitors," Instead of going to a sewing factory, Kim says she ended up in Japanese military brothels in half a dozen countries. Tokyo maintains its legal liability for the wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral claims treaty signed in 1965 between South Korea and Japan.
