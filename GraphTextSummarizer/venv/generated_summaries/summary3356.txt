-- If more women worked, Japan could add millions of employees to its rapidly shrinking workforce, a government study released Tuesday said. Total compensation for women equals about 40 percent of what men make in Japan, the government said. If women did not quit their jobs due to marriage or childbirth, the report says, Japan's workforce would increase by up to 4.5 million people. The annual document analyzes the role of women in the Japanese economy and, this year, urges more flexibility so women can maintain careers and raise children. By 2050, the government estimates 40 percent of Japan's population will be over the age of 65.
