The coroner's report recommends the two international federations over sliding sports -- which include bobsledding and luging -- conduct reviews about their involvement into track design and construction. Given the high speeds at the track, the International Luge Federation (FIL) asked the sliding center for more training days prior to the Olympics and required athletes to make numerous practice runs from various, lower parts of the course before graduating to the top of the course. "Following Mr. Kumaritashvili's fatal incident, questions arose regarding athlete safety at the Whistler track and more specifically, the design of the track and the unprecedented high speeds attained at this venue, such as the record speed of 153.98 km/h [about 95.68 mph]." Pawlowski said "further and greater scrutiny of safety issues at the track is advisable." "It may be that risk can never be fully eliminated from the realm of sliding sports," the report added. When the official luge competition started, male and female racers started from lower points on the luge track, which led to slower speeds.
