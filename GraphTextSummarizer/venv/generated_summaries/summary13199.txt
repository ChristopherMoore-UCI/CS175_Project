Taliban forces tried to overrun, successfully in some cases, several positions that coalition forces had secured inside the city, U.S. Marines told CNN. -- Twelve Afghan civilians were killed Sunday when two rockets fired by coalition forces in southern Afghanistan missed their intended target, as the Taliban showed stiff resistance to the NATO assault against the militant group. Overall, Messenger said, Taliban resistance had not prevented coalition efforts to hold meetings, known as shuras, with local leaders. Coalition forces fired two rockets with the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System at insurgents firing upon Afghan and ISAF forces, but they struck about 300 meters off their intended target, ISAF said. Coalition forces have also suspended use of the HIMARS pending a review of Sunday's incident.
