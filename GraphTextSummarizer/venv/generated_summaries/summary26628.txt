The U.S. government does not mandate any minimum amount of paid sick leave for workers. In our capitalist society, the task of providing necessary worker protections and family support has largely been left out of the hands of the government. We have only unpaid sick leave for those covered under FMLA protections, and then it's up to individual companies to determine their own polices toward sick leave. With the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Americans were guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year. America's policies to support workers and families are worse than any other country in the developed world and hardly better than some in the developing world.
