While results on the track have been disappointing, deputy team principal Claire Williams insists financial solvency is of greater importance. " While Mercedes are able to invest in pursuit of race wins, other teams face more stark financial realities. "The budget is always the most important thing -- securing more revenue than I did last year," Williams, whose father Frank Williams founded the team, told Formula One's official website. Lowe was recruited by Mercedes in January only for McLaren to remove him from his role as technical director and insist he sees out his contract, which was set to expire at the end of the current season. It was originally thought Lowe would replace current Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn, but he will now work alongside his fellow Briton as "executive director (technical)" from June 3.
