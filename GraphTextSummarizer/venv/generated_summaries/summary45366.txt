Cigarette packages will now carry one vivid color image and one of these warnings about the consequences of smoking: "Cigarettes are addictive"; "Tobacco smoke can harm your children"; "Cigarettes cause fatal lung disease"; "Cigarettes cause cancer"; "Cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease"; "Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby"; "Smoking can kill you"; "Tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in nonsmokers"; and "Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health." The new packaging and ads, which must be in place by September 2012, result from the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA), which mandates cigarette packs and advertisements have larger and "more visible graphic health warnings" as part of an effort to educate the public about the health risks associated with smoking. To the extent that FDA were to select warnings based on their ability to evoke negative or cognitive reactions -- not their ability to objectively inform consumers about the health risks of smoking -- such warnings would not pass constitutional muster," the company wrote. Countries such as Canada, Brazil and Australia have long been leaders in tobacco control and have had very graphic art on their packaging for years. -- Nine new graphic cigarette warning labels showing cancerous lesions and other impacts of smoking were unveiled Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration, part of the agency's sweeping new powers to regulate tobacco and tobacco products.
