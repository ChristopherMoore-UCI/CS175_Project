The Pentagon spends billions of dollars trying to detect and avoid improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan, but traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have become an expensive and troubling legacy of the wars -- responsible for a variety of injuries and long-term problems for military service members. And researchers point out that changes in treatment and improvements in recovery would have an impact not just in war zones, but on athletic fields, highways and everywhere brain injuries occur. "The committee strongly supports the provision of energy and protein to patients with severe TBI early after injury," the report says. -- New research suggests a high-calorie, high-protein diet may improve the outcome for some service members with brain injuries due to battlefield explosions. An Institute of Medicine report released Wednesday says improvements in nutrition may offer benefits just after a blast injury and calls for immediate changes.
