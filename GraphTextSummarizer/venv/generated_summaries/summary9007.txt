The current gold standard for time is the cesium clock, a type of atomic clock that an international body of experts has used to define what is the unit of one second: About 9.19 billion oscillations. Such clocks could also test alternative theories about the relationship between time and gravity. "The ytterbium optical lattice clock has demonstrated a groundbreaking, new level of clock stability," he said. Whereas scientists talk about billions of oscillations per second in the cesium clock, oscillations per second in the ytterbium clock approach one quadrillion per second, Ludlow said. In order to understand what's so special about this table-sized clock, it helps to have a little background: How clocks work Inside a clock is a mechanism that changes in some regular way, called an oscillator.
