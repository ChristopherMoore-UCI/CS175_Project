-- One of the world's largest platinum mines in back is operation after a strike, its owner announced Monday, following police violence last week that left 34 workers dead. The tragedy began unfolding a week ago when miners went on strike demanding pay increases at the mine in Marikana, near Rustenburg, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg. Lonmin said Sunday it was telling nonstriking workers that "police consider it safe to report for duty again" Monday morning and was ordering strikers to go back to work or face possible dismissals. The mood at the mine was "stable but tense" Monday, police said, after a strike over pay that has been marked by terrible violence. Last week, police fired on striking miners, killing 34 workers and wounding 78.
