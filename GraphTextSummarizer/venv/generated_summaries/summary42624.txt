"I saw how poor they were and realized that people were dying because they didn't have medical care," Webster said. Since 1993, Webster has been bringing medical relief to some of Peru's poorest and most remote areas through her nonprofit, now known as Amazon Promise. Webster -- described by a visiting doctor as "sort of a cross between Indiana Jones and Mother Teresa and Susan Sarandon" -- and her volunteers have provided free health care and education to more than 55,000 people. Each trip is staffed by adventure-seeking medical volunteers from the West -- often from U.S. medical schools -- and Peruvian health professionals. Nearly half of the area's population lives in poverty, and one-third of residents lack access to basic medical care, according to Peru's National Institute for Statistics and Information Technology.
