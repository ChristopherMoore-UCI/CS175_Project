The military has launched more than 10 offensives against violent extremists in northwest Pakistan in recent years, but for the United States, what matters most is North Waziristan, which U.S. officials call an epicenter of terrorism and a haven for the Haqqani network and other al Qaeda-linked militants killing American troops across the border in Afghanistan. The offensive is targeting militants in Kurram, one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said. Kurram is just north of North Waziristan and is believed to be a destination for many militants escaping other offensives in the region. A Pakistani military official said air force fighter jets were "softening" targets on the ground to open the way for ground troops. Washington has pressured Pakistan to launch a major offensive in North Waziristan, but the Pakistani military has refused.
