So Broussard started a group she called Houston Ground Angels, organizing volunteers to drive patients to and from Houston's airports and treatment centers for free. "I would pick up patients and drop them off ... and they would call a cab, and that was how it was done," said Broussard, who was part of a group of volunteer pilots who flew in patients from all over Texas. " Broussard placed an ad in the Houston Chronicle calling for volunteer drivers, and the response was overwhelming. " Houston, Texas, is home to many medical centers, including MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the world's premier cancer treatment facilities. The group also helps fly in patients from the Gulf Coast, Oklahoma and Arkansas by working with other volunteer flying organizations whose pilots cover part of the distance.
