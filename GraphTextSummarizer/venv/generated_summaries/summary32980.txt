"The UK service will have wireless Internet, spacious leather seats, more leg room and free newspapers," said Alex Warner, managing director of Greyhound UK. For inaugural Greyhound service in Britain, the company aimed to start with the best the United States has to offer, Warner added. We will introduce more of these services based on how well they are received in the UK," Warner said. Despite the added benefits, fares will still target the budget-conscious traveler in Britain, according to Warner. "Obviously, we wanted our services to reflect the nature of UK passengers."
