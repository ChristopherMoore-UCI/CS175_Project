Marriage laws in the states that tell the truth about marriage -- that it is a union of one man and one woman to provide children with a mom and a dad -- were not struck down. The Supreme Court on Wednesday announced disturbing decisions on two important cases regarding marriage law, but the high court refused to create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In its ruling on California's Proposition 8 (which defined marriage in that state as the union of one man and one woman), the Supreme Court declared that the citizen group that sponsored the initiative didn't have standing to defend the state constitutional amendment that millions of Californians voted to pass. In striking down Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the court declared that the federal government can't define marriage as the union of one man and one woman for its own policies and laws but must accept whatever the states decide about marriage. We must now work to protect marriage laws in 37 other states.
