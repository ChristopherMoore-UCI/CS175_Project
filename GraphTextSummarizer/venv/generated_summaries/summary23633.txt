The death toll from fighting between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in western Myanmar last week has risen to 84 and at least 22,500 people have been displaced by the sectarian violence, state media and the United Nations say. There has been tension between the Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims since May, when violence began in Rakhine state after three Muslim men were arrested on suspicion of raping and killing a Buddhist woman. The number of people who have fled their homes could be higher, with the country's government still checking the numbers of displaced people and those that have fled the violence by boat, he added. "Extremists in both communities have been empowered by a lack of accountability where people involved in sectarian violence haven't been bought to justice so it's a very, very bad situation and one that is getting worse," he told CNN. The worst fighting, according to the New Light of Myanmar, took place in Kyauktaw, a village in Rakhine state, where 12 people were killed.
