Creating pop for other people made her understand what songs need, she said, but as an artist turned writer, she was compassionate. "The thrill of writing songs for other people, when you get that right, that person's soul speaks to that song, you've done them a favor and the world a favor," she said. It happened show after show at the South by Southwest music festival, whether on sunny daytime stages, in dark clubs, or while rocking a ukulele, solo, in the middle of an Austin, Texas, street. She looked on the outside like she feels on the inside, LP said, and finally has the instruments and stage to express it. I never thought about songs on the radio, and who wrote them."
