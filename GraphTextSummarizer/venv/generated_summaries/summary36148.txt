CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said when she and two colleagues recently returned from reporting in Liberia, they got a mixed bag of responses from Customs and Border Protection officers. The unidentified man, who is being treated at a Dallas hospital, didn't show symptoms until several days after he arrived in the United States from Liberia. "We all said we were journalists who had just been in Liberia covering Ebola," Cohen said. But shortly after the news broke Tuesday evening, more than 50,000 tweets about Ebola flew through Twitter in a one-hour period, many of them panicked responses. "It's very unlikely that (Ebola victims) would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers," said Stephan Monroe of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
