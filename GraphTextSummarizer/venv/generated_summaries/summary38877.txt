Australia differed from New Zealand in holding a referendum on becoming a republic in 1999, despite the prime minister's monarchism and a divided Liberal Party. But in New Zealand opinion has been more evenly split between republicanism and support for a constitutional monarchy. Historically New Zealand was the more loyal dominion, and more economically dependent until Britain joined the EEC, a move that did not help monarchism.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key restored titular honors in 2009 after they had been abolished by a Labour government in 2000.
