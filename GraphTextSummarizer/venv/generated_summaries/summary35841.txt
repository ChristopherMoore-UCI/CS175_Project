Pancreatic cancer patients who are obese may be 12 times more likely to have cancer that's already spread to their lymph nodes at the time of surgery than similar cancer patients who weigh less, according to a study released Monday in the Archives of Surgery. Health.com: Fiber, starch, fats, and serving sizes: Eat right advice for your diet Tae-Hwa Chun, M.D., an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says "there is good evidence" that obesity increases the risk for certain types of cancer such as postmenopausal breast cancer, and cancers of the colon, endometrium (the lining of the uterus), kidney, and esophagus. Obese patients tended to have slightly larger tumors and were less likely to get chemotherapy or radiation before surgery than other patients. In the study, 95 percent of patients with a BMI over 35 had a recurrence compared with 61 percent of other patients. "What we are seeing suggests there is a difference in the way the cancer grows in obese patients versus those who are not," says study author Jason B. Fleming, M.D., of the University of Texas
