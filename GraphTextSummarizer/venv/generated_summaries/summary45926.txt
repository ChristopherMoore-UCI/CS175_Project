Orders for its CSeries have been few and far between at these events, in part because Canadian securities laws require announcements within 24 hours of the signing of even letters of intent, making it virtually impossible for Bombardier to cluster announcements. Government pressure Aside from the aggressive competitiveness of Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy, who can't tolerate being second at any time and who rarely misses any opportunity to tweak Boeing, the French government is also known to pressure Airbus to make a great showing. In terms of orders, we see this as one week out of 52," admits Boeing's Vice President of Marketing Randy Tinseth, the company's most visible communications counterpart to Leahy. The formal program launch of its 787-10 is expected (although Boeing won't officially say so) and scores of orders are expected to accompany the announcement. Thus, with two new airplane programs and hundreds of orders and commitments anticipated, Boeing could conceivably "win" this year's show.
