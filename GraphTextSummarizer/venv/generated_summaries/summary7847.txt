Quebec Premier Pauline Marois told reporters Sunday that the situation was an "unacceptable" tragedy, according to CBC, but cautioned that people should avoid speculation about what caused the fire and allow the investigation to run its course. Many of them had Alzheimer's disease and used wheelchairs or walkers, acting Mayor Ginette Caron told CBC. At least 10 people were killed in the fire, which struck the 52-unit Residence du Havre in L'Isle-Verte, Quebec, early Thursday morning. Trapped residents screamed for help from their balconies as flames tore through a senior retirement complex in Quebec last week. At least 37 of the residents were older than 85, according to government documents obtained by CBC.
