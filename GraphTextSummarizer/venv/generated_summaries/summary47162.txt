Hungarian paprika is super sweet It takes seven months, from seed to ground powder, to produce paprika. Hungarian paprika peppers are sweeter than others because of the country's cool growing season, which retains sugar in the spice. Early last century, 830 workshops in Szeged alone processed peppers for paprika. Paprika's bursting with vitamin C The Hungarian scientist Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi won the Nobel Prize in 1937 partly for the discovery of vitamin C. He also found a high vitamin C content in paprika peppers and learned to extract it. But Hungarian paprika wasn't always so sweet.
