The popular satire site The Onion tweeted the following to its more than 4 million followers during the show last night: "Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a ____, right?" Last night I sat down to watch the Oscar red carpet with my 6-year-old daughter Kaia. As if it wasn't bad enough that she was sexualized in front of her peers during what was undoubtedly the most exciting night of her life, but to be further humiliated on a social networking site and called one of the most degrading terms that can be used toward women is reprehensible. Instead, last night, on her special night, she was subjected to the most distasteful showing of adult "humor" I have ever seen. Imagine what went through Quvenzhané's mother's mind when someone pulled her aside last night to tell her what happened.
