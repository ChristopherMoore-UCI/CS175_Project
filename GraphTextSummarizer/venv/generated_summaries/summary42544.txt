ISIS was once part of al Qaeda (it was once called al Qaeda in Iraq), but its tactics proved too extreme even for the perpetrators of 9/11, which predicted public beheadings of Muslims would turn other Muslims against the group. It is crucial that ISIS not be allowed to portray this battle as a war pitting Muslims against non-Muslims. ISIS has suddenly changed that equation with its sweep in Iraq, endangering America's friends, the Kurds, threatening genocide against the Yazidis and then ostentatiously killing American citizens. The news from Australia comes on the heels of recent videotaped decapitations of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. -- Australian authorities say that ISIS leaders ordered followers to behead someone on Australian soil as a "demonstration killing."
