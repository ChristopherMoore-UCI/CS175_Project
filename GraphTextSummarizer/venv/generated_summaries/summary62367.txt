"In his mid-30s, he starts to diversify and towards the end of his life he would have seen himself essentially as a scientist who also did a bit of painting on the side," said Martin Clayton, Senior Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Royal Collection in the UK, which contains an extensive collection of drawings by da Vinci. "On a religious level, I think he was a probing person -- he questions (things) a lot," said Monsignor Renato Bellini, a priest in Vinci, where Leonardo was born and baptized. Perhaps our best clues to who da Vinci really was are to be found in his paintings, writings and drawings. The quintessential Renaissance man who was brilliant in the fields of both science and art, da Vinci is widely regarded as a genius. Da Vinci was born in 1452, the illegitimate son of a Florentine landlord and notary, on his father's estate in Vinci.
