"We need to drive the women into our primary health centers," says Hafsat, explaining that many pregnant women choose to not visit a doctor due to high costs. Hafsat runs a conditional cash transfer project for the state, where poor pregnant women are encouraged to use available healthcare facilities for safer pregnancies in a bid to reduce maternal mortality rates. "We wanted to also work with protecting women from domestic violence, raising awareness about the issue of domestic violence," says Hafsat. The daughter of Nigerian politician and philanthropist Moshood Kashimawo Olawale (MKO) Abiola, Hafsat was at her second year studying at Harvard, United States, when her father was sent to prison by Nigeria's junta after claiming the country's 1993 presidential election. Today, Hafsat Abiola is one of the most prominent civil rights activists in Nigeria, fueled by a desire to ensure her parents' deaths were not in vain.
