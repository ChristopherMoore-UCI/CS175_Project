Many Republicans were furious at that suggestion and accused Democrats of election-year politics by trying to paint Republicans as anti-women. "I really resent the implication by some of my Democratic friends that if you're trying to improve the bill that somehow you are for violence against women. Domestic violence is domestic violence. "I'm always for the Violence Against Women bill," said Sessions who voted for a GOP alternative bill that was defeated in the Democratic-majority Judiciary Committee. In a series of floor speeches Thursday, a group of mostly Democratic women senators made a high-profile and at times emotional appeal to Republicans to support an expanded Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).
