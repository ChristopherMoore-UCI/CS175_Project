"They all say, with scientific certainty, that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo is the female voice in those recordings," host Phil McGraw said, citing conclusions by forensic voice analysts with three independent contractors. Asked whether he is gay, Tuiasosopo said, "I would say, yeah, I am gay, but honestly, I am so confused, I'm so lost." Bleacher Report: Twitter Erupts as Hoaxer Tells Story to Dr. Phil Tuiasosopo said the relationship began after he started a Facebook page under the name Lennay Kekua, the first name an elision of his mother's and grandmother's first names and the last name one he had heard "thrown around in the neighborhood." " Finally, after learning that Te'o had Skyped with four women -- including two of his former girlfriends -- Tuiasosopo said he essentially killed off Lennay, having her die of leukemia. McGraw asked the confessed hoaxer repeatedly to adopt the female voice he said he had used with Te'o in order to prove that it was he, but Tuiasosopo refused, saying he was not comfortable appearing on camera sounding like a woman. But when the venue was switched to Tuiasosopo's house, where he said he had made the calls to Te'o, the results were uniformly in agreement, McGraw said.
