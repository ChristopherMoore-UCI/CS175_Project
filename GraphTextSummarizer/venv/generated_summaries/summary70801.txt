" NURV, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, specializes in viral marketing, video production and editing and other media-related jobs. Executive producer Andrew Fischer estimates the half-dozen internet meme makers in the trailer have accounted for more than 2 billion page views combined (including, he said, copycat versions of their videos and views on sites other than YouTube). Now, a dream team of viral video superstars is hoping to hit the big screen. Fischer said he hopes the new trailer will help convince financial backers to jump onboard. Fischer, who also wrote the script and appears as title character "Rick Rolland" (a role he said he'd happily hand over to a more professional actor), said the trailer was shot in Colorado in January.
