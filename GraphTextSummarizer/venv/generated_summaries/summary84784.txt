Lt. Col. Tom de la Rue, Harry's commanding officer in the Army Air Corps, said: "Captain Wales has reached the pinnacle of flying excellence as an Apache pilot, particularly in Afghanistan and, in the process, has proved to be a real inspiration to the many Army Air Corps officers and soldiers who have come to know him so well over the last two years. -- Prince Harry is ending his time with Britain's Army Air Corps and is taking a staff officer role in London, Kensington Palace announced Friday. The move takes him out of a potential combat role flying Apache helicopters and gives him a desk job in London. His responsibilities "will include helping to co-ordinate significant projects and commemorative events involving the Army in London," a Kensington Palace news release said. He qualified as an Apache aircraft commander in July of last year.
