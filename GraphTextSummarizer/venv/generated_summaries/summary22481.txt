-- At least five people were killed and 39 wounded when a car bomb exploded Monday in Basra, an Interior Ministry official said, capping a day in which at least 11 people were killed in blasts in cities with Shiite shrines. Car bombings targeting religious pilgrims in two major Shiite cities in Iraq killed 11 people Monday, an Interior Ministry official said. Iran's Fars News Agency said that on any given day, about 1,500 pilgrims travel from neighboring Iran to visit Shiite shrines in Iraq, particularly in Najaf and Karbala. Najaf and Karbala, south of Baghdad, have seen increases in foreign pilgrims in the last two years after a drop in the daily widespread violence. The parked car bomb targeted buses carrying Iranian pilgrims at the road leading to Najaf's old city.
