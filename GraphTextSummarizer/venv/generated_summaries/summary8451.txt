North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il arrived in Russia on Saturday to meet with President Dmitry Medvedev, authorities said. The six-party talks involved China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, North Korea and the United States. The United States and South Korea, however, have insisted on some tangible demonstration that North Korea is serious about denuclearization. Ahead of the the Kim's visit, Russia's foreign ministry announced Friday that it will send up to 50,000 tons of wheat to North Korea to alleviate some of that country's food shortage. Earlier this month, North Korea  again called for the resumption of the so-called six-party talks without preconditions.
