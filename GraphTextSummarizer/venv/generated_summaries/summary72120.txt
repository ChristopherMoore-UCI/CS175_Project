One Afghan official stressed the deal would mean night raids complied with Afghan laws. A senior Afghan official said details of the arrangement on night raids were changing daily and meetings were ongoing, but the issue of compliance under Afghan law was key to the talks. -- Afghanistan and the United States may soon reach a deal over night raids by U.S. and Afghan special forces on local dwellings that would increase Afghan control over and participation in the controversial operations. Allen said last month that "we have come a very long way in creating greater capacity among the Afghans to conduct night operations in a very credible way." Night raids are deeply unpopular among Afghans, but U.S. officials say they are vital to NATO's operation against insurgents.
