-- President Barack Obama hit back at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie over Ebola on Tuesday, warning that quarantine policies based on fear could discourage US health care workers "doing God's work" in Africa to battle the epidemic. The saga reveals two sides of Chris Christie â€” likely to be vying for prominence if he decides next year to run for president in a campaign that will likely contrast his abrasive style of management with the cool, 'no drama' persona adopted by Obama, which critics see as evidence of disengagement. In standing up to federal health authorities, Christie assumed leadership of those suspicious of Washington officials who insist their risk to Americans from Ebola is miniscule. The jab was a reflection of how the political circumstances of both Christie and Obama have changed since their interactions in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. I don't think we should do that by making her live in a tent for two or three days," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday.
