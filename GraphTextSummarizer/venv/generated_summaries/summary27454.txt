'There is no Eid' A CNN team visiting the hardest-hit areas in northern Gaza where many of the newly-discovered bodies were discovered saw entire blocks of buildings reduced to rubble. As the Muslim world prepared to celebrate the Eid holiday in two days, Gaza residents buried the dead. "Any humanitarian cease-fire that does not include the withdrawal of the occupation soldiers from Gaza borders and allowing citizens to return to their homes and evacuate casualties is unacceptable," he said. The IDF said many Gaza residents were returning to previously evacuated areas despite repeated warnings, placing themselves at risk. "Not even one square meter is safe in Gaza strip," Dr. Hassen al-Masri said.
