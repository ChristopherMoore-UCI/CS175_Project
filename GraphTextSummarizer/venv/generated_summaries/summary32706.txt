The ongoing furor over U.S. Rep. Todd Akin's remarks on rape and pregnancy was largely ignored on the campaign trail Tuesday as candidates for president and vice president refocused their attention on the issues that have dominated the election for weeks: Medicare and the economy. " Ryan revisits Obama circa 2008 Top Dems, Obama campaign seek to tie Romney to GOP anti-abortion stance Biden to be in Tampa during Republican National Convention Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning in Minnesota, pushed back hard on Ryan's claim, saying the law put in place by Obama strengthened Medicare without "cutting a penny. Ryan has proposed a plan in the House that would allow private insurers to compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange, a move Democrats say would amount to a "gutting" of the government-run health care program for senior citizens. Ryan continued using the attack line Tuesday, saying Obama "treated Medicare like a piggybank to pay for Obamacare and his campaign called that an achievement."
