For now, the cease-fire also marks the most important foreign policy test and achievement yet for new Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. The current cease-fire also offers President Morsy the opportunity for renewed, and closer, engagement with the U.S., particularly after President Barack Obama's election victory and Morsy's initial blunders following the killing of America's ambassador to Libya. Obama's first attempt immediately following his 2009 inauguration ended in humiliation at the hands of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. New realities require new approaches. With the U.S. election over, the burden is also on President Obama to assume a more proactive role in fostering a productive peace process, in collaboration with allies and regional powers.
