Fairleigh Dickinson University's Public Mind Poll found that Clinton garnered 45% of the New Jersey electorate while Christie won 42%. Chris Christie and Hillary Clinton are neck-and-neck in the New Jersey governor's home state, according to a poll released Tuesday about the hypothetical presidential match-up. A Quinnipiac University Poll found in August that Clinton would beat Christie in New Jersey 50% to 42%. This was the first time that Fairleigh Dickinson asked questions about Clinton vs. Christie in the Garden State. Correct the Record, an outside research and communications groups helping Clinton, said the fact that Clinton is tied with Christie in his home state bodes well for Democrats in 2016.
