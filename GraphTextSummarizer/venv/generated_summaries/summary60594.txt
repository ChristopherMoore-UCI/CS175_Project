Godolphin said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was "absolutely appalled" after regulator British Horseracing Authority (BHA) found anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- in 11 samples taken from 45 horses from its Newmarket stable in eastern England on April 9. Any horse that has been treated with anabolic steroids must be free of them by race day," Racing Victoria vet Dr Brian Stewart told the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday in reaction to Monday's Godolphin announcement. "I deeply regret what has happened," said Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, who now faces a BHA disciplinary inquiry, in a statement by Godolphin. "News reports so far suggest this case is an aberration and is not indicative of wider use of anabolic steroids in British horse racing," said National Trainers' Federation chief executive Rupert Arnold. " "Ethylestranol and stanozolol are anabolic steroids and therefore prohibited substances under British Rules of Racing, at any time -- either in training or racing," added Brickell, outlining the sport's doping rules on the BHA's website.
