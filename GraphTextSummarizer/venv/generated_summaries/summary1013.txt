However, the source said that when the President wants to talk about midterms, he usually reaches out to senators associated with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (Chairman Michael Bennet, Harry Reid and former Chairman Chuck Schumer) and that committee, not Schultz. As for Politico's story on Democratic and White House grumblings about Schultz, the source said "it didn't come from the White House." -- Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz will introduce President Obama at the party's Women's Leadership Forum on Friday, a well-placed Democratic source says. "As far as I know, she's here to stay ... this too shall pass," the source said, pointing out that it would not make much sense to try to force Schultz out just two months before the midterm elections. Schultz's term does not expire until January 2017.
