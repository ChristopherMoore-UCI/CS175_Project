Bruce Davis -- a former associate of Charles Manson and a convicted murderer himself -- was granted parole Wednesday in California, the state Department of Corrections said, though that doesn't mean he'll necessarily become a free man. Davis was sent to state prison on April 21, 1972, for the first-degree murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald "Shorty" Shea in 1969. If this time proves different, Davis would become the first Manson "family" member to be freed solely for good behavior.
