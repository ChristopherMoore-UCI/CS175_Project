Nigeria has an immense ability to absorb crises and the military's direct threat to the electoral process has passed, not without comment, but without incident. But perhaps the biggest danger is Boko Haram, which has made dramatic territorial gains over the past few months in the North East, and despite the latest offensive to counter the threat, they continue to attack major strategic towns. Despite being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, Nigeria's oil dependent economy has been rocked by falling oil prices, with the worst performing stock market in Africa, record lows for the Naira currency, and depleted foreign exchange savings. The military say they need to concentrate on a new offensive against the Islamic militant group, Boko Haram, in north-east Nigeria. The intervention by the military is a serious blow not just to this election but also Nigeria's young democratic process.
