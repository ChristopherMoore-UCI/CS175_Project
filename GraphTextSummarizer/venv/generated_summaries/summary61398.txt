Television studios may be excited about dads who work at home, but in fact such fathers are only 3.4% of parents at home full time. Over the last half-century, fathers have tripled the amount of time they spend with their kids, but that's only about half as much time as mothers spend. Consider: A&E Network plans a new reality show this fall about dads who work at home, called "Modern Dads." And many young fathers do that. And we know from research that those fathers, in particular those who are not married to their children's mothers, are more likely to walk away from the family than fathers whose children were planned.
