The first guests checked back into the Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi-Trident hotels Sunday, marking the reopening of the two luxury venues damaged by terrorist attacks in Mumbai last month. Watch as the Taj Mahal hotel reopens "All the 550 guest rooms, including the executive floors, of the hotel are ready to receive guests," a hotel spokesman said, adding the business was reopening with "heightened security," There were still portions of both hotels that could not reopened because of damage, including the Heritage wing of the Taj Mahal and the Oberoi wing of the Oberoi-Trident. The Taj has been reopened, after a massive concerted effort, in dedication to all of those who lost their lives in the attacks on Mumbai," said Ratan Tata, the chairman of the company that owns the the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. The scene Sunday is a far cry from November 26 when the hotel and many other locations in Mumbai were paralyzed by a mass of coordinated attacks.
