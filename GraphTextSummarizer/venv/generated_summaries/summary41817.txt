With very few State services, God is all the poor in Haiti's sprawling seaside slum of Cité Soleil can believe in. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been in Haiti since 1994 and in Cité Soleil since 2003. Nevertheless, violence still surrounds the 300,000 residents of Cité Soleil, fueled by hunger and the frustration of trying to survive on less than a dollar a day. That the victims of violence can suffer for years after the event is well-known, but in Cité Soleil the suffering can last a lifetime. Rob Drouen, head of the ICRC delegation, explains, "Haiti is a fragile state where armed gangs can be used to stir up trouble for political reasons and abject poverty fuels discontent."
