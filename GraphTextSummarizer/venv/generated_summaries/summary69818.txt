The Wii U Game Pad is part controller and part handheld console, and new games are expected to take advantage of both abilities. In this game, the player with the Wii U is a ghost trying to track down and capture the four players using Wii controllers. Will Nintendo's forthcoming Wii U breathe new life into its aging Wii concept? Players can watch the overall action on their TVs or get an up-close view through the Wii U screen. This allows the Wii U to have unique goals and abilities in the game when played simultaneously with other people holding regular Wii controllers.
