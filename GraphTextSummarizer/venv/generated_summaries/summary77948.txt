According to a 2008 survey of 1,010 women conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women's rights, 83% of Egyptian women and 98% of foreign women there have been sexually harassed. While the group consisted of men and women, Bahgat said it was generally men who intervened when an assault was detected, to prevent women bodyguards from being sexually assaulted themselves. I felt that it was time to step up and do something about it." Instead of going to Tahrir -- where, according to local reports, three women were sexually assaulted among the crowds that day -- she took to Twitter and started an account, Tahrir Bodyguard, encouraging a "collective effort to promote the safety of women protesters." " Today Tahrir Bodyguard has a database of 200 volunteers, who patrol the square during mass demonstrations, recognizable in high-visibility helmets and vests, intervening to halt the attacks on women that have blighted Egypt's revolution and its aftermath. In a recent mass demonstration on January 25, for example, 25 sexual assaults were reported on women in the square.
