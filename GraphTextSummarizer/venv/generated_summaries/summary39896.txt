In February, a spokesman for the Higher Military Council announced Sheikh was the leader of the group, which claimed to lead armed defectors within Syria. He was accompanied in the video by Free Syrian Army commander Col. Riad al-Asaad. CNN's Brianna Keilar, Arwa Damon, Ivan Watson and journalist Omar al Muqdad contributed to this report. Russia and China have major trade deals with Syria, and again Friday they refused to condemn al-Assad's regime formally by voting against a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution condemning "appalling human rights violations in Syria." But al-Asaad, who was leading the FSA from the Turkish border with Syria, quickly rejected the claim.
