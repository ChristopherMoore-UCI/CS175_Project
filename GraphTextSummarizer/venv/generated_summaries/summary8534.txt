Watch more of the interview with Jessica Cox Â» CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke to Cox about her determination to overcome obstacles. Even though she was born without arms, Jessica Cox never says "can't." Jessica Cox, 25, uses her life story to inspire young people to face challenges head-on. Cox also conquered otherwise mundane challenges like putting in contacts, text messaging, and applying makeup. We have a question from our Web site that said, "What motivated you to become a pilot, Jessica?" Cox: Actually, flying was my greatest fear. [However] just because you confront your fear doesn't necessarily mean that you can overcome it, because I still have a little bit of fear, and fear is a good thing.
