"Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China." So far, WHO said, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. -- Two more people infected with a rare strain of bird flu in China died over the weekend, as the number of human cases of H7N9 climbed to 60, state media reported Sunday. Shanghai's health authorities have now reported 24 cases, after three men were diagnosed with H7N9 on Saturday. Two new cases were reported in central Henan Province on Sunday morning, while a child in Beijing in the north tested positive on Saturday. "Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing," the organization announced on Saturday.
