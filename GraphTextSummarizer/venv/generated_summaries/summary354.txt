U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said Tuesday that Tucson officer Martin Escobar lacks the legal standing to sue, according to court documents. The injunction means police are prevented from questioning people's immigration status if there is reason to believe they are in the country illegally, which was a hotly debated part of law. -- A federal district court has dismissed a challenge filed by a Tucson police officer against Arizona's tough new immigration law. Bolton also blocked provisions of the law making it a crime to fail to apply for or carry alien registration papers or "for an unauthorized alien to solicit, apply for, or perform work," and a provision "authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person" if there is reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation. My defense of the rule of law will continue," Brewer said.
