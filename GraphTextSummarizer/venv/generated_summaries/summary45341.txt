Too often we allow girls to be excluded from school without much complaint, and we continue to tolerate child labor and child marriage. At the core of each plan should be strategies for policing an end to child labor, enforcing laws against child marriage, and clamping down on discrimination against girls. Every year, ten million girls leave education to become child brides and never return to school. A new initiative, Education First, launched last month by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, is bringing together every U.N. and World Bank institution concerned with education to work with governments to deliver new school places and train new teachers. Today just $3 billion of global aid goes to education, amounting to a meager, shameful $13.50 per child in Africa -- hardly enough to finance a textbook, far less a teacher or a school.
