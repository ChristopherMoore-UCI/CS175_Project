Thousands of Palestinians celebrated the release Sunday night of 550 inmates from Israeli prisons, part of the second phase of the deal that won the freedom of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Hamas' armed wing, the Izzedine al Qassam Brigades, welcomed the news even as they, like Rahim and other Palestinian leaders, continued to push for the release of others in Israeli custody. Ahead of the expected release, Israeli security forces and hundreds of Palestinians clashed at a West Bank crossing near the internment facility where the prisoners were being held. "As long as the occupation continues, arrests will continue," he said, adding that approximately 3,500 Palestinian prisoners remain behind bars in Israeli prisons. It all follows a deal, signed between Israel and Hamas in October, that won Shalit's release from Hamas in exchange for allowing more than 1,000 Palestinians to leave Israeli jails.
