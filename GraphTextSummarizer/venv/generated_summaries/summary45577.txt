-- One of three siblings accused of robbing a bank and trying to kill police officers last year has accepted a plea deal that calls for at least nine years in prison, according to court documents. She faces a maximum of 28 years in prison when she is sentenced on April 30, according to court documents. Just before they were captured, she pointed her pistol at a Colorado police chief, but the chief fired his .40-caliber handgun first, wounding her in the right upper thigh, according to court documents. Dougherty and her brothers, Dylan Stanley Dougherty and Ryan Edward Dougherty, are all accused of taking part in a multistate crime rampage that gripped the nation last year. Lee Grace Dougherty, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday in a Colorado courtroom to one count of attempted first-degree assault and two counts of felony menacing, CNN affiliate KRDO reported.
