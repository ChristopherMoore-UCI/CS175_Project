It will arrive on Tuesday, bringing other cargo as well, including 20 mice and elements for 255 scientific experiments aboard the ISS. NASA recently announced it was awarding $6.8 billion contracts to Space X and Boeing to shuttle cargo and astronauts to and from the ISS. On September 25, three new crew members for the ISS will arrive aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. "This launch kicks off a very busy time for the space station," said NASA's Sam Scimemi, director of the ISS. Since NASA's space shuttle program was retired in 2011, astronauts have been hitching rides on the Soyuz spacecraft, at a cost of $70 million per seat.
