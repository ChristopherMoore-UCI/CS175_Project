Despite the call for him to step aside after he publicly admitted Tuesday using crack cocaine, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said he will not step down and will run for re-election next year. Toronto mayor says he won't resign despite possibly damning video Ford, who had previously said he did not use crack and who has not been charged with a crime, made the admission to reporters earlier in the day outside his office in Toronto after they asked him about the issue. "We live in a democracy and on October 27, 2014, I want the people of this great city to decide if they want Rob Ford to be their mayor." Earlier Tuesday, after months of dodging allegations, Ford told reporters that he smoked crack cocaine about a year ago -- probably, he said, during a "drunken stupor." Then, police recovered video from deleted files on a computer hard drive that was seized during a drug and gang investigation, according to a 465-page report by Toronto police disclosed on Thursday. " When he addressed the allegations in May, Ford denied crack cocaine use in the present tense.
