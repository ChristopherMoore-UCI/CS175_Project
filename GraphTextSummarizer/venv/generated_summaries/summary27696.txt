H7N9 doesn't yet spread from person to person, and it may never. What could have gone on to become a major outbreak, killing many people, was stopped because health officials acted quickly. A blind spot anywhere is a risk to us everywhere Keeping people safe is the role of public health agencies such as the CDC -- a role that becomes even more important every day. Drug-resistant infections can be prevented by immunization, safe food preparation and handling, and general hand washing. We still have time to close the door on antibiotic resistance, but it means public health must collaborate with clinical medicine, both in the United States and around the world.
