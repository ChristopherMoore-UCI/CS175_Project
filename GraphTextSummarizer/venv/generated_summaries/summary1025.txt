The Israeli-born Rahamim "came to this country to live the American dream, and he did," said Mayor R.T. Rybak. Minneapolis police and city officials described Friday what happened over the span of 10 or 15 minutes the previous afternoon, when the man walked through the loading dock of Accent Signage Systems and started shooting. Rybak said officials will work to make sure that Accent Signage Systems remains in business after its founder's violent death. The Minnesota resident went to the White House in March, and the White House called Friday to offer its condolences over Rahamim's death, Rybak said. "He's an example of somebody who climbed the ladder of success and didn't pull (the ladder) up but tried every way possible to get other people up on that rung, too," Rybak said.
