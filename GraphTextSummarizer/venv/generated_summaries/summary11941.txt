"Chadima told John Doe that he thought that Doe might be gay," the report says. John Chadima resigned his post as senior associate athletic director at UW-Madison earlier in January after the allegations surfaced. The report alleges that Chadima made the advance in late December at a Rose Bowl party that he was throwing at a hotel in Los Angeles. There was beer and mixed drinks at that party and about 25 to 30 people attended, including employees that were under the age of 21, the report said. The report called the student, who is over the age of 21, John Doe.
