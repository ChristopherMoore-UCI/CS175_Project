First detected early Thursday morning, the leak was causing ammonia to enter space -- which could be seen in the form of "flakes of snow" -- at a rate of 5 pounds per day, said Mike Suffredini, NASA's space station program manager. They will be joined at the end of the month by three new crew members: NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg, Russian cosmonaut Fiyodor Yurchikhin and European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano, who are due to launch aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on May 28. The ammonia coolant for the power channel, one of eight used to supply electricity to the station, is likely to run out by late Friday morning and it will be shut down, NASA said. -- Two International Space Station crew members will head out Saturday morning for a spacewalk to address an ammonia leak in the orbiter's cooling system, an emergency that forced NASA officials to work round-the-clock to hatch a plan. The discovery spurred teams at NASA, over a busy 24-hour stretch, to go into "a full-court press to understand what the failure is" and how to address it, NASA flight director Norm Knight said at a Friday news conference.
