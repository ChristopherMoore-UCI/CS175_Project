-- The third and final day of New York City's Electric Zoo music festival was canceled Sunday after two concert-goers died and at least four others were hospitalized due to drug-related causes, police said. The promoters' website said people who bought tickets for Sunday would get full refunds. In the 1990s, MDMA gained a reputation for party drug at all-night warehouse parties known as raves. In a statement posted Sunday on the event's homepage, Made Event said "the founders of Electric Zoo send our deepest condolences to the families of the two people who passed away this weekend. The cause of death for the two Electric Zoo attendees is believed to involve the drug MDMA, either in Ecstasy pills or in its "pure" powder or crystal form, known as molly.
