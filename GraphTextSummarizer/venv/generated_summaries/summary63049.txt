Bay received a nomination for worst director, and the film picked up nominations for worst screenplay, worst supporting actor (Kelsey Grammer, a nod that also lumped in his performances in "The Expendables 3," "Legends of Oz" and "Think Like a Man Too") and worst screen combo ("any two robots, actors or robotic actors"). Also doing well: Seth MacFarlane, who was nominated for worst actor and worst screen combo (with Charlize Theron) for his "A Million Ways to Die in the West." Cameron, the former "Growing Pains" star, received a worst actor and worst screen combo nomination. "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" was nominated for worst picture of 2011, and "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" won the big prize as 2009's bottom of the cinematic barrel. This year's nominees are Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Mike Myers, Keanu Reeves and Kristen Stewart.
