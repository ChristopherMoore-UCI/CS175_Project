One was arrested Friday in north London and the other in east London on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. A 28-year-old man appeared in court Monday after he became the second person to be charged with murder over the death of British soldier Lee Rigby last month on a London street. Police said Rigby was killed in a daylight attack a couple of hundred yards away from the Royal Artillery Barracks in the southeast London district of Woolwich on May 22. They announced two other arrests in the case Friday, of men seized on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. The charges are not connected to the Rigby murder investigation, police said.
