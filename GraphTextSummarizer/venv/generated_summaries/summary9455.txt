Protecting Russia Others argue Putin could have another goal in mind if he sends troops into Ukraine: protecting his own country. "One way to stop Ukraine from joining the West," Labott said, "is to make it too unstable by keeping this insurgency running." Growing Russia's regional influence Russia has spent billions of dollars in recent years building up its arsenal of warships, military planes and helicopters to go along with what remains the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, CNN's Jim Sciutto said. NATO warned this week that Russia could use "the pretext of a humanitarian or peacekeeping mission as an excuse to send troops into eastern Ukraine." It's true that Putin is weighing intervention, said Stephen Cohen, a professor emeritus of Russian studies at Princeton University and New York University. Russia has fired weapons into Ukraine and boosted the number of troops near the border, officials have told CNN.
