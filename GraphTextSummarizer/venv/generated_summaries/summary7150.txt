The world No.2 completed another convincing display on the clay to notch up a 34th consecutive win in the tournament, seven days after winning his eighth successive title in Monte Carlo. He carried the momentum into 12th and decisive game, closing out the match with the first of three match points. I was lucky when I saved break points. The first set lasted 93 minutes with the 10-time grand slam winner having to save five set points in the 12th game before going on to take the tie-break comfortably. -- Rafael Nadal claimed a seventh Barcelona Open title with a hard fought straight-set 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 victory over David Ferrer on Sunday.
