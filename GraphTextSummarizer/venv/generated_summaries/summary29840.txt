So named for the garland of roses that is draped over the winner, the Kentucky Derby traces its rich history back to 1875 when Colonel Meriwether Lewis Clark Junior decided to inaugurate a race in his home state of Kentucky. Outside of the Derby and the Oaks (the fillies-only race that takes place the day before the Derby), most of the racing here is low-grade. Clark -- grandson of William Clark of the historic 19th century Lewis and Clark transcontinental expedition -- had been influenced by a visit to England's Epsom Derby. These days, Kentucky shares its Derby with the world. African-Americans have played an integral role in the history of the Derby; indeed, the very first race was won by an African-American jockey (Oliver Lewis) and an African-American trainer (Ansel Williamson).
