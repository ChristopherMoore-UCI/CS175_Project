"Price tag" is a term used to describe attacks by Israeli extremists against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in retaliation for any action taken against settlers. Israeli media reported in December that the attack came in response to rumors that Israeli security forces were about to demolish two illegal outposts in the West Bank. The indictment alleges the extremists operated from an apartment in Jerusalem, where they gathered intelligence information through surveillance, lookouts and patrols of Israeli troops. The suspects are also being questioned about "price tag" attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Israeli police. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the incident "crossed all lines."
