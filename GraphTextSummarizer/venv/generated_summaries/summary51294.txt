A push for such a law began under the late President Nestor Kirchner, and the cause was taken up by his wife and presidential successor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. -- Lawmakers in Argentina have approved a gender identity law that allows individuals to be recognized in official documents by the gender they choose. "It is understood that gender identity is the internal and individual way that a person experiences their gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth," the law states. "(The law) is a path toward equality, inclusion and recognition of rights for all Argentinians," Vice President Amado Boudou said. The law is meant to include people who undergo sex change operations or hormone treatments to look like the opposite sex, but it goes further than that.
