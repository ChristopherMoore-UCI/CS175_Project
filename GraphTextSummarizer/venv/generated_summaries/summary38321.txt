-- President Barack Obama placed the blame for Washington's current political paralysis squarely at the feet of his Republican opponents Tuesday, telling CNN that the GOP's "ideological rigidity" is standing in the way of compromises necessary for stronger economic growth. Obama said the greatest threat at the moment is a potential "lone wolf" terror attack from a single individual, similar to what recently occurred in Norway. Asked to respond to Texas Gov. Rick Perry's assertion that members of the armed services would prefer a commander in chief who has served in the military, Obama said presidential candidates have "got to be a little more careful" about what they say. "We don't need to amend our Constitution in order to do that," Obama said. Obama renewed his call for an extension of payroll tax cuts as well as some business tax breaks.
