-- There will be no room for homophobia at the 2014 NFL Draft, according to San Francisco 49ers owner and co-chairman John York. Expanding NFL's reach While York is keen to further the NFL's boundaries when it comes to giving players room to express themselves for who they are, he is also committed to helping the sport expand overseas. A small number of NFL players, too, have chosen to come out in the past, but only once their professional careers had come to an end -- starting with David Kopay in 1975. Former German international footballer Thomas Hitzlsperger, Puerto Rican featherweight boxer Orlando Cruz and NBA player Jason Collins have all come out in recent years, however, they have decided to do so during the latter stages of their careers. The NFL's profile in England is continuing to grow, with London's Wembley Stadium having hosted the International Series since 2007, while there has even been talk of a franchise based in the nation's capital.
