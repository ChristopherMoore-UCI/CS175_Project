According to Dr. Sana Al-Khatib, lead researcher of the study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, ICDs often are recommended as a primary prevention tactic for patients who are at high risk for a cardiac arrest or life-threatening arrhythmia, but who have not yet suffered from these symptoms. She said the time factor might explain the study's finding of an increase in deaths among implant patients who did not meet CMS criteria. " Al-Khatib found that many patients who were being implanted with the ICDs had recently experienced arrhythmias or cardiac arrests. -- More than 20% of patients who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator -- a high-tech device that produces electrical impulses to regulate heartbeats and prevent life-threatening arrhythmias -- in recent years were not good candidates to receive the device, a new study suggests. The memo further states that patients must meet numerous other qualifications relating to clinical trials and not have certain serious diseases or conditions that would lower the implant's efficacy or the patient's likelihood of long-term survival.
