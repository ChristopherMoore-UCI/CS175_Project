He also made reference to his father, President George H.W. Bush, telling graduates they should try to match the 90-year-old's zeal for life -- from wearing colorful socks to parachuting out of airplanes to "judging cheerleader competitions for the Houston Texans -- I think that's on his highlight reel for sure. "And that's what happens when you're a newcomer -- you make an impact." Bush said he'd asked his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, for advice on what to say. Be like my dad, who turned 90 years old this year, and here's a guy who's lived a full, active life, he was shot out of the sky in World War II, he built a business, he served a generation of time in many different positions in public service, and he's had some incredibly painful losses in his life, but he has never stopped having fun," Bush said. The point of his speech, Bush said, was to tell graduates to "dream big, don't be afraid of change and find joy everywhere you can. Bush's preemptive approach is one of the clearest signs yet of how seriously he is considering a run for president and allows him to address potential areas of criticism before opposition researchers dig in.
