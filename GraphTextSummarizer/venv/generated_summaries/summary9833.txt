The British government says Abu Qatada raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Jamal Khashoggi said "Abu Qatada had struck him as far more radical than Osama bin Laden ... influenced by Salafism, the puritanical, fundamentalist strain of Islam." Has he been convicted of a crime in Britain? Profile: Abu Qatada: the preacher at the eye of the storm In January, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan because of fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at the trial planned by the Middle Eastern country. Britain then launched a round of negotiations with Jordan in order to deal with the court's concerns and arrested Abu Qatada again on April 17. Using a forged United Arab Emirates passport, Abu Qatada arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and sought asylum for himself, his wife and their three children, according to court documents.
