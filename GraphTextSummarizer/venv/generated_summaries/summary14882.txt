This isn't Indonesia's only volcano problem December: Volcano in El Salvador erupts for first time in 37 years CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report. The government raised its eruption alert to its highest level overnight, and authorities have ordered an evacuation of all residents in a 10-kilometer (6.2 miles) radius of the volcano in eastern Java. Mount Kelud, located in the eastern part of the main island of Java, had been spewing ash high into the air, as a smoke plume has risen from out of its crater into the sky. The inundation of ash in the air can be dangerous to jet engines. Indonesia is part of the vast "Pacific Ring of Fire," an area of colliding continental plates where powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur.
