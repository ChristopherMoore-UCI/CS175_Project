-- A passenger plane crashed into a shallow waterway and broke in two after overshooting the runway in a remote area of Indonesia's eastern Papua province on Tuesday, injuring 78 people on board. Air accidents are not infrequent in Papua, a mountainous area in the easternmost part of Indonesia. Indonesia has made efforts in recent years to improve its safety record. Bambang Ervan, a spokesman for Indonesia's Transportation Ministry, said  investigators to the airport in  the coastal town of Manokwari where the Merpati Nusantara Airlines Boeing 737-300 had been attempting to land. Merpati, a cash-strapped state-owned airline which is in the process of upgrading its aging fleet, flies many of the more remote routes across Indonesia.
