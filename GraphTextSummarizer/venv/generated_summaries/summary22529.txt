It's tribute to the fact that Guthrie -- who wrote "This Land is Your Land" and who basically was Bob Dylan before Bob Dylan was Bob Dylan -- used folk music to battle indifference to social inequities in the 1930s and '40s. We need more Woody Guthrie today. As Facebook was quick to tell me, contenders for the title of modern Woody Guthrie do exist. In his 2012 State of the Union, he called income inequality "the defining issue of our time." People understand income inequality is a thing, now.
