She took the bronze in Vancouver but stepped up to the top of the podium in Sochi, beating Switzerland's Selina Gasparin into second place, with compatriot Nadezhda Skardino in third. More Swiss success Double gold was also a strong theme on day seven of competition, with Dario Cologna making it a great day for Switzerland by winning the 15 km classic in the cross-country nordic skiing discipline. Belarus later picked up its second gold of the day as 34-year-old Alla Tsuper, competing in her fifth Winter Games, finally found her way to the top of the podium in the women's freestyle aerials competition. But defending champion Bode Miller never recovered after a disappointing downhill run and finished sixth while world champion and U.S. compatriot Ted Ligety trailed home 12th. Tsuper took two years out to start a family but came back to competition better than ever.
