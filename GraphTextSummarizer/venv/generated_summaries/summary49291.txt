"I won't miss Grissom," says Petersen matter-of-factly. In fact, Petersen should have been gone by now: Warrick's death and Grissom's swan song were originally scheduled to air by last May, but the 100-day writers' strike shortened the season, so there wasn't enough time to tell all the stories Petersen wanted -- including the return of the Miniature Serial Killer and Melinda Clarke's dominatrix, Lady Heather. For nine years, "CSI" star William Petersen has had it all. William Petersen says he's become "too comfortable" at "CSI," and that it's time to go. Though everyone knew that Petersen wasn't gone forever -- he'll retain his producer title and he's promised to return for the occasional episode, though that probably won't occur until next season -- it didn't make his departure any less significant.
