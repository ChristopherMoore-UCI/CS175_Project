The man charged with shooting at motorists on Kansas City highways apparently fired a .380 pistol from his own car before speeding away, documents released on Friday said. After police started shadowing Whitaker, he was observed trying to buy a .380 handgun with a laser sight from a man in a Bass Pro Shop parking lot, the statements said. When police questioned the second man, he told officers he advertised the pistol online but refused to sell when Whitaker couldn't provide identification, the statement said. When questioned by police, Whitaker said he was one of the "highway shooter's" victims and claimed not to own a firearm, the probable cause statements say. Baker didn't say if investigators suspected Whitaker in the other cases but that more charges may be filed.
