"The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures that the profits from American innovations go to American innovators," Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, chairman of the powerful House Judiciary committee and the sponsor of the plan, said when the bill was introduced last month. "The bill prevents online thieves from selling counterfeit goods in the U.S., expands international protections for intellectual property, and protects American consumers from dangerous counterfeit products. But YouTube also is home, albeit against its will, to music videos, movie clips and other content posted without the intent of its creators. Its intent is to help put a stop to foreign websites that illegally post, and sometimes sell, intellectual property from the United States. " To coincide with Wednesday's committee hearing, many websites devoted themselves to drawing attention to the debate.
