"Wedding rings seem to be the token item this year for donations," said Haven Sink, director of public relations for the Salvation Army in Wake County, North Carolina. A wave of wedding ring donations has hit the Salvation Army's Red Kettle campaign this year, with seven separate instances of ring donations reported over the past month, according to the organization. "I was overwhelmed," said Salvation Army organizer Debbie Urella, upon finding a third ring in a red bucket. Salvation Army bell-ringers are a familiar ornament outside local retailers during the holiday season, but over the past month it hasn't been the rings from their bells that are catching people's ears. "It's very curious," said Jennifer Byrd, national public relations director for the Salvation Army.
