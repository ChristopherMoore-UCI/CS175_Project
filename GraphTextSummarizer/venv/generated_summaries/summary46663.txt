"Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan, who is serving as co-showrunner and executive producer of Saul, will direct the first episode of the series, which will serve as a prequel and chronicle the adventures of underhanded attorney Saul Goodman before he teamed up with meth kingpin Walter White (Bryan Cranston). The network announced Thursday that it had picked up a second season of "Better Call Saul," the "Breaking Bad" spin-off starring Bob Odenkirk, before the first episode of the show has even aired. We join the fans in eager anticipation for this series and today we happily confirm that our initial Saul order is for two seasons and a total of 23 episodes," said AMC president Charlie Collier in a statement. (EW.com) -- AMC is already calling Saul again. We have a strong history with Vince, Peter, Bob, the studio and so many involved with this production; we are enjoying the process on 'Saul' and all share a focus on making it a true television event.
