Gangs members joined community leaders and Gray's family for a press conference Monday night on the stage at New Shiloh Baptist Church, which had held Gray's funeral. After night fell, giving way to a 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles, Robert Valentine stood alone with his back to a line of police in riot gear. After their comments, Gray family lawyer William H. Murphy took the microphone. But as crowds turned into multitudes, the intervention became a drop in the bucket by compare, and police lines were also no match. He slung an arm over his shoulder, turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines.
