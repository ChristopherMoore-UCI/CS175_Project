Simpson, 18, is the spokesman for the #HappySoundsLike playlist, promoting the U.N.'s International Day of Happiness on Friday, March 20. The observation was decreed in 2012 after the first  U.N. conference on happiness, and the first Day of Happiness was held on March 20, 2013. "There is honestly nothing I can think of that I like to do more than make other people happy through live music," said Simpson, who will perform a few acoustic tracks at the SXSW brunch. The International Day of Happiness is a global celebration that came about after the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2011 recognizing happiness as a "fundamental human goal." Ed Sheeran, David Guetta, Charlize Theron, John Legend and James Blunt are also among those taking part.
