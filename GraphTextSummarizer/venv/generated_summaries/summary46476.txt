-- Argentina's president declared three days of national mourning Wednesday after heavy rains claimed dozens of lives. "In 12 hours it has rained what it normally rains in the entire month of April," Santiago Martorelli, cabinet chief of the city, told the state-run Telam news agency. At least 48 people were killed in La Plata, outside Buenos Aires, officials said Wednesday. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner toured some of the most heavily damaged areas Wednesday evening. "I have come to see what happened with this disaster," she said as she entered a flooded home, according to Telam.
