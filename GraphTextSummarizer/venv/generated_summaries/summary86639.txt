He said: "If you look at clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal, Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger have shown that stability gives you the best platform to achieve success and that is the model we wish to emulate here. "Alan has done a fantastic job over the last couple of years and has proved what a great Premier League manager he is. The 51-year-old, who led the his team to a fifth place finish in last season's Premier League, has impressed at the club following a number of shrewd signings. For a club like Newcastle, which has had eight different men lead the club over the past six-and-a-half years, the decision to give Alan Pardew an eight-year deal comes as something of a surprise. Sir Alex Ferguson remains the current longest-serving manger in the English game after taking over at Old Trafford back in November 1986.
