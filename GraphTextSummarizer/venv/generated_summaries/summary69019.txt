In 2006, when Rwanda's first annual cycling festival was created by Jonathan "Jock" Boyer, the first American to finish the Tour de France, and mountain bike pioneer Tom Ritchey, it was named the Wooden Bike Classic in honor of these traditional contraptions. One of its five founding members, and winner of the first Wooden Bike Classic, Adrien Niyonshuti, will represent Rwanda at the 2012 summer Olympics. These wooden bicycles, typically made from acacia trees, evolved as a solution for wheel-barrowing crops from farm to farm. Team Rwanda is a valuable means of bringing men from different backgrounds together. Eighteen years after the genocide of Tutsis that claimed an estimated 800,000 lives in all, Team Rwanda is now gaining international recognition, and one member will compete at this year's summer Olympics.
