"Now with the advance of smart card technology, we've been able to embed the Octopus mobile SIM inside a smartphone," explained Octopus CEO Kevin Goldmintz, in an interview with CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. "And I think the other side of it will also to be exporting the knowledge that we've accumulated over 17 years of doing contactless smart card, and deploying that knowledge in other cities around the world," Goldmintz told Stout. According to the company, around 95 percent of people in Hong Kong between the ages of 16-65 have an Octopus card, and their transactions add up to about 18 million dollars every day. As for the future, Octopus is optimistic that a cashless society will spread to other areas, particularly in its own patch of the Asia-Pacific area. "We're able to put a Hong Kong dollar purse inside the card, as an e-wallet," said Goldmintz.
