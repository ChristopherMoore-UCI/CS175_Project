He was the first fighter to win world titles in eight weight classes, but none of that mattered Saturday. Pacquiao appeared to dominate Bradley during the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday night, but the judges felt otherwise. The fight did not start until late Saturday because promoter Bob Arum did not want it to compete with Game 7 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat. Now, the question is what Bradley's win or Pacquiao's loss will mean for boxing. Many fans have called for a potential showdown between Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Mayweather is in a Nevada jail serving a three-month sentence for a domestic violence conviction.
