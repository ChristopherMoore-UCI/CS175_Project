"We've spent a significant amount of effort making sure that existing Android apps run well on tablets," Hugo Barra, Android's director of product management, said onstage.

T-Mobile and AT&T also announced more information on new Android phones this week, none of which will run the Honeycomb software at first. This feature has already been enabled automatically on Android phones. "It's the cloud that makes the experience seamless," said Andy Rubin, who leads Android development.
