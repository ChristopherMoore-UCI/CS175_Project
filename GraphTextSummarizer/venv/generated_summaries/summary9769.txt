She said the vote shows that President Francois Hollande should dissolve France's parliament, where most lawmakers come from mainstream political parties. " In France, which has 74 seats in the European Parliament, the National Front won 24.95% of votes, according to official estimates, coming in ahead of the center-right UMP, which scored 20.8%, and President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party, which came in third with 14%. The results sparked stunned reactions from some French politicians and triumphant victory speeches from others. "None of us can shirk their responsibilities," he said, according to a summary of his remarks posted on the French government's website.
