Assistant District Attorney Pat Dixon, who prosecuted Rogers in the 1990s, said Glen Rogers may have an ulterior motive for claiming to have killed Simpson and Goldman. Criminal profiler Anthony Meoli, who exchanged dozens of letters with Glen Rogers and visited him on death row, said Rogers explained to him that O.J. Simpson had hired him to break into his ex-wife's condo to steal diamond earrings he had given her. A death row inmate told relatives and a criminal profiler he killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman while O.J. Simpson waited nearby, a new documentary claims. "I'm absolutely certain that my brother Glen killed Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman," said Clay Rogers, who narrated the film "My Brother The Serial Killer," which will debut on the Investigation Discovery channel Wednesday. " Much of the documentary's support for the claim that Rogers killed Simpson and Goldman came from statements he purportedly made to his brother.
