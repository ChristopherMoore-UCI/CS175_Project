He has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website, which facilitates the publication of secret documents. Assange has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks if he were charged and convicted of a crime. WikiLeaks is preparing to release more than a million documents next year, the controversial website's founder said Thursday. Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in June to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. "My work will not be cowed," Assange said Thursday.
