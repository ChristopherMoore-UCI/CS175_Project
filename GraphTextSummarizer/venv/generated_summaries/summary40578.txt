"[The] whole time I have known him -- goes back 20 years -- he's led a hectic life," said former Clinton adviser and CNN analyst David Gergen. While keeping mostly mum on lifestyle changes, Clinton has opened up about his lifelong struggle with weight since undergoing surgery. -- Though Bill Clinton has received lots of attention for getting healthy since his 2004 heart surgery -- losing weight, exercising more, improving his diet -- associates of the former president Thursday stressed that Clinton continues to live at a breakneck pace and raised questions about the extent of his lifestyle changes. Friends say Clinton introduced healthier foods to his diet but hasn't written off fries and steaks entirely. Douglas Band, a counselor to the former president, said Thursday -- citing the former president's doctors -- that the symptoms that provoked Clinton's hospitalization weren't related to work, diet or cholesterol.
