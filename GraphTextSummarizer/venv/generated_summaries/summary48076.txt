Do I have to buy champagne to get good sparkling wine? Although many champagnes are delightful, most the world's wine regions make tasty sparkling wines of their own. Sparkling wines can be made in a variety of ways, but traditional champagne comes to life by a process called the methode Champenoise. The northern location makes it a bit cooler than France's other wine-growing regions, which gives the grapes the proper acidity for sparkling wine production. If it's a bubbly wine from another region, it's sparkling wine, not champagne.
