They tinkered with old pumps and materials, consulted with volunteer experts and low-income working moms and came up with prototypes for what they hope will be the next generation of breast pumps. The technology already exists to fix many of the biggest issues with breast pump technology, such as loud motors and bulky, weak batteries. They'll publish 3D files online so anyone with access to a 3D printer can print custom accessories and parts that work with existing pumps. A handful of teams focused on mimicking the natural feel of breastfeeding a baby instead of the vacuum technology used by current pumps. The winning team designed a pump for people who aren't able to take breaks to pump breast milk.
