What is taught in Texas often is taught in other states because publishers typically tailor textbooks for Texas, one of the largest buyers of textbooks in the country. "Textbook companies today have a real ability to customize textbooks and whatever the Texas board decides, I don't think that's going to impact education in other parts of the country." "Whatever Texas decides, I do not think there will be large ripple effects around the country," he said before Friday's votes. Three separate votes on amended guidelines for elementary-, middle- and high-school curricula each resulted in 9-5 splits along party lines in favor of the new standards, known as Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills. However, digital publishing has diminished the state's influence on textbooks nationally and that curriculum is always going to be decided at the local level, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said.
