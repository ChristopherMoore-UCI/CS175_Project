The Ralph Beckett-trained filly made a brilliant last-to-first move in the home straight at Epsom under jockey Richard Hughes to lead home a talented field including stablemate Secret Gesture in second and The Lark in third. The Lark was a further Â¾ length behind in third, with favorite Moth in fourth. After a somewhat fractious start in which several of the fillies appeared to become unsettled by the atmosphere on course, an early break-neck pace was set by David Simcock's Miss You Too, who appeared to taking a keen hold with jockey Ian Mongan. Talent, a 20-1 outsider, dominated rivals to capture the Oaks, the premier fillies' Classic of the season. At the start of the season, veteran jockey Hughes had yet to capture an English Classic.
