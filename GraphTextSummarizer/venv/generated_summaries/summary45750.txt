-- Ukraine and Dynamo Kiev striker Andriy Shevchenko is hanging up his football boots to begin a career in politics. Ahead of the October parliamentary election, the 35-year-old Shevchenko, who scored 48 goals in 111 caps for his country, is to join "Ukraine -- Forward!", a pro-business party, which was formed by politicians who were expelled by the main opposition coalition that used to be led by former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. " Shevchenko, who began and started his career with Dynamo Kiev, made his final appearance for the national team at Euro 2012, which Ukraine co-hosted with neighbours Poland.

"I want to fulfill myself in politics and share the experience I gained in Europe, to do something for my country," said Shevchenko, while visiting a children's summer school with Ukraine --
