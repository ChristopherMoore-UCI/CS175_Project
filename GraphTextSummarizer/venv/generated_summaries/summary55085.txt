Published accounts say adherents of those religions have disinterred remains for religious rituals, and Cameron said customs officials at airport ports of entry sometimes discover skulls being brought in for that purpose. "Periodically, human skulls found in our jurisdiction are traced to Santeria or Palo Mayombe source," said spokesman Larry Cameron. The discovery was disclosed Tuesday in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement news release summarizing the activities of the ICE Miami Tactical Dive Team, which assists in providing security on Florida waterways, aids in drug interdiction efforts and helps conduct underwater searches. A spokesman for the medical examiner said that in addition to looking for evidence of homicide, suicide, accidental death or natural death, his examiners also will consult with a local expert on Afro-Caribbean religions. The team was conducting routine training January 5 in the Palmetto Bay area when a diver discovered the skull in about 15 to 20 feet of water, said Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
