It wasn't long though before the left-handed Czech soon found her rhythm grinding down the spirited Stosur with a series of forehand winners to take the second set and level the match. Kvitova started brightly enough against Stosur taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set, but then a series of unforced errors let the increasingly confident Australian back into the contest. The 22-year-old Azarenka, meanwhile, enjoyed much the better of a series of baseline rallies with her Russian opponent, and despite her serve not being in the best order ran out an easy winner. The reigning Wimbledon champion recovered from a set down against Australia's Samantha Stosur to eventually win 5-7 6-3 6-3. Belarussian, Azarenka enjoyed a more comfortable 6-2 6-3 win over Russia's Vera Zvonareva.
