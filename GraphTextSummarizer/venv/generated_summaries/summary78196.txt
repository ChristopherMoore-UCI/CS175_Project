" The 20-year-old, who has played only seven international matches, glanced in an early header from Bastian Schweinsteiger's teasing cross which Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero could only deflect into the net with his right leg. Klose, who spent most of last season on the substitutes' bench at German champions Bayern Munich while Muller grabbed the headlines, made it 2-0 from close range in the 68th minute after being set up by Lukas Podolski. Veteran striker Miroslav Klose celebrated his 100th international appearance with two goals in Cape Town, taking him level second in the tournament's all-time scoring list alongside compatriot Gerd Muller on 14. The star-studded Argentina team rarely looked like breaking down the well-organized German line-up, and when they did put the ball in the net in the 36th minute Gonzalo Higuain was clearly offside. Coach Maradona -- who led Argentina to victory as captain against the Germans in Mexico in 1986 but suffered defeat in Italy four years after that -- took off right-back Nicolas Otomendi, who struggled to fill what has been a problem position for the team throughout the tournament.
