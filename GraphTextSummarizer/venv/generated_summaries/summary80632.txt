-- Actor Zachary Quinto, known for playing Spock in the 2009 "Star Trek" remake and his role as Sylar on the television show "Heroes," acknowledged his homosexuality in a post on his website Sunday, saying the action comes after the suicide of a 14-year-old who killed himself after apparently being harassed over his sexuality. "Our society needs to recognize the unstoppable momentum toward unequivocal civil equality for every gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered citizen of this country," Quinto said. "I also made an 'It Gets Better' video last year in the wake of the senseless and tragic gay teen suicides that were sweeping the nation at the time," Quinto wrote. I believe in the power of intention to change the landscape of our society -- and it is my intention to live an authentic life of compassion and integrity and action." Rodemeyer's life has changed his, the 34-year-old Quinto wrote. "When I found out that Jamey Rodemeyer killed himself -- I felt deeply troubled," Quinto posted.
