There are lots of little tangential stories that could become part of a prequel, or collected short stories. One of the nicest things I've heard, though, I've had a couple people say to me this is not a book for everyone, which I really like, because I don't particularly think there are books for everyone. After all the bells and whistles and Comic Con, and all the big stuff, really the fact that individual people are reading it and loving the book is just the best thing. Morgenstern: I'm going to be very busy with the book's release but when I have time I am working on a new book. Morgenstern: I like that "once upon a time" quality, where the telling of a tale has an elevated sense of story.
