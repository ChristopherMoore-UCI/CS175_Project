Roosevelt Mondesir, 52, was in jail Monday night after being charged with attempted first-degree murder, said Boynton Beach police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater. Boynton Beach police found him around 5:45 a.m. Monday in bushes near the 7-Eleven. She ran, but after being pulled out of the 7-Eleven the first time, Mondesir "threw fire onto her body" and she "became engulfed in flames," according to police. According to the report from the Boynton Beach Police Department, the woman -- interviewed about two hours later at Delray Medical Center, but not identified by police -- said she had gone to the 7-Eleven intending to meet her son's father and son for a "timesharing exchange." It was then that Mondesir came out with a red-colored can and began tossing gas on the woman and her vehicle, the woman told police.
