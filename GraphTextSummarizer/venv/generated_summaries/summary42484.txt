More arrests as power struggle racks Erdogan government in Turkey Recordings common Embarrassing recordings of private phone conversations have been emerging on the Internet on an almost weekly basis in Turkey, ever since police detained the Cabinet minsters' sons and dozens of other businessmen and officials closely linked to Erdogan's government on December 17. The government denounced the investigations, saying they were part of a coup attempt by what Erdogan officials described as a "parallel state" established within the police force and the judiciary. The recordings appear to be wiretaps of a series of conversations allegedly between Erdogan and Bilal. Thousands of police officers were removed from their posts after the corruption investigation, which caught Erdogan's administration by surprise.
