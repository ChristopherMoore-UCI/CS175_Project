So, with apologies to Dr. Seuss -- who would no doubt have found a way to rhyme "President Bar" with "Obamacare" -- here is my updated version of "Green Eggs and Ham. As part of his crusade, Cruz conducted a 21-hour talkathon on the Senate floor, during which he read Dr. Seuss' classic "Green Eggs and Ham." Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made news this week when he told CNN's Dana Bash that he would get his health care through Obamacare. Spoiler alert: "Green Eggs and Ham" ends with the protagonist actually trying the food he thought he hated -- and liking it. I do not like it President Bar.
