In a statement issued Tuesday, Gusman said he closed the House of Detention in 2012 because of its "state of disrepair and abhorrent lack of proper security measures." "Following Hurricane Katrina, we were forced to reopen the House of Detention to house inmates, because other inmate facilities were destroyed by the floods. Attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center say Gusman's neglect led to "brutal and inhumane conditions" for inmates, many of whom are jailed for non-violent misdemeanor offenses. The scenes were captured in 2009 on a camera smuggled into the House of Detention in New Orleans, a decrepit lockup pressed back into service after Hurricane Katrina. "In addition, we have been using eight temporary tents to house inmates. " U.S. District Judge Lance Africk is weighing whether to approve a settlement with the sheriff's office that would require the parish to provide appropriate housing, protection and medical care for inmates.
