"This is a thriving, dynamic region that needs a strong, sustainable Boston Globe playing an integral role in the community's long-term future," The Globe quoted Henry as saying. Henry's Fenway Sports Group owns the baseball club, Fenway Park, 80% of a regional sports television network and the giant Liverpool Football Club in England. As advertising losses and new reader habits afflicted newspapers nationwide, The Times began looking to shed The Globe and even threatened to close the paper in 2009 amid disputes with unions. -- The New York Times Co. will sell The Boston Globe to sports magnate John W. Henry for $70 million, a fraction of the price it paid for the paper two decades ago. Henry said he would disclose details about his plans for the newspapers soon, The Globe said.
