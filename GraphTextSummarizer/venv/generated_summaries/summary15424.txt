An October 2012 survey among young people aged 15 to 19 years old in Manila shows that 83% agree that there should be a law in the Philippines on reproductive health and family planning. The Filipino people, regardless of religion, are in favor of RH.  In June 2011, the Social Weather Stations, a survey group, reported that 73% of Filipinos want information from the government on all legal methods of family planning, while 82% say family planning method is a personal choice of couples and no one should interfere with it. The children remain undernourished and undereducated because their parents are ignorant about reproductive health care and choices. Support also comes from the Interfaith Partnership for the Promotion of Responsible Parenthood, the National Council of Churches in the Philippines, the Iglesia ni Cristo and the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches. Yet the majority of Catholic countries around the world have passed reproductive health laws, even Italy where the Vatican City is located.
