Djokovic was tested by Del Potro in Saturday's opening semifinal, but showed the fighting abilities he needed in earlier group-stage wins against Murray and Tomas Berdych as he prevailed 4-6 6-3 6-2. The 17-time grand slam champion blew away Andy Murray in Sunday's second semifinal, earning some measure of revenge for his defeat in August's Olympic gold medal match and denying the Scot another long-awaited milestone. It was the third time in London this year for the two of us and the crowd was electric," said two-time defending champion Federer, who beat Murray in July's Wimbledon final to match Pete Sampras' record of seven titles on the hallowed grass courts. At first it had seemed that Federer might have been feeling the effects of Saturday's three-set defeat by Juan Martin del Potro, as Murray -- who had an extra day off -- took an early 3-1 lead. Del Potro has won a career-high 65 matches in 2012, battling back into the top 10 after a long recovery from serious wrist problems.
