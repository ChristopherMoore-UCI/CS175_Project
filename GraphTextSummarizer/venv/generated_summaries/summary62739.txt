But U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Gregg was traveling with other former diplomats on a trip to "build bridges," and his visit was unrelated to Bae's case. Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American being held in North Korea, says he is worried about his health after authorities moved him back into a labor camp following a stay in a hospital. U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson has offered to go to North Korea to help get Bae released, a move the U.S. State Department says it supports. 'I have not lost hope' Bae operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to family members, who have described him as a devout Christian. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki on Sunday expressed disappointment that King's visit was called off and noted North Korea had said it wouldn't use Bae as a "political bargaining chip."
