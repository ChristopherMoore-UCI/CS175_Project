The increases in prize money come following pressure from top players concerned with the huge disparities between those who exit grand slam tournaments at an early stage and those who go much further. Wimbledon officials have announced the biggest increase in prize money in the history of tennis as part of a bid to make the sport attractive for future generations of players. On top of that, the reward for qualifying for the tournament proper has gone up by 41% for singles players and 22% for doubles players. According to the men's ATP World Tour website, the Ukrainian has career earnings of $2.65 million, having been ranked as high as 31st, which pales into insignificance compared to world No.1 Novak Djokovic. Players in Melbourne in January competed for a share of $31.1 million following an increase of $4.12 million.
