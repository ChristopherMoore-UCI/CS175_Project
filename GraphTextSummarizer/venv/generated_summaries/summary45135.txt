-- The string of attacks at the University of Florida in the past two weeks has sparked terrible memories of a week in August 1990 that sent a tsunami of fear through the student population and the city of Gainesville. Gun stores began selling out, students traveled in groups or left campus entirely. After Taboada was killed, fear increased, because it became clear men would not be spared and were just as vulnerable. By the time the killer was caught and about to go to trial, I was nearing graduation. I was a freshman back then and remember students being pulled out of school by their parents, who feared their children would be the killer's next victim.
