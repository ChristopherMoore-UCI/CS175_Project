Shark's fin is a popular dish among Chinese diners who appreciate its texture, if not its flavor, in soup. From January, diners won't be offered shark's fin products at the luxury Peninsula Hotels chain, due to a decision by its owners, the Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels group. "By removing shark fin from our menus, we hope that our decision can contribute to preserving the marine ecosystem for the world's future generations," the group's chief executive officer Clement Kwok announced in a brief press statement. The group says its decision is not based on consultation with guests, but since last April the chain has been offering banquet clients an alternative menu, substituting shark's fin soup with another fish soup. Once a delicacy favored by emperors, shark fin is often eaten at weddings to mark the importance of the occasion and impress the couple's extended families and friends.
