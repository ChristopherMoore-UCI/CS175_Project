"I wanted to imagine what these movies would look like if they were conceived and shot in Africa," explains Diop. But much to his surprise, Diop's first conceptual project, the futuristic "Fashion 2112," was selected the following year to be showcased at Bamako Encounters, Africa's premier photo exhibition. CNN's African Voices spoke to Diop about revisiting cinema classics and the transition from the corporate world to art. He quit his job last year and quickly started building an eclectic body of work that spreads from conceptual art to fashion photography and portraits. I'm also interested in the aesthetics of the 1970s and the 1980s, especially in Africa, and I always try to recreate that with the use of colors and styling references.
