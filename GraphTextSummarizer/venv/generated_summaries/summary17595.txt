-- Tonalist won the Belmont Stakes "fair and square," California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn told ABC on Monday as he apologized to horse racing fans and "the world" for his bitter remarks after the third leg of the Triple Crown. He apologized to Tonalist's owner and trainer, California Chrome's co-owner Perry Martin, California Chrome's fans, and to "all of horse racing and the world." Appearing on "Good Morning America" for the second consecutive day, the owner of the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes said he was ashamed of himself for his rants after his horse came up short in its bid to win the first Triple Crown since 1978. Medal Count was third while California Chrome and Wicked Strong tied for fourth. Many fans and nonfans agreed with him, however, saying it's fair to make horses run all three races.
