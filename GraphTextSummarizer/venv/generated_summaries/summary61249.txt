Lagarde, who was the finance minister of France, takes over at a crucial time for the IMF as the organization is working closely with the European Union and the European Central Bank to provide financial support for troubled European economies. Some developing nations had pushed to break that tradition, arguing that the IMF should consider candidates from rising economic powers in Asia and South America. The only other contender for the job was Mexican Central Bank chief Agustin Carstens, who was supported by Australia, Canada and Mexico. The IMF said it selected Lagarde, last week, by a consensus vote. Lagarde was also backed by the United Kingdom, Germany and most European powers, as well as some Asian and African nations.
