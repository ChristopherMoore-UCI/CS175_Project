Negotiators still have to tackle the difficult issues of how FARC rebels would disarm and the future of top rebel leaders who have been sentenced to prison for drug trafficking, murder and kidnapping. -- Peace negotiators trying to end Colombia's blood-drenched, five-decade old civil war Sunday announced an agreement on land reform between the Colombian government and FARC rebels. FARC leaders charge that government forces have illegally executed rebels and allowed right-wing paramilitary groups to carry out massacres. De la Calle said land that's privately owned would not be affected. "Urgent changes to the establishment are knocking on the door of the state, demanding citizen participation in political decisions and choices that would guarantee them a future with dignity," said FARC lead negotiator Ivan Marquez.
