-- Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is ready to fund a third search of the Atlantic Ocean if a second search, now under way, fails to find debris from last month's Air France crash, the company said Friday. Investigators pore over wreckage of Air France flight 447 which crashed killing 228 people on June 1. The company is driven by the desire to understand what caused the crash of Air France Flight 447 on June 1, he said. The locator beacons of flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders are designed to emit acoustic beacons, or "pings," for 30 days after a crash. " Airbus is already helping in the second search alongside Air France and the French accident investigations agency, the BEA.
