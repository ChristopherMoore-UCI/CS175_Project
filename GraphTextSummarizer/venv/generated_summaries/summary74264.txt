"Japan's research whaling is a legal activity," he said, noting that the country would continue to explain its perspective in international court. "If the consumption of whale meat does not endanger whale species, those who find the practice unacceptable for themselves should not try to impose their view on others. Japan's fisheries agency has said that it wants "sustainable whaling" and also advocates conservation. Japan's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups, who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants.
