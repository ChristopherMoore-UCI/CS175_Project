Feted by all those inside Stamford Bridge, Drogba stood and took in the applause from those in Chelsea blue. One of the greatest player's in the club's history, Drogba's spot kick in Munich, which secured the 2011 Champions League title, will never be forgotten. -- He returned to a hero's welcome but this was a night to forget for Didier Drogba. The Turkish side, which showed such defiance in the first leg, failed to threaten any sort of fightback after the break with Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech a mere spectator. From the moment Samuel Eto'o gave Chelsea a fourth minute leader, there was only one side which appeared likely to win this contest -- and unfortunately for Drogba, it was not Galatasaray.
