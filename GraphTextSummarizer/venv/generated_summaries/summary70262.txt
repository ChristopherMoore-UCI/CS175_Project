Many Muslims perceive these moves as the West targeting Iran and Turkey in an attempt to prevent important Muslim countries from achieving the military capacity -- Iran -- and the political stature -- Turkey -- they deserve. Future historians might call January 23 the day when Europe irreversibly alienated not one, but both, pivotal powers -- Iran and Turkey -- that in all probability will dominate the political landscape of the Middle East for several decades. For many in the Muslim world, double standards explain why France singled out Turkey, and didn't criminalize the denial of other nations' crimes against humanity. It's not the accuracy of the opposing claims that is at issue; it's Muslim perceptions. The issue of Armenian genocide touches a very raw nerve in Turkey, which denies the scale of the killings -- Turkey maintains that roughly 500,000 Armenians were killed -- as well as the claim that it was planned.
