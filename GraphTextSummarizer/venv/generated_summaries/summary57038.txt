Earlier this month, Project Right Side and Americans for Workplace Opportunity commissioned TargetPoint Consulting to conduct a survey to gauge voter support for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a bill that extends workplace protections to gay and transgender employees. Similarly, 86% of Republicans agree that "we should all follow the Golden Rule and treat others as we'd like to be treated, including gay, lesbian and transgender Americans." These, along with majority support for ENDA, underscore the vastness of the coalition supporting this important reform. This basic tenant of American life is at the heart of workplace protections that will build and strengthen both the country and our competitive enterprises. Republicans are demonstrating leadership to ensure basic workplace protections for all Americans. In addition to the poll, we used a state-of-the-art modeling technique to estimate attitudes toward workplace protections in all 50 states.
