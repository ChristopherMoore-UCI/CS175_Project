We must reduce detention and incarceration by increasing preventive supports and services children need, including access to comprehensive child health and mental health coverage, quality early childhood development programs like Early Head Start, and supports for parents including home visitation programs. The Harlem Children's Zone Project is a holistic system of education, social service and community-building programs designed to help the children and families in a 97-block area of Central Harlem from birth on, from classes on baby care and child development through preschool, intensive public charter schools and after-school activities right up to job training and college success programs. Child poverty and neglect, racial disparities in systems that serve children, and the pipeline to prison are not acts of God. Editor's note: Marian Wright Edelman is president of the Children's Defense Fund, a nonprofit organization that advocates for policies to help children escape poverty, abuse and neglect and gain access to health care and education. Incarceration is becoming the new American apartheid, and poor children of color are the fodder.
