There will also be cupcakes for each Super Bowl team and a special "snack food" cupcake made of pretzel crust, chocolate cake, peanut butter cream cheese filling and topped with icing and chocolate covered pretzel bits. Williams focuses his music blog on the Fountain Square neighborhood but loves music all over the city. For dessert, head to the Flying Cupcake Bakery on Mass Ave with at least 12 choices daily (and extended hours and specials for Super Bowl weekend). Super Bowl visitors will enjoy the fabulous Super Bowl parties and the very best of this Midwestern city's arts, music and food festivals tailored specially for this sports-filled week. The Vogue hosts dance nights most nights, but larger touring acts make their way through here as well (and those shows are usually smoke-free as well).
