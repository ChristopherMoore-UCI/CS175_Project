With a quarter of their 16 to 25 year-olds out of work, youth unemployment has become one of the most pressing issues facing EU leaders today. Youth unemployment is a tricky subject, especially for the EU which was partly conceived to ensure free movement of labor, goods and services. After demanding cuts in the age of austerity, politicians didn't seem to realize they'd have to support the private sector to provide jobs for people left unemployed in the public sector. And unless the initiatives are backed up by complementary policies in individual nations, the EU's June summit is likely to deliver patchy results. Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said he reckoned at least half of the EU funds agreed will be directed towards Greece, Spain and Italy where the issue is more acute.
