Conditions improved Friday morning when the Seoul Gimpo International Airport reported light rain and mist with overcast skies, according to the U.S. National Weather Service's international weather conditions website. On Thursday, rain fell in some areas around Seoul at a rate of 50 millimeters an hour (two inches an hour). But officials were able to restore electricity to many thousands of homes that had lost power. Five neighborhoods on the outskirts of Seoul had been under evacuation orders Thursday. Earlier, the agency warned that hundreds of families had lost their homes.
