High schools tackle football concussions "I think that it's something you can definitely see in how the younger kids are playing versus how the older boys are playing football because it's a whole different way of playing," said Rodriguez, a mom of three and host of the blog DudeMom.com. Other parents whose children play football pointed to sports such as horseback riding and gymnastics that can also be dangerous for children, but said the dangers of those sports often don't get as much attention as football. As we've learned more and more about the dangers of concussions and head injuries in football, including from research on the brains of professional players who died, we have seen a drop in the number of kids playing the game. "Because of its inherently violent nature, football is often singled out for scrutiny re: head injuries and head/neck injury deaths," said David Hawkins of Ann Arbor, Michigan, whose son plays football. "As with everything in our lives, including football, soccer and other sports, common sense and safety need to prevail," said Sattler, who is also the owner of a business providing sign language instruction.
