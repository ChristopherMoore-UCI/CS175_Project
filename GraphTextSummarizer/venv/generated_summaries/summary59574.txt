More than 200 girls were taken from school in the dead of night, by deadly terrorists with Boko Haram, in Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. On June 18 Boko Haram was reported to have abducted 60 females, including children, and killed 30 men in a raid on a village in northeastern Nigeria. -- A radio host pointed it out to me on my book tour, with alarm: a chapter in my new book -- written three years ago about my president, Goodluck Jonathan, and his handling of Boko Haram, terror and insecurity in Nigeria -- could have been written today, almost word for word. There have been accusations that government buses took touts to disrupt peaceful protests demanding better; the police commissioner in charge of Abuja -- forgetting briefly that the military left in 1999, apparently banned public protest -- although he later denied there was a ban. One of the president's advisers has given himself to farce, branding the informal head of the protests Obiageli Ezekwesili -- who co-founded Transparency International, was vice president of the World Bank's Africa division and has heroically given her life to this cause -- as "an opportunist who profits from national tragedy."
