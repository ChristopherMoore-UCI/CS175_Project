There's a telling quote from the Airbus head of passenger comfort, Kevin Keniston, who says: "Economy passengers who are not prepared to accept long-haul 17-inch crusher seats ... will choose airlines that offer better seat comfort. Would you prefer wider seats on planes, or are there other areas of cabin comfort you think would improve travel? But an extra inch in seat width definitely provides more comfort for all. The little flick-out flaps -- or "wings" -- that are now common on airline seat headrests make it about 0.5% more likely that your head will stay put allowing you to get some good zzzs. The air travel debate of the moment -- about seat width on planes -- is an easy one to be seduced by.
