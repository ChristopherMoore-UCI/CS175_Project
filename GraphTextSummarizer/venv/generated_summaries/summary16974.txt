"On 'Sons,' we exposed a lot of people to a new world," Sutter told CNN from Los Angeles. The show sprang from a different concept Sutter was pitching that looked at criminal activity from two points of view, the criminals and law enforcement. For years, Kurt Sutter has told stories of criminal activity -- first as a writer for "The Shield" and then as the creator of FX's wildly popular "Sons of Anarchy," a dramatized version of an outlaw biker gang in California. " Sutter is putting the finishing touches on the final episodes of "Outlaw Empires" while also in preproduction for the fifth season of "Sons." "We tapped into people that had relationships; some of these guys have been cleaning up their acts -- there's networks to get to these people," Sutter said.
