-- Victoria Azarenka has claimed her first grand slam title after comprehensively beating Maria Sharapova 6-3 6-0 in the final of the Australian Open in Melbourne. It was one-way traffic in the second set as Azarenka grew in confidence and Sharapova's challenge faded. Azarenka's victory, which comes in her first appearance in a grand slam final, also sees her succeed Caroline Wozniacki as the world number one. The 22-year-old made a tentative start to the match losing her opening service game with Sharapova backing up the break with a service hold. Break points in the first, third and fifth games were all greedily snapped up as Azarenka romped to the title.
