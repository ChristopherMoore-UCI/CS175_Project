The abduction and murder of Adam Walsh also fundamentally changed the way law enforcement agencies look for missing children. John and Reve Walsh turned their grief into activism on behalf of missing children and crime victims. After his son's death, Walsh became an advocate for missing children and crime victims, and host of the TV show "America's Most Wanted." "In 1981, when Adam disappeared, you couldn't enter missing children information into the FBI computer system," said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. "You could enter information on stolen cars, stolen guns and stolen jewelry, but you couldn't enter information on missing children," he said.
