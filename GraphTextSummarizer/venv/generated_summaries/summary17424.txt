Alongside their commitments in the GP2 series, Razia and Valsecchi will take part in Friday practice sessions this season. Barrichello was the fifth fastest driver in Friday's penultimate testing session, while seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher clocked one minute 21.268 seconds to set the quickest time for Mercedes. Maldonado will line up alongside veteran Brazilian racer Rubens Barrichello at British-based F1 outfit Williams, who finished sixth in the drivers' championship last year. CNN-sponsored Team Lotus were not involved in the session but they did confirm the appointments of Luiz Razia as third driver and Davide Valsecchi and Ricardo Teixeira as test drivers. And despite finishing down in 12th out of the 14 drivers participating in pre-season testing in Barcelona on Friday, Maldonado insists he is prepared for the challenges ahead.
