The northern tier of the United States -- places like Seattle, Minneapolis or Boston -- is normally the southern limit for the solar flares, meteorologist Jim Branda at the National Weather Service office in Memphis, Tennessee, said. But on Monday night, the display -- also known as the aurora borealis -- could be seen as far south as Oklahoma City, Memphis and Atlanta. If the sky is cloudy, it might be seen only once every 10 years in southern states, according to Branda CNN's Maggie Schneider contributed to this report "A storm on the sun's surface was blown off, and the solar wind scattered it," Branda said, explaining what created the natural light show. The northern lights came to the Deep South on Monday night, making them visible hundreds of miles farther south than they normally would be.
