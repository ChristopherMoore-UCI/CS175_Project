The nanny's duties are written into the custody order, she said, "I believe that Mr. Aubry resents the court order requiring that he have a nanny, and that his resentment has developed into dangerous and aggressive behavior towards me, particularly when I am in the presence of Nahla," Kambem said. I again expressed my concern to Mr. Aubry regarding the lack of communication about Nahla." " Alliance Kambem, who has been Nahla's nanny since June, accused Aubry of violently pushing her while she held Nahla in an incident last Wednesday, according to her sworn statement released by the court. I got away with Nahla as quickly as I could." Kambem's statement also described clashes with Aubry in Spain where Berry was shooting a movie last September. Her sworn declaration describes an incident last week when she went to Aubry's apartment in Los Angeles to pick up Nahla.
