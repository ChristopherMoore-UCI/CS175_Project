-- An array of witnesses testified Friday in the 20th day of the federal trial of reputed Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger: Former drug dealers, family members of alleged victims and a forensic dentist all took the stand. To sell cocaine in South Boston, Moore said that and his partner, Billy Shea, had to pay "rent," a weekly or monthly fee to Bulger and his gang. Weeks alleged that Bulger killed McIntyre after McIntyre admitted to letting authorities capture drugs that Bulger's gang had intended to sell. Some of Friday's most interesting testimony came when former drug dealers detailed the scare tactics they said Bulger used, including extortion and shooting one of their brothers. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran Boston's Irish mob.
