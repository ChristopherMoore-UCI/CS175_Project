Grammy-winning pop singer Bruno Mars will deliver the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show next February, the NFL announced Sunday. Mars appeared live on "Fox NFL Sunday" for the announcement just before the kickoff of the first week of Sunday afternoon games in the regular season. Michael Jackson's performance at Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 is credited with launching the tradition of blockbuster halftime shows. The next Super Bowl is set for MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Sunday, February 2, 2014. Fox Sports urged fans to stay tuned throughout the season "to see what surprises Bruno Mars has in store for this historic halftime show."
