He pointed to several pages where Facebook users are rallying around the victims of the Colorado shooting by posting memorials, messages of support and by trying to raise money for a victim who was shot and now is in an intensive care unit. It's not new for Facebook pages to pop up in support of accused killers and other distasteful figures, but a few dozen Holmes fan pages -- including one with more than 800 followers that appeared the day Holmes is accused of opening fire on a theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and wounding dozens -- are raising new questions about what constitutes free and appropriate speech in the digital age, especially on Facebook. In the past, Facebook has been criticized both for leaving up certain Facebook pages and images and for taking down others. "The mistake is made when people say what does this page mean about America?" he said, "This page doesn't say thing about America, besides maybe that there are too many Facebook pages." Wolens added that the Holmes fan pages are not representative of how Facebook users are responding.
