The storm was moving inland over southeastern New York state and heading northeast toward New England. The storm slammed into Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey, as a Category 1 hurricane around 5:30 a.m., the hurricane center said, hitting cities along the coast as it hurtled toward New York City. While most New Yorkers stayed holed up in their apartments, officials and residents in states further south began taking stock of the damage Irene left behind. Reports of tornadoes came from several states, including North Carolina and Virginia -- but a final determination will have to be made by the National Weather Service. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said flooding in his state was widespread and advised residents to stay indoors.
