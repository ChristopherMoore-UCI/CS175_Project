" American officials have tried but -- as of Thursday afternoon -- failed to contact Thai military officials to urge them "to immediately restore democracy and civilian rule," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. That's when then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra tried to push through an amnesty bill to allow the return of her brother Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister who lives in exile. Thailand is now under military control -- with its military chief in power, its constitution tossed, its political leaders detained, its citizens under martial law -- thanks to a coup that capped months of unrest. The military released a statement saying Prayuth now has the powers to act as Prime Minister until a new one takes office. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed disappointment and concern about the detention of political leaders, the shutting down of media outlets and the suspension of the Thai constitution.
