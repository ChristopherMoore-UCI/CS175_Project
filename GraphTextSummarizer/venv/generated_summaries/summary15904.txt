The number of U.S. travelers going abroad last year dropped 3% from 2010 to nearly 59 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Travel and Tourism Industries, but 2012 is looking strong for U.S. travel abroad. The U.S. State Department's latest worldwide safety caution issued Wednesday warns that terrorist groups "continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in multiple regions, including Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East." It is too early to tell if any of the events that have just occurred will impact travel," a Commerce Department official said via e-mail. "In the case of acts of violence or any other risk/crisis situation such as natural disasters, it is important that countries are prepared and have built crisis management structures and preparedness plans to deal with such unforeseen events in order to minimize their impact on tourism," wrote Sandra Carvao, a WTO spokeswoman, in an e-mail. While most of their travelers aren't heading into political hot spots, U.S. travel agents say their clients understand terrorist threats and political unrest are part of what they have to consider in a post-9/11 world, along with the price of a plane ticket.
