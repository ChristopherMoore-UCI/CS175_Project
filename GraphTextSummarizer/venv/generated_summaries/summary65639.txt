Four Four Two magazine's Tim Stannard explained how the absence of Villa, captain Carles Puyol and the loss of form of several key players could mean Joachim Low's Germany are now favorites for the tournament. "After not getting in the final practice and development desired, David Villa spoke with Del Bosque, who relayed that although it was Villa's wish to be with the team in Poland and Ukraine, that his physical state was 'not as good' as would be desirable. " It is the second setback for Del Bosque, who will also be without injured key defender Carles Puyol for the June 8-July 1 tournament. " Stannard tipped Llorente to fill Villa's boots, although he will first have to emerge unscathed from Bilbao's Copa del Rey final against Barcelona on Friday. Drawn in Group C, Spain will first face 2006 World Cup winners Italy in Gdansk on June 10 before playing Croatia and the Republic of Ireland.
