Fortunately for Hope and other dogs with disabilities, there is no shortage of information to help people care for animals with special needs. Upon hearing Hope's story, HandicappedPets.com offered Simpson a travel-friendly Walkin Wheels to keep Hope moving in the right direction. Firefighter Clay Gaddy, whose wife works with Simpson, downloaded instructions to transform 1-inch PVC pipe, foam insulation and a pair of lawn mower wheels into Hope's new ride. The vet tech decided the next best thing to taking Hope home was to move to Plan B: Build a wheelchair so the dog could get around and — hopefully — find a forever home. In the case of veterinary technician Christina Simpson, she fell for a patient that had been left behind at her roommate's veterinary clinic.
