a man asked President Barack Obama in a bar in Denver Tuesday night. Later, he walked down the streets of downtown Denver, giving fist bumps, shaking hands and slapping high fives. His boys' night out with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper at the bar the governor used to own consisted of, well, things that take place in bars. A teacher, a couple who own a small business, a college student, and a furniture store worker sat Obama down at the head of a table crowded with plates and pizza trays. Obama is holding a fundraiser for Sen. Mark Udall Wednesday and will give a speech focused on the economy to promote his policies to help workers.
