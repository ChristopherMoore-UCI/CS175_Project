-- Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal has signed on with Washington-based Leading Authorities to find paid speaking appearances for him, the lecture agency announced Tuesday. The retired general will speak about leadership, management strategy and global affairs, according to a Leading Authorities press release. McChrystal will teach a graduate-level seminar for students in the international relations master's program, Yale spokeswoman Dorie Baker said. He already has booked "multiple engagements," the source said, adding  that there has been a "significant amount of interest across industries"  to hear him speak. A spokeswoman for Yale said earlier that McChrystal has been appointed a senior fellow with the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at the university, beginning in the fall semester.
