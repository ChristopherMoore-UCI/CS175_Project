In the end, they came agonizingly close to victory, edged out by just one-tenth of a second after four runs on the Olympic course by Canadian duo Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse. Prior to traveling to Russia, U.S. Eagles coach Ric Suggitt invited Meyers to the US Olympic Training Center (OTC) in California to test herself at rugby. It has brought her two Olympic medals and two world titles, as well as a fiance -- fellow American bobsledder Nic Taylor. The inquest into every painstaking moment of that final run -- the American duo's slowest by half a second -- has dissipated in recent weeks, but Meyers concedes "you still can't help going through what happened, what you might have done differently." The pressure is on Meyers to play a remarkable game of catchup with her fellow American rugby players as she attempts to marry her strengths to the requirements of the code -- a shortened version of the 15-a-side union format.
