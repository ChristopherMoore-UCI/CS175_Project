We cannot demand that companies address race, and then attack them when they try. If we don't tamp down the backlash against Starbucks "Race Together" campaign, I fear that no major corporation will even try to talk about race again -- for maybe 10 or 20 years. Unfortunately, today's vicious backlash against Starbucks could become a case study in proving that -- when it comes to race -- no good deed goes unpunished. The people who will suffer the most are the ones who said they wanted a conversation on race in the first place -- but then wouldn't take "yes" for an answer. In fact, some activists are responding with such little sympathy, empathy and grace, that other corporations are like to run the other way.
