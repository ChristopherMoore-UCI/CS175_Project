Well, Laurence J. Peter is a former professor who published a satirical book based around his theory that "In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence" and that "In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties. In some cases, employees are in such denial that they do remain stuck or they get fired ... until they finally 'get' the message. A lot people believe the Peter Principle applies to just business, but there are an awful lot of people out there who live it in all areas of their life. So who is Peter and what did he do to make your boss so frustrating, you ask? [As a business consultant], the minute I find the people who are living examples of the Peter Principle is the minute I find the problems in the company.
