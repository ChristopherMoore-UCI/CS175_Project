The supply routes in the Khyber Pass were closed on Tuesday after Pakistani forces launched an operation against Taliban militants in the country's tribal regions, Pakistani military sources said. -- A key transit link for NATO and U.S. military supplies into Afghanistan is expected to reopen in the next two days, a Pakistani military official told CNN Wednesday. Earlier this month, suspected Taliban militants attacked cargo terminals in Peshawar, Pakistan -- which sits along the transit route -- destroying NATO military vehicles carrying supplies bound for Afghanistan, Peshawar police said. Eight people -- two suspected Taliban militants and six civilians -- died in Tuesday's fighting which involved military helicopter gunships, according to Pakistani intelligence sources. " NATO countries are working on plans with countries in the north -- including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- for possible new supply routes.
