When it rules, the court could strike down laws across the country banning same-sex marriage, or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out. "What kind of marriage is that?" The court appeared divided along ideological lines during the arguments about whether DOMA is discriminatory and steps on state marriage laws for gays and lesbians. Paul Clement, the high-profile lawyer hired by House Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republican legislators to defend DOMA, suggested the act was passed as a "cautious approach" in response to initial efforts in some states to change state marriage laws to include homosexuals. The overriding legal question in the California case is whether the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from refusing marriage to a defined class of people. The potential swing vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy, also questioned the reach of DOMA, saying it presents a "real risk of running into traditional state police power to regulate marriage."
