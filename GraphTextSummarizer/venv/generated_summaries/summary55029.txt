"The iPhone platform has proven to be a great opportunity for mobile developers, bringing a well-regulated market along with a solid development platform and, most importantly, very well-designed terminals," says Fiore Basile, CTO of iPhone developers 8080. Both emerging start-ups and veteran developers for mobile platforms are making uploading and updating content on a mobile device accessible with dedicated content management systems (CMS) and service-based subscriptions. For this reason, Kanchoo apps also support XML data, which allows content-providers to feed the same information into several different applications across platforms. So rather than create an application optimized for mobile devices with flowing text, 8080's PageStreamer encourages clients to upload pre-formatted PDF files to a CMS that converts their content into individual page sections, which can be magnified via the iPhone's touch screen. And while there are several other players on the mobile market, the undisputed favorite among mobile operating systems -- for now, at least -- is indeed the much-touted Apple iPhone OS.
