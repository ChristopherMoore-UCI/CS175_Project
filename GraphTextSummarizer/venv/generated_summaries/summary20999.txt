The group says Garcia is but one of many women who are ignored by police because they cannot file complaints in English. " Police have confirmed the May 30 report, and CNN has obtained copies of reports dated November 27 and 28 from Garcia's family, who found them among Deisy Garcia's belongings after she died. And a group that has a lawsuit pending against the city on behalf of six other Latina women says the case of Deisy Garcia and her young daughters is far from unique in New York. "If they would have given it more importance, would have translated it to English, then maybe they (police) would have figured out what to do, they would have investigated him, been more on top of the case, what was happening with them," said Luzmina Alvarado, Garcia's mother. " But the Garcia family, the Violence Intervention Program and the women the group represents say that it doesn't matter how many officers can speak multiple languages if non-English statements provided by complaint victims are ignored.
