That Republicans don't mind alienating voters by opposing same-sex marriage and immigration reform, which most young voters support, suggests a profound desperation -- namely, a party aware that it can't transform itself for the future and so willing to settle for last gasps of power with its old white voter base. Mind you, it's deeply disturbing that Republicans have used the fig leaf of voter fraud to justify disenfranchising countless legitimate voters to serve their partisan ends. But voter ID laws are a kind of Hail Mary pass thrown by a GOP all too aware that if it just lets everyone keep voting, Republicans are going to keep losing elections -- especially as the American electorate gets younger and more racially diverse. Voters know about "Republican War on Women" In 2012, it was easy to say the whole "War on Women" thing was an aberration that can be blamed on a few errant GOP candidates such as Todd Aiken. By their own deeds, not to mention rhetoric, Republicans just keep reinforcing their war on women and driving voters away.
