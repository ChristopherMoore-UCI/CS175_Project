Germany equalized five minutes later when Marcell Jansen headed home after Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera failed to cut out Jerome Boateng's deep cross. Forlan hit the German crossbar with the final play of the match from a stunning free-kick as the South Americans finished the tournament on a losing note. Lahm's replacement Dennis Aogo was lucky not to be sent off for a bad early tackle on Diego Perez, but Germany had the ascendancy as Arne Friedrich headed Mezut Ozil's corner against the Uruguay crossbar in the 10th minute. -- Three-time champions Germany finished third for the second successive World Cup after coming from behind to defeat Uruguay 3-2 in Port Elizabeth on Saturday night.

Khedira gave 2002 runners-up Germany the lead in the 82nd minute as Uruguay failed to clear Ozil's corner and the midfielder was able to place his header over the despairing Muslera.
