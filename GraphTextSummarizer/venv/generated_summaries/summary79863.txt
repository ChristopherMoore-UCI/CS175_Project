The 50-year-old Stevens in January took a call from Oxbow trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who he told him "I'm going to have a colt for you." The horse, ridden by veteran Gary Stevens, dashed the Triple Crown hopes of Orb, which finished fourth at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. Oxbow came into the Preakness as a 15-1 shot, and "didn't get a lot of respect after the Derby," Stevens, who came out of retirement earlier this year, told NBC. It was the third Preakness victory for Stevens, who had settled into a second career as a race commentator before the call from Lukas. "He's like a brother, a coach and a father figure to me," Stevens said of Lukas, who now claims six Preakness winners.
