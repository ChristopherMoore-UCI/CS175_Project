Promising "next generation experiences," Sony Computer Entertainment of America president Jack Tretton introduced new games aimed at mature audiences: "The Last of Us," "God of War: Ascension" and "Beyond: Two Souls." Much of the event focused on integration between the current PlayStation 3 and the handheld PlayStation Vita and the mention of a new service called PlayStation Mobile that will bring the PS experience to mobile phones and tablets. Tretton said there will be 60 new titles for the Vita next year and PlayStation 1 titles will also be available for play on the handheld console. " There will also be exclusive titles for the Vita, like "Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified" and "Assassin's Creed III: Liberation," featuring a female lead assassin. "We are investing heavily (in) cross-play (playing on PS3 and Vita simultaneously)," Tretton said.
