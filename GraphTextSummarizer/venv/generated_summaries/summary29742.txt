Both players will now return to Europe for the clay court season where Djokovic will be searching for his first French Open title, while Murray will continue his quest for a first grand slam title under new coach Ivan Lendl. Murray closed to 3-2 after winning a 25-shot rally with a backhand sliced drop shot, but he double faulted on the next point and Djokovic took full advantage. World No.4 Murray was always on the back foot after losing the opening set, being broken twice and unable to make an impression on the rock solid Djokovic service. -- Novak Djokovic retained his Miami Masters 1000 title with an emphatic 6-1 7-6 final victory over Britain's Andy Murray Sunday. The World No.1 was at his relentless best to avoid a repeat of his defeat to Murray in Dubai last month.
