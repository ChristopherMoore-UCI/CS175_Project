Peering up at 147, 12 foot-high flags adorning London's shopping district, Brenda Tode shows off her new Union Jack top to classmates on a school trip from Berlin.

Once seen as a stuffy symbol of Imperial nostalgia, it was hijacked by the far-right, leading to false accusations of nationalism for purveyors of Union Jack products.
