Libyans turn out big in historic election Saturday, about 1.7 million Libyans -- roughly 60% of the nation's 2.8 million registered voters -- cast ballots, Al-Abbar said. The election came 17 months after political demonstrations against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi broke out in two Libyan cities. The turnout was expected to increase Sunday, as eight polling centers were opened after violence on election day stopped voters from casting ballots the day before. Friday, anti-aircraft fire hit a Libyan air force helicopter transporting ballot boxes from the eastern city of Benghazi to nearby areas, the Interior Ministry said. And protesters earlier last week attacked a warehouse and torched ballots and other election materials.
