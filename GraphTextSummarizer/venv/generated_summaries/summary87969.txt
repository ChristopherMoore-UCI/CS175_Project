Over the next several hours, several speakers allied with the Martin family took to the lectern demanding Zimmerman's arrest, calling for city officials to take a stand, and criticizing how the police investigation was handled. In communities big and small, people wore hooded sweatshirts -- hoodies -- and carried Skittles and iced tea -- just as Martin had done on the night of his death -- as they called for Zimmerman's arrest, legislative changes and an end to racial profiling. Newspaper report fills in some blanks about incident "Do the right thing, arrest Zimmerman now," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, in presenting Sanford's city commission with a petition he claimed had been signed by 2 million people who urged that the shooter be detained. Demonstrators there said they believed race was a factor in Martin's death at the hands of Zimmerman, who is a white Hispanic. The teen's admitted shooter, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, hasn't been charged in the case, and his lawyer has said his client shot Martin in self-defense.
