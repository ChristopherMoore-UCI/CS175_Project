The EU Commission announced Thursday it will pay for temporary storage of butter, skimmed milk powder and certain cheeses in order to help its farmers deal with the impact of Russian economic sanctions. In a tit-for-tat move against Western sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin banned imports of most agriculture products from the U.S., the European Union, Norway, Canada and Australia. European countries sold more than $3 billion worth of dairy products to Russia in 2013 -- $1.3 billion worth of cheese, $192 million in butter and $140 million of fresh milk. "At the moment, there is no formal ceiling on butter and skimmed milk products," Waite said. The price tag on the help for milk farmers is not yet clear as details will be announced next week.
