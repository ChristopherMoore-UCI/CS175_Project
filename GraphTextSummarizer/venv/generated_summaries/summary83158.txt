" Transgender first-grader wins the right to use girls' restroom Kids who veer from gender norms at higher risk for abuse Parents urged to support, safeguard children as they explore gender -- A transgender rights advocacy group says the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles restricted a teen's free speech rights by asking him to remove his makeup for a driver's license photo. Chase considers himself "gender non-conforming," he told CNN affiliate WYFF. "His freedom to express his gender should not be restricted by the DMV staff," the fund's executive director, Michael Silverman, said. "That's been the policy since August of 2009," spokeswoman Beth Park said.
