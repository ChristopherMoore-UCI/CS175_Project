-- As U.S. President Barack Obama set a January deadline for proposals to deal with gun violence, new details emerged Wednesday about the mother of the gunman who killed 27 people in a Connecticut shooting rampage last week. "We are looking for a civil discussion of gun control, mental health, school safety and school facilities, so that we as a nation can work together to come up with a solution." A Facebook page called "RIP Caroline Previdi -- Sandy Hook Massacre Victim" had more than 5,400 "likes" on Wednesday morning. Speaking five days after the massacre, Obama said Wednesday that a new group led by Vice President Joe Biden is charged with developing "concrete proposals" for dealing with gun violence "no later than January."
