" James 'Whitey' Bulger: Fast Facts Uhlar criticized Morris, who testified about leaking confidential information that led to the murders of Bulger crime associate Brian Halloran and Michael Donahue, an innocent truck driver caught in the crossfire. Known as Juror Number 12, Uhlar told CNN the government "enticed" many Bulger associates to testify by giving them "extremely outrageous deals." I felt like a traitor." Still, Uhlar and her 11 fellow jurors found Bulger guilty of extortion, money laundering, drug dealing and weapons possession. Gangster justice: How mobsters met their fates Uhlar said that aside from the testimony of Bulger's cronies, she and the other jurors could find no supporting evidence in several murders that they ruled "not proved." Testimony revealing deep-seated corruption in the FBI and government during Bulger's heyday left Uhlar disgusted with a justice system she called "tainted," even now.
