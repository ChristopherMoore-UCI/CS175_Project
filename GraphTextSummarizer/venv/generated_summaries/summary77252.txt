Spain's Consitutional Court on Tuesday suspended -- for the second time since September -- a referendum on independence for Catalonia, the wealthy, restive region in northeast Spain whose capital is Barcelona. Citizens groups which have pushed hard to hold the referendum, and which also favor independence, sent notifications on Tuesday to news media about where to pick up accreditations in Barcelona in order to follow the election results on Sunday night. Even after Scotland voted to remain a part of the United Kingdom, many Catalans said the key issue was being allowed to vote in Catalonia on independence. A controversial referendum on Catalonia's future as part of Spain has again been put on hold by a court, just days before the planned vote on Sunday. Yet preparations continue for holding some kind of vote on Sunday in Catalonia.
