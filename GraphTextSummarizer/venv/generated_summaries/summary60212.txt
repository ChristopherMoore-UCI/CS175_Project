-- Environmental activist Erin Brockovich was in Kingston, Tennessee, on Thursday to speak with residents affected by a massive spill of coal sludge from a nearby coal-fired plant. TVA, the nation's largest public utility, promised to do whatever it takes to clean the spill in central Tennessee. Properties near ground zero of the December 22 Tennessee spill are covered in sludge. About 1.1 billion gallons of sludge, or ash mixed with water, spilled onto 300 acres from the plant located 40 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee. Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen promised state government will keep a close watch on TVA's cleanup.
