"Some government officials and diplomats have fled to Bukavu (in eastern Congo) and across the border to Rwanda," said a journalist in Goma who did not want to be named for his own security. Early on Saturday, rebel soldiers launched attacks on several key towns north of Goma using heavy weapons, said the U.N. Congo mission in a press release. The U.N. and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebel group by providing it arms, support and even soldiers. But security analysts say the rebellion in eastern Congo has dangerous regional implications, and the international community has expressed alarm at the latest M23 advancement. U.N. Forces in the region of North Kivu said that they deployed attack helicopters and ground troops to respond to the M23 advances on Goma.
