-- Charges against actress Lindsay Lohan in an alleged Manhattan nightclub fight "are not ready to proceed at this time," her attorney said Monday after a hearing at New York criminal court. Lohan did not attend the hearing because there was nothing for her to plead to, said her attorney, Mark Heller. She was on probation for a 2011 conviction on charges related to the theft of a necklace, but that probation was jeopardized in November 2012 when the city attorney in Santa Monica, California, filed four charges against her in connection with a car crash last summer. Heller said Lohan didn't hit anyone. The charges, all misdemeanors, stem from a car crash while Lohan was on her way to the set for the filming of "Liz & Dick," a Lifetime movie that aired last year.
