We can continue to feed climate disaster by anchoring our future in the fossil fuels of the past, or we can protect future generations from the ravages of climate change by investing in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow. For example, Pope Francis is expected to publish an encyclical on the state of the world's environment, singling out climate change as an urgent challenge to global stewardship. Some power companies are already well on their way, investing in efficiency so we can do more with less waste, getting more power from the wind and sun, cleaning up dirty power plants or some combination of the three. That means average land and sea temperatures, worldwide, have never been hotter in modern times, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (the gold standard for global climate data) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (the guys who put a man on the moon). Above and beyond the economic costs, climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world.
