Bolt added, Meanwhile, former Olympic gold medallists Sebastian Coe and Sergey Bubka have been elected as vice-presidents of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Jamaica's Powell, who took 100m bronze at the last championships in Berlin two years ago, was expected to be one of the main challengers to his compatriot and reigning champion Usain Bolt. His absence and that of leading American Tyson Gay would appear to leave the way clear for Bolt to retain his title, but the world record holder told gathered reporters Thursday that was short of his very best form after battling back from injuries that curtailed his 2010 season. Initially, former Ukrainian pole-vaulter and gold medallist at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul Bubka missed out on election to Canadian Abby Hoffman. -- Former 100 meter world record holder Asafa Powell has pulled out of the world championships in Daegu, which are set to get under way on Saturday.
