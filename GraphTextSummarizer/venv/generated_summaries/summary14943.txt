And that's why, to create new flying robots that work in the world outside the lab, these pioneering researchers are looking to birds. "Small micro air vehicles that can fly close to buildings or in cluttered environments or through turbulence, they actually encounter the exact same problems that birds have encountered for millions of years and solved," he adds. "I study how birds fly and I use it as an inspiration for developing new robots," says David Lentink, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University. Flying robots' aerial acrobatics It's not just cameras that are revealing the secrets of bird flight. But for Lentink, learning more about bird flight inspires admiration of the "extraordinary" creatures.
