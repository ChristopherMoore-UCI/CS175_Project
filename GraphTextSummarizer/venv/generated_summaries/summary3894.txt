"An airplane hangar full of largely bruised, contorted artifacts" formed the basis of the museum, says curator Jan Ramirez. The museum, said Ramirez, is sure to be emotionally overwhelming to anyone who survived September 11, to all New Yorkers, and perhaps even to the millions of people who watched the events of that day unfold on television. Ramirez, the museum's curator, said regardless of religious belief, people found inspiration in the cross and that is why it was included in the museum. From the beginning, Ramirez and all those who worked under museum director Alice Greenwald faced a flurry of contradictions and dilemmas over what to show, how much to reveal. The museum collected items from survivors, families of the dead, first responders, cleanup workers and agencies that were part of the investigation.
