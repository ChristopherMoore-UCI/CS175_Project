On Monday, Suleman filed for federal bankruptcy protection. "I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told HLN "Showbiz Tonight" correspondent Nischelle Turner. "I have had to make some very difficult decisions the year, and filing Chapter 7 was one of them," Suleman said in a written statement Monday. "But my goal, my goal is to get off this immediately." Suleman dreams of building a business "empire" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children. Suleman invited Turner and a camera crew into her home on Friday to see firsthand how she's dealing with financial and parenting pressures.
