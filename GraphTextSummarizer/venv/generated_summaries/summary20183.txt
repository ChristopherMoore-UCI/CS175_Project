Turning Everest waste into art Among climbing enthusiasts on social media, word spread quickly of the fight in one of the world's most hard-to-reach, but well known, locales. Sherpas from different expeditions put down ropes to the summit and later, other climbers hold on to them to scale the mountain. The majority of climbers are on commercial expeditions and are aided by Sherpas to reach the summit. This is true for professional and recreational climbers, and for Sherpa who earn most or all of their family's annual income in these two months on the mountain," guide Adrian Ballinger wrote. According to mountaineering officials, 340 foreign climbers from about 30 expeditions have been given permission to climb Everest this year with about the same number of high-altitude Sherpas set to assist them.
