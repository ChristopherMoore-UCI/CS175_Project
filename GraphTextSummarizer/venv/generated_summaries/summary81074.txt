Veteran Mark O'Meara shared third place with fellow American David Toms after both shot 66, while world No. 2 Martin Kaymer was tied for fifth on 67 with U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell, South Africa's Rory Sabbatini and Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson. -- Tiger Woods' return to golf proved to be short-lived when the former world No. 1 pulled out of the prestigious Players Championship after only nine holes of Thursday's opening round. The 30-year-old American, seeking his second title this year and fourth PGA success overall, birdied his first three holes after starting at the 10th tee then gave back two shots at the par-four 14th. The American was making his comeback after suffering knee and Achilles injuries during the Masters at Augusta last month, but those problems recurred from his first shot at Sawgrass. He has been revamping his swing under the tutelage of coach Sean Foley, but is still having problems with the same left knee that required surgery after he seriously injured it during his triumph at the 2008 U.S. Open.
