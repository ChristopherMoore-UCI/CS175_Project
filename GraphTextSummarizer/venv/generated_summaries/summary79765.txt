It's no coincidence that these organizations are often mentioned when describing health care providers that offer high quality care while staying affordable. Integrated health systems simply assume responsibility for both the financing and delivery of care, so they try to keep patients healthy and avoid costlier illnesses and hospitalizations down the road. Admirers of these foreign systems point to their low costs and accessible primary care services, but they may be surprised to find that successful integrated health systems in this country are organized very similarly to the most admired state-sponsored systems found overseas. Other innovations routinely seen in integrated systems include digital medical records, direct electronic messaging with providers, instant access to health records and test results, telehealth and home-based medical services and affordable access to primary care. This is the mantra that guides care delivery in both the best-performing systems overseas and in prepaid integrated systems in the United States.
