-- Staffan de Mistura -- who has been the United Nations' top emissary in Iraq, Afghanistan and other once-volatile locales -- is moving on to Syria, in the hope of turning the tide after years of war there. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Thursday that de Mistura will take on role as the world body's official facilitator on Syria. Ban expressed confidence that de Mistura's experience working "in very delicate, difficult places like Iraq and Afghanistan" will serve him well in his new post. "He will bring all his expertise and experience to these very difficult negotiations for peace in Syria, so I am confident that he will be able to carry out his duty as special envoy," the U.N. leader said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague was among those offering "our strong support" to de Mistura in his new effort to foster peace in Syria. In January 2010, de Mistura was named the U.N. secretary-general's special representative to Afghanistan in the midst of more violence as well as talks involving the Taliban, which has fought against forces loyal to the Kabul-based central government.
