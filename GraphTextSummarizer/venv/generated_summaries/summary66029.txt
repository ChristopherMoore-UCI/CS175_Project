To understand why children are fleeing in droves, CNN traveled to San Pedro Sula, Honduras. For Monsignor RÃ³mulo Emiliani, Auxiliary Bishop of San Pedro Sula, the migration of Central American children to the United States is a regional disgrace. Last year, U.S. immigration authorities in the United States detained nearly 18,000 minors from Honduras as they were trying to cross the border without documents. Children are fleeing endemic poverty and drug violence in Central America. Juan Armando Enamorado, a 22-year-old who lives in the coastal town of Tela, Honduras, says he almost lost his life at 17 when he jumped off the train, fleeing from gangs.
