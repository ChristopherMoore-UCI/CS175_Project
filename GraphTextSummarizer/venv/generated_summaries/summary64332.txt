Hoboken mayor: 'It's true' Christie administration withheld Sandy funds The turn of events is quite something considering she once tweeted during the Sandy aftermath that she was "very glad Governor Christie has been our Gov." After Sandy, Hoboken was about 80% underwater. The stakes are high and Zimmer's right in the middle of it with her allegations the administration conditioned Superstorm Sandy relief money for her town to her support for a redevelopment project proposed by a company with ties to Christie. -- Hoboken, New Jersey, Mayor Dawn Zimmer is again embroiled in a controversy over redevelopment in her community. The second has added fuel to the fire of scandal consuming the administration of Gov. Chris Christie, a possible presidential candidate. Republicans paint her as one of many partisan opportunists seeking to derail Christie, who appeals to both GOP and Democratic voters in traditionally "blue" New Jersey.
