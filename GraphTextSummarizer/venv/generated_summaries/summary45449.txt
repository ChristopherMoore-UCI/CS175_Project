The Android app was upgraded to, among other things, put less drain on battery life. The changes to the latest version of Yahoo Mail include removing some of the boxes that filled the page in the Web version and offering thumbnail images of attachments, presumably to help avoid clicking on scams, spam and other unwanted content. That's technology similar to that used by Google with Gmail, which uses search algorithms, not real people, to read through the content of people's messages in order to target relevant advertising -- as well as other features -- to them. This change has been in the works since December, when Yahoo, under the guidance of new CEO Marissa Mayer, announced a major and long-awaited overhaul of e-mail. "You've told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to e-mail," Mayer said at the time.
