It's only in the last third of the film that Hunt and Lauda become flesh-and-blood human beings instead of videogame avatars. Chris Hemsworth draws the flashier role in Hunt, a fast-burning British bad boy with flowing blond locks, silk shirts unbuttoned to his navel, and a rakish playboy swagger. More than in any racing movie since 1966's "Grand Prix," the action scenes capture the daredevil kick of sitting in the cramped, claustrophobic cockpit of a Ferrari, zipping around hairpin turns as tires squeal and engines roar. Based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One racing legends James Hunt and Niki Lauda, "Rush" is a tale of two opposite personalities eyeing the same checkered-flag goal: winning the 1976 world championship. When they're not putting the pedal to the metal, Lauda and Hunt are painted as broad archetypes â€” the bad and the beautiful.
