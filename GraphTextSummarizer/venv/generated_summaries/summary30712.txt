Williams' personal assistant, concerned because he wasn't responding to knocks on his door, entered the room and found him dead at about 11:45 a.m., Boyd said. Williams' left wrist had cuts, Boyd said. The connection between the two was completed when Winters was cast as Williams' son on "Mork & Mindy." When Winters died in 2013, Williams said he was "my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend." Boyd would not confirm or deny whether Williams left behind a letter, saying that investigators would discuss  "the note or a note" later. Williams was last seen alive at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday, by his wife, when she went to bed, Boyd said.
