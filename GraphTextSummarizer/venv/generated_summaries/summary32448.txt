In November 1942,  the unguarded SS City of Cairo was sunk by a German U-boat while carrying 296 civilians and cargo that included 100 tons of silver. For most of those years, the money was deep at the bottom of the Atlantic, the monetary casualty of a cruel World War II sinking. It took more than seven decades, but England finally got its delivery of tons of silver coins. "Under contract to the UK Ministry of Transport, DOS recovered several tens of tons of silver coins from a depth of (5,150 meters)," the company said. Deep Ocean Search got a percentage of the sale, and the UK Treasury the rest, according to the BBC.
