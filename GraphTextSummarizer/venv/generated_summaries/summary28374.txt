Investigators tracked her down Friday morning at her workplace, Sheriff Rich Stanek said. " Minneapolis Police Department spokeswoman Ameilia Huffman had previously told CNN the sheriff's count was "speculative," and Police Chief Tim Dolan had estimated 20 to 30 people remained missing. The five people confirmed dead were all identified by Friday evening. As divers searched the murky waters Friday, there was relief when one woman feared missing was found alive and well, the Hennepin County sheriff said. Friday morning's recovery effort went more smoothly than anticipated, Stanek said.
