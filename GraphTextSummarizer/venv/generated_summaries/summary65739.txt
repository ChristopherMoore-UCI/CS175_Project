It's just all in a day's work for Jones, who simply sees himself as a bulwark against efforts by everyone from the Gates Foundation -- run by Microsoft founder Bill Gates -- to conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh to undermine the free world. " In a commentary on his website, Jones objected to the use of the word "paranoid," but otherwise corroborated the accuracy of the Rolling Stones article, which described an extreme distrust of prominent world institutions, leaders and media figures. Titles warn of a coming "Police State," the impending "Fall of the Republic" and the undermining of American society by Obama -- who Jones says is paving the way for world dominance by corporations and banks. The Anti-Defamation League says Jones surpasses conservative radio host Glenn Beck for anti-government hostility, placing both on the "extreme fringes. " In 2009, Psychology Today said Jones hand picks facts to drive home his theories.
