The mysterious report from Guy Hottel, special agent in charge in Washington, begins with this: "An investigator for the Air Force stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. In an article headlined " 'Aliens exist' say real-life X-Files," the London tabloid The Sun said the memo appeared to back the claim that extraterrestrials landed in Roswell, New Mexico. "It certainly looks like, they thought this was third-hand information," said FBI historian John Fox. " The memo also relays a potential explanation for why the flying saucers were found in New Mexico. -- Out of all the case files made public by the FBI online, the most popular is a memo from 1950 titled "FLYING SAUCERS," the agency said this week.
