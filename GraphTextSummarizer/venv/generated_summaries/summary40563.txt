While Hong Kong, as a non-rabies zone, has stringent import restrictions on pets, requiring at least four months quarantine for dogs and cats imported from mainland China, it's not difficult to find pet shop owners in nearby Shenzhen that can deliver a Tibetan Mastiff to the front door of a Hong Kong apartment within two weeks. The current vogue for Tibetan mastiffs in mainland China -- where the nouveau riche have reportedly paid as much as US$750,000 for prize-winning specimens -- has reached Hong Kong, though keeping big dogs in a city where the average flat size is just 484 square feet (45 square meters) presents a dangerous challenge. Hong Kong-based vet and animal behaviorist Dr. Cynthia Smillie said Tibetan mastiffs, apart from being ill-suited to Hong Kong's muggy tropical climate, are temperamentally a poor fit in this densely-populated city where a high level of socialization is demanded of people let alone big dog breeds. Ultimately, the problem of space in Hong Kong has driven home the reality of keeping inappropriate dogs in a highly urban environment. " Demand for the breed in Hong Kong -- often fueled by celebrity owners such as rock star Paul Wong formerly of the Canto rock group Beyond - has fueled a thriving, and sometimes illicit, business in mainland China.
