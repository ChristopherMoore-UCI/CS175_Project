Human Rights First CEO Elisa Massimino argues, "Facebook's privacy policies are prohibitively confusing, make it difficult for users to protect personal information, expose to disclosure information users believe is private, and are changed without adequate warning or consent from users." Mark Zuckerberg has responded to such criticisms in two rather different ways. Health insurance companies could disclose information to employers,  corporations profited as clearinghouses of buyers and sellers of medical records,  and pharmaceutical companies used patient information to more successfully market prescription drugs to individuals. Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy says that "Facebook has purposefully worked to erode the concept of privacy by disingenuously claiming users want to share all of their personal information." In 2000, a new federal right to medical privacy was established in the United States. No wonder now there are very few reports of violations of medical privacy.
