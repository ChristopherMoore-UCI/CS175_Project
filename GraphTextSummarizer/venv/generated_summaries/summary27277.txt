The case tested the free speech rights of adults against the power of Congress to control Internet commerce. The high court and subsequent federal courts said the law -- which has never taken effect -- had serious free speech problems. "Filters are less restrictive" he said, and thus pose less risk of muzzling free speech. He added, "There is a potential for extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech" if the law takes effect." Free speech advocates said adults would be barred access to otherwise legal material and that parental-control devices and various filtering technology are less intrusive ways to protect children.
