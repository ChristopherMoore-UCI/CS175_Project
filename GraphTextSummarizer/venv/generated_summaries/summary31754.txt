"We're on the offensive against al Qaeda in Iraq and the foreign terrorists who help them," said Maj. Winfield Danielson, Multi-National Forces-Iraq spokesman. Muqtada al-Sadr, the populist Shiite cleric, and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the head of the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, forged the agreement in the spirit of the current Muslim holy month of Ramadan, said SICI spokesman Haytham al-Husseini. The men head movements that are in the middle of a power struggle in Shiite regions across Iraq, particularly in the south. Al-Husseini said al-Sadr, who recently returned to Iraq from Iran, signed the agreement in Najaf, the Shiite holy city in the south, and al-Hakim signed it in Iran. The military, underscoring its earlier account of the incident, said it was targeting a Shiite militant believed to be associated with members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force, the entity accused by the United States of providing arms and training to insurgents in Iraq.
