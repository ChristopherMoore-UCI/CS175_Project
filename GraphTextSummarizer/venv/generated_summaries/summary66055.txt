On the night of the incident, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN Secret Service officers apprehended Gonzalez "just inside the North Portico doors. In a sworn affidavit filed with the court on the night of the incident, Secret Service officer Daniel Hochman offered details based on his "personal observations" of Gonzalez's sprint inside the White House. Gonzalez appeared in a DC federal court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty on charges of unlawful entry while armed and two other charges. "I think the original complaint is accurate that Mr. Gonzalez scaled the fence," Pierson responded. Soon thereafter, inside the White House, Omar Gonzalez was apprehended by United States Secret Service Officers," Hochman said in the affidavit.
