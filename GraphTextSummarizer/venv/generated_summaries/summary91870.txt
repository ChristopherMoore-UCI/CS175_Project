An independent report released Monday into the execution of Arizona inmate Joseph Wood revealed the state's Department of Corrections followed protocol. "This independent review concluded that at all times following the administration of the execution protocol, the inmate was fully sedated, was totally unresponsive to stimuli, and as a result did not suffer," said Corrections Director Charles Ryan. In documents filed with the state Supreme Court, Wood contended the use of the anesthetic midazolam was problematic in recent U.S. executions and that it would violate the Constitution's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. "Based on this report, I forwarded my assessment to Governor Jan Brewer that the state continue efforts to procure drugs for the one-drug protocol, and begin the process to adopt three-drug protocols, as opposed to utilizing a modified two-drug protocol," Ryan said. Wood's attorney, Dale Baich, argued the report did not "answer the question of why the experimental drug protocol did not work as promised.
