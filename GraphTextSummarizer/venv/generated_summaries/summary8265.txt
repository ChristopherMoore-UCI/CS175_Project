And playing at home, the Serbians will be relishing the tie event more as they look to seal their place in Davis Cup history. World number three and 2008 Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, and former female world number ones Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic all grew up at the height of the country's troubles, but their success at the top of the game has firmly put Serbia on the map as a tennis superpower. Belgrade-born Djokovic, grand slam doubles champion Nenad Zimonjic, 30th-ranked Viktor Troicki and world number 49 Janko Tipsarevic make up the team that will hope to secure sporting success for their country in front of a packed crowd at the city's indoor tennis center. "I think that Serbia are the favorites -- they are at home," Remi Bourrieres from Tennis Magazine France told CNN. The prospect of playing their 16th Davis Cup final against some of the world's top players in front of a partisan Serbian crowd is something that France have acknowledged is a tough task -- but not an impossible one.
