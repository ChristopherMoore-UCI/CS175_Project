We sincerely apologize to Mr. Gleason, his family and all those touched by ALS," Mack wrote. Steak Shapiro, Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini aired a spoof of former New Orleans Saints defensive back Steve Gleason, who is battling the neuromuscular disease formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There was no immediate reaction from Dimino, Shapiro or Gleason, who had just written a column for Sports Illustrated that recounted his life with ALS. The segment on their "Mayhem in the AM" show featured an imitation of Gleason, who speaks with the aid of an electronic voice synthesizer, telling knock-knock jokes with punchlines like "Smother me, do me a favor." The AM station 790 The Zone "suspended the three individuals involved immediately following their comments and have since terminated their employment," Rick Mack, the station's general manager, said in a statement posted online.
