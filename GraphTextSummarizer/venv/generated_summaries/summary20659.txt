" The three Europa League matches all involved Narva Trans and took place between June 2011 and July 2012. All 17 of the matches took place between July 2011 and July 2012. The Estonian Prosecutor's Office said two of the country's clubs, Narva Trans and Tallinna Kalev, purposefully recruited players who were open to manipulating matches. The news comes days after two men in Britain were charged with "conspiracy to defraud bookmakers by influencing the course of football matches and placing bets thereon. The two teams are accused of looking for players from Estonia, Lithuania and Ukraine who were receptive to fixing aspects of matches in exchange for money.
