According to the Department of Health and Human Services, some 3.1 million young adults now have health insurance because of Obamacare, which requires insurance companies to allow young adults to stay on their parents' policies up until the age of 26. Obamacare tells insurance companies they can't say no to people with preexisting conditions, or charge them more because of their health issues. Before Obamacare, insurance companies in many states took young people off their parents' policies at age 18 or 19. Weaver, 52, knows it would be difficult if not impossible to buy insurance on her own because of her disease, but she said she's not worried because she has good insurance through her job as a public school teacher in Dallas, where she's worked for 20 years. However, it's not clear that insurance companies will allow young adults to stay on their parents' insurance up until age 26 without a mandate.
