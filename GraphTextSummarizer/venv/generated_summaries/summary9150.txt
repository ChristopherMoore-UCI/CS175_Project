Since the United States was established, it adhered to the rule that those born on U.S. lands were U.S. citizens. As Isabel Gonzalez's lawyer told the Court, declaring that residents of America's island territories are not U.S. citizens would mean adding to "precedents in our history of which we are least proud." In the past century, the inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have become citizens. Because Puerto Rico was U.S. territory, she believed herself to be a U.S. citizen. As a result of the court ruling, federal officials were able to deny Gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years.
