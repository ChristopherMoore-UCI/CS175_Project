On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said only that Obama believed state policies "should be guided by science," but wouldn't go to say whether Obama believed Maine's rules lived up to that tenet. A five-hour drive south from the unfolding legal machinations, Democrats welcomed Obama for a political rally supporting LePage's opponent Mike Michaud, who scored a boost to his chances on Wednesday when the state's independent Sen. Angus King lent his backing. "It's the state's responsibility to make sure that people are protected here in the state of Maine for public safety and I support the 21 day quarantine," the Democrat told reporters Wednesday. Obama, who traveled to Portland on Thursday for a campaign rally, has sought to tamp down on fears of recently-returned health workers, inviting a group of them to the White House Wednesday and hailing their mission as essential. "When I hear people talking about American leadership and then are promoting policies that would avoid leadership and have us running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers, it makes me a little frustrated," Obama said on Wednesday.
