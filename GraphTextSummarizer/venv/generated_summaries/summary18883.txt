"China has hundreds of millions of males, most of them regular size in stature and they cannot develop a single NBA-caliber guard?" Brook Larmer, author of "Operation Yao Ming," a book on Chinese basketball and the rise of Yao, explains: "The system basically recruits on height and also inculcates great obedience, discipline and hard work, but it doesn't bring creativity, independence, and leadership, which are qualities that a great point guard needs." Lin shows those qualities. In China, sports fans and commentators are quick to claim Lin, an American born to Taiwan immigrants with roots in mainland China. "He is associated with China and our culture, he knows the language -- though not fluent." Wang says Lin visited China in the summer during the NBA lockout and had talked with Yao Ming, the hulking Houston Rockets center who retired from the NBA last year. "Previous Asian players in the NBA have been physically imposing, but few regular players can relate to Yao Ming." Lin, hoops analysts say, fills China's point-guard gap. Lin was overlooked by most NBA teams until the New York Knicks, desperately looking for a point guard, picked him.
