"Every time we have barazas (meetings) twice a month, I make attendees subscribe to my tweets using their regular SMS or text messaging services," Kariuki said by phone from the town. A recent study shows social media use in the continent is growing, with South Africa sending the most tweets, followed by Kenya and Nigeria. However, almost every household has a cell phone and text messages are a major form of communication in the nation. "Before I decided on this, I asked around -- how can I reach all my people in one time at no cost to them?" Kariuki leads a community of 28,000 residents and while his Twitter account shows he has about 400 followers -- or people who get his tweets online -- the chief said those who receive his tweets via text message are in the thousands. "It has not only saved on the cost of fliers, it has also allowed us to save trees and contribute to green efforts." Subscribers get his tweets in real time in the form of free text messages, and don't need to have a Twitter account or an Internet connection to receive them.
