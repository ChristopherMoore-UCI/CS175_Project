Meanwhile, Kraft has decided to leave Bayern in search of regular first team football, and has agreed a deal to join Bundesliga newcomers Hertha Berlin for next season. Former Schalke midfielder Altintop, defensive midfielder Andreas Ottl and reserve goalkeeper Thomas Kraft are the trio who will be moving on during the close season, with the club marking their farewell with a bouquet of flowers after the game. It is unclear where Altintop will play his football next season, although there have been reports linking Real Madrid with a move for the player. Bayern Munich have confirmed that Turkish international Hamit Altintop is one of three players who will leave the club after Saturday's final Bundesliga match of the season against Stuttgart. Altintop, 28, joined Bayern in 2007 and was a member of the domestic double winning sides of 2008 and 2010, also featuring in the 2010 Champions League final defeat by Inter Milan.
