Zimmer spoke to CNN from Hebron, Kentucky, but said he has been in communication with the head of the orphanage, Pastor Ernst Cassy, who has worked in Carrefour for 40 years. All of the buildings of the Good Shepherd Orphanage, about eight miles from the capital of Port-au-Prince, were "damaged beyond repair," including the dormitories, said David Zimmer, treasurer for the Good Shepherd Orphanage and Schools Foundation. In the capital on Friday, chaos broke out at the Maison De Lumiere Orphanage after severe shortages of food, water and medicine sparked an outcry, said Mike Maiolo, senior pastor of the volunteers' home church in Mission Viejo, California. Zimmer said he plans to fly into Port-au-Prince on Tuesday. Reports of pancaked orphanages stretch from Port-au-Prince to the southern coastal town of Jacmel.
