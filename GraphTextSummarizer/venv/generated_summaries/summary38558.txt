"Since we have many experiences in election, we don't need experts on this issue," said Thein Soe, chairman of the election commission. In the countryside, teams of election workers for the Union for Solidarity and Development (USD) had campaigned. " Because many citizens in rural areas know so little about the political process, election workers said they also had to show people how to vote. "And since we have all ambassadors who are representing their countries, we don't think we need to invite any special group to observe the election since all the ambassadors are here and can watch it on election day," he added. Leading democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has rejected voting in the elections, her lawyer said.
