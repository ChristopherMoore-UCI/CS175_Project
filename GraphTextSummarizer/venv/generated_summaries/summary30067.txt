Kemal said Ethiopia prefers to settle disputes with its neighbor through peaceful dialogue but stressed the nation will not 'hesitate to take proportional retaliatory action" if Eritrea launches more attacks. The ground assault Thursday struck bases used to launch attacks aimed at destabilizing Ethiopia, said Shimeles Kemal, an Ethiopian government spokesman. The military incursion was partly in retaliation to Eritrea backing groups responsible for atrocities in Ethiopia, the spokesman said, including a January attack that killed five Western tourists. The Eritrean foreign ministry described the incident as a "provocative attack" and said it was intended to divert attention from Ethiopia's continued "illegal occupation" of Eritrean territory. -- Ethiopian forces attacked military posts in neighboring Eritrea to target "subversive groups" it said operate within the country, reigniting tensions between the two archrivals.
