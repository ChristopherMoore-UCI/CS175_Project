Macdonald set the scene with the many superstars involved in the special, which included former cast members and some of the show's most popular (and infamous) hosts and musical guests. The "Celebrity Jeopardy" sketch, led by Will Ferrell as Alex Trebek, was still one of the special's most memorable. Remember that awkward Eddie Murphy moment during the "Saturday Night Live" 40th anniversary special on Sunday? According to Norm Macdonald, Murphy's return after 30 years to the show that made him famous was supposed to be so much more. But according to Macdonald, Murphy was one of the biggest stars in a room filled with celebs.
