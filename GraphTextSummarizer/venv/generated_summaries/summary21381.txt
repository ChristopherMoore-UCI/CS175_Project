Nassau County Fire Marshall officials took samples of products they found and sent them to the manufacturers, who verified the counterfeits. Fire department officials said they found manufacturing supplies but no material safety data sheets, which normally accompany these supplies. Counterfeits will not have the same quality or consistency of real products. Law enforcement authorities seized four tractor-trailers filled with knockoff health products from five locations on Long Island on Thursday. A pair of New York brothers will appear in court Tuesday on charges of running a multimillion-dollar ring that peddled fake products distributed up and down the East Coast, authorities said.
