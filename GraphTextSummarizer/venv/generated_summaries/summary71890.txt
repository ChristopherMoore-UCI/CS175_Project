Police said a veiled woman stabbed American schoolteacher Ibolya Ryan, 47, during a fight in a restroom at the high-end Boutik Mall on Reem Island on Monday. The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi issued a statement, back in October, warning U.S. citizens of an anonymous Internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at American and other international schools. Later Monday, the suspect placed a primitive bomb in front of a house where an American Muslim doctor lives, said Al Nahyan, adding that authorities had video of the event. Police arrested the woman, identified only as in her 30s and a UAE national, Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan said. The doctor's son saw the object and called police, Al Nahyan said.
