Champions who repeated: Italy: 1934 and 1938 Brazil: 1958 and 1962 World Cup schedule of matches CNN's Aleks Klosok and Manuela Lanza contributed to this report. -- Two former World Cup champions face off Thursday in Brazil, but neither England nor Uruguay have been in dominant form lately. Champions who went out early: Italy: Won in 1938, eliminated in 1950 (there were no World Cups in between because of World War II) Brazil: won in 1962, eliminated in 1966 France: won in 1998, eliminated in 2002 Italy: won in 2006, eliminated in 2010 Spain: won in 2010, eliminated in 2014 Spain's 5-1 loss to the Netherlands in their first match this year is the worst defeat ever suffered by a defending champion. England, the 1966 champions, have lost their last two World Cup matches. Spain, the dominant national team in European and world football for most of the past decade, crashed out of the World Cup in shocking style Wednesday night, with a 2-0 loss to Chile that makes it impossible for the title holders to advance to the knockout stage of the tournament.
