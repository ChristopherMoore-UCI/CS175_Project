Medical marijuana advocates are hoping state governments can succeed where their efforts have failed by asking federal authorities to reclassify pot as a drug with medical use. In their petition, Gregoire and Chafee said rescheduling was needed because states can't make rules governing medical marijuana "without putting their employees at risk of violating federal law." "From a patient perspective, there's a lot of things up in the air," Gregoire spokesman Cory Curtis told CNN. All four are among the sixteen states and the District of Columbia that have laws on the books that allow the medical use of marijuana, even though the drug remains illegal under federal law. State laws authorizing it "are inconsistent with efforts to ensure that medications undergo the rigorous scientific scrutiny of the FDA approval process," it added. The Justice Department says it isn't targeting patients who are in "clear and unambiguous compliance" with state laws.
