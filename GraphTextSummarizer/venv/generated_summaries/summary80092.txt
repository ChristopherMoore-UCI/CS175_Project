Earlier this year protesters in Egypt set up mesh networks to get around government-imposed blackouts of Internet and phone access. As I wrote earlier, even in developed nations like the United States, not everyone with a mobile device will have access to -- or more importantly, be able to afford -- robust mobile devices and fast (4G speeds or above) wireless data networks. Still, it will probably take much longer than five years -- if ever -- for significant inequities in access to digital information and services to disappear entirely. Bloom also noted the growing role of "machine-to-machine communications," which could allow cell phones and other mobile devices to connect people to useful services. Without Internet access, it's getting harder to apply for jobs, get an education, stay in touch with friends and family -- and keep up with news that affects your life.
