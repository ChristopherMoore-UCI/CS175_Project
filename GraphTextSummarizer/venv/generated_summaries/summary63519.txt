" Convicted drug dealers testified that Bulger collected "rent" from criminal operatives, a crime tax that had to be paid to do drug business in South Boston during the Bulger era. The motion breaks down Bulger's spoils that were spelled out in testimony from gangsters, former associates, drug dealers, convicted felons, and extortion victims during more than 41 days of trial this summer. The government has moved to seize Bulger's personal assets that they say stemmed from a life of gambling and drug dealing, including jewelry, electronics, art, furniture, clothing and other items found in the Santa Monica apartment. In 2011, Bulger was found hiding out in Santa Monica, California, with his girlfriend -- and with nearly $822,000 in cash, 30 guns, some loaded, and an assortment of knives and a Taser. A federal jury convicted Bulger in August on 31 counts of racketeering, extortion, and money laundering and ultimately ruled that Bulger participated in the murder of 11 people.
