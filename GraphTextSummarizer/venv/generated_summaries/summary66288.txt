I favor body cameras on police officers because they can serve a valuable purpose not only to the citizens, but also to officers who will be exonerated from baseless claims against them. At the end of the day, police should focus on: To serve and protect and secure -- as in, protect the Fourth Amendment's right to be "secure" affirmatively instead of viewing it as a hindrance to their efforts as law enforcement professionals. That's partly because I'm a former city of Atlanta police officer and served as a reserve police officer in Oxford, Mississippi, during my time on the faculty at the University of Mississippi's School of Law. The killing of two police officers in cold blood has no connection with the necessary review and scrutiny of law enforcement officers in specific incidents where transparency is crucial. This lack of trust has eroded the "consent" in many communities that often feel more occupied than served and protected by police.
