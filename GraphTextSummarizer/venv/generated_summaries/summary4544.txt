-- California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law a measure that will allow undocumented immigrant students to receive privately funded scholarships administered at public universities and community colleges, officials said Tuesday. The law was needed because the University of California and California State University systems avoided giving the private scholarships to their undocumented students, citing vagueness in laws, said Luis Quinonez, legislative aide to the new law's author, Assemblyman Gilbert Cedillo. Also, community colleges in California often raised money from private sources and diverted those funds to independent nonprofit groups, which in turn gave those funds as scholarships to undocumented students, Quinonez told CNN on Tuesday. Under the new law, community colleges will be able to give those privately financed scholarships directly to undocumented immigrant students, Quinonez said. The law requires undocumented immigrant students to have attended a California high school for three or more years, to have attained a diploma or a GED, to have filed an affidavit with the college stating they have applied for a lawful immigration status or will apply as soon as they are eligible to do so, Quinonez said.
