Jamal Bana is the third Somali-American from the city of Minneapolis to head to Somalia and die there. In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American believed to have been radicalized by al-Shabaab, traveled from Minneapolis to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others. Asha said she cannot figure out what led the young men in Minneapolis to want to return to Somalia. But he said the number of missing men believed to be in Somalia is "in the 10s." So far, there is no indication that al-Shabaab is recruiting young men from Somali-American communities outside Minneapolis.
