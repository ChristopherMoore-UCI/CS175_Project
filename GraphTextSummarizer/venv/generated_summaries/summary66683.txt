Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well." Stack's wife, Sheryl Stack, expressed her "sincere sympathy to the victims and their families" in a statement read by family friend Rayford Walker on Friday. Authorities say that on Thursday, Stack flew a single-engine plane into a seven-story building that held offices for nearly 200 IRS workers. Hunter and his wife, Valerie, worked at the IRS office in the building, his brother Harold L. Jackson told CNN affiliate WAAY. A 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government, particularly the IRS. Authorities say Stack also torched his $230,000 home in Austin on Thursday morning before embarking on his fatal flight.
