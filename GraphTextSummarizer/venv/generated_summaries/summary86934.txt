The boy band, colloquially known as NKOTB, announced they're going back on tour this summer with special guests R&B group TLC and rapper Nelly. The pop group revealed Tuesday that "The Main Event" tour will kick off May 1 in Las Vegas, and hit 40-plus cities in the U.S. and Canada. In recent years, they've also toured with fellow boy bands such as the Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees and Boyz II Men. This is not the first time NKOTB has combined forces in the name of '90s sentimentality: The news comes on the heels that TLC is attempting to fund their new -- and final -- album via a Kickstarter campaign.
