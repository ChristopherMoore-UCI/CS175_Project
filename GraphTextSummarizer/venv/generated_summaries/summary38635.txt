Asked about Obama's preparations, White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday would only offer that the president was "very appreciative of the fact that the American people have given him this opportunity to deliver a second inaugural address." "He takes very seriously speeches of this kind, and he's very engaged in the process," Carney added, noting that Obama wrote initial drafts of speeches in longhand on yellow pads. While inaugurations celebrate American democracy through the peaceful transition or extension of power at a ceremony full of pageantry and color, a second inaugural address tends to feel like many second weddings -- important, for sure, but lacking some of the nervous anticipation of the first one. While themes of unifying the country and seeking God's blessings are common to most inaugural addresses, second efforts have come in varied lengths and styles. Ryan to attend Obama's inauguration "With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations," Lincoln said to conclude the speech of 697 words, a fraction of the 3,610 in his first inaugural address. He had acknowledged that difference to begin his remarks, saying: "At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first."
