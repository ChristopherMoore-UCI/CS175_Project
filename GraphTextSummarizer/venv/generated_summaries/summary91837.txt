"Sparkle's" leading lady Jordin Sparks, who won Season 6 of "American Idol," isn't the first Idol champ to show up at the box office, though she did garner the strongest opening weekend results. Thanks to a narrow theater count of 2,244, "Sparkle" notched a sturdy, if uninspiring, $5,348 per theater average, and if it can garner strong word-of-mouth — which seems likely given its "A" CinemaScore grade — it could find legs in the weeks to come. The final new release of the weekend, "The Odd Life of Timothy Green," started back in seventh place with $10.9 million. By comparison, "The Bourne Ultimatum" earned $69.3 million during its opening weekend in 2007. As a point of comparison, the concert doc Michael Jackson: "This Is It" -- which arrived four months after Michael Jackson's death — started off hotter than "Sparkle," earning $23.2 million in its opening weekend in October 2009 on the way to a $72.1 million finish.
