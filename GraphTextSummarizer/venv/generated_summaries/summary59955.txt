Barcelona maestro Messi earned a remarkable $48 million in the last financial year, ahead of Beckham -- who has been first or second in each of the last nine years. The previous year's accounts recorded a $35m profit following the $130m sale of winger Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. Meanwhile, respected magazine France Football have published their list of the highest-paid players in the world, with Lionel Messi taking over from David Beckham at the top of the earnings table. Beckham earned $44 million, while Ronaldo and his Madrid teammate Kaka took third and fourth place in the list. The accounts also reveal the deficit includes some one-off costs incurred by the Glazers, following the setting-up of the $861 million bond scheme last year to replace the bank loans they obtained to purchase the club.
