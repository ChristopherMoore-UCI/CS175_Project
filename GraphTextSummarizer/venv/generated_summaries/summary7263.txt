The White House said in a statement, "The President spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko today to express his sympathy for the mounting toll of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and his deep concern about the ongoing violence, particularly in and around Debaltseve. Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko declared a ceasefire went into effect at midnight Saturday local time (5 p.m. ET) between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian militants in the nation's east. Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, tweeted  that the separatists "now have larger fighting force with more tanks armored vehicles, heavy artillery & rocket systems than some NATO and European countries. " He also posted satellite images which he claimed show "Russian military, not separatist, systems" deployed in eastern Ukraine. While Ukrainian forces have to pull back their heavy weapons from the front line as they stood Saturday night, separatist forces must pull back theirs from the front line as it was on September 19, when a previous peace agreement was signed in Minsk.
