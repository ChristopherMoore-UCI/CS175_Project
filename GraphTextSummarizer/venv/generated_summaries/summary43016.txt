The Palm Beach Gardens and West Palm Beach police departments were also assisting on the case, including helping deal with arrangements for the officer and supporting the police force in Jupiter, according to Kitzerow. The officer from the Jupiter, Florida, police department was transported around 4:40 p.m. to St. Mary's Medical Center in nearby West Palm Beach after being critically injured in a crash. The man -- identified as Officer Bruce St. Laurent -- later died at the hospital, Jupiter police Chief Frank Kitzerow told reporters late Sunday. The Jupiter officer was traveling along I-95 through West Palm Beach when a Ford 150 pickup hit his motorcycle, West Palm Beach Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Therese Barbera told CNN. Obama was notified of the death, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters after Air Force One landed in Washington.
