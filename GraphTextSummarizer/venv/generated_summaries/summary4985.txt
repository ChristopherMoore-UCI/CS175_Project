Interphone, a series of multinational studies on the risk of cancer from cell phones, has not found an increase in tumors associated with the first 10 years of mobile phone use, he said. -- Bringing a growing health concern to Congress, scientists squared off Thursday over whether cell phones contribute to brain cancer. The results indicated that people who use cell phones have double the chance of developing malignant brain tumors and acoustic neuromas, which are tumors on the hearing nerve. The evidence for the connection between cell phones and cancer is inconclusive and more research is needed, he said. Herberman had issued a warning to physicians, scientists, and staff at the University of Pittsburgh in July advising them to limit cell phone use because of the possible risk of cancer.
