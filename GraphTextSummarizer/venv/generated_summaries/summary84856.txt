"Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to help end the uncertainty that is crippling job creation and hurting small businesses," House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week. "I assure you we would not have this bill without this president," said Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, adding that the measure would help small businesses expand and help entrepreneurs launch new businesses. "Most minority businesses are small businesses," Green said. "Small businesses are the linchpin of our nation's economic growth and well-being," Steve Bartlett, the group's president, said last week. The breaks aim to encourage small businesses to purchase new equipment, to incentivize venture capital firms to invest in small businesses, and to motivate entrepreneurs to start their own business.
