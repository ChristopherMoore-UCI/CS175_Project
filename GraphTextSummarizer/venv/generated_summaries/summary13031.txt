"What's most important is they try to go back to a routine," said Farchi, whose aid group has been working at the school and Catholic retreat center in Sainte Marie since the earthquake. "It's as if they were thirsting for school," said teacher Jacques Junior Mathieu. Some privately run schools that are able to supply a safe space for classes, including Sainte Marie, were allowed to reopen this week. The students at Sainte Marie were happy to be back in class. On the first day of school after the earthquake, Medlika Rameau told her classmates about how she was trapped in the rubble of her house with her mother and little sister.
