Polanski pleaded guilty in Los Angeles, California, in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, but fled to Europe before he was sentenced. -- Switzerland will not send Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski to the United States to face sentencing for child sex charges, the Ministry of Justice announced Monday. Polanski was 43 at the time he had unlawful sex with the girl. U.S. prosecutors cannot apply again to Switzerland to have Polanski extradited, she said, but could apply to other countries to detain and extradite him. Polanski's attorney, Chad Hummel, has been pushing for Polanski to be sentenced without having to return to Los Angeles.
