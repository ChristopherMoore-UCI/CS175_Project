"That said, the increase will be partially motivated by Washington's strategic campaign to re-assert itself in Asia Pacific and will underscore China's growing means to assert its power over maritime claims in disputed waters of the South China Sea, East China Sea and Yellow Sea." IHS Jane's recently forecast the pace of Chinese defence spending growth to jump to an average 18.7 per cent per year. China has reported double-digit increases in official military spending for each year since 1989 except for 2009, when the announced growth rate dropped to 7.5 per cent. China plans to boost its official defence budget by 11.2 per cent this year as Beijing is balancing the modernisation of its armed forces against the need to keep military spending in line with economic development. Foreign analysts agree that Beijing's official defence budget does not represent the full amount China spends on the military, but most external estimates still assume that the overall growth trajectory of military spending is in line with the announced figure. The 11.2 per cent increase comes as the US, which has the world's largest military budget, is cutting defence spending while at the same time shifting its focus to Asia-Pacific, widely seen as an effort to re-assert its regional influence against a rising China.
