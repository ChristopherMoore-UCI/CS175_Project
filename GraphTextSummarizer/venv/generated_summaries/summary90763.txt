The pope looked unscathed Friday as he delivered his Christmas message in St. Peter's Square, just hours after a woman jumped a barrier and dragged him down during Christmas Eve Mass. Pope Benedict XVI, 82, delivered the traditional address known as "Urbi et Orbi" -- Maiolo, 25, is the same woman who tried to attack the pontiff on Christmas Eve last year, Lombardi said. "As compared to say, the president of the United States, the security membrane around the pope is pretty thin and fairly permeable," he said, citing similar past incidents, including one that happened last Christmas Eve. The pope was not injured when an assailant, identified as Susanna Maiolo, lunged at him during mass Thursday night, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said. He then sent Christmas greetings in 65 languages with tens of thousands gathered before him.
