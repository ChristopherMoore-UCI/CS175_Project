Starting December 1, Amazon will give newspapers a 70 percent cut of revenue from digital versions of their editions sold in the site's Kindle Store. The program is designed to speed up the process of producing a version of the newspaper for the many platforms where Kindle software can be downloaded. The online retail giant also is providing publishers with a new tool called Kindle Publishing for Periodicals. "A publisher would just need to send one feed, and Amazon customizes the experience for reading across different apps," Amazon spokeswoman Sarah Gelman said. Amazon was previously giving newspaper and magazine companies about 30 percent, according to a New York Times report last year.
