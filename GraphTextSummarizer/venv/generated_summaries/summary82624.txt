Here's the deal: San Francisco's obscure, long-ignored law prohibiting rentals of less than 30 days is nearly 30 years old, but few people thought about it until news arose about crackdowns on tourist rentals in other cities. But the law might not have become a reality had it not been for the lobbying of hotel and motel associations -- which obviously compete with vacation rentals, and which would obviously benefit if travelers turned away from short-term rentals en masse. Rather than inquire as to the legality of such rentals, the city has traditionally preferred to subject owners to the local 14 percent hotel tax, bringing in millions annually that would not have been raised had the properties been occupied year-round by owners or long-term renters In the second quarter of this year, HomeAway recorded a 104 percent increase in inquiries for New York City apartments compared with the same period in 2009. Bottom line: In Paris, there has been no noticeable drop-off in owners posting short-term apartment rentals.
