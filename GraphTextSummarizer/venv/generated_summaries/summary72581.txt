The image spread through social media on Friday after British ITV News anchor Charlene White shared it on Twitter, attributing it to Marie Claire magazine. The American version of Marie Claire, a joint venture between Hearst Magazines and French-based Marie Claire Album, called the image real, honest and gorgeous but denied any connection to the photo. "The most important thing about this news is to note the beauty that Crawford has always been, and how happy we are that she has been part of a production for Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America -- a title that shows the strength and power of real women, always respecting (their) beauty, individuality and femininity." Opinion: Is Cindy Crawford's photo empowering? The image comes from a cover shoot for the December 2013 issue of Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, representatives for the Mexico-based publication said. It was a total privilege to have this fashion icon on the cover," Ariadne Grant, editor in chief of Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, said in a news release.
