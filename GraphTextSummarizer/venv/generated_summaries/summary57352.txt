Authorities arrested a woman in June 2008 in central Mexico on charges that she had killed another woman for similar reasons, La Voz de Michoacan newspaper said. Santiago Iniguez Olivares is accused of bludgeoning Modesta Navarro Nieves and her husband at their home in the mountainous Guadalupe del Cobre community in April 1998, the Michoacan state attorney general's office said Thursday. Guadalupe del Cobre is a remote village in western Mexico. Olivares had been on the run until recently, when he returned to Guadalupe del Cobre because he thought the 11-year-old murder had been forgotten, the attorney general's office said. According to officials, Iniguez Olivares went into the woman's home, accused her of putting a witch's spell on him and started to beat her with a stick.
