-- Angry protesters threw rocks and bottles and police lobbed tear gas canisters Tuesday in Rome's streets after Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi narrowly survived lawmakers' confidence votes. Last month, Fini accused Berlusconi of a lack of attention to the economic crisis and structural reforms that Italy needs. On Monday, Berlusconi accused Fini, a co-founder of Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, of betraying him. Forbes magazine ranked Berlusconi last year as the world's 70th richest man, estimating his net worth at $6.5 billion. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, who has the authority to dissolve parliament, has said he opposes new elections because they would create instability at a time of economic crisis.
