After Hussein was hanged, Shiite witnesses danced around his body, chanting celebratory slogans. "It was uncivilized and backward," said Chief Judge Raouf Abdul Rahman, who spoke to reporters on Tuesday as they awaited the start of the latest trial of ex-regime members. A cell phone video showedHussein being taunted by Shiites and included bitter exchanges between Hussein and Shiite witnesses. His execution was condemned at the time, then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a leading advocate of Hussein's overthrow, saying its manner was "completely wrong." There were shouts of praise for Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose father was believed to have been murdered by Hussein's regime.
