Like the smokers I know, the overwhelming majority of whom hate to smoke, many women develop unhealthy patterns (like snacking on junk food at home) that lead to unhealthy bodies, which lead to a seriously unhealthy lack of self-esteem. -- I didn't need to read the findings of a recent Australian research study to know that most women who live with their mates have more body fat than those who don't. When we are consistent with our diet and exercise programs, there is no need for maniacal starvation. They end up doing the yo-yo thing, torturing their bodies through obsessive experimentation with an endless list of exercise programs, almost all of which fail them, because the will to really change behavior is not yet there. We don't need to sit at the dinner table with a radish on our plate, while our children and mates enjoy full meals.
