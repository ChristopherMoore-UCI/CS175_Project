Tiananmen Square is China's most politically sensitive landmark as a result of the events of June 4, 1989, when government forces opened fire on civilians to quash pro-democracy demonstrations. -- Five people are dead after a jeep plowed into a crowded part of Tiananmen Square and caught fire Monday, authorities said. The Tiananmen East subway station and part of the Tiananmen West station were temporarily closed, the subway operator said. Photographs circulating on social media showed a vehicle engulfed in flames in Tiananmen Square. Around 2:30 p.m., authorities were barring tourists from entering the area in front of the Tiananmen Rostrum and the center of Tiananmen Square.
