-- Brazil coach Dunga has been sacked after their shock World Cup quarterfinal exit to the Netherlands. Scolari guided Brazil to their fifth World Cup triumph in 2002, but was less successful in his spell with English Premier League Chelsea where he was sacked. " Dunga, 46, who skippered Brazil to the 1994 World Cup, had been national team coach since 2006 and led them to a Copa America triumph the following year. "I am going to rest before meeting, in one or two weeks' time, the president of the CBF, Ricardo Teixeira to talk about it (extending his stay in charge)," Dunga told a news conference, but his optimism was misplaced. With Brazil hosting the World Cup in 2014, Dunga's successor is obviously key and local media have already made Luiz Felipe Scolari the favorite.
