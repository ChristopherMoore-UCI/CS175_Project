Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin responded angrily on her Facebook page Friday to a verbal attack by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka where he called her a "crazy magnet." "Trumka's attempts to put himself on the side of the working man and woman would  be more convincing if he weren't a career union boss who's spent most of his  life in DC," the statement on Palin's Facebook page said. "I'm not sure why he's attacking my record when I'm not the one responsible for  the policies resulting in continued mass unemployment and a weak economy," Palin shot back. Palin provided her own assessment of Trumka on her Facebook response. I mean, look at your former governor..." "After she tied herself to John McCain and they lost, she blew off  Alaska," he said.
