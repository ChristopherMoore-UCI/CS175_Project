Authorities identified and charged a man Monday in connection with the discovery of human remains in a duffel bag in Cambridge, Massachusetts, over the weekend. Carlos Colina, 32, was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office said in a statement. "This was a gruesome discovery," said District Attorney Marian Ryan. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains.
