Joe Jackson, the 80-year-old Jackson family patriarch, was not named in Michael Jackson's 2002 will, which left his wealth to his mother, Katherine Jackson, his three children and undisclosed charities. Katherine Jackson replaced the lawyers representing her in the estate case last month with attorney Adam Streisand. Joe Jackson is credited with launching and guiding his family's show business success, but Michael Jackson had publicly criticized his father's parenting skills. Although Joe and Katherine Jackson are still married, Joe Jackson lives in Las Vegas, Nevada. Michael Jackson died June 25, but the probate of his will has been slowed by a series of court squabbles between Katherine Jackson's lawyers and the two men now in control of the estate.
