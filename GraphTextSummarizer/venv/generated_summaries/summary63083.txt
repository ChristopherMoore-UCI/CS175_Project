TV's Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of "The Dr. Oz Show," was nearby at the time of the accident and rushed over to assist, according to show rep Tim Sullivan. Green's right leg sustained multiple injuries but will likely regain most functionality with time and physical therapy, the trauma surgeon said in a statement. The British tourist who was struck by a New York City taxi after it jumped a curb had her left leg amputated below the knee, hospital officials said Thursday. Given the condition of the lower leg, "replantation was not an option," according to Dr. Spiros G. Frangos of Bellevue Hospital. Sian Green, 23, was at 49th Street and Sixth Avenue -- home to Rockefeller Center and near Radio City Music Hall and Saks Fifth Avenue -- Tuesday morning when she and a bicyclist were both hit by the cab after the driver swerved onto the curb, authorities said.
