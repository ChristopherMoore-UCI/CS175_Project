For example, many are unable to take part in specialized mental health services, such as post-traumatic stress disorder support groups, because child care is unavailable. Yet the unemployment rate for female veterans has steadily climbed for most of the past decade, and is now higher than for male veterans. Mental health services for women are severely lacking. To help combat unemployment among female veterans, the Department of Defense must take a hard look at the primary program designed to help veterans go into the civilian labor force: the Transition Assistance Program. The DAV report finds that the federal, state and community programs to support women making the transition out of military service have serious gaps that put some of them in jeopardy.
