"We know that influenza is a serious illness which affects an estimated 15% to 40% of children during annual flu season," said Dr. Jay Varma, who oversees infectious diseases as deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department. "One-third of children under five in New York City do not receive an annual influenza vaccination, even though the vaccine safely and effectively protects them against influenza illness. "Only 60 percent of children under the age of 5 in New York City get vaccinated," Dr. Varma said. Young children often pass influenza to other children and family members, who then spread the infection to others in the community." The issue of vaccinating children is controversial.
