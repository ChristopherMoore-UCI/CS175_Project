" English golf star Ian Poulter also took to Twitter after being accused of taking too long over a putt by NBC commentator Johnny Miller. " While players actually got out on the course on Saturday and Sunday, they were left frustrated as balls blew off their tees and disappeared off putting greens after being placed. However, the traditional curtain-raiser for the elite U.S. circuit has yet to get going, with high winds and rain causing play to be canceled on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. "They have not mowed the greens in two days and the wind is still blowing balls off the green," Beljan wrote on Twitter. We had registered gusts up to 48 mph right before we suspended play today," Pazder told the PGA Tour website on Sunday.
