The incident ended when Boswell's 22-year-old grandson grabbed a gun from another room and pointed it at the intruder -- sending him running into the woods, said Jane Slusark, the congressman's spokeswoman. The FBI is assisting in the investigation, FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault said. -- Rep. Leonard Boswell, D-Iowa, and his family were victims of a home invasion at their rural farmhouse outside Lamoni, Iowa, over the weekend. Other than a few scrapes and bruises, the eight-term congressman and his family were unharmed, Slusark said. Boswell represents Iowa's 3rd District.
