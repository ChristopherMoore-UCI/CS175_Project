Our moderators can remove comments that violate our guidelines and block users who have a pattern of bad behavior. We're always looking for new ways to highlight user comments on CNN and to make participating in the discussion more rewarding. We also read through the comments to see which stories are generating buzz and deserve follow-ups, and to look for new story ideas and fresh angles. You can check out our Community Guidelines to get the full list of what is and what isn't allowed on CNN.com, but the short version is that we encourage lively discussions and spirited debate. Is it appropriate to allow comments calling for terrorists, rapists and serial killers to be killed in the most violent way possible?
