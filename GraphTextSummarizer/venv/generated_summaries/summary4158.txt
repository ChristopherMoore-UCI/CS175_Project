The report found labor markets would firm in the U.S. and Japan but unemployment would continue to rise in the euro area through 2014. The report warned: "Structural reforms are essential to prevent cyclical unemployment from becoming structural." The survey gives some ammunition to stimulus supporters with its projections showing the U.S. is emerging from the financial mire better than Europe, which is facing a new crisis of extreme youth unemployment. The Economic Outlook from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, released Wednesday, paints a picture of pain for some economies as major nations struggle to emerge from recession and unemployment in Europe soars to record levels. The OECD said U.S. annual GDP growth will be 2.8% in 2014, up from 1.9% in 2013.
