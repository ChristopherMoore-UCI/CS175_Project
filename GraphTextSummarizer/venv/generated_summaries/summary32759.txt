The chaos and violence after the 2007 election escalated into ethnic violence pitting supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Ruto, Sang and Kosgey are accused of being involved in the murder, deportation and commission of other offenses against supporters of Kenya's Party of National Unity. Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali are accused of committing or contributing to the killing, rape and other acts of violence against supporters of Odinga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement. They are Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura, former national police Chief Hussein Ali, opposition leader Henry Kosgey and radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang. Kenyatta is the son of the iconic founder of modern Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's first president.
