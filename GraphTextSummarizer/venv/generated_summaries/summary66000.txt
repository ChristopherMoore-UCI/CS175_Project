" On Thursday, former NHTSA administrator and longtime safety advocate Joan Claybrook asked GM to be forthcoming when notifying car owners about a recall. GM spokesman Alan Adler said the company has been in contact with NHTSA about the request. In the company's apology, GM North American President Alan Batey admitted in a statement last month: "The process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been." Even that acknowledgment is the subject of a NHTSA question -- Describe in detail the ways in which GM's process "was not as robust as it should have been" and GM's plans, if any, to change its process. Since that multi-year investigation, the industry has been quicker to identify problems in many cases and issue recalls, and NHTSA has made improvements in how it handles those matters. Until that is performed, vehicle owners should use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring, GM said.
