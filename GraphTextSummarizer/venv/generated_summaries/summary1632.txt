In the evening kickoff, Inter Milan gave new coach Leonardo a superb start with a 3-1 win at home to Napoli, who would have cut the gap on Milan at the top to three points with victory at the San Siro. -- Sierra Leone international Rodney Strasser scored a vital goal five minutes from time to send AC Milan five points clear as Serie A resumed Thursday after its short mid-winter break. The defeat leaves Juventus eight points adrift of Milan, who made their breakthrough late as new signing Antonio Cassano played in fellow substitute Strasser to net. Strasser first goal in the Italian top-flight gave Milan a 1-0 win over Cagliari in Sardinia to increase their lead in the title race as Lazio were held to a 0-0 draw at Genoa. Juventus' championship challenge hit the buffers after a humiliating 4-1 home defeat to mid-table Parma.
