FFP is designed to prevent clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses, but Dupont believes the sanctions are "completely illegal" because they restrict competition -- a key principle of European Union law. "FFP rules emerged from a wide-reaching consultative process involving all relevant stakeholders in European football," read a statement from UEFA. In a statement sent to CNN, UEFA said it "completely rejects" the suggestion that the break-even requirement may lead to any restriction of competition in the market for matches played in UEFA club tournaments. " To back up his argument, Dupont cites an academic article by professor Nicolas Petit on EU competition law and FFP. " Dupont believes FFP raises further competition concerns by entrenching the status quo, by not allowing clubs like City and PSG to challenge the established football order in future.
