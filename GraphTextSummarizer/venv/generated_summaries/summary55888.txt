-- The U.S. Embassy in Kenya warned it has credible information of an imminent terror attack, days after the east African nation announced it is sending troops to Somalia to battle Islamist militants. The terror group has threatened Kenya with retaliatory attacks, saying it considers the forces' incursion an affront to Somalia's sovereignty. The warning comes after Kenya sent troops across the border into Somalia to pursue Islamist Al-Shabaab militants. Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda and has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, is fighting to impose its own interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, on Somalia. His wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat, and is believed to have been taken into Somalia.
