Williams, known for films that featured synchronized swimming spectacles, was 91. In several films, Williams played opposite Latin lovers, including Ricardo Montalban and Fernando Lamas, the latter her third husband. " Williams and her fourth husband operated a swimwear company in recent years. "Her movie career played a major role in the promotion of swimming, making it attractive to the public, contributing to the growth of the sport as a public recreation for health, exercise, water safety -- and just plain fun," her biography on the hall of fame website reads. "That's one of my sad moments in my life," Williams told CNN's Larry King in November 1999.
