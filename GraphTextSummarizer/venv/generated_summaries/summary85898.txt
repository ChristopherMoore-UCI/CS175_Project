-- It didn't come close to matching last year's record time but supermaxi Wild Oats XI won a record-tying seventh Rolex Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Saturday. Wild Oats XI's billionaire owner, wine maker Bob Oatley, added that more victories could be on the way. Wild Oats XI coasted home in the 628-nautical mile race in two days, six hours and a fraction over seven minutes, which was well off the 2012 mark of one day, 18 hours and 23 minutes. Wild Oats XI took control of the race and didn't relinquish its advantage after passing Perpetual LOYAL on Friday. Still, Wild Oats XI managed to equal the record of Morna, which was later called Kurrewa IV.
