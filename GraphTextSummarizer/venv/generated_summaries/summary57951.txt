Ten bullets over music On November 23, 2012, Michael Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville and parked next to a red Dodge Durango full of teenagers. Dunn -- who also killed a black 17-year-old and said he did it in self-defense -- now faces decades in prison after he shot into an SUV full of teenagers during a spat over loud music. "It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment, and I will pray for him," McBath said. "You are looking basically at life in prison," Dunn's attorney Cory Strolla said. But prosecutors said Dunn lost control, firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the SUV over music he didn't like.
