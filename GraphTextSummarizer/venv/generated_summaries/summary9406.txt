The 1994 shooting and robbing of Shakur is viewed as sparking the infamous West Coast versus East Coast feud in rap music, which ultimately led to the shooting deaths of both Wallace and Shakur. -- New York police said Thursday that they will talk to an inmate who admitted to being part of the 1994 robbery and shooting of rapper Tupac Shakur. Shakur publicly blamed the 1994 attack, which occurred at a music studio  in New York, on Christopher "Notorious B.I.G." Wallace and Sean "P-Diddy"  Combs. "Detectives are going to speak to the individual," a New York Police spokesman said early Thursday morning. Wallace was shot and killed in 1997 in Los Angeles.
