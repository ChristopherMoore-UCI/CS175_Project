Critics noted that in China's one-party system, you don't get a week of violent protests without government approval. As protests spread to a hundred Chinese cities, one sign chillingly suggested, "We must exterminate the Japanese." Protesters threw bottles, rocks and eggs at the Japanese embassy, they smashed and burned Japanese businesses and vehicles and cars, and they generally overflowed with barely concealed hatred, the flames stoked even higher on the anniversary of the 1931 "Mukden incident" that started Japan's invasion of China, the most sensitive spot in historical memory. His Muslim Brotherhood sought to wave the banner in defense of Islam, initially calling for more protests. Seeking to benefit from the intensity of emotions, Islamist militants such as Lebanon's Hezbollah called for more protests. Anti-Western protests, under the banner of defending Islam, amount to raucous political rallies in support of the more radical, anti-liberal positions.
