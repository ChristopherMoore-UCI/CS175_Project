" FBI seeks links in Texas, Colorado killings Clements was shot to death Tuesday night at his home outside Colorado Springs. "Tom Clements was a remarkable person," Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said. -- The bullets that killed Colorado prison chief Tom Clements came from the gun found with a former inmate who died in a shootout with Texas police two days later, investigators confirmed Monday. The El Paso County, Colorado, Sheriff's Department said it was still trying to determine whether the suspect in Clements' slaying, Evan Ebel, acted alone or what his motive may have been. Witnesses had reported a similar vehicle, -- a black, boxy car with Colorado license plates -- near Clements' home in Monument the day he was killed.
