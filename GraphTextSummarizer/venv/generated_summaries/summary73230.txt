The cause of Wilson's death is under investigation. Jason Evans, spokesman for Dallas Fire Rescue, identified the firefighter as Stanley Wilson. The fire has been classified as a six-alarm blaze for several reasons, the department said, including the search for Wilson. He was one of a team responding to the blaze at the Hearthwood North Condominiums, in northeast Dallas, when he became trapped in the building. "An offensive fire attack was initially attempted, but the fire was growing too quickly and caused them to have to move out for a defensive attack.
