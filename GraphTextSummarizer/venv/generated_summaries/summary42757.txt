"We've traveled the world together, which other coaches rarely do," Takahashi says of Nagamitsu. Takahashi took more time out in 2011 when he had to have the bolt from that knee surgery removed, but he recovered the following year to win his first Grand Prix Final -- which was held in Sochi, the Russian resort city that will host next year's Winter Olympics. " At junior high school he met Utako Nagamitsu, who has remained his coach ever since -- she is currently working alongside the Russian Nikolai Morozov, who is now back on Takahashi's team after their initial split back in 2008. " Takahashi is now hoping to earn one of the three men's places in Japan's figure skating team for Sochi. Both are much younger -- Hanyu is 18 and Mura 22 -- and Takahashi is keenly aware that he has a lot of work to do if he is to succeed at Sochi.
