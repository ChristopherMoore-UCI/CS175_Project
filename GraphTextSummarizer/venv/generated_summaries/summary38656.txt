" Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty in the 2007 killing of Knox's roommate, Meredith Kercher. But the sample was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's slaying were unable to double-test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. At the trial, prosecutors said a knife found in Sollecito's home had traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. An emotional Knox responded, saying: "The only time that Rudy Guede, Raffaele Sollecito and I were in one room together was in a court room.... Kercher was found dead in the villa she rented with Knox in the central Italian university town of Perugia, semi-naked and with her throat slashed.
