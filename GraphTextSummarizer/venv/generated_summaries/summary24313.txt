It was the latest in a series of human rights incidents that has horrified the south Asian nation and deeply eroded public confidence in security agencies. Shah, age 17 and dressed in a dark shirt and jeans, tried to rob people at a fairly new park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, police say. Also in May, police and paramilitary forces in Quetta killed five Chechen citizens who were labeled at the time as suicide bombers but turned out to be unarmed civilians. In a Pakistani public park, Sarfraz Shah begs not to be shot. "They shoot to kill rather than take other measures." Interior Minister Rehman Malik vowed justice but tempered his comments about Shah.
