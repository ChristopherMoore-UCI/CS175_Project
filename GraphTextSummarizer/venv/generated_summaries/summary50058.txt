In Maine, there were as many as 110,000 customers without electricity on Thanksgiving morning, but milder Turkey Day temperatures allowed for workers to cut that number down by more than two thirds by night's end: Central Maine Power Co. reported that less than 32,000 customers had no power, while Emera, the state's second-largest utility company, reported that less than 1,000 customers without electricity after a Wednesday nor'easter dumped more than a foot of snow across a dozen Maine cities, WMTW reported. "Power is out at parents house in Maine, so my mom is chopping breadcrumbs with a flashlight," Brooklyn copy editor Kelly Gordon tweeted. "Crews will remain in the field through the overnight hours and into Friday until all customers are fully restored." Despite the setback, the heartiest of New Englanders wouldn't let the lack of electricity prevent them from enjoying the heartiest of meals. Tens of thousands spent Thanksgiving just as others did in New England when it was first observed in the 17th century: without electricity. Many New Englanders were without power -- but this was nothing new for the state.
