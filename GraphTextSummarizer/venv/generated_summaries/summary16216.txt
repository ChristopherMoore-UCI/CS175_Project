The route includes landings in Myanmar; China; India; Phoenix, Arizona; and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The batteries are able to store enough energy to allow the plane to fly long distances at night. An earlier version of the plane was the first solar-powered aircraft of "perpetual endurance" to fly "day and night without a drop of fuel," according to its website, thanks to advanced solar cells that charge light-weight lithium batteries. In 2010, with Borschberg in the cockpit, a previous Solar Impulse became the first manned plane to fly for 24 hours on nothing but solar-powered batteries. Swiss pilots Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg announced the Solar Impulse 2 aircraft will depart the United Arab Emirates on their historic adventure in late February or early March, making a total of 12 planned stops.
