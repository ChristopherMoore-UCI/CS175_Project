-- Alvaro Quiros triumphed at the Qatar Masters on Sunday when the Spaniard finished three shots clear of former champion Henrik Stenson and Louis Oosthuizen. Stenson, last year's runner-up to Adam Scott, snatched the lead at 16 under with an eagle at the 10th, but Quiros and Oosthuizen -- playing a group behind -- responded with birdies of their own to leave all three tied through 11. Spaniard Quiros clinched his third European Tour title and now looks set for a first appearance at the Masters. Oosthuizen had birdied the last to record a second successive runner-up finish, which sees him move up to fifth on the season money list -- a place ahead of Stenson. Swede Stenson's three-putt bogey at the last for a 68 allowed South African overnight leader Oosthuizen to share second with the 2006 champion after a final round of 71.
