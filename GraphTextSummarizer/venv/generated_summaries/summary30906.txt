This year's floods are far worse than previous ones, NDMA spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. Landslides and rising waters have cut off several villages in one district of the province of North Sulawesi province, leaving about 1,000 residents stranded, the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency (NDMA) said. That weather system, along with another over northern Australia, helped generate the heavy rains over North Sulawesi, Indonesian authorities said. Most of the deaths in North Sulawesi were reported Wednesday, authorities said, and two people are still missing. Heavy rains started drenching the region Tuesday and have resulted in about 40,000 people leaving their homes to seek temporary shelter, according to the NDMA.
