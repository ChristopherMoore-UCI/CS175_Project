The whole album thumps like the soundtrack to a lost "Eddie and the Cruisers" sequel, one where Eddie gets crucified by Roman soldiers, while Gaga stands under the cross weeping and sending dirty texts to the DJ. But the big surprise is the way Gaga pillages the Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar and Eddie Money records of her childhood. Gaga loves overheated cosmic statements for the same reason she loves dance pop and metal guitars -- because she hears them as echoes of her twisted rock & roll heart. Lady Gaga knew it was time to crank up the crazy, and she didn't hold back: "Born This Way" is her Eighties arena-rock move, going for maximum goth Catholic bombast. Exclusive: How E Street Band Saxophonist Clarence Clemons Ended Up on Lady Gaga's New Album All over "Born This Way," she takes on the big topics dear to her heart: sex, religion, muscle cars, her hair.
