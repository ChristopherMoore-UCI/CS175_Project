-- There were always three possible scenarios for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Bridgegate: One, that he was explicitly involved in the shutting down of three lanes feeding the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as political retribution against a no-name mayor who didn't endorse him in an election Christie ran away with. He said he planned on meeting with the jilted Fort Lee mayor and with Fort Lee residents to apologize directly to them. Two, that he was marginally involved, in that he told staffers to "take care of" the problem mayor but wasn't specific about the actions to take. It's Christie, we said. Nonetheless, that's exactly the story Christie's going with, and in his two-hour news conference, he did a tremendous job convincing me, at least, that he really was blindsided by the news.
