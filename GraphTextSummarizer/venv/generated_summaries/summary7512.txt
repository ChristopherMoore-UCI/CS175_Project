-- Same-sex couples in California may be able to obtain marriage licenses on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. The new forms, which were also released, have lines for "Party A" and "Party B." However, the "general information" page for California marriage licenses still stated as of Wednesday that "only an unmarried male and an unmarried female may marry in California. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. The California Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional in a May 15 ruling, clearing the way for the state to become the second to legalize such marriages. A constitutional amendment initiative that would specify marriage is only between a man and a woman is awaiting verification by the California Secretary of State's office after its sponsors said they had gathered enough signatures to place it on a statewide ballot.
