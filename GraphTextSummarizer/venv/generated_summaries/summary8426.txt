The largest case of bank fraud in Iranian history is threatening to engulf President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after a parliamentary commission decided to investigate his office for possible connections to the crime, Iranian state media has reported. But they are failing, according to economist Laylaz, and should be held responsible, although he does not name specific government officials. The "deviant current" label has become a well-established political slight in Iranian state media. In defense of softer comments toward the United States and Israel, Mashaei has explained to Iranian state TV: "My statement was that we, the Iranian people, are friends of the whole wide world, even the people of Israel and America. Mashaei has regularly rankled the religious right with conciliatory tones toward Israel and the United States -- moves considered serious gaffes in Iran -- and his habit of shaking hands with women in formal settings, which is considered culturally impolite by many in Iranian society and thought to be indecent by the religious right.
