Last year it was won by bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst. Early favorites were "X-Factor" entrant Samantha Jade, former "Australian Idol" winner Guy Sebastian and  fellow "Idol" singer  Jessica Mauboy (who performed in the interval last year). Eurovision explained the logic in an effusive press statement pointing out that Australia's inclusion would help the contest "walk the talk" of this year's theme "Building Bridges." "Eurovision is huge down under, 3 million people watched the show last year. With so many European expats (and those Aussies of European descent) it makes sense for Australia to be invited to the party."
