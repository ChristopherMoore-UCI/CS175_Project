Canizares, whose lone European Tour title came in Russia seven years ago, was forced to skip this month's China Open after being diagnosed with viral meningitis. "I'm not at full strength but it's working for me, so I'm not going to complain," said Canizares, the son of Ryder Cup veteran Jose Maria Canizares. Also tied for sixth is the halfway leader, Italian Francesco Molinari, who slumped to a 73 in the third round. Westwood, who recorded a 67 in the third round, said it would be "ironic" if he won the title months after moving his family from England to Florida. But it's the player in second, England's Lee Westwood, who might fancy his chances Sunday.
