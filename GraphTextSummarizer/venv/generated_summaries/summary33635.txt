The 19-year-old Wales international has been ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining fractures to the tibia and fibula in his right leg in Saturday's 3-1 victory against Stoke City. The Londoners battled back from 1-0 down at Stoke to move to within three points of leaders Chelsea, who had two players sent off in a 4-2 defeat at home to Manchester City on Saturday. -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has called on his team to continue their rejuvenated bid to win the English Premier League title in the wake of the horrific broken leg suffered by young midfielder Aaron Ramsey. But on Saturday we had a midfield of Nasri, Fabregas, Ramsey, Song, Eboue. The injury, caused by a challenge from Stoke's new England squad member Ryan Shawcross, brought back memories of the horror break suffered by Arsenal teammate Eduardo against Birmingham two years ago.
