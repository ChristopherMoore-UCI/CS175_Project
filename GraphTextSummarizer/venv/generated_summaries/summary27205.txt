Get fit and others will follow On April 27, just two days before Anje's final radiation treatment, Darbi, Anje and I ran across the finish line of the St. Jude Country Music Half Marathon hand-in-hand. Anje's doctor decided she needed a complete hysterectomy, with possible radiation and/or chemo to follow, depending on what the surgery uncovered. This run was for Darbi, my best friend since college and her partner Anje, the two people that have taught me about the best me I can be. With a cancer diagnosis, Anje and Darbi should've been thinking about anything except me, but that's not the kind of hearts they have. So Darbi stepped in with her "I got this" swagger and picked up where Anje was forced leave off.
