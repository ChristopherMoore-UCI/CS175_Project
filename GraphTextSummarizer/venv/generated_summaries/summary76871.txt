Women like Miriam Adelson, said conservative activist Carter. In a year when much has been made of the so-called "war on women," women like Adelson add weight to Republican causes, said Amy Kremer, chairwoman of the Tea Party Express. Kremer said Miriam Adelson is able to use her platform to amplify the views of many Republican women. Political observers credit Miriam Adelson with helping encourage her casino magnate husband to up the ante when it comes to spending money for Republican causes. "Dr. Adelson is pretty unique," said Mary Anne Carter, policy director at the YG Network, a conservative think tank that put on the "Woman Up" event.
