All told, Siri voice analysis would be far more challenging on a Mac computer, particularly when other voices or noises are in the room. Gillett also believes Siri ties into unique hardware features that make chatter between one's device and Apple's data center more streamlined. What's more, as Tunstall-Pedoe points out, desktop computers are relatively stationary devices, so a Mac version of Siri may not even need location-awareness, as a large portion of Siri's talents would never be engaged. But porting Siri to Mountain Lion desktops would pose several challenges. There's one big omission, however: Siri, Apple's voice-controlled virtual assistant, does not make the migration from mobile to desktop.
