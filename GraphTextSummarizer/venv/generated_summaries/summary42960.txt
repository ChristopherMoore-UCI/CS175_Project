Belgium international Eden Hazard joined the London club from French side Lille for a reported fee of $49 million, while Marko Marin was also signed from German side Werder Bremen. Midfielder Frank Lampard, who has been at Chelsea since 2001, said the club's close season business will add fresh impetus to an experienced side, that also contains former England captain John Terry. "Everyone is trying to impress, and you never lose that in pre-season, there's not one manager I've met yet who will close the door on any player. The trio of attacking players will look to provide the ammunition for Spain striker Fernando Torres, after Chelsea stalwart Didier Drogba left the club for China. He is the third high profile signing of the close season by Chelsea, who secured their first ever European Champions League triumph last season.
