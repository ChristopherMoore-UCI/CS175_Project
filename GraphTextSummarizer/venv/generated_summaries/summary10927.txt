Last week, another Laker forward, Metta World Peace, was suspended for seven games without pay over an elbow blow he delivered to the head of Oklahoma City Thunder's James Harden. In his statement, Hill said his lawyers were gathering facts and that he planned to cooperate with authorities. " Hill, who scored 10 points and 10 rebounds in the Lakers' 103-88 win over the Nuggets on Sunday, told reporters he did not expect to miss any games. The charge stems from an incident on February 29 when Hill allegedly choked his girlfriend of two years at his home in Houston after the two got into an argument about their "future," authorities said. Donna Hawkins, the assistant district attorney in Harris County, said Monday an arrest warrant for Hill will be issued once the magistrate has signed the paperwork -- unless the player turns himself in first.
