Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan fully reversed his anti-abortion position and came out as pro-choice in an op-ed published on Tuesday. And while he's won re-election to his heavily Democratic district with comfortable margins nearly every cycle since 2002, Ryan's pro-life stance could have been an obstacle for him in a Democratic Senate primary in the swing state. Ryan wrote in the op-ed that his shift was inspired by conversations with women during his political career, but the move also puts him in a better position politically as he contemplates a potential 2016 challenge to Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican. In recent years, he's drawn criticism from pro-life activists that once supported him for voting to protect public funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception. Ryan told Roll Call that "we're certainly looking very closely at" a Senate run.
