"Suicide Squad" also stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie and a large cast of villains and anti-heroes. We've seen a few teases so far, but on Friday night, director David Ayer gave us the first full look at Jared Leto as the Joker. (Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Entertainment -- makers of "Suicide Squad" -- are owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.) The Clown Prince of Crime will appear in 2016's "Suicide Squad," the first movie featuring the best-known comic book villain, where (as far as we know anyway), there is no Batman present. He will be the first actor to play the character on the big screen since the late Heath Ledger.
