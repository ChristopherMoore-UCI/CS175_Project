According to a State Department bulletin, Abu Du'a is in charge of overseeing all AQI operations, such as the August attack on Baghdad's Umm al-Qura mosque, and is based in Iraq. Ibrahim "Awwad Ibrahim" Ali al-Badri, also known by the alias "Abu Du'a," was put on the agency's global terrorist list earlier this week and is the senior leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, the State Department said. He has also threatened "violent retaliation" for the death of Osama bin Laden, who was killed in May after a decade-long manhunt ended with a U.S. raid on the former al Qaeda leader's compound in Pakistan. The terrorist designation is part of a U.S. effort to restrict resources available to Abu Du'a, while also freezing his assets in the United States, the State Department said. The United States designated al Qaeda in Iraq as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2004.
