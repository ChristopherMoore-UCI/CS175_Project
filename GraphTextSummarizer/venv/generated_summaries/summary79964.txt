"The level of support shows a bit of a new generation that does not know the experience of the past, of 30 years ago, of the war that happened in Nicaragua," said Manuel Orozco, a senior associate at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. -- Left-leaning Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega easily won re-election with more than double the votes of his closest rival, election officials said on Monday, amid complaints of voting irregularities. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland similarly weighed in Monday on reports of procedural irregularities and voter intimidation. Ortega is known as an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and was a public supporter of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi during the Libyan uprising. Opposition leaders have criticized Sunday's vote and Gadea, Ortega's closest rival, refused to accept the results.
