A four-time Olympic sailing gold medalist, Ainslie was on honeymoon in the Caribbean with his new wife, British TV presenter Georgie Thompson, when the furling system broke on the vessel's main sail. " Ainslie was sailing close to Branson's private Necker Island, where some of the tycoon's staff soon sailed to the rescue helping to cut the tangled sail to pieces. Given his sailing pedigree it's the last thing you would expect, but America's Cup hero Sir Ben Ainslie had to send out a distress call after sailing into trouble on his honeymoon. And who better to answer a knight's call for help than another knight of the British realm, Sir Richard Branson. Once back on dry land, the newly weds holidayed with Branson on Necker Island for a few days.
