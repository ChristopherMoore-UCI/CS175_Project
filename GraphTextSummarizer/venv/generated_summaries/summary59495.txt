8 things you might not know about Jamaica Spicy Garlic 'Pepper' Shrimp (Serves 4 to 6) Reprinted with permission by Kyle Books from "Caribbean Potluck" by Suzanne and Michelle Rousseau 1 pound (16 or 20 count) fresh shrimp, in shells with heads on 2 tablespoons sea salt 2 cups vegetable oil 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, chopped with seeds 6 cloves garlic, diced Â¼ cup sliced scallions 1 teaspoon sugar 1. Island eating means seafood, and lots of it -- like the fiery pepper shrimp that Jamaican sisters Suzanne and Michelle Rousseau cook up in their new cookbook, "Caribbean Potluck. In small batches, quickly saute the Scotch bonnet, garlic, scallions, sugar and remaining 1 tablespoon sea salt over high heat for a few seconds. For the rum drinker's benefit, Jamaican side dishes can often be starch-heavy: There's roasted or fried breadfruit, plantains, sweet potatoes and yams to accompany hearty oxtail stews, jerk-spiced meats and curry goat, with staples like the leafy green callaloo, coconut rice and field peas rounding out the mix. " "Pepper 'swims,' or shrimp seasoned with chili peppers, are sold by shrimp vendors on the roadside and at stoplights in various parts of the island," the Rousseaus write.
