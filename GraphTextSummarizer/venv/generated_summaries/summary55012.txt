"Actually, that amount of weight loss has been shown very clearly to have considerable health benefits, including preventing future disease, reducing current diseases that are associated with obesity and helping patients decrease the number of medications they're on." Studies in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Journal of Preventive Medicine also support the benefits of journaling, although weight loss in both studies was modest. Either way, Moore said she thinks of a journal as a "personal road map" to weight loss, healthier eating and behavior change. However, Bartfield said modest weight loss is "underappreciated. She added, "That's actually my first goal for all patients -- modest weight loss, or simply 5% to 10% -- and I think that every pound counts."
