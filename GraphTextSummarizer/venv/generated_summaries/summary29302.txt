Economic consequences of island spat The islands, situated in the East China Sea between Okinawa and Taiwan, are under Japanese control, but China claims they have been a part of its territory for ages. Japanese media also reported incidents of assault on Japanese nationals in China in the past few days. They have come to represent what many Chinese see as unfinished business: redressing the impact of the Japanese occupation of large swathes of eastern China during the 1930s and 1940s. Elsewhere in China, anti-Japanese rallies broke out in dozens of cities and sometimes turned violent. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895.
