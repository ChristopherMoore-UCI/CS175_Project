In a Facebook post December 30, Cologne Cathedral Provost Norbert Feldhoff said Monday's protest would "certainly not take place in the light of the cathedral." The protest group "Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West,"  or PEGIDA, called for people to take to the streets at 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. GMT) Monday  in the cities of Cologne, Kassel and the German capital Berlin. Germany's Cologne Cathedral turned off its lights Monday in a symbolic rejection of an anti-Islamification rally taking place in its shadow. "We learned our lessons from the Nazi years and you can see it's very interesting that the organizations of PEGIDA, they know exactly where the red line is which they should not cross --  this makes me more skeptical but they know where the taboos are in Germany so I don't see a renewal of the NPD (the far-right National Democratic Party) -- it's less than in other European countries. Such demonstrations encourage the exclusion of people because of their skin color or religion, she said.
