Svetlana Shkolina won the women's high jump for Russia going clear at 2.03 meters to beat U.S. rival Brigetta Barrett (2.00m) who took silver. But there was better news for the U.S. in the 100m hurdles with Brianna Rollins recovering from a poor start to take gold in 12.44 seconds ahead of 2011 world champion Sally Pearson from Australia. Shkolina's teammate Anna Chicherova shared bronze with Spain's Ruth Beitia. His compatriot Warren Weir took the silver in 19.79 seconds while U.S. sprinter Curtis Mitchell claimed the bronze in a time of 20.04 seconds. Russia's women also pipped the U.S. to gold in the 4x400m relay as Antonina Krivoshapka held off a challenge from Francina McCrory of the U.S. on the anchor leg.
