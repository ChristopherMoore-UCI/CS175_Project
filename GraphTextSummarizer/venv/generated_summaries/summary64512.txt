The California Highway Patrol detained engineer Jacob Gregoire of the Chula Vista Fire Department for about 30 minutes after he refused to move an engine partially blocking a lane, CNN affiliate KFMB reported. " The incident prompted a meeting between CHP and Chula Vista officials Wednesday. "We don't know what was going through the officer's mind," Hanneman told CNN affiliate KSWB. "From our perspective, our engineer was out there doing what they're trained to do and doing everything right to take care of patient care and protect that scene. It was there to help protect ambulance crews treating people injured in a rollover accident on Interstate 805.
