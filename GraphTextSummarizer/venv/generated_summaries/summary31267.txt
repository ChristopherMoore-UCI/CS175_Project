Several international airlines posted advisories on their Web sites regarding extra screenings and carry-on bags for international U.S.-bound flights, saying that the U.S. government's revisions have prompted changes for passengers flying to the United States. -- Canada is immediately limiting carry-on items for flights to the United States in the aftermath of a failed terror attack on a Northwest Airlines flight. The rule prohibited passengers on international U.S.-bound flights from leaving their seats during the last hour of a flight, the sources said. Passengers had to stow pillows and blankets, and maps viewed on in-flight entertainment screens were disabled during the final hour of flight. Only one carry-on bag is allowed for international U.S.-bound flights, the advisories said.
