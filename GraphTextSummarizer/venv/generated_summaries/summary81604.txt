No. 5 David Ferrer beat John Isner 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4 6-2 in Sunday's decisive singles match in Gijon, after brothers Bob and Mike Bryan had kept U.S. hopes alive with victory in Saturday's doubles match. World No. 45 Berlocq was drafted in for the singles match after Argentina's No. 1 Juan Martin del Porto was forced to withdraw from the tie through injury on Saturday. The final will be a repeat of the 2009 showpiece after Tomas Berdych's straight-sets win against Carlos Berlocq saw the Czech Republic seal a 3-1 victory over 2011 runners-up Argentina. Berdych, a semifinalist at the recent U.S. Open, was rarely troubled by Berlocq and sealed a straight-forward 6-3 6-3 6-4 win, much to the disappointment of the Buenos Aires crowd. Defending champions Spain are through to the 2012 Davis Cup final after a 3-1 defeat of the United States.
