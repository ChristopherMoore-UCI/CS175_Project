President Barack Obama has been facing some of his lowest job approval numbers this year while public support in Russia for President Vladimir Putin has surged over the last year to record highs. Ben Judah, author of "Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In And Out Of Love With Vladimir Putin," said those factors make it more difficult to gauge Russian public opinion. On Thursday Putin delivered a rallying state of the nation address in which he accused the West of replicating the Cold War containment strategy -- asserting that Western nations would have found a way to impose sanctions on Russia even without the crisis roiling in Ukraine -- and he called on Russians at home and abroad to come together. Henry Hale, an international affairs professor at The George Washington University specializing in Russian politics, said on the whole, the polls reflect the reality on the ground of popular support for Putin. Meanwhile, the Russian government admitted this week the country should brace recession because of dramatic drops in oil prices and after a spree of Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea and its ongoing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine walloped the Russian currency and sent investors fleeing.
