The company also publishes data on how often government agencies request that public content be removed from Google services, such as YouTube videos or blog posts on Blogger. In a bit of circular logic, the Justice Department has argued that the electronic evidence gathered without warrants is necessary to build enough of a case to later get search warrants. According to the latest Google Transparency report, Google fielded 20,938 requests for private account data from governments around the world between January and June of this year.

While Google is admirably proactive about releasing data on government requests, in the majority of cases it does turn over the requested information.
