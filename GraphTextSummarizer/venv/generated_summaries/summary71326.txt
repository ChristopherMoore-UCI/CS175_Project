Japan's Mika Miyazato, 2011 Kraft Nabisco champion Stacy Lewis, Norway's world No. 4 Suzann Pettersen and 2009 U.S. Open winner Eun-Hee Ji of South Korea were all on four under. Feng carded a five-under-par 67 to seal a two-shot triumph at the LPGA Championship in New York on Sunday, which also made her the first woman from mainland China to win on the U.S. women's circuit. Tennis star Li saw her profile increase dramatically after clinching the 2011 French Open title, making her China's first grand slam singles champion, and Feng hopes her win can have a similar impact on golf's popularity in the country. There are good players from China, young players, right now. "Hopefully it's going to help golf in China because I want to be Li Na for golf in China," the 22-year-old told the LPGA's official website.
