There never was a gunman and no one was in danger at the 350-acre research facility next to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Ohio, according to NASA spokeswoman Katherine Trinidad. The center, named for former astronaut and Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, is involved in research on a variety of NASA projects.
