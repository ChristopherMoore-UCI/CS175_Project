A jaywalking rarely makes national news, but the arrest of Arizona professor Ersula Ore has done just that. "Professor Ore's one crime that evening was to demand respect that she deserves as a productive, educated and tax paying member of society," Roby said in a statement to CNN, adding that they maintain any actions Ore took were in self-defense. Appearing Monday on CNN's "New Day," Ore was asked about her own words and actions in the incident and replied, "I think I did what I was supposed to do. " Ore faces charges of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, failing to provide ID and obstructing a public thoroughfare. The two talk over each other as the situation escalates, with Ferrin threatening to arrest Ore unless she produces her ID.
