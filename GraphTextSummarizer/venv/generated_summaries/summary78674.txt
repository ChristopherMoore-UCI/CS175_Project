Watch: From David Petraeus to Trayvon Martin, a 2012 media report card Those who believe that guns are being unfairly blamed, led by the NRA, are lashing out at politicians, video game makers, entertainment conglomerates and, of course, the media.

Watch: Should NBC's David Gregory be jailed for waving ammunition on air? He walked right up to the line, and some would say crossed it, of pushing LaPierre to acknowledge that some form of gun control would be sensible. The same kind of animus has been directed at CNN's Piers Morgan, an outspoken advocate of gun control.
