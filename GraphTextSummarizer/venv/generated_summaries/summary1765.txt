I'm giving interviews about why divorce can be a great rite of passage, and why starter marriages, if dissected, can be necessary to fixing one's own flaws and to finding the right person the second time around. Second weddings are often small, discreet and sensible. I believe in divorce, and I believe in marriage. But Matt, who has never been married before, feels strongly about having a real wedding, so I decided to succumb to the juggernaut that is the wedding industry and have a second wedding, which will feel like most people's first. This was my first marriage proposal, but not my first marriage.
