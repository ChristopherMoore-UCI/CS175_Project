Some Americans have previously crossed the border without a visa, either knowingly or by mistake, but in this case, the U.S. official said, "This was somebody who was a tour operator who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North." Bae's sentencing comes amid tense relations between North Korea and both the United States and its staunch ally South Korea. Three days earlier, a State Department spokesman told reporters that Swedish diplomats, who represent U.S. interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic relations with the North, were able to visit Bae. A Korean-American, Bae entered North Korea on a valid tourist visa, a senior U.S. official told CNN on Monday. The North has used that name to refer to the man U.S. authorities call Kenneth Bae. -- An American man detained in North Korea since last November has been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, North Korean state news reported Thursday.
