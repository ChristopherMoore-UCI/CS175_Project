Metehan, 19, a university student studying English literature, believes the government's latest policy initiatives and the "brutal" measures taken by police are a true reflection of the state of Turkish democracy. "He [Erdogan] is starting to define people as alcoholics if they drink," she said in a reference to the recent enactment of stricter alcohol controls. Incinerated cars, desecrated monuments and homemade banners now litter Istanbul's commercial hub, Taksim Square, after demonstrations at the weekend turned violent when police moved in to scatter protesters. Under Erdogan and his ruling AKP party, Turkey has lifted curbs on public expression of religion, including strict limits on women wearing Islamic-style headscarves. Gozde, 19, a university pupil studying genetics, joined the protests with her mother and is worried for the future of her country under the leadership of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
