The following day the Chinese edition of the Global Times, a state-run publication known for its uncompromising op-eds, published an editorial warning that recent pro-democracy activities -- including the referendum, as well as the upcoming rally and sit-in, are polarising Hong Kong society. The article urges Hong Kong people not to be "kidnapped" by the radical opposition. "Hong Kong people know where their interest lies in and they don't need your (Global Times) phony kindness," said user @lddldd0000. Let Hong Kong people handle their own business." The Federation of Students and Scholarism will camp overnight on Chater Road, the city's business heart, as well as outside the government offices in the Admiralty district of downtown Hong Kong, until Wednesday morning.
