What's more, the researchers suggest that the fossil record of what have been considered different Homo species from this time period -- such as Homo ergaster, Homo rudolfensis and Homo habilis -- could actually be variations on a single species, Homo erectus. The New York museum's Hall of Human Origins takes visitors on a tour through human evolutionary history, showing distinct Homo species reflected in major fossil finds such as Turkana Boy (Homo ergaster) and Peking man (Homo erectus). Ian Tattersall, curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History's anthropology division, said in an e-mail that there's "no way this extraordinarily important specimen is Homo erectus," if the skull fragment discovered in Trinil, Java, Indonesia, defines the features of the Homo erectus group. "This is most complete early Homo skull ever found in the world," said lead study author David Lordkipanidze, researcher at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi. Ancient fossils question human family tree Lordkipanidze said he and colleagues consider A. sediba to be earlier and more primitive than the Dmanisi hominids, and that there's "no doubt" the Georgian fossils belong to the Homo genus.
