German police detained one member of the group -- 25-year-old Mohammad Mohammadi, a German of Iranian descent -- before he left the country, German intelligence officials told CNN. When the duo boarded a flight in Vienna, Austria, security officials discovered jihadist literature in their bags, according to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, quoting German officials. German officials recently visited Sidiqi and are evaluating his claims, the officials told CNN. Both men were radicalized after they started attending the Taiba mosque, German intelligence officials told CNN. Two others -- Alexander Janzen, 30, and Michael Wallinger, 25, German converts to Islam from the former Soviet Union -- were arrested soon after arriving in Pakistan, German intelligence officials said.
