Among those the military junta deemed "dangerous": novelist Julio Cortazar, singer Mercedes Sosa and actress Norma Aleandro. These three, for example, spent the dictatorship years abroad: Sosa and Aleandro in exile and Cortazar in France. These cultural figures were categorized as "F1" to "F4," corresponding to their perceived risk to the state, Defense Minister Agustin Rossi said Monday when he unveiled the findings. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the so-called Dirty War. The files have "historical and judicial" value, Rossi told a radio station Tuesday.
