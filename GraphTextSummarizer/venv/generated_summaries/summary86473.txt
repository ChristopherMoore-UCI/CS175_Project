-- The couple who called police after being held hostage in Big Bear, California, by rogue ex-Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner will get a majority of the $1 million reward for information that led authorities to him. A panel of three judges awarded 15% to the Daniel McGowan, who discovered Dorner's burning truck near the ski resort town, and 5% to R. Lee McDaniel, who spotted Dorner on February 7 and informed police. They will receive 80% of the reward, put up by the city of Los Angeles with help from other jurisdictions, groups, and private donors. The manhunt for Dorner ended when Dorner was cornered and died in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 100 miles east of the city where he once had been a police officer. Karen Reynolds and her husband, Jim, called 911 on February 12 to report that Dorner had tied them up and stolen their car.
