According to local media reports, citing official sources, authorities know the perpetrator is a woman because she yelled at the second victim before shooting him: "You guys think you're real bad, don't you?" The slayings have terrorized many bus drivers, especially those operating Route 4, also known as the Yellow Route, which serves main thoroughfares and downtown Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million located across the border from El Paso, Texas. " Ciudad Juarez gained international notoriety in the late 1990s and early 2000s after a wave of slayings involving women. She reportedly says in the e-mails that her motive is retaliation against bus drivers who have raped vulnerable women, especially those who work in the "maquiladoras," or foreign assembly plants (mainly American) on the Mexican side of the border. Journalist Edgar Roman in Ciudad Juarez contributed to this report. Authorities say the elusive woman has killed at least two bus drivers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
