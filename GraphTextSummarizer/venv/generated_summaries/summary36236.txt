"It's not only a way of inspiring future generations into energy savings but it shows we need different energy mixes," Kemball-Cook said. The company this year installed 36 tiles to create two people-powered dance floors at the 20th Essence Festival, placing digital screens in front of the dance floors to display the amount of energy produced during each dance off. From footfalls to climbing stairs, to opening doors, the cities of the future will look at ways of tapping energy from all the mechanical energy we expend going about our daily lives. When looking at the amount of kinetic energy produced in the average metro station at rush hour, or even on the dance floors of nightclubs, harvesting electricity from human activity makes sense. The company's footfall harvesting technology -- a deflecting pad covered with the type of soft ground surface commonly found in playgrounds - can produce up to 7 watts of energy with each step.
