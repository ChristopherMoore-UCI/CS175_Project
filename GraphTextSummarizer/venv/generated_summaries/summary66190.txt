Family friends in Ireland said the ex-beauty queen's widower, Gaelic football star John McAreavey, was in a packed courtroom along with other relatives to hear the verdict announced. Michaela McAreavey, a 27-year-old teacher and ex-beauty queen, was found strangled in the bathtub of her hotel room in January 2011. It also dominated the news agenda in McAreavey's native Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both denied the murder during a two-month trial and police confirmed Thursday they were acquitted by a jury at the Supreme Court in the Mauritian capital, Port Louis. The Harte and McAreavey families issued a written statement after Thursday's verdict.
