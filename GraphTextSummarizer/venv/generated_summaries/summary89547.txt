Tidal heating has likely melted the interior of Triton, producing the volcanoes, fractures and other geological features that Voyager saw on that bitterly cold, icy surface." Pluto, which is slightly smaller than Triton, will likely be very different from Neptune's large moon, but researchers expect the dwarf planet to have similar features to Triton, including internal density and bulk composition, and similarly low temperatures on its frozen surface. NASA says the image of Triton and video provides a sneak peek of what scientists expect when New Horizons reaches Pluto. "Although Triton is a moon of a planet and Pluto is a dwarf planet, Triton serves as a preview of sorts for the upcoming Pluto encounter," NASA said on its website. "Although both bodies originated in the outer solar system, Triton was captured by Neptune and has undergone a radically different thermal history than Pluto. Space agency officials caution, however, when New Horizons makes its closest fly-by of Pluto on July 14, 2015, "it will not be a replay of Voyager, but more of a sequel and a reboot."
