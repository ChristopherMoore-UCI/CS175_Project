He faces 20 years on murder and human rights abuse charges in Panama, but Panamanian law would allow him to serve his sentence under house arrest because of his age. Noriega was later convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison, reduced to 17 for good behavior. " Noriega is charged in France with depositing drug money in French banks and using drug money to buy apartments in Paris. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned down Noriega's request for a new hearing, setting the stage for his extradition to France, where he has been convicted in abstentia on money laundering charges and faces a new trial. Because of that status, he and his attorneys believe he should have been returned to Panama -- where he would face murder charges -- when his sentence ended in 2007.
