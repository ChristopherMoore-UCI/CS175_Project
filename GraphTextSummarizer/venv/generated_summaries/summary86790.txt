Wayne McMillan, CEO of BDI, says job numbers for people with disabilities show little hope. The Bobby Dodd Institute in Atlanta provides job training and rehabilitation for people with disabilities. Now, as a disabled worker, the 29-year-old is competing with thousands of nondisabled job seekers going for jobs once allocated for the disabled population. She emphasized that disabled workers have one of the highest retention rates in the industry, 82 percent to 87 percent, according to BDI figures. For the first time, the Department of Labor in February released a report tracking unemployment rates among disabled job seekers.
