Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni declared victory Thursday in an election to lead the ruling Kadima Party, putting her on a path that could make her Israel's first female prime minister in 34 years. Whoever succeeds Olmert as prime minister will be handed a set of daunting challenges, including determining the fate of Israel's talks with the Palestinians, its fledgling indirect talks with Syria and its tough talk on Iran's nuclear aspirations. "Kadima members are more concerned about the corruption threat inside Israel than the security threat from Hamas and Iran," Israeli columnist Gil Hoffman said. Mofaz announced Thursday he will take a "time out" from politics and will resign his seat in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. Livni's election marks a stunning rise for the 50-year-old, who entered the Knesset less than 10 years ago.
