A glimpse into how much the operation may have made can be seen in the documents, which allege that Nikolaenko received $459,098.47 between June 4 and December 5, 2007, through his work distributing e-mails peddling everything from advertised erectile dysfunction drugs, other counterfeit prescriptions and "herbal remedies. According to court documents and FBI affidavits, experts looking into the "Mega-D" spam automated botnet -- which is a prime source for selling counterfeit goods -- identified Oleg Nikolaenko, 23, as the plan's mastermind. That man gave federal agents information that led them across several continents, to different e-mail addresses and websites and, eventually, to Nikolaenko, authorities said. On Friday, Nikolaenko pleaded not guilty to charges related to federal anti-spam legislation. FBI agents and the Federal Trade Commission had been monitoring him since at least 2007, according to court documents.
