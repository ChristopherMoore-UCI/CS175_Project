The arrest follows that of three teenagers from northwest London on Sunday after they were intercepted by Turkish police in Istanbul. British police say they think the three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- traveled to Syria after flying from London to Istanbul on February 17. There was increasing concern about the number of women traveling to Syria, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said. Last week, Turkish authorities said they had arrested a  person -- working for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service -- on suspicion of helping three British girls who are thought to have entered Syria to join ISIS. An 18-year-old British man has been arrested on suspicion of preparing to join ISIS in Syria, UK police say.
