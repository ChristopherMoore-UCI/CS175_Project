State Department officials should have beefed up security in Libya's second-largest city because of general warnings that U.S. personnel were at risk. In a statement issued by her office, Feinstein said claims that the report blames Clinton for the Benghazi deaths are "patently false," and that the Republican addendum "unfairly criticizes Secretary Clinton." Wednesday, Feinstein told CNN's The Situation Room that "it's interesting that the first thing out of the box is something that's political." U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department computer specialist Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed in that attack. GOP leaders quickly focused their fire on her after the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that the 2012 assault on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was "likely preventable" based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings. They argued that as secretary of state, Clinton bore "ultimate accountability" for security at the Benghazi mission, "and we believe there should be a full examination of her role in these events, including on the night of the attacks."
