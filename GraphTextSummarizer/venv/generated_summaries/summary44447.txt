Dupnik said the suspect has had contact with law enforcement in the past in which he made violent threats, but he declined to say against whom. Police recovered a 9mm Glock Model 19 handgun believed used in the shooting, according to senior law enforcement sources. An Arizona law enforcement source and a federal law enforcement source, meanwhile, identified the suspect as Jared Lee Loughner. One suspect was in custody immediately after the shooting, and investigators were "actively in pursuit" of a second man whom they believed may be involved in the attempted assassination, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Saturday night. Dupnik reiterated Rhee's prognosis Saturday evening.
