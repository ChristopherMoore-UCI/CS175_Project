As well as enabling citizens to monitor elections in near real-time, they have engaged more traditional election observers who are able to verify and amplify messaging to security personnel and electoral authorities in the event of outbreaks of violence. Yet Kenya's tech-savvy activists are determined to prevent their nation slipping into chaos and with up to 93% of Kenyans using mobile phones, they're harnessing the power of technology to monitor elections, report incidents of violence and encourage a peaceful process. Built on a violence-interruption approach that has been used in contexts as differing as Baltimore and Baghdad, the intervention combines targeted SMS with intensive on-the-ground work by existing peace builders and community leaders to target potential flashpoints of violence. Aware of the powerful influence that new media such as online forums and the blogosphere had in both inciting and dampening violence in the last election, Nairobi's iHub, a hothouse for tech innovation in Kenya, is piloting an initiative called Umati, which is monitoring and reporting hate speech that could trigger violence this year. It is well known that alternative media often doesn't reach poorer communities, which include the slums where there were severe outbreaks of violence in the aftermath of the last elections.
