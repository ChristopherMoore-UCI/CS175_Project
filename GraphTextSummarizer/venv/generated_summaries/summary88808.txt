Among the major artists playing at this year's New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival are the Who, Elton John, Keith Urban, John Legend and Wilco. There are 12 stages going, and you can still hear plenty of jazz, blues and local performers, including the Meters, the Radiators, Dr. John, the Rebirth Jazz Band and Rockin' Dopsie Jr. & the Zydeco Twisters. The festival also brings in a great deal of money for local organizations and musicians, many of whom get far more exposure playing in front of crowds of thousands -- or tens of thousands -- than they would at small clubs. AEG, the giant entertainment company, is now the driving force behind Jazz Fest, leading to the influx of big names. "And 'OZ isn't interested in Elton John no matter how big he is."
