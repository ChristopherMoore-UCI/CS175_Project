Luckily for me and the friends I traveled with, we were able to camp out with other friends who had a suite with a balcony. Strangers lent cell phones, moms held other moms' babies so they could have a break, passengers gave a hand to the elderly to ensure they got up and down the stairs safely and guys were ready and willing to lift wheelchairs of sick children up and down the stairs, as my friend Nick Burge did. By this time, seven out of the nine friends in our group had reached their breaking points emotionally, along with many other passengers. Tears, big hugs as passengers reunite with families Within an hour, my friends found each other in the halls and ran to the top deck, where we could see black smoke billowing from the smokestack. People were throwing on life jackets and frantically rushing to find crew, friends and loved ones.
