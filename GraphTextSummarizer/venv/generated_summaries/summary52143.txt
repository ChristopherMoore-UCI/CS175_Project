"The days of Live Aid and the Concert for Bangladesh are becoming relics of the past," says Keith Clifton, an associate professor of musicology at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. Despite their imprint on popular culture, there was never a golden age for benefit concerts. Rachel Weingarten, a pop culture critic and a co-producer of benefit concerts, says some of the concerts eventually became known as "Ego-Fests" because of the back-stage demands of some performers. Other problems cropped up in subsequent benefit concerts. Some musicians try to sidestep that criticism by creating their own charity instead of allowing concert organizers to pick one for them.
