This month, the United States began providing air support to YPG fighters defending the Syrian border town of Kobani from an ISIS siege. In addition to bombing ISIS militants in and around Kobani, U.S. military planes parachuted weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters, infuriating the Turkish government. But instead of ending up in Iraq, Matson joined the YPG in Syria. Matson said the YPG could use more support on the ground, in addition to ongoing U.S.-led airstrikes. Since recovering from his wounds, Matson has been working to bring other foreign fighters to Syria.
