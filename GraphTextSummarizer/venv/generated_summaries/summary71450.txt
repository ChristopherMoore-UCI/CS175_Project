The Warhawk Air Museum is home to two rare Curtiss P40 World War II-era fighter planes, which appeared in 2001's "Pearl Harbor" and 2008's "Valkyrie," said museum co-founder Sue Paul. Those who renovated the Geiser in 1997 aimed to restore it to the opulence it enjoyed when the German-Swiss Geiser family first built it in 1889 -- complete with ornate, decorative stained glass fittings, said owner Barbara Sidway. On the set of "Valkyrie," star Tom Cruise turned to Paul, took her hand, and told her, "'I want to thank you so much for the honor of using your beautifully preserved historical airplanes in this movie,'" recalled Paul. Near the square is St. Paul's Episcopal Church, where Confederate President Jefferson Davis in 1865 learned the troubling news that his troops were no longer able to defend the city. During your walk, stop for lunch at one of the many restaurants in Shockoe Bottom, which once served as a market for slave traders.
