As confirmed by Deadline, Underwood is teaming up with entertainment moguls Jerry Bruckheimer, Jonathan Littman and Ildy Modrovich to executive produce a six-hour television series based on the song. He's lying to both of them," Underwood says of the devilish song she penned with Hillary Lindsey and Josh Kear for her "Blown Away" album. This will be Underwood's first time to produce a television project, moving behind-the-scenes after her starring role on NBC's live television production of "The Sound of Music." Modrovich ("CSI: Miami," "Necessary Roughness") penned the script, which is set in the modern-day South and tells the story of a wife and mistress who find out about one another and then conspire to murder the cheating husband. KristieAnne Reed will co-executive produce the series, which will air on Fox.
