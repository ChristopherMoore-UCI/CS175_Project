Clearly, Hasidic communities feel threatened, as evidenced by the recent post in xoJane titled "What Women's Media Needs to know about Chassidic Women." She made sweeping claims on behalf of Hasidic women: They all love their husbands, enjoy following the laws of marital purity and are safer from cervical cancer as a result. If Hasidic women can summon the moral fortitude to face up to the cracks in the foundation of the lifestyle, they can perhaps work toward repairing it, and create a healthier, happier environment for their children to grow up in. The article enraged many of my peers, some of whom are religious, because it replaces what could have been a sensitive personal essay about Judaism with a whitewashed version of Hasidic life. She also reduced all non-Hasidic women to a coke-snorting and skinny jeans-wearing caricature.
