In works made just after the war, he (like his German compatriot George Grosz and other Dadaist artists) incorporated collage into his canvases, evoking the scores of amputated veterans visible in Germany's city streets, themselves virtual assemblages of prostheses. Painted while he convalesced from a mustard gas attack, Fernand LÃ©ger's "The Card Party" (1917) depicts the artist and his fellow French soldiers as virtual extensions of military machinery, their jointed arms mobile like metallic prostheses. Opinion: The mighty women of World War I From Futurism, Dada borrowed strategies of shock and illogic, assaulting received truths and bourgeois morality alike. In France as elsewhere, then, culture formed a parallel theater of war. With the gradual rise of fascism, such stability proved itself increasingly illusory, as even the most decorous of aesthetic traditions were put in the service of an aggressive, murderous ideology, and another war -- even more terrible than the first -- tore open the century.
