But Nichols saw the character as uncertain and neurotic, qualities Hoffman brought to life on screen. At one point in 1967, he had four plays running on Broadway -- including two by Neil Simon, "Barefoot in the Park" and "The Odd Couple" -- and he was a go-to guy for stage works until the end of his life, helming Tom Stoppard's "The Real Thing" (1984), "Monty Python's Spamalot" (2005) and a 2012 revival of "Death of a Salesman" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. -- Mike Nichols, the award-winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award, died Wednesday evening, according to a note from ABC News' president to its staff. "Barefoot," "Odd Couple," "Plaza Suite" and "Second Avenue" were all written by Neil Simon. " "No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike," James Goldston, president of ABC News, said in a note to the staff.
