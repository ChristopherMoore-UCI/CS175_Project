Meanwhile, the shock of slowly but steadily rising prices for fuel and electricity would drive economic changes that would accelerate U.S. economic growth. Today, coal's share of the electricity mix has plunged to one-third, as utilities substitute cheap natural gas. Moreover, natural gas does little (as yet) to address emissions from automobile tailpipes. They prefer zero-emissions power sources like wind and solar -- sources made more uncompetitive than ever by ultracheap natural gas. Millions of Americans want new cars.
