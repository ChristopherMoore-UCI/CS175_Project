The network's website posted a story headlined "Did Kanye West Inspire Aubrey Plaza's Movie Awards Stage-Crash?" West's interruption of Taylor Swift's speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards -- in which he made it clear he thought Beyonce deserved the honor more -- was soon followed by an apology tour. Plaza was given the front-row center seat closest to Ferrell, whom she said she's "known for a long time." -- Aubrey Plaza's lips are firmly sealed about her MTV Movie Awards "Kanye" moment four days ago, which could be seen as evidence that it was a stunt to promote her new movie. MTV quickly promoted the "incident," while officially denying it was staged and insisting that Plaza was expelled from the audience. The actress ran onstage Sunday as Will Ferrell began his acceptance speech for the Comedic Genius award.
