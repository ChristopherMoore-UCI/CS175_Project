Far beyond repurposing news, this is a whole new chance to engage readers, curate the best coverage and display and explain news in new ways. The loss of classifieds to the Internet, an investment community that played these institutions like poker chips and left choking debt in the wake, owners without an honest commitment to independent news in a democratic society, and newspapers themselves that were slow as readers flocked to the Web. Newspapers need to succeed in five broad areas if they have a hope of saving the news: First, newspapers are losing their connection to enough readers to stay in business. To its credit, the New York Times is having success with its digital subscription model -- total digital subs are up over a year ago and the Gray Lady even saw a bump in newspaper subscriptions because of the way it had bundled its digital offer. The noble and necessary work of covering, investigating and following stories goes on, but papers are slow to meet readers where they live.
