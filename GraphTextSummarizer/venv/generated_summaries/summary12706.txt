Even though science can be good for all of us, scientific issues in America have taken on political overtones. But other issues that aren't strictly scientific also involve the big numbers and complicated interwoven decisions for which scientific thinking can help. If current political discussions are any indication, America is in danger not only of losing scientific leadership but also of losing respect for the scientific method itself. Of course political factors enter, too, in policy debates in which actual scientific facts don't necessarily dominate the decision-making process. But if policymakers show they believe what scientific results say, even those who are skeptical or afraid might come around.
