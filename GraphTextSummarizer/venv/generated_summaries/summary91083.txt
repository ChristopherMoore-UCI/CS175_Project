-- As the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrates the 90th anniversary of its founding, party officials are pledging to continue the fight against corruption. Graft and corruption includes nepotism, accepting bribes and kickbacks, lavish spending of public funds, and laundering of profits and public money overseas. Some netizens exposed officials who demanded cars and villas, police officers who asked for cash incentives to not issue traffic tickets and doctors who wanted money to ensure safe surgical procedures. A public opinion survey conducted by Horizon Research Consultancy last year cites corruption as the worst problem tarnishing China's image. Anti-corruption official Wu Yuliang acknowledges the role of the netizens and general public -- with a caveat.
