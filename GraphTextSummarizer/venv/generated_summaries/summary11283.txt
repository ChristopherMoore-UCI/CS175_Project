Since the dramatic ANA incident, Dreamliner's list of problems have gone on to include a United Airlines emergency landing in Houston due to brake problems, a fire on an Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner at Heathrow Airport and plane groundings and investigations into a faulty fuel pump indicator, an electric panel, a plane oven and emergency beacons. The new plane rolled out of the factory in Everett, Washington, and is in the flight line awaiting its first flight by Boeing teams. The four-month global grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet after an ANA flight was diverted following a battery fire in January was the first such global grounding in 30 years. This year, Boeing has had a total of 82 orders to date for the 787, with the largest order of 42 planes coming from American Airlines. "We are working with our supplier partners to continue to introduce improvements to the 787-8 to enhance reliability, just as we do for all of our airplane models," said Boeing's communications representative Julie O'Donnell.
