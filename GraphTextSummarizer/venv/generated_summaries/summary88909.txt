The concept of cancers growing slowly over years is more typical of older women who are past menopause than younger women in their 40s. TIME.com: GMA's Amy Robach reveals on-air test led to breast cancer diagnosis Robach wrote on Good Morning America's website that she has "very little family history" of the disease, and "considered it virtually impossible that I would have cancer." Good Morning America host Amy Robach revealed on her show that a recent on-air mammogram had found she has breast cancer, but the diagnosis wouldn't have been made if she followed certain federal guidelines for screening.

There's also growing evidence that in breast cancer, tumors start to send out signals to other parts of the body to prime them for metastatic growths.
