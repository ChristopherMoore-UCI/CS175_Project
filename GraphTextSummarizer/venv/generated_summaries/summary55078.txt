Saudi Arabia and Israel care more about U.S. sanctions than EU ones; EU and U.N. sanctions hurt Iran less than U.S. ones as even if EU banks don't offer letters of credit to Iran, it is because of the U.S. sanctions. Israel fears the problem with the U.S. timeline is if Iran kicks out inspectors, Washington would not have sufficient time to gear up militarily. Iran could follow suit by avoiding tougher sanctions by appearing to cooperate with the U.S., playing for time while creating and exploiting differences between the U.S. on one hand and Israel and Saudi Arabia on the other. The combined result is that the U.S.'s allies in the region -- mainly the Gulf and Israel are feeling cornered with the high probability that Israel will feel forced to strike Iran before the Obama administration decides to proceed with independent negotiations with Iran and unilaterally roll back sanctions allowing Iran to become a nuclear threshold state. " US-Israel rift over Iran nukes now in the open Israel does not see the U.S. as a reliable ally, especially in light of leaks from the White House on targets that the U.S. had of Syria's military instillations and chemical sites giving the Assad regime the time to disperse it into densely populated areas; and more recently on Israel's strike on Hezbollah's weapons shipments giving Hezbollah an excuse to strike back.
