Els earned his place in the top 30 qualifiers after successive victories at the WGC-Doral and Arnold Palmer Invitational tournaments, both held near to his Florida home. -- South African star Erne Els is in no mood to rest on his laurels after his "big surprise" at being inducted into World Golf's Hall of Fame. Els received 66 per cent of the vote from a panel of journalists, golf dignitaries and Hall of Fame members, easily topping the poll. " An Els victory at Augusta would certainly be massively popular with golf galleries, who have taken the smooth-swinging South African to their hearts over the years. But despite landing the ultimate lifetime achievement award, Els is still keen to add to his 62 global victories and wants to round off his season by coming out on top at this week's PGA Tour Championship at East Lake.
