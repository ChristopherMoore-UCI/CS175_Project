Disproportionately tiny pool "Success in football is directly related to the population of football players," says Rowan Simons, chairman of China Club Football, one of Beijing's biggest sports networks. Simons has been in China, and playing football there, for 20 years. Right now, China has anywhere between 7,000 and 50,000 kids involved in football, according to the Chinese Football Association. He adds that he had a tough time convincing parents of the positives of football, which in China is associated with cheating and match-fixing.. The coach imagines an ideal future where grassroots football takes off in China, with community-based football clubs in the European mold taking the lead.
