Beleaguered New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner got into a war of words Wednesday with a man who lashed out at him for being "married to an Arab," in addition to chastising the former congressman about his well-documented sexting scandal. The two then went face-to-face, with Kessler accusing Weiner -- who resigned in disgrace after 12 years in Congress representing part of New York City after admitting to sending sexually suggestive images and carrying on inappropriate relationships with women over the Internet -- of doing "disgusting things, and you have the nerve to even walk around in public. The Weiner campaign released a video of Wednesday's exchange, a version of which also was captured by blogger Jacob Kornbluh. Reached by CNN later in the day, Kessler admitted calling out Weiner for being "married to an Arab." Kessler didn't stop talking, even as Weiner was leaving the bakery, saying, "You are disgusting, disgusting." "It takes one to know one, jackass," Weiner replied.
