As Republicans reflect on their path forward with minority voters and persuadable whites, there are opportunities to advance civil rights. Working with Sessions, civil rights advocates pushed to reduce this disparity significantly -- among the greatest advances in criminal justice reform in decades. In the U.S. Senate, such prominent Republicans as Edward Brooke of Massachusetts (the first African-American senator since Reconstruction), Jacob Javits of New York and Everett Dirksen of Illinois were strong supporters of civil rights, as were governors such as Nelson Rockefeller in New York, George Romney in Massachusetts and William Scranton in Pennsylvania. Moreover, support for civil rights persisted in the party throughout the last century. These are two forms of the same drug, but crack cocaine is used more by minorities and carried much harsher punishments for possession.
