"I never had a chance to put my daughter on a school bus," said Carl Tyson, making direct eye contact with Pettway. DNA confirmed she was Carlina White, the daughter of Carl Tyson and Joy White. Judge Castel recommended Pettway serve her sentence in facilities in Danbury, Connecticut, or Tallahassee, Florida, where she could participate in mental health programs. "I would like to apologize to the family," Pettway told U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel. A teary-eyed Joy White told a packed courtroom, "I only spent 19 days with (her daughter) from birth, and those were the most memorable days of my life."
