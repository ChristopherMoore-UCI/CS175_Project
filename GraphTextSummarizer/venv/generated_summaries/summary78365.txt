Iran will sign a final nuclear agreement only if economic sanctions against the nation are removed on the first day of the deal's implementation, President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Islamic republic's supreme leader, meanwhile, told state-run media outlets he is neither in favor nor against the proposed deal because it isn't final, and he's not certain it will become binding because he has "never been optimistic about negotiations with the U.S." Six world powers and Iran reached a preliminary deal last week that aims to limit Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic  sanctions. President Barack Obama faces an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical Congress, which has threatened to impose new sanctions on Iran. "We will not sign any deal unless on the very first day of its implementation all economic sanctions against Iran are lifted all at once," Rouhani said at  a ceremony to mark National Nuclear Technology Day in Tehran. Rouhani said his government would not surrender to bullying, sanctions and threats, according to Press TV.
