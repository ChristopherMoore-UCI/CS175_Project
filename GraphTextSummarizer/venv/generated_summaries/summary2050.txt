It didn't earn a red card and an ejection for Bolivian President Evo Morales, but it was caught on video -- and in this viral world of YouTube, it got him a lot of unwanted attention. Nor did the player in question insult Morales, the mayor is reported to have said. The action unfolded Sunday in game between a team put together by Morales and a squad of city workers from La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. The player he kneed in the groin in a friendly soccer game Sunday had kicked him in the leg and then literally added insult to injury, Morales said at a news conference. Morales said he then went up to the player to remind him that it was only a soccer game but was met with insults and offenses that made him lose his composure.
