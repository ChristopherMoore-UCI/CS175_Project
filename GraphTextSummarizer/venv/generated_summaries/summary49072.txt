Less than three weeks after he announced his surprise abdication, longtime leader Juan Carlos signed the step into law at the royal palace in Madrid, making his son the new king. Flanked by his family and before Spain's Parliament, Felipe VI was formally proclaimed the new King of Spain Thursday, following the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos. In another ceremony held Thursday morning to mark the transfer of power, Juan Carlos took off the red sash signifying his role as head of Spain's military, fastening it around his son's waist. The new King, clad in military uniform, promised to head a changed monarchy "for new times," in an address before the packed parliamentary chamber. Juan Carlos has said Felipe, a former Olympic yachtsman, has "the maturity, the preparation and the sense of responsibility necessary" to serve as king and "to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation."
