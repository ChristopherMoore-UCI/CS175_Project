That included U.S. national team stalwart Landon Donovan, Irish forward Robbie Keane and Beckham. Beckham flicked a header to Keane who passed the ball to Donovan -- who, in turn, sent it past Dynamo goalkeeper Tally Hall. Beckham has been a global soccer icon for years, inspiring the movie, "Bend It Like Beckham" and starring for years with Manchester United, Real Madrid and the English national team. Clubs rumored to have shown interest in him include European teams Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Queens Park Rangers. He's also been a hot item off the field, as the husband of former "Spice Girl" singer and fashionista Victoria Beckham.
