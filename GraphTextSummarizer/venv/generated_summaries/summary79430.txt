Fast facts about ricin "The recipe for it is easily accessible on the Internet," CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said Thursday on "Piers Morgan Live." In short, ricin is a poor choice for someone trying to inflict mass casualties because it must be directly injected or ingested in some way by the victim, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote recently. At least 10 ricin-laced or suspected ricin-laced letters have been sent to government officials in recent weeks, including President Barack Obama. Also, the FBI announced Thursday its agents are looking for a letter sent to the CIA that they believe is similar to other letters, mailed from Spokane, Washington, that contained ricin. This week, authorities were interviewing a man in New Boston, Texas, in connection with ricin-tainted letters sent to Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a person with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
