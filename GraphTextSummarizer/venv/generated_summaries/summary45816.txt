This year's theme of "Power," has "enormous breadth, embracing contradiction and paradox in equal measure that has uncovered images and issues that are both awe-inspiring and disturbing," organizers say. The winner will be announced by Kofi Annan, the awards' honorary president, in October at the opening of the finalists' exhibition of the shortlisted works at the Saatchi Gallery in London. -- Twelve photographers from four continents have been shortlisted for the fourth Prix Pictet award in photography and sustainability.
