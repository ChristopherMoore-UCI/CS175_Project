They knew the context," said Australia coach Robbie Deans. Halfpenny kicked the Lions into a six-point advantage with a further penalty after the interval, but the surges of Wallabies new boy Israel Folau set them up for their decisive try. Lions coach Warren Gatland refused to blame Welshman Halfpenny for his late failure from long range. It was reward for their greater invention and Ashley-Cooper took full advantage from close range. The Lions led 12-9 at halftime, all their points coming from the ever reliable boot of Halfpenny with penalties, his only miss another from distance which struck the crossbar between the posts.
