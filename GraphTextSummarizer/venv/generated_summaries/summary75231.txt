In today's globalized world, where stolen money can be wired instantly from one country to another, we need global action to end corruption. Although a corrupt official or business in Africa may be the one stealing money, those funds often end up in bank accounts and anonymous shell companies based in supposedly reputable financial centers like London, New York and Hong Kong. First, they should require companies to publicize the names of their owners so that anonymous companies can no longer be used to steal the riches of developing countries. According to The ONE Campaign, nearly $1 trillion each year is siphoned out of developing countries through shady deals and money laundering, with sizable amounts of that money ending up in the world's richest countries and offshore tax havens. Indeed, given revelations of government officials from some of Africa's poorest countries owning luxury homes in the United Kingdom, United States and France, it is clear we need strong international transparency laws to help ensure such assets aren't purchased with money stolen from public coffers.
