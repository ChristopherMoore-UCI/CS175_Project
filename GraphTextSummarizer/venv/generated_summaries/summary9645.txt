" Mujahid described an earlier incident in a nearby area when another group of captured police officers were released from Taliban control after pledging not to work for the government again. "We have got documents and evidence that shows all the 50 captured people are policemen and they have also (confessed) during the investigations too," Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN.
