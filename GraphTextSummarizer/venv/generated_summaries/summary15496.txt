Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the past two months. ISIS militants have attacked Kirkuk in northern Iraq, an effort that might be an earnest attempt to capture the key oil-rich city or perhaps to divert Kurdish troops fighting to capture the Islamist extremist group's stronghold of Mosul. For months, ISIS has been facing off with the Peshmerga --  armed fighters who protect Iraqi Kurdistan -- to the west of Kirkuk. Photos posted by ISIS purportedly show the group's militants in control of parts of south and southwest Kirkuk, burning tents that had been used by Peshmerga troops. Peshmerga forces took over the Kirkuk area in June when the Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances and have played a vital role in defending it from ISIS since.
