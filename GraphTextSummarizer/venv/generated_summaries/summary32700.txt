Belvedere Vodka marketing Senior Vice President Jason Lundy posted an apology on the page Friday afternoon, saying the ad also offended "the people who work here at Belvedere." The company's apology included a donation to RAINN -- the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network -- "as an expression of our regret," Gibb said. RAINN posted on its Facebook page that when Gibb called the group he was "profusely apologetic" and "offered to make a generous donation to RAINN to support our work to help victims of sexual violence and educate the public." Company President Charles Gibb added his apology in a posting Saturday. -- Belvedere Vodka executives quickly apologized for an ad posted online that showed a smiling man grabbing a woman, who appeared to be in fear, from behind.
