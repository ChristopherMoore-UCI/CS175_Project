The typical coffee cup simply doesn't work in low gravity, unless you want scalding hot liquid floating through the air. You'll notice a pointed corner in the center of the cup; this strange bit of design is what makes it possible to drink liquids in low gravity. It sounds simple enough, but designing a cup for space requires a deep understanding of how fluids move in low gravity. Drinking a cup of coffee, for example, is a shockingly simple act when you're affected by gravity, yet it's infinitely more difficult once you leave Earth's atmosphere. What Cities Would Look Like if Lit Only by the Stars The project an evolution of Don Petit's low-gravity cup, which he designed on the ISS in 2008 as a means of drinking coffee in something approaching a normal fashion.
