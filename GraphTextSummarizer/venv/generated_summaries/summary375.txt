Obama getting better odds Paddy Power, like most international bookmakers, has Obama as the favorite and Romney as the underdog in Tuesday's election. When you look at election forecasting models that "rely on more economic data and less on polls, the percentage likelihood exceeds the odds that any sports book is giving. In the winter of 2011, Chris, a 23-year old professional poker player, was confident that his candidate, President Barack Obama, would keep control of the White House in November of 2012. In the last few days, possibly looking to take advantage of the odds, a sizable amount of money has been coming in for Romney, according to FÃ©ilim Mac An Iomaire, a spokesperson for Paddy Power. "Given how little is known by non-political scientists about how elections are determined, almost no one has a good idea about the likelihood about one person winning or not," Chris said.
