Last week, monsoon-like conditions overwhelmed southern California, creating flash floods that kept workers at home and businesses and streets knee deep in mud and water. Five homes were destroyed and nearly 75 damaged in the San Bernardino County community of Highland when water and mud rushed through the foothill town last week, authorities said. -- Volunteers flocked to a southern California community to help residents mop up last week's flood damage ahead of what meteorologists are predicting will be more rain. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the storm should be much smaller than the one last week, but that it could dump as much as two inches of rain or two feet of snow in the mountains of California. They laid sandbags in a bid to divert future water flows in preparation for more rainfall, which is expected soon.
