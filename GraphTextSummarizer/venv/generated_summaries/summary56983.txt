Revolutionary fighters had cornered Gadhafi loyalists in the District 2 area of Sirte. Bakeer told Reuters that Gadhafi was wounded with gunshots in his leg and back. Friday, Gadhafi's bloody, battered body lay on a mattress in a Misrata market cold storage room, Reuters reported. The National Transitional Council's leadership says Gadhafi was killed in crossfire between revolutionary fighters and the remnants of loyalists in Sirte. The revolutionaries also took Gadhafi's satellite phone, his brown scarf and one black boot, the Times reported, to keep as ultimate trophies of their victory.
