When the United Nations declared March 20 the International Day of Happiness, it recognized the relevance of "happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world." Maybe if you travel to happy countries with an open mind and a loving heart, you can pick up on that Danish spirit of "hygge," which is sometimes translated too simply as the Danish need for "coziness." If you're up for an adventure, head to Snæfellsjökull National Park to see a glacier on top of a still active volcano (although the last time it erupted was 1,900 years ago). The happiest of countries -- many of which are in Scandinavia according to the most recent World Happiness Report -- have a robust combination of higher life expectancy, gross domestic product per capita, social support, generosity, freedom to make life choices and lower perceptions of corruption. Visitors come from all over Europe to see the different varieties of tulips and other flowers.
