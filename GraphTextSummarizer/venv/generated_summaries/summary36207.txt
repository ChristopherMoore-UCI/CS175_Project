" Opinion: Spanking isn't child abuse; it's common sense Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said Peterson wasn't treated any differently because he is one of the NFL's marquee players. NFL star Adrian Peterson pleaded no contest Tuesday in a Texas court to one count of misdemeanor reckless assault, avoiding jail time for whipping one of his children. Peterson appeared in a Montgomery County court in Conroe after prosecutors and his attorneys reached a plea deal. "I believe that Mr. Peterson is accepting responsibility (for hurting his child)," Ligon said. We cannot provide a timetable," NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said.
