" Such walls were used primarily to defend against marauding desert nomads looking to rob the city, said Reich, a professor at the University of Haifa. The wall is built of enormous boulders, confounding archaeologists as to how ancient peoples built it. "The new discovery shows that the picture regarding Jerusalem's eastern defenses and the ancient water system in the Middle Bronze Age 2 is still far from clear," Reich said. The wall is believed to have been built by the Canaanites, an ancient pagan people who the Bible says inhabited Jerusalem and other parts of the Middle East before the advent of monotheism. "This is the most massive wall that has ever been uncovered in the City of David," Reich and Shukron said in a joint statement about the find.
