Jose de Jesus Mendez Vargas, also known as "The Monkey," is a reputed co-founder and co-leader of the Mexican drug cartel known as "La Familia." He also says he gave the order to kill U.S. consular employee Leslie Enriquez and her husband, Arthur Redelfs, as well as 15 young people at a house party in Mexico's murder capital, Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.

Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, also known as "El Diego," was the reputed leader of "La Linea," a gang of enforcers for the Juarez Cartel in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.
