As expected, the top vote getter in Mexico's presidential election on Sunday was PRI candidate Enrique Peña Nieto. Meanwhile, we'll have to wait and see whether the election of Peña Nieto turns out to be good news for Mexico. Besides, if you listen to what Peña Nieto has been saying in the last several weeks about combating drug violence, it sounds like what the Mexican people typically hear from Calderon. But Mexico's version of Big Media, led by the gargantuan multimedia company Grupo Televisa, has been a big fan of Peña Nieto. Their cozy relationship was one of the things that, in recent weeks, drove hundreds of thousands of student protesters into the streets to protest the candidate's likely election and the fact that the elites who run Mexico seemed to be ramrodding Peña Nieto into office.
