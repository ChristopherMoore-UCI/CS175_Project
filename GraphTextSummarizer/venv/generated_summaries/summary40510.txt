The inspector general says the non-compliance rate could spell trouble when Customs and Border Protection seeks "full compliance" with the law, saying the latter agency does not have the resources to process large numbers of non-compliant travelers through secondary screening. Compliance is lowest at Texas border crossings, where 91 percent of travelers had everything they needed. The report suggests that the threat of slower travel has not led to higher compliance, noting that compliance rates have leveled off over time. The federal Customs and Border Protection agency, though, contends that the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance gradually then to enforce it right away. It sought compliance through a carrot-and-stick approach, by promising the benefit of speedier travel and punishment of secondary screening and travel delays.
