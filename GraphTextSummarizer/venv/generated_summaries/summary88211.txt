The group has also claimed responsibility for numerous attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan, a Justice Department statement said last year. The program is authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has become the subject of scrutiny since disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The government has used such surveillance information for investigative purposes before, but without public notification, according to U.S. officials and lawmakers who have come to the defense of the NSA. "The government intends to offer into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in proceedings ... information obtained or derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978," Friday's court filing said. Government officials say the IJU is known for conducting suicide attacks in Uzbekistan.
