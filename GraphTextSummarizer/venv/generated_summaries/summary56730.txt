Levitan said Istanbul's Africa Cup marked a success for integration of the African community in at least one sector of Turkish society -- football. "There is a sort of double-marginalization that African migrants are confronted with, which is the discrimination and mistreatment that is sometimes directed at them by local populations, combined with a lack of protection from the police or actual violence that is directed at them by the police," said Rachel Levitan, a lawyer and co-founder of the first legal clinic to defend refugee rights in Istanbul. Like many of the players competing in Istanbul's Africa cup, Hamza, the tournament's Nigerian organizer, first came to this city with dreams of breaking into professional Turkish football. More importantly, Hamza said the games offer a chance to better integrate new waves of African immigrants showing up on Istanbul's shores. From the sidelines of the match, where he commanded a team of volunteer security guards with the help of a walkie-talkie, Hamza said he too had been subjected to harassment from Turkish police in the past.
