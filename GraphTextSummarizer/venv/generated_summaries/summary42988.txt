Barca's Josep Guardiola heads the nominees for the Coach of the Year award, alongside Real's Jose Mourinho and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who guided the Red Devils to a record 19th English championship last season. Messi's chip and volley against Arsenal is shortlisted, with Manchester United's Wayne Rooney also nominated for his spectacular overhead kick against arch rivals Manchester City. Ronaldo netted the winning goal as Real beat Barca to clinch last season's Copa del Rey, going on to finish the 2010-11 season as the top goalscorer in Spain. Norio Sasaki is up for the women's award after guiding Japan to their first World Cup triumph in July, with France's Bruno Bini and Sweden coach Pia Sundhage also shortlisted. Messi and Xavi were part of the Barca team which defeated Manchester United 3-1 at London's Wembley stadium in May to become European champions, while the pair also helped the Catalans seal a third consecutive Spanish Primera Liga title.
