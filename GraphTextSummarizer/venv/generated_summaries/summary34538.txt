Syria's UN Representative Bashar al-Jaafari said that humanitarian support to Syrians cannot be carried out correctly and effectively unless actions match words on not politicizing humanitarian issues and unless it goes hand in hand with stopping terrorism, according to SANA. The council strongly condemned Syrian authorities for widespread violations of humanitarian law and urged all parties to lift sieges of populated areas, including in Aleppo, Damascus and Homs. Hoping to ease suffering in Syria's besieged cities, the UN Security Council unanimously passed a resolution to boost access for humanitarian aid. "This resolution holds the promise of something real," U.S. Secretary John Kerry said in a statement. "Russia has backed the resolution when it was agreed upon and became balanced," said Russia's UN Representative Vitaly Churkin, according to the state-run Syrian news agency, SANA.
