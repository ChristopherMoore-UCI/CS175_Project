-- Unmanned aircraft patrolling the nation's borders have an accident rate seven times greater than general aviation aircraft, and hundreds of times greater than the rate of jetliners, federal officials said Thursday in urging caution in expanding the use of pilotless planes. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have proven remarkably useful in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan, but are difficult to integrate into U.S. skies, the most complex airspace in the world, FAA official Nancy Kalinowski said in testimony before a House Homeland Security subcommittee. The accident rate for general aviation aircraft is 7.11 accidents per 100,000 flight hours, and 0.149 accidents for commercial aircraft. But because of the limited data, "the FAA must make conservative decisions" concerning integrating UAVs into U.S. skies, Kalinowski said. Increasingly, government agencies, police departments and private businesses have pushed the FAA for expanded use of UAVs.
