The Vestas Sailrocket 2 is half boat, half plane, and hopefully it will soon to be the fastest sailing vessel on water too. -- Sailor Paul Larsen hopes that 2012 will be the year that he and his team will break the world speed sailing record -- and he believes he has the right contraption to do it. "Everything above the water is an aeroplane and everything below the water behaves just like a boat," says Larsen, a professional sailor who's now turned his attention to breaking the speed sailing record, describing it as his lifetime mission. The record is open to any craft, as long as it's using wind and water, and there is at least one person on board. Last month the team made another record attempt in southern Africa.
