It is a three pronged strategy, Malta said, which includes direct confrontation with criminals, support to governmental bodies who work in the region, and support to the public in the form of health and cultural work. "Our principal objective is to keep our air space from being used (for) illegal activities like drug trafficking and contraband," said Air Force mission commander Jose Geraldo Ferreira Malta. Drug trafficking is minimal," said an army leader, Gen. Joarez Alves Pereira Junior in a statement. -- Nearly 10,000 troops and civilians have been deployed to Brazil's southern border region, in a show of force against illicit traffickers of all kinds who operate in the region, Brazil's defense ministry said. The deployment is the fifth such surge under a mission to reassert rule of law in the border area known as Operation Agatha.
