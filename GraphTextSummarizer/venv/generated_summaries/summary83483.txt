" Opinion: Australian tobacco packaging laws misguided "With Australia's victory, public health enters a brave new world of tobacco control," said Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization. " Tobacco products in Australia must be in plain packaging without logos and have graphic health warnings as of December 1. Health officials around the world hailed the decision by Australia's high court, which stubbed out claims by tobacco companies that the packaging of cigarettes without branding was unconstitutional. Last year the United States unveiled nine graphic health warning labels that must cover half the area of cigarette packages by this September. Canada and 18 other nations require at least 50% of the packaging to contain health warnings.
