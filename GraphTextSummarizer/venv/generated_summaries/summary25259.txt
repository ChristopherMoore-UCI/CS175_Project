Defeat left Getafe just four points above the relegation zone after a poor run while in other La Liga action Sunday fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao lost 2-1 at home to Espanyol. At the start of the season we had problems, but now we are more solid, playing with more confidence and look more natural in our play," said manager Carlo Ancelotti. -- Cristiano Ronaldo may be suspended for three games but Real Madrid made light of his absence by drawing level at the top of La Liga with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid after a 3-0 away win over Getafe Sunday. Ronaldo picked up his ban after being sent off against Athletic Bilbao earlier this month, but it has given his ready made replacement Jese Rodriguez the chance to show his qualities. The midfielder scored the third in the 66th minute as his low shot beat Miguel Angel Moya.
