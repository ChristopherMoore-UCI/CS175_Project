We provide users with notice and control over the collection, sharing and use of location in order to provide a better mobile experience on Android devices. In contrast to Apple, Google's stance on the position is clear: It has been upfront about location data collection from the start. Any location data that is sent back to Google location servers is anonymized and is not tied or traceable to a specific user. As WIRED.com pointed out yesterday, Apple already admitted and explained that it deliberately stores geodata on its mobile devices so the company can collect it to improve location services. Apple says it keeps all this data in its own database, so it can provide you quicker and more precise location services.
