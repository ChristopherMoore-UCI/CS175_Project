-- Aiden O'Brien's superstar colt Camelot added the Irish Derby Saturday to his 2,000 Guineas and English Derby victories earlier this year. Camelot stormed to success in the English Derby earlier this month to put him in contention to become the first horse since Nijinsky to capture the English 'Triple Crown' of Thoroughbred racing: the 2,000 Guineas, the Epsom Derby and the St Leger Stakes. He had the speed to win the Guineas, the class to win the Derby and then he had to have class, courage and stamina to win today. Camelot eyes horse racing immortality O'Brien's gamble of running Camelot looked in doubt when Born To Sea mounted a strong challenge, but the colt dug deep to pull two lengths clear and give the trainer his seventh successive victory in the race. Camelot is also the first horse since High Chaparral in 2002 to complete the Epsom-Curragh Derby double.
