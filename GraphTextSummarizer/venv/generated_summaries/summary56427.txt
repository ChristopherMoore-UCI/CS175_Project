We always hear about hockey as, it's an expensive sport for kids who want to play. I'd go play a little bit of basketball, but after an hour I'd get bored of it, so I'd say, "I have to go play hockey now." And they would go, "Uh, naw, you're not going to make it in hockey, so you might as well play basketball" or something like that. I grew up sort of in an urban neighborhood and, you know, a lot of my friends are playing basketball and sports like that. All my close friends to date were minor hockey players, and their support helped get me to where I am today.
