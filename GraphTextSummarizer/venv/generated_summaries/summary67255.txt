That familiarity with campaigning has caused Iowa voters to look at what Clinton is doing - traveling the country to support Democrats, spending the last week of her midterm campaign in both Iowa and New Hampshire -- and think the former first lady already made up her mind. While speaking in Cedar Rapids, Clinton heralded Iowa's astute voters and the state's focus on politics. Ready for Hillary, the super PAC urging Clinton to run for president and organizing around her possible candidacy, has made the state a focus and put their money behind nearly the entire slate of 2014 Democrats running in Iowa. Hillary Clinton was making her way around the Hamburg Inn on Wednesday -- a quaint, politically historic family restaurant in Iowa City -- when she got the question. To date, the group has donated $123,000 to Iowa candidates, including the Jack Hatch, the gubernatorial hopeful who been consistently polling behind incumbent Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, and all the congressional candidates Ready for Hillary also loomed large at the final Harkin Steak Fry in September, where the group activated more than 100 volunteers for the event.
