Finally, new Dropbox supports drag-and-drop, simple multiple file selections, and keyboard shortcuts (hit "?" for a full list). The first thing you'll notice in the new Dropbox UI is the action bar which lets you sort files by name, date, size and type. According to Dropbox, this redesign is only the first step in a complete overhaul of the service, with more new stuff coming in the "next few months". Dropbox has launched a major redesign, simplifying many file management tasks and bringing a new video and photo viewer. You can also perform these actions by right-clicking on a file, which makes Dropbox more similar to Microsoft's Windows Explorer than ever.
