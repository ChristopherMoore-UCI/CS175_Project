-- Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong tweeted Thursday that he's handed over the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Summer Games, adding that it should be at International Olympic Committee headquarters in Switzerland "asap." The agency, which is designated by Congress as the country's official anti-doping organization for Olympic sports, announced two months later that it was stripping Armstrong of his Tour de France titles and barring him from future competitions for life. His historic rise came at a time when cycling, generally, was mired in repeated doping scandals. Calling himself "deeply flawed," Armstrong admitted that he'd used an array of performance enhancing drugs and took blood transfusions to excel in the highly competitive, scandal-ridden world of professional cycling. The IOC asked for Armstrong's Olympic medal back the same day the first part of the Winfrey interview aired.
