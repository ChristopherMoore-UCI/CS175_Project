SouthernLiving.com: D.C. Travel Planner "He was the best horseman in America," James C. Rees, executive director of Mount Vernon, remarks. At the museum at Mount Vernon, the 45-year-old future president is depicted riding in Valley Forge. "King George III told an associate that if Washington gave up all his power and went back to his farm, he would be the greatest man in the world," James remarks. Today's first President is a well-rounded figure at the expanded visitors center, museum, and education facility at Mount Vernon Estate & Gardens in Virginia. Step around another museum corner and he appears at 45 astride his horse in the snow at Valley Forge.
