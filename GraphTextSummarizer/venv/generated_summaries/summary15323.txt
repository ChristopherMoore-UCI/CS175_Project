During a half hour shuttle journey on Thursday, I met a New York hedge fund manager, the chairman and CEO of Bayer, the VP of a Norwegian bank and many many more fascinating people. This attitude has enabled to me make more contacts than on any other occasion. The beauty of the shuttle is that no one knows anyone, so conversation normally begins with "Are you enjoying Davos? With eye to eye contact and closed doors, they are forced to engage in conversation. I have been taking the shuttle since Saturday, and on each occasion, I have made small talk with the passengers.
