The need to maximize protection of civilians in the face of the unprecedented brutality of internal conflicts -- especially the Spanish Civil War -- was the primary motivation for including fundamental law of war protections for such conflicts in the 1949 Geneva Conventions. -- The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria recently determined that the fighting in Syria is not an "armed conflict" (PDF) -- the legal term for war -- under international law because the opposition forces are not sufficiently organized. International law regulates permissible conduct during war, even civil war. States and other international legal experts are following the same overly technical approach and, as a result, not applying the law designed for just this situation: the law of war. Yet surely the protesters, dissident fighters and terrified citizens caught up in the violence in Syria believe they are at war.
