The wicketkeeper is also labeled as a "back-stabber" by Pietersen, for revealing details of a supposedly confidential team meeting during the Australia tour. Who doesn't enjoy the sight of two men who should know better -- Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger -- shoving each other on the sidelines during an English Premier League match? Jose Mourinho vs. Arsene Wenger These two great rivals haven't seen eye to eye almost from the day Mourinho pitched up at Chelsea from Portuguese football in 2004. The man referred to by fans as "KP" has waited a long time to have his say on his sacking from the England cricket team after a disastrous tour to Australia. Their first spat centered on Wenger's criticism of Chelsea's lavish spending under billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich, Mourinho hitting back by calling his opposite number a "voyeur." Chelsea's boss later claimed he had a dossier on things Wenger had said about his club, hinting at legal action.
