According to court documents, Dawari neglected to document his association with HIG in a 2013 application for U.S. citizenship. These two very different images of Dawari emerged after he appeared Friday in federal court in Philadelphia on immigration fraud charges. Court papers described HIG as a "violent, anti-western terrorist group ... affiliated with al Qaida, and it has claimed responsibility for many attacks against U.S. and coalition forces." Dawari, 62, who pleaded not guilty Friday, was ordered held without bail. But in the eyes of the United States government, Dawari has been working with an anti-Western insurgent group in Afghanistan with ties to al Qaeda. The court case stems from charges of immigration fraud.
