Aviation teams that flew over parts of Long Island had "identified a significant number of items that aren't natural for the area," Nassau County Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter said last Thursday. -- As they worked to determine if new bones found off Long Island, New York, were human -- and possibly those of victims of a suspected serial killer believed to have targeted sex workers -- tests were underway Monday to match up identities with at least four other sets of discovered remains. Last week, police discovered skeletal remains -- including the human skull -- prompting the wider search. Now, "the DNA process is underway" on at least five other sets of remains found in and around nearby beaches in the time since, New York City medical examiner's office spokeswoman Ellen Borakove said Monday. The remains include a skull and bones found as recently as last week in Nassau County, as well as a bone fragment of unknown origin found by divers off the Oak Beach area last Friday.
