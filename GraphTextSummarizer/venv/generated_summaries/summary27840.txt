As a self-made businessman turned Jakarta governor, Widodo would be the first president without a connection to the military or the country's traditional elite. He rose to become Jakarta governor in 2012, where he piloted new healthcare and education programs. Most voters "have aspirations for a strong leader who will turn Indonesia to have a stronger position in Asia," said Wijayanto Samirin, managing director of Paramadina Public Policy Institute, a Jakarta think tank. Prabowo has denied allegations, while human rights activists say he has not been held to account for his alleged actions. But critics say Widodo is too inexperienced and hasn't finished his work in Jakarta after only 18 months in the governor's office.
