As one of the series' most essential characters -- both for his centrality to the story and because of the welcome balance he brings -- it's hard to imagine Tyrion meeting this unjust fate, but "men meeting unjust fates" could be another tagline for "Game of Thrones. As for Jon Snow, he's "focused on being a leader" when episode 10 picks up, Harington teased to Elle magazine. " On "Game of Thrones," "exciting" can also be a stand-in for "bloody" and "heartbreaking," and chances are Harington's tease will just make fans more nervous for season four's final hour. You know that you're not supposed to see them, but there's nothing you want more." Basically, Jon Snow couldn't quit Ygritte, kind of like how we can't quit "Game of Thrones" no matter how many heads explode. Show runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss have already promised that Sunday's season closer will be the series' best yet, and Kit Harington -- aka Jon Snow -- is making that same bet.
