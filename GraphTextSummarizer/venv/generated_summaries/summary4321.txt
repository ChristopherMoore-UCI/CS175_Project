-- Iraqi President Jalal Talabani will travel to Germany for medical treatment, Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said Wednesday. Two months later, Talabani left for medical tests and to lose weight, his office said. In February 2007, he fell ill and was flown to Jordan for treatment, and there were conflicting reports about what prompted his hospitalization. Talabani's doctor and a spokesman for the president's office said then that he was suffering from exhaustion and lung inflammation, and underwent tests they described as precautionary. Talabani was rushed to a Baghdad hospital Monday night in deteriorating health because of hardening of his arteries, his office told the media.
