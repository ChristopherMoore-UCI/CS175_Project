For example, during Bhutto's time in office, Pakistan didn't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws. In the days after Benazir Bhutto's assassination, it will be tempting to reach two hasty conclusions: that she was Pakistan's last great hope and that her geo-politically crucial country has revealed itself to be  inherently hopeless. The United States lapsed into profound divisiveness following the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. While far more liberal and democratic than Gen. Musharraf, Bhutto disappointed moderate, modern Pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist.
