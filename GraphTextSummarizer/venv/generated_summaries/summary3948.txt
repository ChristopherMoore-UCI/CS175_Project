On October 19, a kindergarten girl died and another was seriously injured after an Israeli settler ran over them -- deliberately, according to the official Palestinian news agency, WAFA -- near a village north of the West Bank city of Ramallah. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld called the incident an apparent "intentioned event" and terror attack. Reprisal attacks, rocket fire and retaliatory airstrikes followed. Israeli police say they are investigating. Tensions have remained high in the region after the bodies of three Israeli teenagers were found in the West Bank in June.
