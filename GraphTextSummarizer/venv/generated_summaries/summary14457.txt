Mikaela Shiffrin Teen sensation Shiffrin blasted onto the scene last season to become the youngest World Cup slalom champion since 1974. Vonn had hoped to be back for the new World Cup ski season, which begins in the Austrian resort of Soelden this weekend, but the Olympic gold medalist and four time overall world champion will not be able to take part as she continues her comeback from a serious knee injury. The 28-year-old Vonn had started the Alpine season chasing Annemarie Moser-Proll's record number of World Cup victories, after making a promising start with wins in Lake Louise. After taking the World Cup titles in both last season, he'll be sizing up the course in Sochi which has been generating buzz for the sheer size of its jumps and long, hard terrain -- a suitable gauntlet for this Norwegian pillar. In April she ended the year as the world's No. 1 female skier, wiping the board as the overall World Cup champion with 11 victories and a record 2414 points.
