Fatmire "Lira" Bajramaj won the corner kick which clinched Germany's World Cup title in China in 2007, and the 22-year-old is hoping to shine again when Germany hosts the FIFA Women's World Cup in June and July this year. Bajramaj already has an Olympic bronze medal under her belt, is an under-19 European Champion and a World Cup champion -- but she says she's not done yet. -- She is the star of Germany's female soccer scene. "The girls and I heard the World Cup was coming to Germany and we talked about it constantly, it was like a fairytale for us." Her parents fled to Germany when she was just 4 years old.
