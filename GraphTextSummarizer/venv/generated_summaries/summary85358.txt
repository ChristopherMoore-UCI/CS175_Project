Spieth, who lit up the Masters where he finished in a tie for second earlier this year, had not dropped a shot all week on the challenging TPC Sawgrass course but came unstuck at the fifth hole Sunday where he carded his first bogey. -- Martin Kaymer overcame adverse weather and fading light to secure his first tour triumph since 2011 at The Players Championship at TCP Sawgrass. The 29-year-old German was on the 14th green and three shots ahead of second-placed Jim Furyk at 15-under-par when play was suspended due to heavy rain and thunder late on Sunday. But he was clawed back by the young American, Jordan Spieth, on Saturday and the pair started level on Sunday at 13-under-par. The Australian required at least a top 16 finish to become world No. 1 this week but will now likely claim the top spot next week without playing due to the way the rankings are calculated.
