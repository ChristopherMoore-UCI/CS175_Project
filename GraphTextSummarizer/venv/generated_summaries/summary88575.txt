It left him 14 seconds adrift of reigning Tour de France champion Contador ahead of a difficult final day in the south of France. -- Cervelo's Xavier Tondo won the toughest stage of this year's Paris-Nice cycling classic as Alejandro Valverde finished second to ratchet up the pressure on race leader and their fellow Spaniard Alberto Contador. Sunday's final leg is a 119km stage based around Nice with several tough climbs where Contador has predicted he will seal his final victory. Young Slovakian Peter Sagan, who claimed his second stage win of the race in dramatic style pm Friday, finished third to retain the green jersey of points leader. He now leads Benoit Vaugrenard of France by 18 seconds in the overall classification.
