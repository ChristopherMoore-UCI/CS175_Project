Patients are now being told they will have to wait until the government starts up again to begin their trials, according to NIH spokesman John Burklow. Burklow also said patients in desperate need of treatment will be handled differently and will more than likely be seen by physicians or nurses at the NIH Clinical Center. Researchers at other institutions who have received NIH grants are not affected by the government shutdown. Every week, hundreds of patients like Langbehn are admitted to new clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health. "Due to the lapse in government funding ... transactions submitted via the web site may not be processed, and the agency may not be able to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted," a message on the top of the NIH website states.
