Dr. Paolo Macchiarini, director of the Advanced Center for Translational Regenerative Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, performed Warren's operation on April 9. Macchiarini told the Times Sunday that he plans to continue with similar operations, including one he is performing this week in Stockholm. Children make ideal patients for regenerative procedures, since they are naturally better than adults at healing and growing new tissue. Stem cells are able to develop into different types of body cells and are great at adapting to a new environment. In the months after surgery, Warren's new trachea was doing well, the family wrote, but her lungs continued to deteriorate.
