The transit center said investigators are determining the cause of the crash and emergency responders were on the scene Kyrgyz Prime Minister Jantoro Satybaldiev held an emergency meeting in connection with the crash, state media reported. An American military refueling plane took off and crashed in Kyrgyzstan on Friday, Kyrgyz and U.S. officials said. The plane crashed in a mountainous area between Chorgolu and Cholok-Aryk -- two villages in the Chuysky region of northern Kyrgyzstan, and a fire crew and three ambulances responded, Elmira Shyrypova, at the Kyrgyz Emergencies Ministry press office. The plane was a U.S. Air Force KC-135 tanker aircraft, according to the expeditionary wing's Public Affairs Transit Center at Manas, near Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The Manas transit center is a U.S. airbase that serves as a supply hub for American forces in Afghanistan.
