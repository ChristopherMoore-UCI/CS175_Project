The issue of equipment shortages for British troops has been simmering for years. -- The person who leaked British lawmakers' controversial expense claims earlier this year, triggering a national scandal, was motivated by outrage at apparent equipment shortages for British troops, a newspaper said Friday. The mole was angry at apparent equipment shortages for British troops deployed around the world. The father-in-law, Stephen Minter, wrote a letter to Brown detailing what he believed to be a lack of equipment for British troops. Hearing the soldiers' stories while at the same time looking through what were revealed as excessive claims made by lawmakers, prompted the mole to take action, the newspaper said.
