-- At least 24 people were killed early Sunday when militants raided a Sunni town in northern Yemen, medics and witnesses said. "The movement has more than 100,000 fighters ready to obey commands from their spiritual leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi," said Ahmed Bahri, an expert in Houthi affairs. The attacks come a day after Yemen's vice president called for presidential elections to be held in February, state media reported. Sectarian violence is at peak in northern Yemen where Houthis control is spread across five provinces. The Houthi Shia militants raided a Sunni town in Sa'ada in the predawn hours, medics said.
