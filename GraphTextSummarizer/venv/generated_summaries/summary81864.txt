Police discovered Cachay, whose designs had been considered a celebrity favorite, at the Soho House club and hotel, according to a New York police spokesman who declined to be named, citing agency policy. The office will provide more details surrounding Cachay's death "pending toxicology and tissue testing, which would take a few weeks," said spokeswoman Grace Burgess. The elder Brooks was indicted on multiple counts of sexual assault earlier this year, according to New York Supreme court documents. "Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke," said publicist Kate Godici. -- The boyfriend of a 33-year-old swimsuit designer, whose bruised body was found in a bathtub at an exclusive New York hotel on Thursday, has been charged in her death, officials said.
