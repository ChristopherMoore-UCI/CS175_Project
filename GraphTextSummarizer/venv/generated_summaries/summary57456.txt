-- Former New England Patriot player Aaron Hernandez was transported from his Massachusetts jail cell to a nearby hospital this weekend, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson. Hernandez has since returned to Bristol County House of Correction, where he awaits a trial on first-degree murder charges in the June 2013 death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. Hodgson was unable to disclose why Hernandez was admitted to the hospital because of federal health privacy law, except to say that it was not caused by a fight, security issue or any other problem at the jail. Prosecutors allege Hernandez orchestrated the killing of Lloyd, whose body was found in a remote spot at an industrial park about a mile from the former Patriots player's home. The two were shot to death in what prosecutors described as an ambush as they drove on a Boston street following a "chance encounter" with Hernandez at a lounge.
