The following two days, on May 18 and 19, Hollande will attend the G8 at Camp David and then on to the NATO summit in Chicago, where the French president will announce the earlier withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan, an announcement which should not please the U.S. administration and Nato allies. If the street celebrations lasted till dawn in the streets of France, however, the honeymoon shouldn't last very long for  Hollande, who was already on the phone to German chancellor Angela Merkel an hour after being elected. With 51.7% of the votes, the Socialist candidate Fran√ßois Hollande won a neat victory, albeit not a large one. And it is precisely what a majority of French people want to hear at present. Besides, Hollande doesn't need being convinced that Germany is France's most important ally.
