Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches, mosques and civilians. Troops from Niger and Chad discovered a mass grave with more than 90 decomposed bodies near a northern Nigerian town recently retaken from the Islamic militant group Boko Haram, security sources from both countries said Friday. Borno is in the northeast corner of Nigeria and borders Niger, Chad and Cameroon. The group, its naming meaning "Western education is forbidden," has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria. Troops from Niger and Chad took back the town from Boko Haram last week during a joint operation, the security sources said.
