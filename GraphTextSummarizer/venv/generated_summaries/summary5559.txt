" The simple act of walking to school "engineers three to five miles a week, so you don't have to worry about gym class and you get people moving," said Buettner whose project finds the best practices in healthy communities to apply to U.S. cities. After spending five years, he wrote a book identifying five cities where people enjoyed longer and healthier lives. In Albert Lea, they banned junk food snacking in schools, started walking school buses, organized community-walking groups and identified the most socially influential people to spread healthy habits. Andrea Soto, an employee at a call center called AAMCOM in Redondo Beach, said health issues at work also should be addressed. The three-year project ended with an average weight loss of about three pounds, extended life expectancy of three years and a 40% drop in health care costs for the city.
