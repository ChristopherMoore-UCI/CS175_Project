In an exclusive extended clip from the first installment of Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit" trilogy, pop culture's beloved hobbit (as played by Martin Freeman) is seen overhearing an intense debate between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Elrond (Hugo Weaving). -- Eavesdropping isn't cool --- unless, of course, you're Bilbo Baggins trying to get the scoop on the dastardly dragon Smaug. "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Bilbo Baggins is drawn into a dangerous mission to reclaim the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the beastly Smaug. This year's second part, "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," arrives in theaters December 13, with the final installment, "The Hobbit: There and Back Again," opening December 17, 2014. Led by the warrior Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Baggins teams with a group of 13 dwarves on a quest that pits them against a host of foes, from goblins to giant spiders.
