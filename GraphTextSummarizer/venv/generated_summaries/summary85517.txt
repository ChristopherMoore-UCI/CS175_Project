South African journalist and author Fred Khumalo says most South Africans can't afford to buy books and there is no culture of reading for leisure. New publisher Nollybooks is taking chick-lit and adapting it for a South African audience, with a series of romance novels by, and for, young black women. Makura said the aim was to make reading entertaining and fun -- quite a challenge in South Africa, where she says the commonly held perception is that books are purely educational. "I was really trying to evoke girl power, an independent woman's message, because a lot of women in Africa have a strong sense of marriage and family and I felt it important for women to know that they didn't have to become that person and that it's okay to be single. When it came to starting her own publishing company, she made it her mission to get young women reading again.
