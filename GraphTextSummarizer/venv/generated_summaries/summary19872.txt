But the majority of Robin Hood funds have been devoted to housing, one of the largest and most critical areas of need across the tri-state area. Robin Hood was honored to be entrusted with these funds, and we have since distributed the entire proceeds from the concert to almost 400 organizations across the tri-state area. We continue to accept donations at the Robin Hood Fund and are encouraged by the fact that dozens of other relief organizations are still on the front lines helping. And without shelter, storm victims have an even harder time getting back on their feet. Generous concert donors -- hailing from all 50 states and more than 90 countries -- gave $51 million to help organizations working on the front lines of the disaster.
