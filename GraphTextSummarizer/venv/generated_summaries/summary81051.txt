Less than a week after a judge in Rock Hill righted a wrong of the Jim Crow era, someone used  white spray paint to scrawl "Happy N***er Month KKK" on the rock outside the city's South Pointe High School, an apparent reference to the start of Black History Month. "We wanted to replace it with something positive." Rock Hill police officers reviewed school surveillance video but it was so "dark and grainy," they were not able to identify any potential suspects in the vandalism, Capt. "I wanted the students to stop texting and tweeting and blogging that image," said visual arts teacher Ashley Beard. "Kids all over the country were going to school -- demonstrating in the afternoon, after school, in the mornings, and then being arrested, then paying the fine and we weren't making any progress," Friendship Nine member Clarence Graham told CNN. After writing a book about the Friendship Nine, a local children's author urged 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett to seek a pardon for the men.
