In order to address all these threats, Fey said, the industry needs to rethink security from the ground up, designing more secure products from the start instead of just constantly chasing threats. But McAfee's worldwide chief technology officer, Mike Fey, warns against looking at the the number of threats targeting Android and assuming that other platforms are safer. The latest threat report from security firm McAfee highlights the need for vigilance on mobile devices and a change in how people and companies approach security. The current approach of discovering threats, then fighting them, has to change, according to Fey; he called it "a thousand percent unsustainable. " New threats are popping up constantly, creating a never-ending game of security whack-a-mole.
