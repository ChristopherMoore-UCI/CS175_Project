The headlines alone tell the story: • 11/18/13: Obamacare Mess Defines GOP 2014 Campaign Strategy (The Fiscal Times) • 1/31/14: Republicans turn up IRS rhetoric as elections loom (Politico) • 3/21/14: Republicans Double Down on Obamacare for 2014 (Time) • 5/08/14: House GOP pursue Benghazi inquiry going into midterm campaigns (PBS) • 5/27/14: House Vote on Former I.R.S Official Signals Element of GOP Election Strategy (New York Times) • 8/24/14: Republicans Shift Focus To Immigration As Leading Election Issue (Huffington Post) • 9/23/14: Republicans think the Islamic State is their winning issue (Washington Post) And they will remember the standout moment from this Congress: that House Republicans, who could not work together with other lawmakers on solutions, went for a shutdown instead. Instead, House Republicans have been focused on anything but strengthening the middle class. In the 114th Congress, House Democrats will continue our focus on the Middle Class Jumpstart agenda, a plan built on the pillars of investing in infrastructure, making college more affordable and ensuring equal pay for equal work. Boehner and leading Republicans have said over and over that this election is about: the IRS, the Affordable Care Act, Benghazi, immigration -- and the list goes on.
