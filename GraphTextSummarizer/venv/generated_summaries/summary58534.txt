For now, Facebook Deals is only being offered in five cities: Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; San Diego, California, and San Francisco, California. "While many Deals on Facebook offer discounts, it's more important to us that you find interesting experiences around you to do with friends," Facebook's Emily White writes on Facebook's blog. The integration with Facebook is what the site sees as key: "A lot of deal sites get that deals are social," White told The New York Times' Bits Blog. Facebook Deals aims to make the idea of digital coupons more social. Some, such as Scoutmob, are mobile deals based on a person's location, and offer deals on nearby restaurants, spas or other services.
