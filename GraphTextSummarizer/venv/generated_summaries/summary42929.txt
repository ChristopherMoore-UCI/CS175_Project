For astronaut Jose Hernandez, his first space flight, scheduled to be aboard the space shuttle Discovery, marks a remarkable journey from the farm fields of California to the skies. Hernandez earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering, and before joining NASA worked on a number of high-tech projects, including an X-ray laser to be deployed in space, a digital mammography system and the disposal of excess nuclear material in Russia, his official biography states. As a child, Hernandez's family split their time between Mexico and California, where they worked as migrant farm workers. Astronaut Jose Hernandez is an American-born son of immigrants from Michoacan, Mexico. "I come from a very humble family and what I would call a typical migrant farm working family," Hernandez said in a NASA interview.
