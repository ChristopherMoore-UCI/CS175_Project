"We believe the protection ought to be comprehensive, and we don't believe the Republicans' bill does that." He joined a number of House Democrats who urged their colleagues to vote against the bill prior to the floor vote on Wednesday. Vice President Joe Biden reacted to Wednesday's vote by saying the House-passed version of the bill "will roll back critical provisions to help victims of abuse." House Republican leaders, meanwhile, accused Democrats of creating a phony fight for political gain. The White House late Tuesday threatened to veto the House GOP bill, in part because it "fails to include language that would prohibit discrimination against LGBT victims." Human Rights Watch released a report Wednesday showing immigrant farmworkers are especially at risk for domestic abuse and argued provisions in the Senate bill -- not the House version -- "would go some way toward fixing the problem and should be enacted." House Republicans oppose those changes, saying they are unnecessary because the law already covers all victims, and instead favor a narrower version of renewing the law. "This is another one of the Democrat gimmicks that goes on around here," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a recent news conference.
