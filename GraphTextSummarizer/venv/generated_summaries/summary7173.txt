He says the street culture vibe is "very unpredictable and evolving rapidly" because people are realizing how self-expression can be used "as a weapon to shoot your voice for the world to hear." Smarteez, and other street culture movements, are giving voice to a new generation, Mngomezulu said. Last year, Swedish filmmakers Teddy Goitom and Benjamin Taft traveled to Cape Town and Johannesburg in search of a different scene, one which steered clear of the "media stereotypes of violence, AIDS and safaris. -- Arcade game-inspired fashionistas mixing with heavy metal bands grinding out tunes on street corners sounds like a scene you might find in New York's trendier locales. Stocktown X: South Africa is the latest in a series of documentaries in which Goitom and Taft have explored underground urban music scenes in Japan, Australia and Brazil and the United States. " The result is "Stocktown X: South Africa," an uplifting and colorful 30-minute documentary which gives a snapshot of the exciting youth scene in some of Cape Town and Johannesburg's poorest districts.
