For the first time, newly unsealed court documents reveal police directly suggested that former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez may have pulled the trigger in an unsolved Boston double homicide in July 2012. Hernandez, 24, was indicted for first-degree murder and weapons charges by a different grand jury in August  2013, in the shooting death of his friend Odin Lloyd. But as as CNN has previously reported, a grand jury has been looking into whether Hernandez played a role in the drive-by shooting, according to law enforcement sources. The warrant was used to search a Toyota 4Runner linked to Hernandez that, according to court documents, was seen at the scene of the crime by witnesses the night of the murders. The vehicle was recovered at Hernandez' uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut.
