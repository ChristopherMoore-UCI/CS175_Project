Havard is the co-founder of Timeless Entertainment Concepts, host of PlayDate, with Ryan Hill and Ronald Gaither. " Back on the dance floor, Havard narrates a game of musical chairs. "I mean, where else in the world would you see 30- and 40-year-olds playing musical chairs at midnight?" A lot of people have on their nightclub personas, so you don't get to know real people. While Gaither takes care of the legal and administrative aspects, Hill and Havard attend events and deal with affiliates.
