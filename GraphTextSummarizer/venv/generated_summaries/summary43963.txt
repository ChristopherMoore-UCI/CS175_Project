Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, told The Plain Dealer in May that the family had concluded that Michelle had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her then-2-year-old son. "Sometimes she would cry, and I'd tell her everything would be OK, and that one day we'll get home," Knight told McGraw. "I want my son to know me as a victor, not a victim," Knight told host Dr. Phil McGraw. Castro lured Knight into his vehicle from a Family Dollar store in Cleveland in 2002, promising to give her a ride. "When you realize what she went through, it makes everything else seem so trivial." 'It's God's will if you die' Knight said she remembered the warning, the one Castro delivered while wrapping a chain around her neck and shackling her to a metal pole in the basement of his Cleveland home.
