-- A Pakistani court Tuesday indicted President Pervez Musharraf, charging him with murder in the death of the country's first female prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. "The politically motivated indictment... is not only false, fabricated and fictitious, but is also an undignified attempt to smear the honor and integrity of the former president on the world stage," Musharraf spokesman Raza Bokhari said in a statement. After the assassination, Musharraf's government blamed former Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, saying he had paid a network of Islamist militants to carry out the killing. Musharraf was president and military chief at the time, and Bhutto was a leading opposition figure. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets.
