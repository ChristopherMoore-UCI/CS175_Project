-- Very few things will make my skin crawl more than listening to someone totally misrepresent the famous "I Have A Dream" speech the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave on August 28, 1963. King then began to talk about the "fierce urgency of now," laying out the treacherous conditions upon which black people lived in, and having to deal with violence and the trampling of their rights. Second, we continue to misrepresent King's speech as the "I Have a Dream" speech. Then King launches into the portion about his "dream." Folks, the fulfillment of King's dream wasn't about getting along. Instead, folks -- especially those who likely would have branded King a Communist, a socialist, a Marxist or a racial hell-bent on destroying America -- love to tout King's "content of character" line in order to push back against a variety of issues, especially affirmative action.
