"Mr. Sharper must stay in Los Angeles County," the judge said. Sharper also is under investigation in Arizona, Louisiana and Nevada in connection with a total of five alleged rape cases in those states, according to Los Angeles authorities. Former NFL star Darren Sharper pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles court Thursday in the alleged druggings and rapes of two women. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Stacy Okun-Wiese said in court that Sharper is also being investigated in sexual battery case in a fifth state, in Miami Beach, Florida. Berk has said that she is "hopeful that before the case is concluded that Mr. Sharper will be exonerated." Leonard Levine, another of Sharper's attorneys, indicated his client would post his residence and his father's residence for the $1 million bail.
