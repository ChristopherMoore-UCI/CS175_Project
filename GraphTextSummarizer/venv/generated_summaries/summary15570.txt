Syrian opposition activists and rebel commanders say both the tempo and accuracy of airstrikes have increased since government forces began using them -- and they point to Iran as the source of the equipment. Wednesday, Russian-built MiG jets pounded targets in the Damascus suburbs, near the port of Latakia and around the cities of Deir Ezzor and Idlib, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Syria is Iran's leading ally in the region. They're accompanied by training manuals emblazoned with the image of Iran's revolutionary leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Islamic republic has said it doesn't supply military aid to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which is battling a 19-month-old revolt, but Iran hasn't commented on the drone allegations.
