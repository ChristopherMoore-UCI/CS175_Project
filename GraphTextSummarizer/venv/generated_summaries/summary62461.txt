"Rock-writer Paul S Williams, author and creator of CRAWDADDY magazine, (and my husband), passed away last night 10:30 pm PST while his oldest son was holding his hand and by his side," Berryhill wrote on Facebook. -- Paul Williams, who founded the groundbreaking music magazine Crawdaddy as a 17-year-old student in 1966, has died, according to his wife, singer Cindy Lee Berryhill. After Dick's death, Williams began the Philip K. Dick Society and edited its newsletter, which became famous as well, according to Williams' website. The magazine soon published writers such as Jon Landau, now Bruce Springsteen's manager and confidant; Sandy Pearlman, who produced Blue Oyster Cult; and Richard Meltzer.
