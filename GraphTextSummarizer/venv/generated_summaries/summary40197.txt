Other nominees include Gitane Restaurant in San Francisco; Mie N Yu Restaurant in Washington; Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel in Chicago; Da Marino Ristorante Italiano in New York; Buc-ee's in New Braunfels, Texas; and Lane Stadium/Worsham Field at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. There are changing tables in bathrooms for both men and women and smaller toilets and sinks for younger visitors. While Buc-ee's and Radisson are Cintas customers, the company says that doesn't have any impact on the results: Members of the general public vote for the finalists online and determine the winner by popular vote. "People come in for our dinosaurs, mummies and gems, and last year, they were coming here for our bathrooms," says Field Museum spokeswoman Emily Waldren, who reports that a plaque describing the award has been discreetly placed outside the ground floor bathroom. These locales are among the public restroom facilities nominated for the 11th Annual Cintas' America's Best Restroom awards.
