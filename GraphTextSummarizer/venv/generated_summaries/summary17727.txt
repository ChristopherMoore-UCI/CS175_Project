"In cancer -- which is always unfortunate -- Ashley is fortunate that she had a form of cancer that was slow-growing and wasn't going to be altered by the course of pregnancy and could be managed," Scott said. According to the National Cancer Institute, thyroid cancers are a highly curable form of cancer, with an overall survival rate of 97.5% over a five-year period. As a result, Ashley wanted to wait until after the babies were born at 30 weeks to undergo cancer surgery. Six weeks after her cesarean section and nearly one month after cancer surgery, Ashley is recovering and the babies are growing. But their surprise turned to fear when doctors diagnosed 24-year-old Ashley with thyroid cancer four months into her pregnancy.
