State law requires county elections officials to report final vote tallies by July 6. California Secretary of State Debra Bowen then has until July 13 to certify the results. Initial results showed Prop 29 being rejected by a margin of roughly 65,000 votes, out of nearly 4 million cast -- a margin of 50.8% to 49.2%. "We've asked counties to report their number of unprocessed ballots, but it's voluntary, so there's no way to know the exact number," said Allie Schembra, a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's office. However, the results don't yet include a vast number of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots.
