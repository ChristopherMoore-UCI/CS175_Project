A state appeals court Friday upheld an involuntary manslaughter conviction against Johannes Mehserle, a former San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer who shot and killed 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland. This case has been controversial in California's Bay Area community for years. Mehserle was accused of fatally shooting Grant on New Year's Day 2009 on a platform of a Bay Area Rapid Transit station. He was sentenced to two years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter conviction, but was released last year because of a California law that allowed him to reduce his sentence to nearly a year. "We disagree with defendant's contentions and affirm the judgment of conviction," wrote the three-judge panel of the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco.
