Watch new suicide tactics in Iraq Â» Four U.S. soldiers died at the scene Monday's Baghdad blast and one more died later of wounds, the military said. Earlier, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said one person was killed and eight people were wounded in a suicide bomb attack targeting a U.S. military convoy in western Baghdad. A roadside bomb exploded on a highway near a U.S. military patrol in eastern Baghdad, wounding two bystanders. Monday's attacks would bring the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq this month to 10. Several U.S. troops may have been sickened by dirty water intended for hygiene use and supplied to bases around Iraq between 2004 and 2006, according to a Pentagon report released Monday.
