Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that "George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and, during the course of the altercation, he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall. On Wednesday, the first full day with testimony, Huguely's attorney asked the jury to consider only an involuntary manslaughter conviction, saying Love's death was an accident. When he went into a nearby bedroom, Burns testified that he saw Huguely with his arm around Love's neck. Chapman also told jurors that Love's death was slow and painful, claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. " But defense attorney Francis Lawrence said there was no evidence that Love's head hit a wall.
