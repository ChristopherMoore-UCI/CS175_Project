New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg described Lumet as "one of the great chroniclers" of New York City because his films often used the city as both settting and a figurative character. -- Film director Sidney Lumet, who made the American classics "12 Angry Men," "Network," "Serpico," "Dog Day Afternoon" and "The Verdict," died Saturday morning in his New York City home. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including best director, "Network" won four Oscars: best actor for Peter Finch, best actress for Faye Dunaway, best original screenplay for Paddy Chayefsky and best supporting actress for Beatrice Straight. In a statement, Grammy Award-winning producer and composer Quincy Jones said Lumet gave him his start in film composing in 1963 with "The Pawnbroker." With Al Pacino as the lead actor, Lumet's "Serpico" delved into one cop's struggle against the seemingly insurmountable corruption in the New York City police department.
