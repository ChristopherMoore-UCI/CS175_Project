We are, I believe, likely to see "peak population" by about mid-century. But the real story is that rich or poor, Muslim or Catholic, secular or devout, socialist or capitalist, with tough government birth control policies or none, most countries tell the same story. But if Africa follows Asia, then we can see an end to population growth. Well, peak population is good news, of course. So there is no way halting population growth in the poor world today would have more than a very marginal effect on climate change.
