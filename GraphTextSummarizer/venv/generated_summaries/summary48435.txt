Just 15 minutes or so from downtown Seattle is Discovery Park, a 534-acre protected oasis of natural beauty. But the 103-year-old market survives not just from the tourists but also because legions of Seattle residents keep coming back for the amazingly fresh seafood and produce. In reality, Seattle rain is more of a constant drizzle. Friends who say they don't care for the fishy flavor of salmon do not recognize the taste of the fresh fish you eat in Seattle. The first time I went there, I remember going kayaking and seeing killer whales hunting for salmon just off shore.
