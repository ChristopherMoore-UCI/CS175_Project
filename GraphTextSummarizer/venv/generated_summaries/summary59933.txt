Earlier, American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith said that no explosive material or devices were found on board the plane. "Out of an abundance of caution, local law enforcement and EOD (explosive ordnance disposal, or a bomb squad) arrived on scene to inspect. The flight had 169 passengers and 11 crew members on board, Smith said. He said that empty fuse holders were found and described them as like a fuse but not an explosive device. -- An American Airlines plane was searched and cleared at Miami's airport Monday after a "suspicious item" was identified in its cargo hold
