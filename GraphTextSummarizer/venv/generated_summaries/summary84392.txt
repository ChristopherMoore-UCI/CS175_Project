Having taken a long break between albums -- it's been three years since the last set, "Louder Now" -- the Long Island, New York, rock band is signaling a fresh outlook with its fourth album. Taking Back Sunday's new album, "New Again," came out last week. Out last week, it's called "New Again." Matt Rubano: We try to approach everything with our way of doing things and our sense of humor so that it's not uncomfortable. But now after that little break and since we've been doing everything that we've been doing now with "New Again" coming out, I haven't started hating any of you guys yet.
