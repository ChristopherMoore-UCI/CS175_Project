-- Dr. George Tiller, whose Kansas women's clinic frequently took center stage in the U.S. debate over abortion, was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his Wichita church Sunday morning, police said. The National Organization for Women, which supports abortion rights, called Tiller's killing an act of "domestic terrorism." See what people are saying about Dr. Tiller's murder Â» Tiller's slaying drew condemnation from supporters, from some of those who tried to shut down his practice and from President Obama, who just two weeks ago urged Americans to seek "common ground" on the issue of abortion. " If Tiller was killed because of his work, he would be the fourth U.S. physician killed over abortion since 1993. Wichita police said a 51-year-old man from the Kansas City, Kansas, area was in custody in connection with the slaying of Tiller, who was one of the few U.S. physicians who still performed late-term abortions.
