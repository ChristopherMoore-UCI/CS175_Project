In 1993, when he was 12, Vargas came to the United States from the Philippines with a man he'd never met but whom his aunt and a family friend introduced as his uncle, Vargas wrote in his 2011 New York Times Magazine column. Asked how it was possible that he didn't know he would get extra scrutiny at the border airport, Jose Antonio Vargas told CNN's "New Day" that he didn't anticipate being detained in McAllen, Texas, after visiting a shelter where undocumented immigrant children were being held. Vargas was detained at the McAllen airport while trying to pass through security en route to Los Angeles, said Ryan Eller, campaign director for Define American, a group Vargas founded in 2011. "ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the agency's resources to promote border security and to identify and remove criminal individuals who pose a threat to public safety and national security." "Mr. Vargas has not previously been arrested by (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,) nor has the agency ever issued a detainer on him or encountered him," the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday.
