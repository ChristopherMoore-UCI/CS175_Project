While it may seem surprising for newspapers to be flourishing in an internet age, Libya's uprising was not conducted as much through social media sites as those in Egypt and other Arab countries. "In Benghazi, 80% of people starting up newspapers are engineers because it's the center for the oil refineries," said Brandt. "I read newspapers and nowadays people are providing analysis and holding the politicians to account. Before the start of Libya's civil war, you could count the number of newspapers in the country on one hand and all were heavily controlled by the government. These newspapers are mostly run and staffed by engineers, doctors and students, said International Media Support, one of several foreign organizations that is helping train journalists in Libya.
