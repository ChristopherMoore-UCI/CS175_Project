The spokesman, Gen. Marwan Mustapha, said Mubarak's condition had stabilized "and a number of doctors from the prison authority are monitoring him," along with physicians from the armed forces. " Mubarak, 84, was sentenced to life in prison on June 2 for the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators during the 2011 revolt that toppled him. The ex-president and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were convicted of ordering security forces to kill anti-government protesters and could have been sentenced to death. Egypt's jailed ex-strongman Hosni Mubarak clung to life Tuesday despite slipping in and out of consciousness, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Mubarak became president after the in October 1981 assassination of his predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
