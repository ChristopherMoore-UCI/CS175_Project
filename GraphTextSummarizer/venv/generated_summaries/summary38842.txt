They are currently in production on a "Kind Kit" which will include a recorded version of their school assembly program, the film "Finding Kind," and a yearlong curriculum they say is endorsed by self-esteem expert and author Jessica Weiner (who also appears in the documentary). "The two of us have really personal experiences with what we call girl-against-girl crime," says Parsekian, who co-founded the nonprofit organization Kind Campaign with Thompson in 2009 to try to stop this pattern of harassment. Reflecting on her personal journey through this issue of girl-on-girl bullying, the filmmaker highlights the message of "Kind Campaign": "We're not standing here pointing the finger and saying, 'You're a mean girl and this is what you're doing wrong,' because at the end of the day, every person has been on both sides of this, and we've all thought things or done things that we shouldn't have that have hurt other people in our lives. For Thompson, her experience with the brutality of "girl world" came in her junior year of high school when a former friend started spreading rumors about her. As she elaborates on a past where middle school became torture, filled with flying rumors and drama that led to an eating disorder and a seventh-grade suicide attempt, the cliche "never judge a book by its cover" comes to mind.
