Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel was beset by problems during testing, with the all-conquering Red Bull team struggling to get the best out of its Renault engine. The 2008 drivers' champion failed to complete a lap during the first session of practice at Albert Park, but he recovered in the afternoon to lead the timesheets ahead of his teammate Nico Rosberg. But despite many fearing the worst for the four-time title winner, Vettel was fourth fastest -- over half of a second adrift of Hamilton. " Vettel and co. will be back on the track for qualifying on Saturday, with the first race of the 2014 season taking place on Sunday. "While it was disappointing to not get any track time this morning, these little hiccups are going to happen with the new cars and we'll have to get used to that," Hamilton, who's car had an oil sensor problem early on Friday, told the sport's official website after a lap of one minute and 29.625 seconds.
