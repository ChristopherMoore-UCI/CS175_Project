-- After deliberating for nearly two hours, a Georgia jury found 18-year-old De'Marquise Elkins guilty Friday of multiple charges, including felony murder, for shooting and killing 13-month-old Antonio Santiago during a robbery. They see something even better, something even more weak, something even more vulnerable, a mother and a child." Johnson ended her closing argument with an emotional plea to the jury to find Elkins guilty of murder. During his closing argument Friday, Elkins' attorney Jonathan Lockwood attacked West's recollection of the shooting, saying she couldn't confidently identify Elkins as the shooter. Elkins was also convicted of aggravated assault and other charges for shooting pastor Wilfredo Calix-Flores during a separate mugging 10 days before the baby was shot. Sherry West, Santiago's mother, wept on the stand during the trial as she recounted how Elkins shot her son in broad daylight in Brunswick, Georgia, on March 21, after he and another teen tried to mug her.
