" The first person to swim across Lake Ontario was 16-year-old Marilyn Bell in 1954, according to Swim Ontario, the sport's provincial governing body. She began swimming in the lake three or four years ago and said competing in open water is "way quieter" than in a pool. -- A Canadian 14-year-old completed a nearly 27-hour, 31.6-mile solo swim across Lake Ontario on Sunday, becoming the youngest person ever to make the trek. She says she chose Lake Ontario for her swim because it's one of the hardest open-water swims in the world, and she wanted to "accomplish something difficult" for children who fight cancer. She climbed out of the water at Toronto's Marilyn Bell Park two minutes before 9 p.m. Sunday.
