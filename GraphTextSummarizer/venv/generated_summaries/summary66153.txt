" Siren is part of a growing trend of apps that aim to take control of the online lechery and worse: Hinge allows users to connect only with mutual friends and third-party connections on Facebook; Willow users must answer questions before showing pictures; Wyldfire allows female users to invite only the men who they would want in the dating pool. "Give women the chance to send subtle cues of interest, men to show off a little of who they are, friends to recommend good men and people to make each other smile. CEO Susie Lee and design director Katrina Hess created Siren based on the core principle that "women needed to control visibility," Lee said, meaning the users can give clear signals that they're actually interested and comfortable talking to the suitor of their choice. The 2013 Pew Research online dating report found that 28% of online daters have been contacted "in a way that made them feel harassed or uncomfortable," with 42% of female online daters experiencing this, compared with 17% of men. "We're cheering good men on in as many ways as we can," Lee said.
