-- After harsh criticism and controversy, the 2010 Commonwealth Games will officially begin Sunday in New Delhi, India. Excitement filled the air in New Delhi after days of fears that India simply would not be ready in time. Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit said she hoped the Commonwealth Games would leave a legacy that will ultimately make life more comfortable for the residents of India's sprawling capital -- rich and poor. The government spent billions on a new international airport, additional metro lines and fresh landscaping along dingy Delhi roads. Still, India remains a country with millions of poor people, who this week felt brushed aside as the new India tried to put its best face forward.
