National Assembly President Jose Luis Varela performed the swearing-in and placed the presidential sash on Martinelli, a pro-business conservative who defeated a candidate from the ruling center-left party in May. The citizens of Panama "want things to be done differently," Varela said at the inauguration. Among the dignitaries at the inauguration was deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a military-led coup Sunday. Martinelli won the presidency with 60 percent of the votes in a race against ruling-party candidate Balbina Herrera. Panama will also work with Mexico and Colombia to combat drug trafficking in the region, Martinelli said. The son of Italian immigrants, Martinelli, 57, is a self-made businessman who is chairman of the Super 99 supermarket chain, one of the largest private companies in Panama.
