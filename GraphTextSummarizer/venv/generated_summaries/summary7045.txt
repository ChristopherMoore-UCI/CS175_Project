The actress, who played the lovably clueless Rose on "The Golden Girls," responded with glee Friday when folks on the set of her sitcom, "Hot in Cleveland," greeted her with a choreographed dance number and a banner reading "Happy Birthday Betty." The surprise was caught on video: White is being driven in a golf cart on the "Hot in Cleveland" set by co-star Dave Foley, who casually says, "I think there might be a little bit of a celebration for your birthday." The flash mob culminates in a "Happy Birthday, Betty!" White's assistant greets her daily with a little hula dance, according to People Magazine. Everyone's favorite nonagenarian, Betty White, got the surprise of a lifetime for her 93rd birthday -- a hula-dancing flash mob!
