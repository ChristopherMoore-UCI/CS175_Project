Reactions: Facebook IPO underwhelms Web, too Second, much as it soothes the ego to think that your portfolio setbacks are because of a conspiracy, where large institutional clients make a killing and the individual investors get the crumbs from the table, it is institutional clients who lose the most in bad deals because they have more to lose. I think the investment bankers priced the offering based on how shares of Facebook were trading in the private market and their assessments of institutional demand. The bankers set the offering price at $38, knowing that the stock was not worth that much, the insiders in the company unloaded their shares at the offering price and institutional investors stayed on the sidelines. By pushing up the offering price to its upper limit and by expanding the offering to allow more insiders to cash out, they broke the spell that momentum casts over investors. Finally, remember that markets make mistakes, and they can make bigger ones after a meltdown like this one.
