"However, that said, given the things that Maj. Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people, I am not surprised. An owner of a 7-Eleven convenience store at Fort Hood said Hasan, whom he knew as "Maj. Nidal," came in for coffee and hash browns most mornings, including the morning of the shootings. Hasan's cousin, Mohammad Munif Abdallah Hasan, said the Army major had wanted to leave the military because he felt disrespected over his religion. While few official details have been released about Hasan, his family and others have given some insight into the man accused of killing 13 people and wounded 38 others in Thursday's massacre at Fort Hood Army Post in Texas. Thompson said he saw van de Walker apologize to Hasan and that a police report was filed.
