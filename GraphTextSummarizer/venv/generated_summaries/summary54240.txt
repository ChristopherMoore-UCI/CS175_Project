" Vanished Hoffa still fascinates after almost 40 years Corbett, who prosecuted Zerilli in several cases in the 1980s and '90s, says Zerilli was the head of the Detroit organized crime family from 1970-1975, but was in prison himself when Hoffa disappeared. Anthony Zerilli, 85, told New York's NBC 4 that Hoffa was buried in a Michigan field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen on July 30, 1975. In an interview with CNN on Monday, former U.S. attorney and chief of the Eastern District of Michigan's Organized Crime Strike Force Keith Corbett said there are very few people, if any, who would be more likely to know about Hoffa's disappearance than Zerilli. One of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded a great deal of sway in many elections -- and when some unions were notoriously tied to organized crime -- Hoffa was forced out of the organized-labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. " Zerilli said the plan was to bury Hoffa in a shallow grave, then move his body to a different location.
