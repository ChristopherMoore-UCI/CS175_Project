"We fully expect that my client will similarly be vindicated with respect to Doe #2, as well as with respect to any other person who makes meritless claims against John Travolta," Singer said. Okorocha apologized last Friday for putting the wrong date of the John Doe #1 incident in the lawsuit, saying his first client initially told him it was January 16, 2012. Instead of just changing the date on the filing to January 15 -- the day John Doe #1 later decided was when it happened -- Okorocha decided to withdraw the allegation from the lawsuit. Okorocha also said he had "personality conflicts" with John Doe #1 that contributed to his decision. Attorney Okorie Okorocha, who filed the lawsuit last week, dropped John Doe #1, who made the Beverly Hills allegation, from the complaint Tuesday because of the Texas man's confusion over the date of the alleged incident.
