The official Xinhua news agency said that Li Hao had been convicted of murder, rape, illegal detention, organized prostitution and making pornography for profit in 2012. Li was executed "according to law" after meeting relatives in a detention house in Luoyang, Henan province, a statement issued by the Supreme People's Court said, according to Xinhua. Li repeatedly raped the women, forced them to appear in pornographic web shows from March to April 2011 and made them have sex with customers for a brief period, it added. The death penalty had been approved by the Supreme People's Court, Xinhua said, after a higher court upheld the sentence handed down by the Luoyang Intermediate People's Court in November 2012. -- A Chinese man was executed on Tuesday for keeping six women in a dungeon as sex slaves and killing two of them, state media reported.
