According to Timberlake's publicist, there are currently no plans for a new album, though JT is working with Timbaland on tracks for "Shock Value 3" (he appeared on each of the first two installments of the series). So while the idea of a new JT album is titillating (especially for those of us still obsessed with "FutureSex"), it will have to remain a fantasy for now. While he hasn't been completely invisible (he has dropped in on tracks for Madonna, T.I., Jamie Foxx, Timbaland and Esmee Denters, among others, since the release of "FutureSex/LoveSounds"), he has pretty much put the idea of an album on the back burner â€” though he may be dipping his toe into the world of film scores. That tends to fill one's day with acting in Oscar-winning films, dropping into the occasional SNL sketch, hosting a golf tournament, sometimes going to the Marine Corps Ball and being engaged to Jessica Biel.
