Frum and Sabet compare this hypothetical Leviathan to the alcohol and tobacco industries, both of which have been accused of marketing to minors and encouraging destructive consumption of their products by adults. A majority of Americans favor full legalization, and they understand that recreational cannabis is not now and will never be legal for minors. And our prosecution of healthy adults for their relatively benign use of marijuana prevents the justice system from focusing on the diversion of pot to the young people we all want to protect. Setting aside the odd assumptions about who are insecure and discontent, minors and minorities could both benefit from legalization. Those opposed to marijuana do raise important concerns that are often neglected in the movement toward legalization.
