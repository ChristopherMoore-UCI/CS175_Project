"We are still looking to recover the second medal, and we stress that our inquiries remain active," said Detective Chief Inspector James Harman. A spokesman for the London Metropolitan police said a medal belonging to the British field hockey player Hannah Macleod had been mailed anonymously to the offices of England Hockey on Friday. Harman said police wanted to hear from anyone with information on the thefts. A bronze medal belonging to fellow British Olympian Alex Partridge, a rower, remains missing. " The medals were taken after Partridge, 31, and Macleod, 28, left their blazers, with the medals inside, unattended as they danced in the upmarket Mahiki nightclub, following a reception with Britain's queen for London 2012 athletes at Buckingham Palace.
