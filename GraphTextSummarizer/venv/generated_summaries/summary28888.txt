Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said. On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said. -- A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced. During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said. Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth.
