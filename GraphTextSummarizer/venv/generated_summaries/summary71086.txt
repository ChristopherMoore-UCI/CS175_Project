He finished second at the Australian Grand Prix, third in Monaco and fifth in Valencia at the European Grand Prix. "That is certainly our target, so we will keep working hard and pushing on every front, not just for the rest of this season but also for next year when there are more big rule changes on the way. "There have been many rumors surrounding his future in recent weeks, which were a tribute to how well he has driven this year, and we are very happy to have agreed a multi-year deal. -- Robert Kubica has signed a contract extension that will keep him at Renault until the end of the 2012 season.
