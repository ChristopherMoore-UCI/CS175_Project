United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon pledged up to $10 million for relief and recovery efforts during a two-day visit that included a visit with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. The Chilean government has asked the United Nations for items such as field hospitals with surgical facilities, dialysis centers, generators, saltwater purifying systems, mobile bridges and field kitchens. Aid poured in for Chile from home and overseas, with a local television station hoping to raise $27 million by Saturday night and the United Nations pledging money toward recovery efforts. "Chile Helps Chile," a telethon that started Friday, ran until Saturday night. "I am visiting this city with a deep sadness," Ban said Saturday in Concepcion.
