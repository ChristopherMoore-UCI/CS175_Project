But despite the focus on Paris from much of the national media, once the President arrived in Detroit and Phoenix, he stuck to his message that his policies are responsible for the rebounding U.S. economy and the resurgence of growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs. And aboard Air Force One on his flight to Detroit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was peppered with questions like,  "With respect to the situation in Paris, does the U.S. have an assessment...on who these gunmen were?" With HUD Secretary Julian Castro by his side, the President even announced a half percent cut in FHA mortgage loan rates to help families. In Phoenix Thursday, he made an unscheduled stop at a housing development where new homes were being built to highlight the uptick in housing prices. The President added: "that's going to be the focus of my State of the Union address in a couple of weeks -- building on the progress that we've already made." Perhaps Friday will be a breakthrough day, as he heads to Knoxville, Tennessee, to talk about expanding higher education opportunities for millions of students.
