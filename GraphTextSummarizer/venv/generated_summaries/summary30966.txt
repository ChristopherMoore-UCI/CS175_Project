About a half hour after the trio of attacks, a suicide car bomber hit a police station in the Kohat district of northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 11 people -- eight civilians and three police, said Kohat Police Chief Dilawr Bangish. The offices of several senior police and government officials and several military installations also are nearby. -- Militants launched a string of bold strikes in Pakistan on Thursday, leaving at least 30 police officers and civilians dead, authorities said. At least 41 people were killed and 45 wounded in a blast Monday at a security forces checkpoint in northwest Pakistan. Among other things, the act promotes a partnership aimed at "combating the extremism that threatens Pakistan and the United States." Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Pakistani Taliban accepted blame for the three attacks against two police training centers and the country's Federal Investigation Agency in Lahore.
