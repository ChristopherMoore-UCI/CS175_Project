Wanda Lee, the Franklin County coroner, said the victims were Roy D. Napier, 50; Angela Napier, 47; Melissa Napier 23; Jacob Napier 18; and Henry Smith 43. "We are looking at all motives for this crime," said Franklin County Sheriff Ken Murphy. Authorities on Tuesday released the identities of five slain people whose bodies were found at two addresses in rural Franklin County, and stressed that none of them was responsible for the killings. The Napiers all had been shot in the head, Lee said, and Angela Napier also had suffered blunt-force trauma to the head. Authorities first got a call Sunday afternoon from people concerned about a small child wandering near the street along Stipps Hill Road near Laurel, in eastern Indiana about halfway between Indianapolis and Cincinnati.
