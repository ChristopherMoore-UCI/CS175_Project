"Earlier today, Gov. Perry and Chancellor George Osborne discussed the global repercussions of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and the governor offered to share what we've learned in Texas with the United Kingdom, which is also preparing for the possibility of an Ebola case," she said. "State, local and federal officials continue to manage the response to Dallas' Ebola cases, and the infectious disease task force that Gov. Perry created to review the state's preparedness and response efforts will conduct its first public hearing this month," Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Monday. -- Texas is still grappling with an Ebola scare, and Gov. Rick Perry -- faced with a test of his leadership ahead of a possible 2016 presidential bid -- is in Europe. His trip comes after a Dallas nurse became the second person diagnosed with Ebola in the state, and as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors dozens more doctors and nurses who treated the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died last week. Perry's absence has raised eyebrows: Texas Democrats pounced on Perry, saying the episode is characteristic of a governor they've long accused of being too focused on his own political fortunes.
