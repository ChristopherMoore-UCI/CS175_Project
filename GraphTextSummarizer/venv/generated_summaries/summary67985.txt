On Wednesday, the High Court of Australia will be asked to assess whether it's legal under Australian law and the constitution to detain refugees indefinitely and "whether Australian law puts a different value on liberty for non-citizens, one where liberty is more easily put in jeopardy," Manne said. 'Serious psychological harm' Australia's policy of indefinite detention has been harshly criticized in the past, most recently by a special committee of 18 human rights experts assembled by the United Nations. Both parties have defended their policies as necessary to discourage the thousands of people who are paying people smugglers to board often unseaworthy boats for the dangerous trip to Australia. -- A refugee and mother of three young boys who is being held in indefinite detention in Australia has two days to convince the country's highest court why she should be freed. "The core issues in Ranjini's case are common to more than 50 other refugees deemed a security risk and has serious implications for their liberty too," said her lawyer David Manne, who as the executive director of Australia's Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, is representing most of the refugees involved.
