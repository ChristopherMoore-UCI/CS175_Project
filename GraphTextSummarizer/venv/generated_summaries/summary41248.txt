-- Mercedes-Benz will head up their own Formula One team next season after the German car manufacturer confirmed they have taken a 75.1 percent share in Brawn GP -- with Ross Brawn remaining as team principal. The new team will become known as Mercedes Grand Prix, with Brawn in control, while Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug will work with the F1 team and the engine team of Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines. Mercedes engines powered Brawn's Jenson Button to the world championship this season -- while the team also claimed the constructors' championship. From fighting for our survival to forging a strong relationship with Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines, winning both the constructors and drivers world championships, and now accepting Daimler's offer to buy our team, which will secure its future," he added. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton, Button's predecessor as world champion, was also sitting behind a Mercedes engine in his McLaren.
