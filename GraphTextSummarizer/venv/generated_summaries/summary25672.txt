In August, CNN spoke to Curtis' former cellmate in Syria, Matthew Schrier. When asked about the death of James Foley, an American journalist killed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria last week, Nancy Curtis began to weep. " President Barack Obama has been briefed on Curtis' release and "shares in the joy and relief that we all feel now that Theo is out of Syria and safe," said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. White House national security adviser Susan Rice said Curtis was safe, no longer in Syria and expected to be reunited with his family shortly. Nancy Curtis spoke to her son briefly by phone Sunday.
