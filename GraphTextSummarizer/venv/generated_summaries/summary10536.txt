Facebook invited reporters, hardware makers and rival internet companies to its headquarters to debut a new initiative on Thursday for improving website infrastructure. Facebook's initiative could be seen as a potential jab at Google and Amazon, which closely guard information about their infrastructure and facilities, Forrester Research analyst Richard Fichera wrote in a report. " Servers aren't sexy, but Facebook certainly tried to make the underpinnings more broadly appealing. With this Open Compute Project, Facebook is publishing documents that describe how to build the network of computers that support the site's millions of users and enormous banks of information. "It's functionally beautiful," said Amir Michael, Facebook's hardware design manager, describing a server free of paint or screws like a car salesman might.
