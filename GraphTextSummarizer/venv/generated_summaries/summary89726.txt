The storm also destroyed several buildings at Kansas State University, including a wind erosion lab, and tore the roof off a fraternity house at the school in Manhattan, Kansas, said Cheryl May, the university's director of media relations. -- Rescue workers in Kansas searched for people Thursday among the wreckage left by tornadoes that ripped through the Midwest on Wednesday night. She said residents in the areas hardest hit by Wednesday's storms had about 20 minutes of advance notice, which was ample time for people in a state that takes tornado warnings seriously. She said two schools, three churches and several homes were destroyed and many buildings sustained heavy damage. Two people were killed as tornadoes swept across Kansas, destroying 60 homes and damaging another 60, officials reportedly said.
