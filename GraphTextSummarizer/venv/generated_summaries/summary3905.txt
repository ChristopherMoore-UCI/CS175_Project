The images surfaced Sunday and Monday in Syria, where more than 2,000 people have died in five months of bloody conflict between security forces and anti-government demonstrators. They were among those who fled as security forces cracked down on al-Ramel, a Latakia neighborhood that has been the center of anti-government demonstrations. According to human rights activists and anti-government protesters, that's exactly what the girls' parents tried to do -- flee. Syrian security forces told residents to get out during the military offensive, which occurred by sea as well as land. Back in May, the U.N. Children's Fund, or UNICEF called on the government to spare civilians, particularly women and children, amid reports of youthful casualties.
