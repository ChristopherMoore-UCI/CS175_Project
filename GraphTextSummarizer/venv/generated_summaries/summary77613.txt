As the sole bugler for the southern region of New York's Military Forces Honor Guard -- part of the state National Guard -- DiLeo travels five days a week from cemetery to cemetery, playing at funerals of military servicemen and women and veterans. " Taps has been played at military funerals since some time during the Civil War, according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Aware that there was a shortage of buglers because of the large number of funerals a day, DiLeo contacted the military about bugling after he attended his godfather's funeral, where a recording of taps was played. For DiLeo, playing taps at the funerals of men and women who served the country holds significant meaning. "Every veteran has the right to get military honors, and taps, in my opinion, should be played live as opposed to having a recording," DiLeo said.
