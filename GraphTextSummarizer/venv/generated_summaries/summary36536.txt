The woman is scheduled to appear in federal court next month to plead guilty to felony counts of making false statements to the FBI and witness tampering, federal authorities said. That woman, 70-year-old Tatiana Khan, agreed to plead guilty to federal charges related to the sale of the phony Picasso, authorities said Tuesday. "Khan also admitted that she told the art restorer to lie to the FBI by saying that she only did restoration work for Khan and did not do any copying work. -- A Los Angeles, California, art dealer, federal authorities say, thought she'd done the math: Pay an art restorer $1,000 to create a knock-off of Pablo Picasso's 1902 pastel, "The Woman in the Blue Hat." "Khan falsely told an FBI agent who was investigating the sale that Khan had obtained the drawing from an acquaintance," a Department of Justice statement said.
