In other matches, fourth seed Andy Murray eased into the second round beating French qualifier Eric Prodon in straight sets 6-4 6-1 6-3. Austria's Jurgen Melzer, a losing semi-finalist last year, beat Germany's Andreas Beck 6-3 6-4 6-2. But Isner -- who won the 11-hour epic against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon last year -- wasn't about to give up and promptly raised his game. Fifth seed and 2009 runner-up Robin Soderling needed four sets to beat American Ryan Harrison. The six-foot-nine American -- ranked 39 in the world -- took both the second and third sets on the tiebreak raising the prospect of handing Nadal only his second defeat at Roland Garros and causing one of the biggest upsets in years.
