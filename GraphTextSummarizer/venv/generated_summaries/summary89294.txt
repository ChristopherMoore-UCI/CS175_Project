-- A judge placed France's richest woman, L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, under the guardianship of her grandson on Monday, her lawyer said. In an interview published Sunday in France's Journal du Dimanche, Bettencourt said she was worried about the judge's decision on Monday. Last year, Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, declared in court that her mother was not mentally competent to handle her own affairs. Bertrand Favreau, one of Bettencourt's lawyers, said Jean-Victor Meyers, the eldest grandson of the 88 year-old woman, has been designated her guardian. Bettencourt was friends with the photographer, Francois-Marie Banier, and allegedly gave him the money.
