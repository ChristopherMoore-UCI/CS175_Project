Designed to give easy access to people taking care of elderly relatives, Ask Medicare provides information and links to services that are important to caregivers. So when her mother, Delphine Mickens, was told she had Alzheimer's disease, Mickens took care of all the arrangements for her mother's care -- among them, she chose a nursing home not far from her place in Baltimore. Mickens eventually concluded that the only way Delphine was going to receive acceptable care was to move her mother in with her. Mickens finally feels content about the quality of care her mother is getting, and she says it would have never happened so quickly had she not found the Ask Medicare Web site. Medicare personnel helped her get some of the medical supplies she needed and also recommend a new Web site called Ask Medicare.
