-- Engineers have determined a storm-battered crane that is dangling over Midtown Manhattan is securely fastened to a high-rise building under construction, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Wednesday. The peculiar scene has since left many New Yorkers peering skyward as authorities secured the area and evacuated nearby buildings, including the posh Le Parker Meridien hotel. The crane, damaged Monday afternoon, sits atop a building that is planned to be among the tallest residential structures in Manhattan, offering views that potentially range from Central Park to the city's Financial District. New York after Sandy: A tale of two cities Since Tuesday, engineers have been inside the One57 building on West 57th Street, where gale force winds toppled a crane boom some 90 stories above the city. Lend Lease, which is building the tower, said the crane was inspected October 26 and that the operator left it in the correct position, as was done during previous hazardous weather, including Hurricane Irene.
