The ashes of late actor James Doohan, who played chief engineer Montgomery Scott in the original "Star Trek" television series and a series of subsequent films, were on the SpaceX rocket that launched a private spacecraft into orbit this week. While it is unclear if the exact phrase "Beam me up, Scotty" ever was uttered in a "Star Trek" episode, it became a popular bumper sticker and Doohan chose it for the title of his autobiography published in 1996. "He would rather have flown when he was alive, of course," said Doohan's widow, Wende Doohan, who watched the SpaceX launch Tuesday with the couple's 12-year-old daugher, one of three children from a 31-year marriage. "He was this enormous fan of technology, future technology, space exploration, NASA and anything with mankind reaching out," Doohan said. Doohan always told her he wanted his ashes flown in space, she said Thursday, adding that the contract with Celestis was not signed until after Doohan died.
