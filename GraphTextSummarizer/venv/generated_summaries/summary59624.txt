Long before authorities arrested Smadi, however, they were following his Internet discussions, according to a court affidavit. Hosam Maher Husein Smadi said through his lawyer that he understood the charges Friday. " Smadi said many times that he wanted to commit violent jihad and he was a soldier of Osama bin Laden, the affidavit says. It details a conversation that Smadi is said to have had with authorities: "I have decided to change the target," he said, according to the affidavit. After casing the bank in July, Smadi told an undercover agent he would target it, according to authorities.
