-- U.S. transportation security officials want to speed more travelers through airport security lines by expanding a voluntary program that requires a background check. The idea of removing low-risk, pre-screened people from the main security lines, will allow security resources to be concentrated more closely on potential threats and alleviate long lines at security checkpoints. But striking a balance between thorough security in a post 9/11 age and the desire of travelers to reduce the "hassle factor" of airport screening has been a political, logistical, and financial challenge. The original initiative required travelers to opt in through an airline's frequent flier program or first enroll in other programs like trusted traveler. Since the TSA first announced the PreCheck program in March of 2012, a total of 12 million travelers at 40 airports have taken advantage of expedited security lines.
