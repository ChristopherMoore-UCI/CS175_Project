" Quadrotors could also use sensors to detect radiation levels and other biological hazards, Kumar said. As much fun as Turpin and his colleagues seem to be having, he says their ultimate goal is to put quadrotors to good use outside the lab. "But if there's an emergency, if there's a 911 call, the question is, do you want a human dashing off to respond to it right away?" Kumar also saw an opportunity for quadrotors to be used when law enforcement was close to apprehending a suspect in the Boston bombings. Other quadrotors at the GRASP Lab have worked together to carry cargo and build structures. "This is a robot that's completely autonomous," said doctoral student Matthew Turpin, "and by that I mean there's no remote control in the background.
