-- World number three Roger Federer exited the Monte Carlo Masters at the quarterfinals stage to Austrian Jurgen Melzer Friday. There was no stopping world number one Rafael Nadal, bidding for his seventh straight title in Monte Carlo, as he swept aside Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-1 6-3 to reach the last four. Nadal will face off against Britain's Andy Murray for a place in Sunday's final after the number three seed continued his fine run with a 6-1 6-2 dismissal of Portuguse qualifier Frederico Gil in just over an hour. It was the earliest defeat for Federer in a tournament this year, ending his hopes of claiming the Monte Carlo title for the first time after being beaten three times in the final by Rafael Nadal. "He beat me three times last year and I didn't even win a set," he told AFP.
