Smoke blanketed the Argentine capital Friday as brush fires apparently set deliberately consumed thousands of acres in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Entre RÃ­os. "Covering highways with smoke just to clear a field of weeds is unforgivable," Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez told Radio Diez. Sections of major highways and the Buenos Aires port, among the busiest in the world, have been closed. On Friday morning, the National Roads Administration closed sections of the heavily traveled Panamericana Highway, which leads in and out of Buenos Aires. Schools in Pilar, a city in the province of Buenos Aires, were closed Friday because of the gray, thick air.
