Newey has quite a track record of working in this field, having co-founded YIY, a youth group that creates opportunities for young people to grow into engaged citizens and social entrepreneurs. At 30, Newey is a Thai citizen and director of the Youth Venture program in Thailand, an initiative that is empowering young "changemakers," as the parent organization Ashoka calls them, to improve the quality of life in their communities. Her day-to-day role as Youth Venture director takes her to all parts of Thailand to meet, encourage and support 14-24 year-olds -- be they middle class, underprivileged, marginalized, or delinquent. As for Newey, she's a deep individual and an artist at heart. Over the course of the next year, Newey will show you her work in the teeming city of Bangkok, but also take you to the rural countryside, where conditions can be even more challenging.
