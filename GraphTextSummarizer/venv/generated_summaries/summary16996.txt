Gainesville police posted a fresh plea Friday night, on the department's Facebook page, asking volunteers to report to the Florida Farm Bureau at 9 a.m. Saturday to resume the search for Aguilar. Bravo then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city, prompting police to warn that Aguilar may be disoriented and/or seriously injured. Officer Ben Tobias announced that the Gainesville police department charged Pedro Bravo with the death of Christian Aguilar. Bravo told investigators that he'd gotten into "an altercation with Aguilar" on the night the college student went missing, police said. Ron Kozlowski, one of Bravo's attorneys, told CNN on Friday night that he has "not been presented with any new evidence thus far."
