The U.N. children's agency said it has dispatched emergency medical kits containing surgical gloves, water treatment tablets, cholera medicine, oral rehydration salts and educational materials. The outbreak, which began in May, has exceeded 3,000 cases, said Dr. Eric Mintz, the leader of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team. "What puts people at risk is a lack of safe drinking water," Mintz said. CDC's Mintz said the rugged and remote region has been affected repeatedly by cholera epidemics, most recently last year. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north, bordering Nigeria and Chad and the Central African Republic, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official.
