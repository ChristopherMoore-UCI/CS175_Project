The visuals of more than 50 protesters picketing on Landrieu's front yard with "No KXL" signs could bolster Landrieu's status as a serious threat to opponents of the pipeline and positions her as a key player in the effort to bring more than a dozen Senate Democrats on board to support the bill and send it to President Barack Obama's desk. Instead, Ganapathy and other activists said the protest was about more than Landrieu -- sending a message to national Democrats that they risk losing their base if they support policies like Keystone. " Thirteen other Senate Democrats also risk having inflatable pipelines strewn across their front yard. " "We're here to try and convince people not to support the Keystone XL pipeline," he said when asked about the impact on Landrieu's reelection prospects. So far, 14 Democrats, including Landrieu, reportedly plan to join Republicans in supporting the project Tuesday -- putting the Senate just one vote shy of the filibuster-proof 60-vote majority.
