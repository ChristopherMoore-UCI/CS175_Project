-- First lady Michelle Obama got into the Christmas spirit Saturday by helping field phone calls from excited children eagerly tracking Santa and his sleigh full of toys across the world. Most of the children she spoke to were more concerned with finding out Santa's whereabouts than talking to the first lady, but one parent appeared to catch Obama by surprise when he asked, "What do you want for Christmas this year from Santa? For the second year in a row, Obama was one of the 1,200 volunteers who answer phone calls and e-mails from children around the world. I think we were all praying and praying, and asking Santa, and the Tooth Fairy, and every fairy that they could think of -- that's what Malia and Sasha were doing -- that he would be able to be with us on Christmas." And it looks like that sleigh is pretty full -- yep, that's what the experts here are saying." Obama took the phone calls from Hawaii where the first family is vacationing for Christmas.
