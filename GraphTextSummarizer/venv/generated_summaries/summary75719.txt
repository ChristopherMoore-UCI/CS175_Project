Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house. You would easily get a child or infant in it," Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag. After her rescue, Dean, her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions. " Aldridge said he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible. " Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over Â£30,000, Aldridge said.
