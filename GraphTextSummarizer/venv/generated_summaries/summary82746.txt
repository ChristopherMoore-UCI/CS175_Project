"FIFA will today send a letter to the Nigerian football federation indicating that the government of Nigeria has until Monday 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) to cancel its decision to withdraw Nigeria's participation in all FIFA and CAF organized football competitions," Maingot told a news briefing on Friday. Should Nigeria fail to resolve the situation, the country will be banned from competitive games including African competitions, and will also lose vital financial help from FIFA. Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan suspended the "Super Eagles" from international competition on Wednesday after their first round exit at the World Cup in South Africa. However, FIFA rules prevent governments from interfering in the running of national football federations. FIFA President Sepp Blatter had earlier warned France that they would face a possible suspension following a similar issue involving an investigation by French President Nicolas Sarkozy into the national team's infamous World Cup exit.
