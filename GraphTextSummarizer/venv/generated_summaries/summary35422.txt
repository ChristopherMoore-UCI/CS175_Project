Flight 1921, a Boeing 757, was flying from Detroit to Phoenix when the captain saw a light indicating possible problems with one of the engines, Delta spokesman Anthony Black said. The pilot diverted the flight, and during the landing, the captain received another indicator light showing overheating to the rear wheel, Black said. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said there was a fire in the main landing gear when the plane landed.
