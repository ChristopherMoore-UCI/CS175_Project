Tom and Misha are part of an expensive, ambitious and risky program sponsored by the UK-based Born Free Foundation, which is aiming to prove that captive dolphins can be reintroduced to the wild. Within 48 hours, satellite transmitters showed that Tom and Misha had traveled more than 100 miles, and they were observed hunting fish as a team and interacting with other wild dolphins. Within the first four or five hours after we let them out, they were pursuing fish and interacting with wild dolphins. According to Moore, Tom and Misha's release will have virtually no impact on the world's wild dolphin population, which faces an onslaught from industrial fishing nets, decimated fish stocks and polluted seas. There has been a rapid increase in the number of "dolphinariums" and "swim-with-dolphin" programs cropping up across Turkey over the last decade.
