Based on the steam emitted after these water-spraying operations, Edano said that authorities believe there is still water in the spent fuel pool -- meaning fuel rods, which can give off radiation, likely aren't fully exposed -- though he said it was not clear how much liquid there was. Unit 3 too is being injected with sea water and water was being sprayed into it. The TEPCO spokesman said the level of water in the main pool, which contained older fuel that had already cooled, was only 10 to 15 centimeters below normal. They're focusing on reactors, then spent fuel becomes damaged," Johnson said. Concerns remained about the spent fuel pool at reactor No. 4, from which the IAEA said no water-temperature data has been received since Monday, and which a U.S. official said Wednesday appeared to contain no water.
