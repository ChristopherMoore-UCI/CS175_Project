BP said in a statement Monday that costs from the disaster now total about $2 billion, including the cost of the response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to Gulf states, claims paid and federal costs. As much as 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) of oil may be gushing into the Gulf every day, government estimates found last week. Brian Collins, an attorney for the Justice Department, insisted the suspension was necessary because it "assures the public time to evaluate safety measures." BP has agreed to set aside $100 million to compensate oil workers idled by the moratorium, company chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said last week. "This is about industry survival for deepwater drilling in the Gulf," he said. Company CEO Tony Hayward, who was grilled during an appearance before Congress last week and then strongly criticized for attending a yacht race over the weekend, will not attend Tuesday's World National Oil Companies Congress in London, according to a BP spokesman.
