Spending here, saving there Poison control center operators say their services save health care dollars, primarily because most callers are told they don't need a hospital. Measure H.R. 1 would cut $27.3 million, or about 93%, of federal funding for poison control centers across the United States. It's not just the patients Hospitals rely on poison control centers, too. According to a study cited by the Department of Health and Human Services, for every dollar spent on poison control centers, $7 in health care spending is saved. Other studies find the per dollar value of poison control centers to be far greater.
