The Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, according to Bill Roggio, a military affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. Khan's father, Hafiz Khan, 76, of Miami and his brother, Izhar Khan, 24, of North Lauderdale, Florida, were arrested Saturday in south Florida. The three other people named in the indictment now reside in Pakistan: Amina Khan, who is the daughter of Hafiz Khan; her son, Alam Zeb; and Ali Rehman. But both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, Roggio said. The case isn't linked to the May 2 killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, two U.S. officials have said.
