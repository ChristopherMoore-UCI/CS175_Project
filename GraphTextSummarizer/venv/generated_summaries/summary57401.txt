Demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images months later as a matter of free speech. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said police arrested a 40-year-old Dane of Moroccan origin and two Tunisians. CNN's Paula Newton said the arrests reinforced growing fears in Europe that radical Islam was trying to suppress free speech. Many protesters directed their ire at Denmark, prompting the closure of several Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries, including Indonesia and Pakistan. "Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me," Westergaard said in a statement posted on the newspaper's Web site.
