-- Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed legislation that would have allowed concealed pistol license holders who undergo additional training to carry concealed pistols in schools and other public places, his office said Tuesday in a statement. Snyder recommended that the bill be modified so that it would not permit the open carrying of weapons in these public areas, but would permit concealed carry for license holders who undergo additional training, his statement said. In a news release, Snyder's office said the governor "had committed to give the bill additional scrutiny" prior to Friday's school shootings in Connecticut "in an effort to ensure that public safety remains a priority." "With this veto, however, open-carry still exists in schools, churches and other public areas, and we know that criminals do not respect gun-free zones. But even with this modification, he would still want property owners to be able to decide whether to allow concealed weapons on their premises, he said.
