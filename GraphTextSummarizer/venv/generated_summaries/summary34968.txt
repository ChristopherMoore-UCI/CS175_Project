While Garut province is not the country's worst offender, a Garut forestry official said he can no longer ignore the damage. "Most people here work in agriculture which is of course highly dependent on the fertility of the soil," said Eddy Muharam of Garut's forestry department. On a hot and sticky morning in a village near Garut, 26-year-old Cucu carries a sapling to give to his bride. They will plant the other saplings -- eucalyptus, avocado and mahogany -- at the sleepy village about an hour outside Garut where they plan to settle, for now. " Forestry officials have identified "critical land" in Garut, which has been overfarmed and needs to be reforested.
