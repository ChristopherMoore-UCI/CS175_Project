"And we want to educate women about sports as well." Lemon, who describes herself as a huge fan of professional football, says she hopes her show will lead more men to understand that women love sports, too. "Ladies in the locker room are not women who think they know everything about sports; they just know the men who do," Lemon said. "When women talk about sports, sometimes men look at us as groupies," Lemon said. It's called "Ladies in the Locker Room," and TV subscribers in the Atlanta, Georgia, area have been tuning in to its unique brand of sports commentary, analysis and trivia since 2004. Â» The show is the brainchild of Hattie Lemon, a prolific writer, director, producer and actor whose independent crime series "Atlanta Homicide" is featured on the CoLours TV network.
