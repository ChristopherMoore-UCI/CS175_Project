Indonesia carries tough penalties for drug offenses and smugglers can face the death penalty. "The cocaine brought by the smuggler was of the very rare type," Made Wijaya, head of the airport's customs office, told the official Antara news agency. The British Foreign Office said it is "aware" of the arrests and is "ready to provide consular assistance." Lindsay June Sandiford was found to have blocks of cocaine in her suitcase after she arrived in Bali on a Thai Airways flight, government officials said. In the course of the investigation, authorities also arrested three more people from Britain and one from India in connection with the alleged drug transportation, all accused of being "part of an international syndicate," the state-run news agency said.
