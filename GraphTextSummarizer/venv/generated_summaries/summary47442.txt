"Their general motives are spreading an ideology of hate by calling others disbelievers, collecting money to finance the deviant al Qaeda group inside and outside the kingdom, easing travel for some individuals for training in destabilized places and executing criminal plots to spread chaos and insecurity." The people were involved in collecting money and financing terrorism, targeting oil refineries and government buildings, weapons training, and making hand grenades. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, Interior Ministry spokesman, said the people were plotting to kill government officials, security forces, and media employees. The cells have external links, al-Turki said, a reference to al Qaeda in Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan. -- Security forces in Saudi Arabia have arrested 149 people alleged to be members of al Qaeda, the Saudi Interior Ministry said Friday.
