Ballmer succeeded his buddy Bill Gates as Microsoft CEO. A group that included media moguls David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey also made a bid of $1.6 billion for the Clippers, a source told CNN. But unlike owner Donald Sterling, whose racist remarks hurled him into a vortex of public criticism, Steve Ballmer flew under the radar in recent months before he laid down a record $2 billion offer for the team.
