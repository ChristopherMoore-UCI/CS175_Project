"We want people to know what kind of person this fellow was so they can help us connect dots and maybe generate connections between missing person cases and Israel Keyes," Anchorage police Chief Mark Mew said. Israel Keyes did this because he got an immense amount of enjoyment out of it, much like an addict gets an immense amount of enjoyment out of drugs," said Anchorage, Alaska, police Detective Monique Doll at a news briefing. Besides Koenig, whose body was found in a lake north of Anchorage, authorities have identified only two of Keyes' other victims, Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex Junction, Vermont. Doll said Keyes researched and read about, but did not emulate, other serial killers, including Ted Bundy, who killed as many as 40 people between 1974 and 1978. "Israel Keyes didn't kidnap and kill people because he was crazy, he didn't kidnap and kill people because his deity told him to or because he had a bad childhood.
