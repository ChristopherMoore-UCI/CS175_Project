While some may not understand my choice to forgo conventional treatment, this time around I'm determined not to be scared into toxic therapy. With that knowledge came a major decision: Should I give in and allow myself to be thrown back into the chaos of toxic therapy -- or defy the fear and find a better way? When relapse was confirmed, my general practitioner told me about homeopathic cancer therapy. The news came at lunchtime on a Tuesday six weeks after that fateful ER trip. I didn't have time to deal with cancer.
