Cook was also questioned about whether Apple is losing its "cool factor," with competitors such as Samsung and HTC getting good reviews for their new phones armed with cutting edge features and larger screens. Cook noted that he needs glasses to see and questioned whether people would want wearable technology on their faces. For instance, he said, 59% of smartphone web traffic comes from IOS, the operating system that powers the iPhone. But Apple CEO Tim Cook is not a huge fan of its potential. Questioned by moderators Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, who manage the technology blog by the same name, Cook seemed to hint that Apple may someday enter the "wearables" market, but declined to be specific.
