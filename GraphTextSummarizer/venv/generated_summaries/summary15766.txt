There is an almost total lack of transparency about cost, quality and outcomes among various insurance providers for different kinds of procedures or between health care facilities. No one would tolerate such a terrible dining experience at restaurant A, especially not when a perfectly good meal is to be had across town at restaurant B. In the United States, our experience as health care consumers is a lot like dining at restaurant A -- a business that under normal market conditions would likely be closed within a week. Some would argue that health care is a service that is unlike any other in our economy. We purchase health care often unwillingly, or at times of great stress and medical concern. What we must do is demystify the process of buying health care in the United States.
