The miners survived for more than 17 days by sharing small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in a shelter, along with water, President Sebastian Pinera told CNN en Espanol on Monday. "We have still not told them the timetable, but we are sure that as miners, they know this will take a long time," Health Minister Jaime Manalich said. The San Jose mine is near the town of Copiapo, in the Atacama region in northern Chile. How are you doing?" said Golborne, according to CNN Chile. The miners cheered as officials informed them that their family members had been keeping vigil outside the mine, CNN Chile reported.
