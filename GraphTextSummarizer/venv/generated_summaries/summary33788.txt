Its decision to decide the fate of both the 2018 and 2022 bids at the same time has been widely criticized for encouraging vote collusion between bids -- an accusation FIFA deny. Last Monday the BBC alleged that Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football, Nicolas Leoz, president of the South American football confederation and Ricardo Teixeira, head of the Brazilian football association, all took bribes during the 1990s. Another investigation by the British press, closer to the bid date, has made further uncomfortable accusations about three other FIFA members. The finding by FIFA is just the latest chapter in the ongoing story of the World Cup bidding process which crescendos with the vote on Thursday. Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti were both suspended by FIFA's ethics panel following the revelations, reducing the voting number to 22.
