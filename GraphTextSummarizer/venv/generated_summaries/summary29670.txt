-- Alinghi will defend the America's Cup against U.S. challenger Oracle in the United Arab Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah next year. Due to the time of year and perceived favorable conditions, Alinghi have opted for the waters off the smallest of the seven emirates. Racing will be in a best-of-three format, again a departure from recent America's Cup competitions which have lasted several months with hopeful syndicates racing off against each other in a challenger series before taking on the defending champion. "Well we looked everywhere for a venue that suited having good racing and really the whole push was to find a place that we could race on those dates in February," said Alinghi's New Zealand skipper Brad Butterworth. It is significant because it reflects how the emirates have become a place for hosting international events," said Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Crown Prince of Ras al-Khaimah.
