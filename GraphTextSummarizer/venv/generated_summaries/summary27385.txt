"We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires, which makes more fires with the wind being so strong." Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., the fire department responded to 140 calls of wires down before the evening outbreak. "It just created a firestorm where we had fires," the fire commissioner said, adding that at least eight of the fires were linked to downed power lines and two to arson, though he said those numbers may change. "We had winds from 30 to 50 mph and have a number of downed power wires," Mack said. The inferno was a perfect storm, and was aggravated by high winds and downed power lines, the officials said. Fire officials said Wednesday that there were still hot spots and downed power lines in the city.
