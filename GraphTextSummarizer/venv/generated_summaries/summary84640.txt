World No.2 Sharapova has not played since sensationally losing to Portuguese qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito in the second round at Wimbledon on the opening Wednesday. She will be left with only two hard court tournaments at Cincinnati and New Haven ahead of the final grand slam of the season on the same surface at Flushing Meadows. Victory for the fifth seed ended the Italian's 13-match winning streak which has brought him titles in Stuttgart and Hamburg. "I would like to apologize to the fans that I could not give more in the final, but I'm simply too tired from other matches," he admitted. Fognini made 31 unforced errors and said the efforts of recent weeks had caught up with him.
