Flatt served five years in prison before completing his parole last year. Authorities said Henley shot the couple and later set their farmhouse on fire. Henley had maintained his innocence, blaming the couple's deaths on co-defendant Terry Flatt. An autopsy found that Edna Stafford was still alive when the fire was set, according to authorities. Henley was sentenced to death for the slayings of Fred and Edna Stafford.
