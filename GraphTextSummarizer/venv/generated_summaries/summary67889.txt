Attorney Lawrence Berger -- general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents Secret Service agents and others -- said he is not representing all of the agents involved in the Colombia story, but he does have several other clients in the group in addition to Chaney and Stokes. A source close to the investigation said Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan -- who briefed Obama on the investigation Friday, according to White House officials -- has ordered a "comprehensive" investigation of everything that happened during the trip. In addition, the source confirmed that Secret Service agents were staying at a second hotel on the trip -- identified as a Hilton in Cartagena -- which presumably will be included in the expanded probe. According to sources, the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at the hotel, where Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. Six Secret Service members now have left their jobs in the wake of the incident in Cartagena, Colombia, which came while they were on a security detail in advance of President Barack Obama's trip there for the Summit of the Americas.
