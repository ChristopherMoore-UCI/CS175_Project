A new jury was selected Tuesday, and prosecutor Richard Whittam began the state's second try. Incedal was arrested in October 2013 and found to have the address of a property belonging to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Whittam told the jury. British prosecutors have started a second attempt to convict a man of terrorism after he was caught with bomb-making directions, in a highly unusual case being heard partly in secret. Incedal does not need to have planned a specific attack or had a target in mind to be guilty of plotting terror, the prosecutor told the jury. A select group of 10 journalists will be allowed to hear other parts of the trial, but must leave their notes in court.
