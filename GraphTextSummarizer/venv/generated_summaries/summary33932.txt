Kennedy placed a call to Coretta Scott King against the advice of close advisers, expressing his concern to King's wife. " "Now, it is true that Sen. Kennedy did take a specific step," King said. "We've heard Dr. King talk about peaceful change in the public forum, but this is an audio tape of him talking conversationally," he said.
