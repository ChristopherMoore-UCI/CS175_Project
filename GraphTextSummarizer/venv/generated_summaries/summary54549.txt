HTC is bundling a bunch of extras with the device: 25 GB of free Dropbox-powered storage, Beats Audio sound (HTC acquired Beats Audio in August 2011) and a feature called Media Link, which takes your photos and videos from the smartphone to the TV (through a special gadget that connects to any TV) with a three-finger swipe on the smartphone's screen. HTC has launched a new flagship Android smartphone, the HTC One X, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. HTC had the last, and perhaps the most glamorous event of the day, held in a huge rounded dome at the top of the CÃºpula las Arenas next to Fira de Barcelona, where the main conference is held. An on-screen comparison with the photos taken with an HTC One X and an iPhone 4S portrays HTC's device as a clear winner, but we're sure Apple will have a word or two to say about that. The HTC One X (the first in a new line of devices called simply HTC One), unveiled by the company CEO Peter Chou, is a 4.7-inch, quad core Tegra 3-powered beast in a polycarbonate white shell.
