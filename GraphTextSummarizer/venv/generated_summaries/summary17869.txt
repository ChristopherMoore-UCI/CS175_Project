As soon as Navy personnel lost contact with the unmanned vehicle, a piloted aircraft was dispatched to Maryland's Eastern Shore, where it came upon the wreckage and determined that it was unlikely anyone on the ground had been hurt, Navy officials told CNN. Crashes are highly unusual, Navy officials said. Of the five drones based at southern Maryland's Naval Air Station Patuxent River, four are in routine training and one is deployed with the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet, the officials said. -- A U.S. Navy drone crashed Monday in a marsh near Salisbury, Maryland. Video from CNN affiliate WBOC showed smoke rising from brush fires in the unpopulated area.
