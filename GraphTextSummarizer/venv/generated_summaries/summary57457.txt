-- Former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki made a shaky start to the new WTA season with a shock defeat to Kazakhstan qualifier Ksenia Pervak in the first round of the Brisbane International Monday. Wozniacki will now head to Sydney to get in some match practice ahead of the Australian Open, while Russian-born Pervak goes into the second round at Brisbane for the first time in four attempts. Wozniacki, watched by her boyfriend, golf's World No.1 Rory McIlroy, powered through the opening set in just 29 minutes, but Pervak hit back to level. The eighth seed led 2-0 and 30-0 but Pervak broke back and was dominant in the tiebreak, winning it 7-1 for her first victory over a top ten player. In the men's ATP event, which is headed by Britain's Andy Murray, Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori began his campaign with a straights sets 7-5 6-2 win over Australian Marinko Matosevic.
