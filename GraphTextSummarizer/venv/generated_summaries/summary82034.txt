Given the rates of violence, that's puzzling and negligent -- especially since programs that teach kids about healthy relationships, child sex abuse and dating violence have been proved effective in evaluation studies. Alaska is part of a relatively small minority of states that does not require school districts to teach a form of sex or health education, said Megan Comlossy, a policy expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Perhaps change should come in the form of a mandate that all school districts in Alaska teach about sex abuse and healthy relationships. Called Erin's Law, after an Illinois victim of child sexual abuse, and based on a national movement, the bill would require school districts in Alaska to teach warning signs for child sexual abuse. But here's a factor I didn't really consider until readers brought it to my attention: Alaska doesn't require sex education.
