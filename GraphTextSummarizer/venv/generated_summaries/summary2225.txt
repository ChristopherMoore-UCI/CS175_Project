A joint statement from Google and Nestle did not give a release date for Android KitKat, although some observers expect it to be launched this fall. "We couldn't imagine a better name for our Android K release than the tasty chocolate that's been a favorite among the team since the early days of Android," said Marc Vanlerberghe, Google's marketing director for Android. John Lagerling, director of Android global partnerships, told the BBC that the Nestle deal is "not a money-changing-hands kind of deal," but was dreamed up by developers who kept KitKats, along with other snacks, in their break room while coding. More than 50 million KitKat bars, specially branded with Google's green Android robot on their packaging, will be released, giving customers a chance to win prizes that include a Nexus 7 tablet and credits to the Google Play store. Android has been developed by the company's engineers under dessert names ever since the release of Android Cupcake in 2009.
