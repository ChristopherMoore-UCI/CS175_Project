One Twitter user posed the question in a tweet: "After the case of Valentina Maureira, should euthanasia be legal?" Doctor Andres Castillo, chief of pediatrics at Catholic University's Clinic Hospital, said that at the moment, Valentina's condition is stable. Not even the President can agree to Valentina's request because Chilean law does not allow euthanasia, Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizaldo said. Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia. During the visit, the President learned details about Valentina's health, whose condition has reportedly slightly improved, CNN Chile reported. A Chilean girl's plea via social media for an assisted suicide caught the attention of the person the teen thinks could make it happen: President Michelle Bachelet.
