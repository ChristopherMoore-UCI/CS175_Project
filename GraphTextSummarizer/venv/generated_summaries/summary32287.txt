-- Apple CEO Tim Cook expects China, the world's most populous country, to become the No. 1 market for the company. If China Mobile gets its own version of iPhone, as rumor has it recently, then it would be a shot in the arm for Apple. Among the three main telecommunications companies in the country, China Mobile is the only one without Apple's iPhone support despite the fact that it is the largest operator with nearly 700 million subscribers. Even the bad press surrounding Foxconn, the main manufacturer of Apple products, did not make too much of a dent on the company's sales. One day, Apple products can and will be replaced.
