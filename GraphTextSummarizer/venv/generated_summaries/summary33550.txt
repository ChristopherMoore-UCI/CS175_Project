-- While most sitting Supreme Court justices refuse to comment about current and future nominees to that bench, one member says she can't wait to welcome Judge Sonia Sotomayor to that exclusive club. We can be sensitive to things that are said in draft opinions that [male justices] are not aware can be offensive." Ginsburg used the word "same" to describe the outcome, Sotomayor used the word "better," a wording she has told senators privately she now regrets. Ginsburg told reporter Joan Biskupic that oral arguments in the 2009 pregnancy case were, "just for me, Ledbetter repeated." Ginsburg is still recovering from surgery and post-operation chemotherapy after an early diagnosis in January for pancreatic cancer. But President Obama, in the first bill he signed when taking office in January, made law the Lily Ledbetter Act. She told USA Today just weeks before Justice David Souter announced his retirement that more women should join her.
