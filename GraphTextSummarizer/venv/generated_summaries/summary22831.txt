The Thai senate rejected the bill on November 11, but opposition demonstrators have called since then for Yingluck's government to be replaced. The face-to-face meeting came the same day protesters tried to force their way into the government headquarters and a police club compound, hoping to find Yingluck. But the military intervened in 2006 when it ousted Yingluck's brother -- and then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- in a bloodless coup. "The most violently active areas are around the Government House," said Lt. Gen. Paradon Pattanathabut, referring to the government headquarters. In recent days, the demonstrators have been seeking out increasingly high-profile targets, such as several government ministries.
