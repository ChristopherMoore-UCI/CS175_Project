I'm so tired of labels, and it seems that EVERYTHING in life and society reinforces those labels. The fashion magazines, the media, the news, our parents, our brothers and sisters, our friends, our neighbors, the church, the mosque, the guy on the corner who never met me is enforcing labels and controlling my thoughts and actions according to those labels. I want to see fewer stereotypes in the media, less "Barbie" and "Conan," and more of us regular folk who are just as beautiful as people need to be -- maybe more beautiful -- if you look beyond the label. Look around and see how many things point us into a label and divide us as people into those labels. I now understand what I'm really doing and see what you see in me." You all who are reading this might ask, "What the heck are you talking about?" Putting my answer simply, two things: I like people -- no labels -- just people.
