Such a landfall would spare Bermuda "the worst of the storm surge, but will inflict some of the highest wind speeds ... on the island," said CNN meteorologist Angela Fritz. Large waves generated by the storm were already pounding beaches Saturday afternoon, said CNN iReporter Michael Branco. As of 11 p.m. EST Saturday, Igor was about 285 miles (455 km) south of Bermuda, packing sustained winds of about 100 mph (160 kph) as it headed north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). Conditions on the island were deteriorating late Saturday ahead of Igor's expected passover late Sunday or early Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. "Our roofs, which we use to catch our drinking water, can sometimes be vulnerable to high winds and pressure changes, so fingers crossed our roof is OK," he said.
