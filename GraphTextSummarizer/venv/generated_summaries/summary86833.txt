In the immediate future, however, Mason and his team believe their study is a "first step" towards protecting the health of New Yorkers -- and could be the basis for a "smart city" where leaders use the data to improve city planning as well as management of mass transit and human health. New York City health officials called the study "deeply flawed. After sequencing samples were picked up at subway stations, researchers determined that nearly half did "not match any known organism" -- a fact that underscores "the vast wealth of unknown species that are ubiquitous in urban areas," the report said. Scientists chose the New York City subway system because it is the largest in the world by station count and transports 5.5 million people per day, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The study found that DNA swabbed at certain subway stations paralleled the ethnic demographic of the community that lived around it.
