Success on day 14 of Obamacare site October 1 was supposed to be the big day -- the day they could finally buy a policy without worrying about denials for pre-existing conditions or sky-high premiums that only millionaires could afford. I don't need health insurance -- I get it from my employer -- but I wanted to see how easy (or difficult) it is for the millions of Americans who do need insurance and want to shop on the new exchanges set up by Obamacare. Healthcare.gov's glitches, on the other hand, are so overwhelming that Ezra Klein of The Washington Post's Wonkblog has deemed it a "failure," at least so far. Millions like him were relieved that health insurance would finally be a sure thing, not something they had to yearn for or worry over. I've covered health care reform for 25 years, first as a print reporter in Washington and then for CNN.
