Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu isn't aiming to disrespect President Obama or muddy the waters of American politics when he speaks before Congress, the country's ambassador said Sunday. Israel deeply appreciates the strong support we have received from President Obama in many areas: in enhanced security cooperation, heightened intelligence sharing, generous military assistance and Iron Dome funding, and opposition to anti-Israel initiatives at the United Nations," Dermer said. Iran has denied working toward a nuclear weapon, insisting its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. It is his most sacred duty -- to do whatever he can to prevent Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons that can be aimed at Israel. Netanyahu is expected to lobby Congress to approve tough new sanctions on Iran.
