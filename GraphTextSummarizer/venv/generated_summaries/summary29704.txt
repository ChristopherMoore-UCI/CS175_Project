Just ask David Willis, a tourist from Texas who was inadvertently locked inside a London retailer for several hours, after strolling in minutes before the store was closing. Willis, from Dallas, entered the Waterstones store near London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening to use the store's WiFi. After several hours of waiting, he took to social media to broadcast his plight, posting on Twitter and Instagram. The bookstore posted its own Twitter message shortly afterward, announcing: "We're pleased to announce that @DWill_ is a free man once more. After three hours in captivity, Willis followed that with his own Twitter declaration: "I'm free".
