Children's Hospital Colorado has treated over 4,000 children with severe respiratory illness since August 18, said Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control. The children were hospitalized between August 9 and September 28 with muscle weakness in their limbs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. " Enterovirus: My son was 'like a goldfish gasping for breath' A cluster of children with similar paralysis symptoms was identified in California last year. This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma.
