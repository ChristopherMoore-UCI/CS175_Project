The three men, who are part of a team of injured soldiers taking part in the challenge, were named as Justin Birchall, 40, a team driver and civilian volunteer, whose Wildcat vehicle retired earlier in the race, former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer and Gulf War and Falklands war veteran Lee Townsend, a team mechanic, and retired Army Major John Winskill, the team logistics expert. The squad of 28 includes both British and U.S. service people who were wounded during combat and have missing limbs, spinal injuries and psychological injuries. -- The Race to Dakar has been marred by injuries to three Britons after they were involved in a road traffic accident in South America, which left two others dead. Although the race used to be held in Europe with the climax in Senegal, Africa, it was moved to South America in 2009 following threats of terrorism. Team leader Captain Tony Harris said: "Our hearts go out to the families and relatives of those who have died in this tragic accident and we offer them our condolences and sympathy.
