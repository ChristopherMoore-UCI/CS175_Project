The body of James Heselden, 62, was pulled from the River Wharfe in northern England on Sunday, police said. -- The owner of the Segway company has died, apparently in an accident involving one of his upright two-wheeled vehicles, police in England said Monday. It hailed his charitable work, saying that a donation of 10 million British pounds (nearly $16 million) to a local foundation earlier this month raised his lifetime charitable giving to 23 million pounds (over $36 million). " Heselden was the chairman of Hesco Bastion, a company that manufactures protective walls used by military troops. He also owned Segway Inc. Hesco Bastion confirmed "with great sadness" that Heselden had died "in a tragic accident near his home."
