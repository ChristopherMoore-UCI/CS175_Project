Emotional issue Britain has a different attitude toward horses than some of its European neighbors, with the idea of eating horse meat an emotional one, he said. The Olympic equestrian referred to the transport of horses from countries such as Poland, the source of some horse meat, saying many horses left looking "absolutely wonderful" but suffered in transit. "If that's true then and they value their horses -- they look after them well because they're in the horse meat trade -- and it's the transport that's the problem, should we be considering a real market for horse meat, and would that reduce the number of welfare cases?" -- Princess Anne's suggestion that Britons need to reconsider their reluctance to eat horse meat was "brave" and reflects a sad decline in horses' value, the head of a horse welfare charity says. "As I was reminded, not so long ago, by somebody who'd traveled in France, the most expensive piece of meat in the local butcher was a fillet of horse meat," she said.
