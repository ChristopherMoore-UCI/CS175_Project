CAI, a consortium of 18 Italian entrepreneurs, won control of Alitalia in the fall, after numerous talks with Fantozzi and Italian government officials and despite protests and strikes that canceled hundreds of flights and increased losses for the company. -- The board of ailing Italian airline Alitalia has accepted an offer from Air France-KLM to buy 25 percent of the company and become its international partner, Alitalia announced Monday evening. Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi campaigned last year on a promise to keep Alitalia under Italian ownership. Sabelli said Alitalia fares will not increase. Alitalia declared bankruptcy in August and the government placed Augusto Fantozzi as administrator.
