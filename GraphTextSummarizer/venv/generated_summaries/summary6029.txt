" New shooting spurs more talk on gun control Authorities have not said what weapons were found with Spengler, though Pickering said "probably at least a rifle was used" to shoot the first responders. "It appears that it was a trap," Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said. " Authorities do not know how Spengler -- who was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after the four firefighters were shot -- obtained the weapon or weapons he used or why he opened fire, Pickering told reporters. "When we get there, we have people down, we have raging fires, and we have gunshots going off," Pickering said. Police officers rushed to the scene, and one of the first ones there exchanged fire, "in all likelihood, (saving) many lives," according to the police chief.
