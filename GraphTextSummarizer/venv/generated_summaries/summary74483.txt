The digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs: minimum wage jobs (think Amazon warehouse employees) and so-called "sharing-economy jobs" (think Uber drivers). Sharing economy jobs aren't really jobs at all; they're freelance gigs. Sure, Silicon Valley doesn't owe America jobs. America needs to realize that instead of creating jobs, Silicon Valley is erasing them, leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground. But wait â€” won't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs?
