" She said incidents involving the MNLF were occurring only in the Talon-Talon, Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, Kasanyangan, Canela and Mampang areas. Roxas said almost 13,000 people had been evacuated amid fighting between government armed forces and an estimated 300 armed Muslim rebels in blockaded areas of the city. He said government forces and the rebels had a sporadic firefight in the Barangay Santa Catalina area Wednesday afternoon. Rebels, he said, had also fired on security forces and government aircraft with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. "Government forces continue to come in and adopt a nonaggressive stance," he said, adding that the government's policy was to show restraint during the siege.
