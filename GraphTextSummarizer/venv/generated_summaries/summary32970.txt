-- Indonesia's president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has apologized to Singapore and Malaysia for the hazardous air pollution caused by smoke from forest fires raging in his country. Jakarta has sent planes, helicopters and an extra 3,000 personnel to fight the fires, which have been blamed on the clearing of land for palm oil plantations "For this incident, I, as President of Indonesia, would like to apologize to Singapore and Malaysia and ask for their understanding. Schools in many areas of Malaysia were closed on Monday and a state of emergency was declared in two southern regions after the country's air pollution scale spiked to hazardous levels on Sunday morning, Bernama, Malaysia's state news agency reported. Authorities in Singapore are anxious to avoid a repeat of the 1997 Southeast Asian haze, which the government estimates cost $9 billion in health care costs and disrupted air travel and business. Singapore said it would take legal action against local companies found to be involved and pressed Indonesia to provide evidence, the New Straits Times reported.
