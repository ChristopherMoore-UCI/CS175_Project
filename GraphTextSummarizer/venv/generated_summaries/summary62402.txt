Cycling is a sport with a dark doping past but the way it has cleaned up its act is a model for athletics to follow, says Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell. The retired British sprinter called for change after track stars Tyson Gay of the U.S. and Jamaica's Asafa Powell both tested positive for banned substances. " Campbell, who also clinched silver over 200 meters at Sydney 2000, has long been a supporter of lifetime bans for athletes who chose to take banned substances, a sanction currently not allowed under the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) code. Campbell is pleased to see anti-doping authorities clamping down on athletes regardless of their stature. "Athletics needs to have a look at cycling and see how they handled the Lance Armstrong situation and how over time people started to believe in the sport again," Campbell, who won 4 x 100 meter gold at Athens 2004, told CNN.
