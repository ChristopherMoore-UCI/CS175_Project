As military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan have squeezed the central leadership of al Qaeda, its affiliates have stepped forward as the main perpetrators of terror attacks, though recently challenged for the spotlight by ISIS. It re-emerged, reinvigorated, in Yemen in 2009 after the Saudi outfit merged with a Yemeni al Qaeda counterpart, the analysis said. AQAP late last year issued a rebuke to ISIS -- already cut off by al Qaeda's general command in February -- reflecting a certain rivalry between al Qaeda and ISIS, as the latter seeks to extend its reach beyond Iraq and Syria. The group's current incarnation "is widely considered to be the al Qaeda regional franchise that represents the most serious international threat," it concludes. A leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for last week's deadly attack by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
