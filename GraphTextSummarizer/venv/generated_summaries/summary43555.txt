Slater (Mario Lopez) and Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkley) and administrator Mr. Belding (Dennis Haskins). There were plenty of inside jokes about Jessie becoming a stripper (Berkley famously took it off in the film "Showgirls") and Zack and Kelly moving to Beverly Hills (Thiessen had a role on the TV series "Beverly Hills 90210").
