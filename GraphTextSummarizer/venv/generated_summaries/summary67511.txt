"It's ludicrous to suggest that Facebook leads to divorce and we would suggest that anyone who purports to have conducted surveys about the topic also ask respondents about other popular communication channels, such as text messaging, chat sites and email, before jumping to conclusions," Noyes said. Another recent survey by Divorce-Online.co.uk of more than 5,000 divorce petitions says Facebook is mentioned in about 20 percent of divorce cases. Stacey Kaiser, a psychotherapist and relationship expert, says she estimates Facebook plays a much larger factor in divorces. He says that if there is trouble within a marriage or a relationship, "the affair's going to happen anyway," but Facebook "makes it much easier." Andrew Noyes, a spokesman for Facebook, says the website is not responsible for breaking up marriages. Savage, who says he has nothing against Facebook and uses it regularly to connect with childhood friends, told HLN's "Prime News" Wednesday that the networking site is simply "a tool for an affair."
