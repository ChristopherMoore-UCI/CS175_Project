Fire officials said the Crown Fire represents the biggest challenge. -- More favorable weather conditions Saturday helped firefighters in their bid to contain the roaring Crown Fire, one of several in southern California. Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency for Kern County, located approximately 130 miles north of Los Angeles. Authorities said that they had lifted evacuation orders and most residents had returned home, while hundreds of firefighters and more than a dozen aircraft worked to extinguish the Crown Fire. "We were very fortunate not to have fires for some time, because the air was cool and we didn't have the experience of dry weather and all of these winds and so on, but all of a sudden the fire season kicked in," he said Friday.
