When the divers find the fields of nets, they begin the labor of cutting them free piece by piece and all by hand. But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets. But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets. "If you had nets strung along the streets that are catching bunny rabbits and squirrels, we wouldn't be discussing whether we should be removing them. In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets.
