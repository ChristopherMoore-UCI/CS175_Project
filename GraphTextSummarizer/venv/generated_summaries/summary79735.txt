We were assistant U.S. attorneys in the Eastern District of New York, which covers Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. She is a workhorse, not a show horse, and she has flourished doing the hard, ordinary work of federal prosecution -- narcotics cases, organized crime (always big in Brooklyn), public corruption (ditto) and civil rights violations. -- New junior federal prosecutors literally started in the basement of the U.S. courthouse in downtown Brooklyn. She has no public track record on these policy issues, though she has aggressively prosecuted narcotics offenders in Brooklyn. She has been U.S. attorney twice in the courthouse where she came up -- first under President Bill Clinton and currently under President Barack Obama.
