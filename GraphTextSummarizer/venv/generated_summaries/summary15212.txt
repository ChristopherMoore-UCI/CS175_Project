Rural Virginia residents shaken by case So what happened to Kevin Quick? Civic leaders have put up $22,500 in reward money for information leading to Quick, Edwards said. That meal was the last time Quick's credit card was used, according to Edwards. Quick had been legally separated from his wife since 2007, but their divorce was not final, Edwards said. And given what they know about Quick, 45, and the case so far, the Virginia State Police have announced they suspect foul play.
