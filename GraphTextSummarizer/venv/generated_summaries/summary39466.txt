"I believe that my religion requires me to wear a beard." Hasan made the statement after the presiding judge, Col. Gregory Gross, asked why he was still in contempt of court -- in other words, why Hasan hadn't shaved his beard, which is against Army regulations. Gross postponed that hearing, then found Hasan in contempt of court at a July hearing, fined him $1,000 and warned him he would be shaved by force unless he got rid of the beard. The trial was delayed when Hasan's legal team petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals to prevent Gross from ordering Hasan's facial hair shaved. The Court of Appeals found that Hasan's petition was "premature" because Gross had not yet issued a definitive order. Hasan was found in contempt of court again Thursday, fined $1,000 and sent from the court to a trailer where Hasan watched the rest of the proceedings via closed circuit TV.
