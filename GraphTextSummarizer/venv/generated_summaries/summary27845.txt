Two teens found guilty in Steubenville rape case This verdict is a consequence not only of the defendants' actions that night, but also of decades of change in how society views sexual conduct -- and how the law has evolved in response to this change. -- The Steubenville, Ohio, rape case has made national headlines because it represents a perfect storm of inappropriate sexual conduct, high-school football heroes, social media and viral YouTube videos. Alcohol will still be present at parties and will still be an element in many sexual encounters -- but now prosecutors, judges and juries will impose their own standards for the acceptable level of impairment. Today, it brings protesters into the streets and creates a nationwide outcry about sexual abuse. (In the Steubenville case, the question was decided by the judge because the case was in juvenile court.)
