Last month, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, who is the head of the judiciary of East Azerbaijan province, said Ashtiani's crimes were "numerous" and said she was "convicted of adultery and murder and was sentenced to death," according to the official news agency IRNA. "I was found guilty of adultery [in 2006] and was acquitted of murder, but the man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned but he is not sentenced to death," Ashtiani said. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani and attorney Hootan Kian say even though Ashtiani was cleared of her husband's murder five years ago, Iran continues to insist she was found guilty. Kian's letter said the man actually convicted in the death of Ashtiani's husband, "admitted in the branch that he administered the electrifying of Mr. [Ebrahim] Ghaderzadeh himself with his own hands three times and each time the deceased received electrical shock." -- A woman facing possible stoning and one of her lawyers argue that Iran is mischaracterizing the status of adultery and murder charges against her.
