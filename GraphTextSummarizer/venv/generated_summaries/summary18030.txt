-- Saturday marked the start of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of spring in the Southern Hemisphere. We received more than 1,700 submissions from six continents, including plenty of pumpkins and colorful leaves, but also shots of beaches and even one taken underwater! Users uploaded photos to iReport using the CNN mobile apps, via email and on iReport.com. CNN celebrated the change of seasons with a global mobile photography project. The photos were shared on social media with the hashtags #hellofall and #hellospring.
