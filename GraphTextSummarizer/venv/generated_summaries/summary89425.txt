Austin Police spokeswoman Veneza Bremner identified her as Sandy Thuy Le, 26. Gates also said Le's family has been through a lot in recent years, first losing their home in Hurricane Katrina, then their shrimping business was financially hurt by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. A family spokesperson said Le's family was by her side at the hospital in Austin when she died Monday morning. Owens, 21, was charged last week with two counts of capital murder. -- A third person has died as a result of last week's incident in which a driver plowed into people at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, police said Monday.
