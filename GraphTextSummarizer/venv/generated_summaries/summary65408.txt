The spectacle of young and promising college football players being selected by legendary NFL franchises now garners so much interest, that day one of the Draft is watched by more people than an NBA Finals game -- that's including LeBron James and the Miami Heat's triumph last season. On February 3, the Baltimore Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII in what was a thrilling finale to the NFL season. The event is held in New York City's Radio City Music Hall, with rabid NFL fans allowed to attend, and most importantly, all three days televised nationally with non-stop coverage. But the number two pick that year was Ryan Leaf -- arguably the biggest bust in NFL history after he was released just a few years into his career. While the Super Bowl has always been "the" event in the U.S., the NFL Draft has steadily gathered more steam through the decades to be what it is today.
