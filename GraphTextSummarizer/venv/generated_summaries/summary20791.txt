Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama "Antichrist." Halloween is nearly upon us, but "Antichrist" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called "Vows of Chastity." The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: "Chaos reigns!"
