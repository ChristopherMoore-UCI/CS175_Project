Riddick, co-written and directed by David Twohy, scavenges a variety of genres for parts, morphing over the course of its run time from survival story to slasher film (as Riddick hunts his hunters one by one) to a climactic Aliens-esque siege by slithery, slavering creatures. The franchise's third entry shrinks back from the baroque, byzantine space opera of 2004's "The Chronicles of Riddick," placing Vin Diesel's interstellar criminal in a story that's more similar in scope to the series' first film, the smart and stylish "Pitch Black" (2000). Abandoned on a sere, hostile planet, the laconic antihero subsists off the meager landscape like a muscle-bound Robinson Crusoe until an ensemble of bounty hunters and soldiers (including "Battlestar Galactica's" Katee Sackhoff) arrive looking to put his head â€” with those superpowered, see-in-the-dark eyes â€” in a box.
