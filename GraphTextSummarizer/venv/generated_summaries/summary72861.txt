" Nadal, the first man to win an ATP Tour event six times in a row, is seeking to extend his record of Masters Series titles to 19 following hard-court final defeats in Miami and Indian Wells by Djokovic -- who missed this tournament due to injury. Ninth-ranked Melzer was playing in his first Masters Series semifinal, having become the first Austrian to reach the last-four stage in Monte Carlo since clay-court legend Thomas Muster 15 years ago. The Spaniard had to battle for almost three hours before overcoming third seed Andy Murray, whose hopes of a first win on the surface against Nadal were ultimately hampered by an elbow injury. World No. 3 Vera Zvonareva thrashed Sara Errani 6-0 6-2 in Saturday's first singles match, then two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova battled past Roberta Vinci 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 6-1. Murray's participation was in doubt before the first serve as he needed a pre-match injection, and he required lengthy treatment in the deciding set at 3-0 down -- having been denied it after the previous game due to tournament rules.
