"I've been doing this for 41 years and this is the worst wreck with this number of people I've seen," said Calhoun County Sheriff Billy Gore. Mitchell Diggs, a spokesman for the University of Mississippi, said the group from Ackerman High School in Choctaw County was in Oxford for a typical admissions visit for seniors. Calhoun City is in north central Mississippi. A tractor-trailer clipped one bus carrying students back from a college visit and then struck another head-on, leaving three dead, Mississippi authorities said Tuesday. A teacher, school bus driver and the driver of the big rig died in the Tuesday afternoon incident near Calhoun City, authorities said.
