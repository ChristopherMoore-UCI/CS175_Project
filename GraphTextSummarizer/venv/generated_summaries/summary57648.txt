First look at Dubai's new A380 concourse "Five swift years have gone by since Emirates changed the face of air travel with this remarkable aircraft," said Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline in a press statement. British Airways was the latest to join the A380 club last month; the UK flag-carrier will begin using the jet on its high-volume London to Los Angeles and London to Hong Kong routes from October. Last week the Dubai-based airline marked five years of flying the A380 and earlier this year opened a dedicated A380 concourse at Dubai airport. According to Emirates, since their first A380 flight in August 2008, the airline has loaded 4 million bread rolls onto their superjumbo planes from their Dubai base, along with more than 157,000 fresh flower displays, 538,500 baby food jars, over 1 million toothbrushes and more than 4 million teabags.
