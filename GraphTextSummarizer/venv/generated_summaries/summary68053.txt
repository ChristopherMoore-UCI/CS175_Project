Last year, Los Angeles' La Gran Limpieza collected 25 tons of trash from cigarette butts to "river treasures," as Backlar put it, consisting of shopping carts, a hammock, a sleeping bag and a Barbie doll with dreadlocks. It becomes theirs," said Gail Cunningham, senior vice president of Keep America Beautiful and managing director of the Great American Cleanup. Added volunteer Judy Bloom, 48: "I spent a couple of hours picking up several bags of trash and it was primarily plastic, about 90%. Keep America Beautiful -- the nonprofit group that sponsored the Great American Cleanup "National Day of Action" -- organized trash-clearing activities in nearly all 50 states, as well as special large-scale events in 10 locales, including Los Angeles. About 450 people, including 250 from a local Mormon church, collected 400 bags of trash -- including a king-size mattress, an animal skull, and a discarded wheelbarrow -- from one stretch of the river, said Shelly Backlar, the river group's executive director.
