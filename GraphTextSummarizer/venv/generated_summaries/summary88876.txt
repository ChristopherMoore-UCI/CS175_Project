With Tourette syndrome, there's not just compulsive actions, but compulsive thoughts as well. People believe that if you can shut your Tourette's off for a period of time, then you can always shut it off. Some people, unfortunately, don't believe that, and to them I would say, "Step into my shoes for a day." CNN: You've teamed up with a foundation called Jaylen's Challenge to visit schools and educate kids about Tourette's and bullying. I try to explain to people that if I spent my whole life trying to control my tics, that's all I would have time for. If I can just accept it, and tic when I want to and have my passion project -- what I'm mentally, physically, emotionally invested in something -- where you're fully focused and your body ports and mind are all moving toward this one goal, you're focused and you can shut it off, but only for a certain period of time.
