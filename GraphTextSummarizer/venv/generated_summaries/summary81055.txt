"The process used to be just spraying some kind of a detergent right directly onto the fabric itself and scrubbing the heck out of it and causing it to look like some kind of a fur or something," said Mitch Poole, clubhouse manager for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Still others watch the players get dirty with ground-in dirt and grass stains and wonder, "How do they get those uniforms looking so brand new for the next day? Then, during a road trip to Phoenix about four years ago, Poole was talking with the clubhouse manager from the Arizona Diamondbacks and discovered the team used a new product, "Slide Out." Poole said what they came up with, Slide Out, is to him a miracle product. They are called nature stains: grass, ground-in dirt, blood and sweat.
