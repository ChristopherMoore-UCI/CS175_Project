Asked by a defense attorney whether he had ordered a blood test for Holmes, Appel said he had not. On July 7, Holmes used an online ticketing service to buy a ticket for the midnight showing of the movie, according to Detective Craig Appel, the lead investigator in the case. Holmes sitting in his underwear, T-shirt and white socks after police had cut away his body armor -- making puppets of the paper bags officers had placed over his hands to preserve gunpowder evidence, according to Appel. The photographs were recovered from Holmes' cell phone and go along with months of sales records and descriptions of meticulously prepared booby traps at his home. At some point, according to Pearson, one of Holmes' weapons jammed. "Had the AR-15 not jammed, he would have killed more people," she said.
