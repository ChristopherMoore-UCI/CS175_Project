I've had a running e-mail chain for weeks with the chairman of DragonCon about ACC versus SEC," said DragonCon spokesman Dan Carroll. Kris Harter, a chemist and DragonCon attendee, says it's not always easy for the two groups to get along, but there's enough room for everyone. She says that three years on, DragonCon attendees are more accepting of the football fans and are joining in during the buildup toward the game. Because it's so massive, DragonCon attendees need to prepare, Harter said. Atlanta's long-established science fiction and fantasy convention DragonCon and Chick-fil-A's college football extravaganza are the strangest of bedfellows.
