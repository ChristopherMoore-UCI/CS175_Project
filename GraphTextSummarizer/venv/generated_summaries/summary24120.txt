Foster was arrested in Plano, Texas, more than 250 miles north of the scene of the shooting, at the North Harris campus of Lone Star College just outside Houston. Trey Foster, 22, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, said Christina Garza, media manager at the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Harris County officials have said the January 22 shooting apparently stemmed from an argument between two men. Another man, 22-year-old Carlton Berry, was arrested on the day of the shooting and charged with aggravated assault. The shooting garnered wide media attention amid early fears that once again, a gunman was on the loose on a campus.
