-- Documents chronicling the life of South Africa's first black president Nelson Mandela are now freely available to his fans around the world, thanks to a new online digital archive. "It is a pioneering step to digitize Mr Mandela's own records and to post them online." The archive extends from the earliest known record of Mandela -- a Methodist church membership card issued in 1929 -- to handwritten notes taken during the talks to end apartheid, and beyond. The concept behind the project is that spreading Mandela's life story will help promote a message of social justice through the world. The Nelson Mandela Digital Archive Project contains nearly 2000 mementos from of the life of the 93-year-old, casting an intimate light on the life of the anti-apartheid leader.
