Stomachs weren't the only thing full over Thanksgiving weekend — so were movie theaters showing The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Catching Fire set a new record for both the 3-day and 5-day Thanksgiving weekend, surpassing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which grossed $57.5 million/$82.4 million in 2001. Amazingly, Disney's animated musical Frozen also broke Harry Potter's records during its opening weekend, though it wasn't quite as gigantic as Catching Fire. The film pulled in a terrific $110.1 million over the Wednesday-to-Sunday period — $74.5 million of that during the traditional weekend frame — which gives the sequel a stunning $296.5 million domestic total after only 10 days. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire -- $110.1 million 2.
