Symbian and Android will dominate the mobile operating system market by 2014, research firm Gartner said Friday. IDC likewise said that Android OS will take the second spot behind Symbian in 2014, but it pegged Android's worldwide market share at 24.6 percent, compared to Symbian's 32.9 percent. By the end of 2010, Gartner says, Google's Android will sneak into second place behind Nokia-backed Symbian with 17.7 percent market share, compared to Symbian's 40.1 percent. Gartner expects that Symbian and Android together will account for 59.8 percent of the total worldwide mobile OS market by 2014, split almost equally -- Gartner thinks Symbian will still lead the mobile market in 2014 due to "Nokia's volume and the push into more mass-market price points."
