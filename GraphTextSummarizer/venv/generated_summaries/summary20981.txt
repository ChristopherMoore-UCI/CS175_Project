Other members who attended included Rep. Patrick Meehan, who co-hosted with Miller, Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, Rep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois, former Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, and Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey. Rep. Tom Reed, R-New York, said Christie "had a good message about the future" and felt "impressed by his delivery." "I thought the most ironic part of what the President said last night was when he said he ran his last campaign," the New Jersey Republican told reporters in Washington on Wednesday morning. Kirk is sponsoring the legislation with Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. Billed an informal meet-and-greet, the event was arranged by Rep. Candice Miller of Detroit, who said she likes Christie's "blunt" style and wanted to provide an opportunity for him to spell out his vision for the future of the party and to meet other lawmakers.
