Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Getting into North Korea was one of the weirdest processes VBS has ever dealt with. As the days went on, North Korea presented us with progressively stranger sights and encounters. All the other diners left, and these women came out and started singing North Korean nationalist songs. We went straight to the stadium, and there were 40,000 people in the stands, portraying the history of the North Korean revolution with flip cards. And we're willing to bet we'd hate jail in North Korea.
