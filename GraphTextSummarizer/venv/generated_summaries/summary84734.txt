The court's ruling on transgender, transsexual and third-gender people recognizes that their plight cannot be ignored, said Graeme Reid, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. The ruling states that "gender identity is integral to the dignity of an individual and is at the core of 'personal autonomy' and 'self-determination.'" Hijras, the ruling said, must be considered a third gender "over and above binary genders under our Constitution and the laws." "It begins the process of re-establishing the important social role that third-gender people played in traditional Indian society," he said. The law bans people from engaging in "carnal acts against the order of nature" and dates back to British colonial times. The ruling means transsexual and transgender people and those who identify as belonging to the "third gender" will not be required to submit medical evidence of their sexuality to be recognized by the government as a member of that gender, said Tripti Tandon, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs.
