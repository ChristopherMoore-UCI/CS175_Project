Here are some notable listings: Most expensive: A framed portrait of Dwight Schrute Currently going for: $609.99 with 24 bids Description (which kind of reads like Mr. Schrute wrote it himself): "The item is approximately 33.5 inches tall by 27.5 inches long. NBC Universal is holding an eBay auction featuring wardrobe props, Schrute weaponry, and Cornell paraphernalia from the Scranton, Pa.-based show. Most unlikely source to stock your self-defense cabinet: Dwight's mace and pepper spray (part of a used tactical accessory set) If you're the lucky winner, don't plan on using Dwight's sprays to ward off would-be attackers, as the listing description warns: "The Mace and Pepper spray are assumed to be in working condition but could not be tested due to the nature of the items."
