Pentagon releases official timeline of Benghazi attack Sen. Rand Paul: Heads should roll over Benghazi, but Rice is not the issue "What is clear is that this administration, including the president himself, has intentionally misinformed -- read that, lied -- to the American people in the aftermath of this tragedy," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California, a GOP member of the House Foreign Affairs committee that on Thursday convened a panel of experts not directly connected with the Benghazi attack. His comments didn't appear to dampen GOP criticisms of Rice and, thus, the Obama administration at Thursday's House Intelligence Committee hearing. Besides learning more about the attack, some Republicans in recent days have focused on comments made by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice days afterward, when she suggested the attack came after a protest against an anti-Muslim video produced in the United States. Obama: Republican criticism over Rice 'outrageous' After that hearing, Rep. Adam Schiff echoed the president's comments on Rice, saying those "claiming that the U.N. ambassador had some different information ... are either unfamiliar with the facts or willfully ignoring them."
