The pilot left Oroville at 12:10 p.m. local time, with Bozeman as the destination and Butte as the alternate, according to an instrument flight rules flight plan the pilot filed. Fourteen people were killed when the plane slammed into a cemetery March 22 in Butte, and investigators immediately began focusing on why the pilot asked to divert the flight from Bozeman, Montana, to Butte, 80 miles to the west. The aircraft slammed into a cemetery about 500 feet short of the Butte airport. The preliminary NTSB report said "visual meteorological conditions prevailed" at both Bozeman and Butte. -- The pilot of a plane that crashed last month in Montana twice requested a change of destination in radio comments to air traffic controllers but "gave no reason for the diversion," according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board issued Thursday.
