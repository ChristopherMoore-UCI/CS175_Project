An interesting project from Agence France Presse maps and measures diplomatic tweets around the world on its E-Diplomacy Hub. -- Hours before the United Nations General Assembly voted to recognize the Palestinian Authority as a non-member observer state, the official U.N. Twitter account made a very unfortunate one-character typo. The @UN account has 1,129,488 followers and is part of an active social media program run by the U.N. The person responsible, U.N. information officer Nancy Groves, quickly acknowledged her mistake on Twitter and explained the reason for the delayed correction. As Twitter becomes a more common place for countries to communicate, directly or passive-aggressively, typos and mistakes will probably become more commonplace. Twitter is an increasingly fertile ground for diplomatic communications around the world.
