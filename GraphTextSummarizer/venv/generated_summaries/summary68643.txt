-- New French sensation Christophe Lemaitre completed the 100-200 sprint double at the European Championships in Barcelona on Friday but only after a desperately close finish to the longer race. Lemaitre, who won the 100m title on Wednesday, hit the front in his final stride as he overhauled and then outdipped Britain's Christian Malcolm to win in 20.37 seconds. Welshman Malcolm, so often the nearly man at major championships, led from the gun and was clocked in 20.38 seconds. He succeeds Portugal's Francis Obikwelu, who also achieved the 100m-200m double in 2006. Lemaitre's compatriot Martial Mbandjock took his second bronze of the championships after finishing third in the 100m.
