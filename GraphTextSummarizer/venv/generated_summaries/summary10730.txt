Report: U.S., Pakistan had secret agreement on dozens of drone strikes The drone strike that Mazari linked the CIA officials to happened in northwest Pakistan. She gave the names of U.S. CIA Director John Brennan and a person identified as the CIA's Station Chief based in Pakistan. It was said to be one of the first U.S. drone strikes outside of Pakistan's tribal districts. "I can't speak to the alleged operational issues, but more broadly I note we have a strong ongoing dialogue with Pakistan regarding all aspects of our bilateral relationship and shared interests," a U.S. Embassy official in Pakistan told CNN. In 2010, the CIA recalled its top spy in Pakistan after he was identified in a lawsuit filed by a man whose son and brother were killed by a drone strike.
