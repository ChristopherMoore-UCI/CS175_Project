"Everything is fresh, made to order, and for lunch we are hoping for the bustling kind of energy like the movie scene (from 'Beauty and the Beast') in the dining room," says Lenny DeGeorge, Walt Disney World executive chef. Located in the Castle Courtyard in the center of Fantasyland, it will be a place for guests to meet Disney princess characters. "It gives guests another level of immersion," says Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. Overall, the new additions certainly have Disney fans aflutter, but will this translate to an influx of Orlando visitors? In true Disney style, the decor inside and out is over the top.
