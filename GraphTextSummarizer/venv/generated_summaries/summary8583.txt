Sabre Holdings Corp. will stop offering American Airlines fares on its global distribution system in August, a month before the airline's contract is set to expire, according to Chris Kroeger, Sabre's senior vice president of marketing. When the airline and online travel site Expedia couldn't reach a distribution agreement, Expedia removed American Airlines fares and schedules from the site on January 1. Customers looking to compare flights online can visit other travel sites such as kayak.com, priceline.com or travel agencies, American Airlines said, as well as the carrier's own website, aa.com. "In contrast, the actions only serve to protect Sabre's market position and attempt to force airlines and travel agencies to rely exclusively on its legacy systems that only lead to higher fares and fewer choices for consumers. " Sabre, one of several airfare global distribution systems, says American's plan will make it harder for consumers to comparison shop.
