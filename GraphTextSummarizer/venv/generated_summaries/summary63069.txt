Late Chief Justice Rehnquist honored A marble bust of late Chief Justice William Rehnquist was recently unveiled at the Supreme Court's Upper Great Hall. Court sources say, however, that several justices are aware of the fantasy league and find it interesting. Court sources say that the 55-year-old justice has found the caseload a bit overwhelming at times and that she has been working long hours and spending many late evenings at the court. He was elevated to chief justice in 1986 after serving as an associate justice for nearly 15 years. "Despite his modest and unassuming ways, he has left a permanent impression on this institution, both as a great justice and a great chief justice," said Chief Justice John Roberts, who was a law clerk to Rehnquist and counted him as a mentor.
