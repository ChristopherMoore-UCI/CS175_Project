Lavrov: 'They are spreading lies' The pro-Russian uprising in Ukraine's east follows Moscow's annexation of Crimea, a move that emboldened other pro-Russian Ukrainians in the country's east. In the cities of east Ukraine, the atmosphere seemed more relaxed than it was a few days ago, with many residents apparently welcoming the presence of pro-Russian forces and their seized military vehicles. Ukraine's armored vehicles rolled Wednesday, but its attempt to take back eastern towns from pro-Russian militants seemed to stall. In Slaviansk, north of Kramatorsk and about 100 miles from the border with Russia, pro-Russian militants now appear to be firmly in control of the town, according to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh on the ground. After days of urging pro-Russian militants to vacate buildings they have seized, on Tuesday they sent in troops.
