"When we arrested them, they were in possession of a loaded firearm." Earlier this week, authorities arrested Stewart's mother on accusations of helping the two murder suspects escape jail by sneaking in hacksaw blades. Quincy Vernard Stewart, 36, and Cortez Rashod Hooper, 23, escaped from jail Monday and were captured by law officers Thursday night in Texarkana, Arkansas, Schoefield said. "When about 22 prisoners were taken out of the courtroom with Stewart being one of them, his mother was able to pass to him a bag containing hacksaw blades, small amount of marijuana and a cell phone," Schoefield said. Stewart had a court date on May 20 in the courthouse in downtown Texarkana, and Stewart's mother was in the gallery, Schoefield said. Schoefield said Charlene Stewart was arrested late Tuesday and was in a Texarkana jail facing felony charges of furnishing prohibited articles and implements of escape.
