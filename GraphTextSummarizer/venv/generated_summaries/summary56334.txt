Argentina allows personal consumption of marijuana, and a federal judge had issued a stay against prosecuting the unnamed woman, who swore she used the marijuana solely for herself, the government's Judicial Information Center said last week. Mexico also enacted a law in August that decriminalized possession of small quantities of most drugs, including marijuana, heroin, cocaine and LSD. Earlier last year, a Brazilian appeals court ruled possession of drugs for personal use is not illegal. The unanimous ruling made Argentina the second Latin American country within a one-week span last year to allow personal use of a formerly illegal drug. Argentina's Supreme Court ruled in August it is unconstitutional to punish an adult for private use of marijuana -- as long as the use doesn't harm anyone else.
