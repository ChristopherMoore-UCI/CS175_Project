Beginning next season these decisions can be reviewed: -- Batter hit by pitch; -- Fair/foul (outfield only); -- Fan interference; -- Force play (except the fielder's touching of second base on a double play); -- Ground-rule double; -- Home run; -- One runner passing another on the base paths; -- Record keeping (Ball/strike count to a batter, outs, score, and substitutions); -- Stadium boundary call (e.g., fielder into stands, ball into stands triggering dead ball); -- Tag on baserunner (including steals and pickoffs); -- Trapped ball (outfield only); -- "The opportunity for our fans to see more replays in our ballparks is also an important modification that the clubs and I favored. "The new system will give managers valuable recourse in potentially game-changing situations," outgoing Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said through a written statement. The replay officials will be based in New York at what MLB calls the Replay Command Center, staffed by more umpires. -- Managers will be able to demand review of up to two umpiring decisions beginning full time with the regular season in April, Major League Baseball announced Thursday.
