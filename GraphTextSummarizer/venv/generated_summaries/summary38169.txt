To openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible, and good luck finding other blacks who also don't believe. The lack of people of color at secular events is a problem -- partly because there is unawareness of such events existing, but also because there is limited effort placed in accommodation and care. Does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just don't gravitate towards nonbelief, or are there other factors which keep us hidden? It is very important to note however, that the Internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other, and there is a large community of us online. In fact, African-American atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of American atheists at large.
