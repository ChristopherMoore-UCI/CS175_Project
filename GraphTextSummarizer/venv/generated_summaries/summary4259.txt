The vulgar photograph of Todd Carney, taken at a nightclub urinal, created a storm on social media, prompting the Cronulla Sharks club to release a statement Sunday announcing it had ended the player's contract with immediate effect. 'Heavy price' Carney's agent, David Riolo, appeared on Sydney radio station 2UE Monday saying his client had been dealt with unduly harshly by the club. -- An Australian rugby league star has been sacked from his club in disgrace after a photograph circulated on social media that appeared to show him urinating into his own mouth. "The photograph that appeared last night on social media does not meet the values and standards the club is looking to uphold and take into the future. "When Todd was first signed to the Sharks he was made well aware of his responsibilities both on and off the field, to himself, the club and to the game in general," read the statement, issued by the club's CEO Steve Noyce.
