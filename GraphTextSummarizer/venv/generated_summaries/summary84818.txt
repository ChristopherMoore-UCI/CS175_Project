But the larger reason to reduce our dependence on oil is this: Even if we as a society don't care about oil spills destroying natural environments, we've got to care -- eventually we will all care -- about how burning this oil is destroying our environment through climate change. And regardless of how safe we make oil drilling, tankers, or pipelines, we'll never reduce spill risk to zero. Twenty-five years ago on March 24, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into Bligh Reef and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into the cold, clear waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound -- one of the "last best places" on Earth. There's not much we can do now for Prince William Sound, short of protecting it from more harm. No wonder one of OPEC's founders, Juan Pablo PÃ©rez Alfonso, once called oil "el excremento del diablo," or the devil's excrement.
