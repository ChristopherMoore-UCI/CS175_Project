" CNN has spoken to several U.S. officials with access to the latest intelligence on Syria, who confirmed the information. U.S. intelligence agencies, the Defense Department, the State Department and White House are all reviewing the information. "As per the declaration by Syria, the site was confirmed as dismantled and long abandoned with the building showing extensive battle damage," the statement said. The intelligence is not definitive, but "there are various threads of information that would shake our confidence," one U.S. official said. But while the inspection progresses, the United States is looking at new classified intelligence suggesting that Syria might not fully declare its chemical weapons stockpile, CNN has learned.
