And to put this unknown in context of the things we do know: when it comes to maintaining super-human levels of focus and concentration, female drivers have got all that it takes to challenge in F1, he insists. But she is happy to show patience and wait for a chance to come her way: "There's no pushing women in to get the quota higher, it's simply happening in an organic way," says the Scot -- who is married to Toto Wolff, executive director at the dominant F1 team this season, Mercedes, and a shareholder at Williams. Add to that the sport's danger -- made clear by the tragic crash suffered by de Villota, once the most visible female face of F1, before her death last year -- and here the inevitable boon of publicity works against a trailblazing woman driver. Whether Wolff is the woman to show that female drivers really can be banked on, no-one wants to guess. 'She doesn't have the strength' "I know that women have around 30% less muscle than men," says Wolff.
