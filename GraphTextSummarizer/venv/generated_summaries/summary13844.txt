No, I was a girl, I was my ethnic group Luo, I was middle class, I was many things before I was black, so it was like a rearrangement when I came here and realized that in America that's the first thing that people notice about me. Since then, the award ceremonies and opportunities to dazzle photographers have been plentiful for Nyong'o, whose mesmerizing performance as Patsey earned her numerous accolades and recognition, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. And I've felt relief as well that people are registering Patsey's loftiness -- in praising me I feel like her spirit is being uplifted, really, because what I met in those pages of Solomon Northup's book was heartbreaking -- and it still breaks my heart -- and inspiring, and I had the privilege of bringing her back to life. Where do you go inside yourself to play a role like that of Patsey with such generosity of spirit? So you were born in Mexico but grew up in Kenya.
