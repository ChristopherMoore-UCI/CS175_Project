Further protests were scheduled to take place in Bahrain on Monday, making the country the latest in a string of nations to experience popular protests that began in Tunisia. Recently, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa offered more than $2,500 to Bahraini families, ostensibly in celebration of Monday's 10th annivesary of the adoption of the country's National Action Charter. The unrest spreading through North Africa and the Middle East has reached the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain, according to reports from the state news agency. Bahrain hosts the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. The injuries occurred during an attack on a police station during protests Sunday evening, the news agency said.
