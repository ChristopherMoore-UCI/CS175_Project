Fine wins over English Premier League Tottenham Hotspur and Dutch side AZ Alkmaar had left Benfica with the opportunity to reach another final, but Juve have the incentive of a possible title match in their home Turin Stadium on May 14. -- Benfica's hopes of snapping a 52-year title drought in Europe were revived by a stunning late winner from substitute Rodrigo Lima in a 2-1 victory over Serie A giants Juventus in Lisbon Thursday. His sublime 84th minute strike left Gianluigi Buffon clutching at fresh air to leave Juventus with work to do in the second leg of the Europa League semifinal in Turin next week. Benfica have not won a major trophy since winning the old European Cup in 1962, despite playing in seven finals in various competitions since, beaten by Chelsea in the title match of the Europa League last year. But Benfica's top scorer Lima, on target twice as his side wrapped up their 33rd Portuguese League title at the weekend, had other ideas as he converted from Enzo Perez's pass.
