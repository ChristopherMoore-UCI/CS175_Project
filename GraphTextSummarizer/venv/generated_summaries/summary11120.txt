Lawrence may have lost out on a best supporting actress Oscar for her "American Hustle" role -- that went to Lupita Nyong'o for "12 Years A Slave" -- but she's won the Internet with this performance. In the movie, Lawrence sings along to Wings' "Live and Let Die" with such fervor it left us wishing she had a second career as a cover band frontwoman. But it gets even better: it turns out Lawrence also filmed a scene with Santana's 1969 track "Evil Ways" as the song of choice. In the David O. Russell dramedy, Lawrence plays Rosalyn Rosenfeld, a '70s housewife with a penchant for belting out the era's hits while scrubbing down her home. The sequence didn't make it into the final film, but the DVD/Blu-ray, released on March 18, includes extended outtakes like this one: Clearly, we've been approaching housecleaning in the wrong way.
