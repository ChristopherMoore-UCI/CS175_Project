Thompson had not allowed local law enforcement onto the farm to check the pens, Muskingum County Sheriff Matthew Lutz said. "Zoo officials encourage lawmakers to pass a bill quickly to ensure public safety and protect the welfare of animals," the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a news release. Two spotted leopards, two macaque monkeys and a brown bear were returned to Marian Thompson, widow of farmer Terry Thompson, who set off a scare in October when he let loose 50 dangerous animals from his farm before shooting himself. -- Five exotic animals once owned by an Ohio man who last year set free dozens of animals before committing suicide were returned to the man's widow Friday. "If we are pushed to do what we had to do the last time, we would take care of it." Legislation that would tighten rules regarding private ownership of exotic animals passed the Ohio Senate in April and is now being heard in the House of Representatives.
