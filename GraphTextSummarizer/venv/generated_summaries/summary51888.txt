Those same exit polls found that former GOP Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is also considering a 2016 run, is seen as a better presidential option in the state than Hillary Clinton. By 2008, Arkansas was seen as so unfriendly to Democrats that Obama wrote the state off -- even as he won other southern states like North Carolina and Virginia that Republicans carried for decades. In the final weeks of the 2014 election, top Democrats in Arkansas told Hillary Clinton and her associates that she wasn't welcome to stump for the party's candidates in the state, according to a knowledgeable source. This state launched the Clinton brand two decades ago and handed Hillary Clinton one of the biggest victories of her 2008 primary battle against Barack Obama. Bill Clinton made up for the absence, making 13 stops in the state during campaign season imploring voters to not make the election a repudiation of President Barack Obama.
