More than 70 officers were killed in a suspected Maoist ambush in Chhattisgarh state last month in what was seen as one of the most daring attacks by the left-wing guerrillas on Indian security forces. Authorities identified some suspects, but had not yet made any arrests, said Bhupinder Singh, police chief in West Bengal state. Singh told reporters Friday that officers had found Maoist posters claiming responsibility for the attack. Maoist rebels are suspected of causing the crash by removing the fasteners securing the tracks, police said. About 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said.
