Manchester United went five points clear at the top of the Premier League as goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar set a new English record for minutes in not conceding a goal in the 1-0 victory over Everton. He had taken Petr Cech's Premier League record in the 5-0 win at West Bromwich Albion last week and has now had 12 straight clean sheets. Everton's failure to score by the 73rd minute at Old Trafford left van der Sar unbeaten for 1,104 minutes. United manager Alex Ferguson was delighted with yet another clean sheet and the three points. In truth, Everton, missing three strikers through injury, rarely troubled van der Sar with most of the action at the other end.
