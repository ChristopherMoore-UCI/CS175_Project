Households will be moved to Shachuan Village, in the western part of the mudslides-leveled county, said Yang Jianguo, a government official in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture which administers Zhouqu. The mudslides occurred in Zhouqu County in Gansu province. China has been drenched by heavy rains and floods since the end of May and the devastating Gansu mudslides occurred in early August. The death toll from the mudslides in a northwestern Chinese province now stands at 1,407, state-run Xinhua news agency said Friday, citing the government. More than 1,000 tents will be erected at a new settlement zone with three tents for each family, said Yang, quoted by Xinhua.
