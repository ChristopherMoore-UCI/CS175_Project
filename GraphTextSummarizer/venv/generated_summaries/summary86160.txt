A goal midway through the first half from Kerrar Jasim proved enough to gain Iraq second place in Group D and secure a showdown with Group C winners Australia, with a semifinal place for the winners. The quarterfinal stage gets under way on Friday, with host nation Qatar tackling three-time champions Japan and Group A winners Uzbekistan facing Jordan. Similar Incidents that followed Saturday's win over United Arab Emirates saw three people killed and seven others wounded, accoring to local health officials. It is an Iraqi tradition to celebrate by firing pistols or machineguns into the air, but Baghdad Military Operation Command issued warnings that some insurgency groups might take advantage of these shootings and conduct terrorist attacks against Iraqi security forces or civilians. Arash Afshin, Mohammad Nori and a Walid Abbas own goal gave Iran victory although both teams finished with 10 men after Afshin and UAE defender Khalid Sebil both saw red in separate incidents.
