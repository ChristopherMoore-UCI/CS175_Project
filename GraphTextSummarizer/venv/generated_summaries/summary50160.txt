But according to authorities, Knight (and DeJesus) explained it very differently: Castro punched, kicked and jumped on her stomach, forced her to do exercises and starved her for days. And there were the restraints -- duct tape, plastic zip ties, metal chains fastened to a basement pole and bedroom walls -- to ensure that Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus wouldn't leave. Michelle Knight: 'After 11 years, I'm finally being heard' The following April, Castro spotted Amanda Berry walking along a Cleveland street in her Burger King. The prosecution didn't have to present evidence Thursday, but they did -- laying out in vivid detail the twisted torment that Knight, DeJesus, Berry and Berry's young daughter, fathered by Castro, went through -- in testimony, impact statements and a sentencing memorandum. Castro had a gun that he'd show to Knight, DeJesus and Berry, threatening to shoot them if they ever tried to escape, prosecutors said.
