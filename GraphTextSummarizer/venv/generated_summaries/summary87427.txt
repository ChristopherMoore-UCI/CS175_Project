"It is critical for the South African government to engage with consumer countries and to fight against international syndicates involved in illegal rhino horn trade," said Dr. Jo Shaw, rhino coordinator for the WWF in South Africa. "Rhino numbers continue to grow in South Africa as more rhinos are being born than are dying, even when poaching mortalities are taken into account," Shaw said. One of the nations linked to the trade is Vietnam and a collaboration action between the two against illegal rhino horn trade remains unsigned, according to Shaw. -- A record number of rhinos have been killed this year in South Africa, fueled by the belief that their horns can cure cancer. "There is also an urgent need for law enforcement actions by neighboring countries implicated as transit routes for illegal trade in rhino horn," the coordinator said.
