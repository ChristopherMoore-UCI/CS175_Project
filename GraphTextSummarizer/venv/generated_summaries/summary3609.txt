And Russia's defense budget -- $78 billion in 2012 -- dwarfs that of Ukraine -- $1.6 billion in 2012, according to Jane's Defence Weekly.

According to the CIA World Factbook, Ukraine has 15.7 million males and females ages 16-49 fit for military service. Those figures may have been on the mind of Ukraine's acting defense minister, Ihor Tenyuh, on Sunday. As of last month, Russian armed forces numbered 774,500 versus 139,000 for Ukraine, according to Jane's Information Group.
