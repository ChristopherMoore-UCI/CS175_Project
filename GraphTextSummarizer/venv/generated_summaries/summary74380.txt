Call Wendy Davis or any other female politician a "whore" and a "bad mother" enough and American women will start to wonder what you think about them.

This isn't a debate over Davis' values, but rather a reminder that she is a woman, and that a woman's place is at home. Still, this controversy could be the best thing that's happened for Davis, and for female politicians in general. And let's be honest: Would people accept Davis as a legitimate candidate for Texas governor if she had skipped school in favor of staying home with her kids?
