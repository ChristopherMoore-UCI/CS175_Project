The refining company Motiva has notified officials that an estimated 300,000 gallons of diesel spilled at its facility in Sewaren, New Jersey, when Superstorm Sandy pushed through, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said. Shell said terminals in New Jersey and New York had flooding because of the storm surge, as well as loss of power. The Coast Guard is providing oversight of Motiva's cleanup, which includes the placement of containment booms, according to Tibbets. 'Jersey Shore' cast on Sandy devastation "Previously deployed booms are continuing to skim released product in the Woodbridge Creek adjacent to the site," Shell said in a statement. The Coast Guard, Motiva and state officials will work to verify the spill amount, Tibbets said.
