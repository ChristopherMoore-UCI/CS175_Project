Militants on Tuesday "mortared" a NATO-led "combat outpost with white phosphorus and high explosive rounds" in Paktika province, the coalition said. The Taliban has alleged that U.S. forces used the chemical in fighting insurgents May 4 in Farah province and injured civilians, but that assertion has been denied by the U.S. military. On Saturday, troops found white phosphorous mortar rounds in Bamiyan and a white phosphorus rocket in a military base in Nangarhar province. The U.S. military earlier this month declassified a report of 44 events in Afghanistan in which it said insurgents "used or stockpiled" munitions made of white phosphorus. "The data, obtained from incident reporting from February 2003 through the present, show that insurgents have stockpiled and used white phosphorus against personnel in both indirect fire attacks as well as improvised explosive devices," the military said.
