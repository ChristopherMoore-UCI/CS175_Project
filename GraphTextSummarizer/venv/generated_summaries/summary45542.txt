Lifetime marriage is turning into a crapshoot for many people, especially Baby Boomers. Now, long marriages have no guarantees of continuance, even if they have lasted decades. Just ask Robert Redford and Lola Van Wagenen (27 years) or Jerry Lewis and Patti Palmer (36 years). Maybe holding on till "death do them part" is least likely for Hollywood stars whose work takes a hard toll on their relationships and whose exit from marriages is not generally impeded by financial concerns. Hollywood marriages face special pressures that hurt their odds of lasting forever.
