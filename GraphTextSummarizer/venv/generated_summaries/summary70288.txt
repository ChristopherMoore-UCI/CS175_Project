-- Police arrested rapper-producer Kanye West on Thursday morning at Los Angeles International Airport on felony vandalism charges after an altercation with two paparazzi, airport police said. The incident near the airport's Terminal 4 involved the rap star; his road manager and bodyguard, Don Crowley; and a photographer and a cameraman who were taking their photos, airport police said. Initial police reports that said Crowley also had been charged with battery were incorrect, police said. West, a 10-time Grammy winner, and Crowley were in the airport to catch a flight to Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. West was released later Thursday after posting $20,000 bond, according to Los Angeles police Officer Julianne Sohn.
