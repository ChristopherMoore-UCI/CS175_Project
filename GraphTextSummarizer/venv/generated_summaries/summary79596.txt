Yuma International Airport spokeswoman Gen Grosse said passengers were tended to and given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac was close to 100 degrees. He said the airline offered passengers accommodations in Yuma, but did not know if any passengers chose to stay. " "I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us," passenger Greg Hansen said. "The safety of our Customers and Employees is our primary concern, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries," said Mike Van de Ven, Southwest's executive vice president and chief operating officer. Meanwhile, passengers who were aboard the crippled the Boeing 737 said they had feared for their lives.
