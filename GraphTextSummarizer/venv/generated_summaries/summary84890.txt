Devices highlighted at this year's Mobile World Congress and Consumer Electronics Show suggest the future is bright for phones and tablets that are both stylish and waterproof -- or at least water-resistant. "If you're having a bath and you really want to enjoy that great movie ... and (the tablet) accidentally falls into the bath, it's OK," said Xperia Z product manager Sharath Muddaiah. "I can't tell you how many people I know who've accidentally dropped their phone in the toilet, or their kid spilled their juice box all over it," CNET senior writer Maggie Reardon told CNN. Consumer electronics and water don't mix, and for many, there are few things more nerve-racking than a smartphone or tablet that's been accidentally doused. The Xperia Z's makers said it can withstand sprays of water -- such as sprinkler play on a lawn or a water fight.
