But for U.S. teens, cell phones (especially text messaging) are a key way to stay connected with friends and other people in their lives, according to new research from the Pew Internet & American Life Project. White teens are most likely to have a cell phone (81%), vs. 72% of black teens and 63% of Hispanic teens. For teens, cell phones appear to correlate with social privilege.

Interestingly, Pew found that smartphone-using teens are slightly less likely than teens with simpler feature phones to have recently used a computer to access the Internet.
