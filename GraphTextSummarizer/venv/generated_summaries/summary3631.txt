The game began in dramatic circumstances when Italy defender Matteo Gentili shoved Liverpool striker Krisztian Nemeth in the penalty area in the opening minute. Hungary captainr Vladimir Koman sent Vincenzo Fiorillo the wrong way from the spot to give Hungary an early lead -- the quickest goal of the tournament so far. Despite the man disadvantage, Italy rallied and levelled in the 82nd minute when substitute Giacomo Bonaventura threaded a delightful throughball to Antonio Mazzotta in the box and the left-back finished superbly. Remarkably though, just a minute later Italy equalized again when Giacomo Bonaventura ran at the Hungary defence and unleashed a shot which flew home. The match went into extra time and in the 112th minute, Koman found Nemeth with a delightful pass and the striker made no mistake.
