The next president will have to decide how America will fight ISIS, and al Qaeda, the rival terror groups who share an anti-modern, anti-Western ideology backed by brutal terrorist tactics, which have already left thousands of dead Americans, including on U.S. soil -- a reminder that simply ignoring the problem because it seems distant and intractable is not a viable option. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, more hawkish than Obama, called years ago for arming moderate Syrian rebels, but would that have meant U.S. weaponry would have ultimately ended in ISIS hands, as rebels have changed sides or lost to the ultra-radical Islamists backing ISIS or al Qaeda? Just watch President Barack Obama struggle with a war in Iraq and Syria during his final years in office; watch him discuss what kind of U.S. military he will hand over to the next president, and think back to the campaign promises that put him in office, a vow to end America's "dumb war" in Iraq. Sen. Rand Paul has offered a confusing mix of isolationism and interventionism, blaming U.S. interventions for the crisis while saying he supports the fight against ISIS. Four years after Obama declared "the time has come for [Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad] to step aside," al-Assad is massacring Syrian civilians with barely a whiff of condemnation from an international community now more concerned with ISIS.
