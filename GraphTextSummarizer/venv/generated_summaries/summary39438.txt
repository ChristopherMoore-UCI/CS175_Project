In the letter, Abedini thanked Obama for meeting with his wife, Naghmeh Abedini, and their children in Boise, Idaho on January 22. " Abedini's letter to Obama was posted online by the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), an organization founded by television evangelist Pat Robertson that has worked to publicize Abedini's situation. Despite their grueling emotional journey, Abedini family members say they continue to hold on to hope as they make headway in bringing increased attention to Saeed Abedini's story, both in the United States and internationally. Earlier this month, the Obama administration called for Abedini's immediate release, along with other Americans held in Iran, including Washington Post Tehran Bureau Chief Jason Rezaian. Naghmeh Abedini said Obama promised her the United States will "keep at it until Saeed is released."
