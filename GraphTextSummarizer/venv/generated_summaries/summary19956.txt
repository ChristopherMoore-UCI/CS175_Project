Marina Brozovic, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said the space agency was able to train a great deal of high-powered instruments -- including the massive radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico -- on the asteroid as it approached. Goldstone antennas are very sensitive radio telescopes used to investigate quasars, radar mapping of planets and comets.

As the object neared Earth, NASA studied the asteroid with the Goldstone radar antennas in California's Mojave Desert. YU55 passed within 202,000 miles of Earth -- about four-fifths of the distance to the moon -- at 6:28 p.m. Tuesday, NASA said.
