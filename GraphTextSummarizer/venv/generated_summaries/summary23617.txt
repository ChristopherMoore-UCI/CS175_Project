At the time, the U.S. policy -- directed by President Richard Nixon and his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger -- was to resolutely support Pakistan, from which Bangladesh was trying to secede. -- The legacy of U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died on Tuesday, spreads far and wide, and across the ocean to now-independent Bangladesh. Two months later -- in February 1972 -- Kennedy flew to Bangladesh and delivered a speech at Dhaka University, where the killing rampage had begun a year earlier. On December 16, 1971, Bangladesh gained independence after a 10-month struggle, in which 1 million to 3 million Bengalis were killed. He said America had prospered despite predictions that it would collapse following independence, and so would Bangladesh. "Even though the United States government does not recognize you, the people of the world do recognize you," Kennedy told the crowd.
