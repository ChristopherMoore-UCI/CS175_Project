The journalist used his official Twitter account to say "from PR, Kobani is the real Benghazi, the beseiged fortress where president really can & must save heroic defenders." Geraldo Rivera tweeted over the weekend about Kobani, a key Syrian city that has been a focus in the battle against ISIS. "I had learned how to use Twitter a couple of weeks ago and there I was." But while we get that Rivera was enjoying his time in Puerto Rico, it seemed strange that his tweet would include a topless selfie of himself. It's not like topless selfies haven't stirred the pot for the 71-year-old before.
