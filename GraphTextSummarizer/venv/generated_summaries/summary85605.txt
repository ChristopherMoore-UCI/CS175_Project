Janet Camacho, the sister of Joshua Camacho and a friend of Ludemann's; Jilica Smith, a friend of Janet Camacho's; Ashley Lovelady, Ludemann's best friend; and Dustin Grimes, a friend of Wade's ex-boyfriend. Prosecutors are expected Thursday to play other recordings of threatening voicemail messages left on Ludemann's cell phone by Wade in the eight months before the attack. Smith and Janet Camacho both testified that while they were driving to a McDonald's with Ludemann in her minivan, they heard their friend on the phone with Wade and said they heard Wade tell her, "I'm going to stab you and your Mexican boyfriend. Ludemann then rushed over to Laboy's house, where Wade was at her car with a knife nearby, Janet Camacho and Smith testified. Wade stabbed Ludemann, who was unarmed, twice in the chest, and Ludemann died at the scene.
