But there are all the makings of a spirited conversation for President Barack Obama and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, when this Washington odd couple meets at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. The President called but could not reach McConnell on election night last month, just hours after he beat Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes to win reelection in Kentucky and all but secure his place as the next Senate Majority Leader. start time for Wednesday's meeting is a bit early to share that "Kentucky bourbon" with McConnell, as Obama offered at his post midterms news conference last month. While Obama and McConnell rarely ever sit down together privately, the two leaders have held such meetings a few more times than what has been previously acknowledged by aides to both men. But given that McConnell once vowed to make Obama a one-term president, perhaps the best both men can expect is a healthy pour of Washington reality.
