Elsewhere Thursday, two NATO service members were killed in eastern Afghanistan, according to an International Security Assistance Force statement. Last month, coalition forces reported a day-long fire fight in a "known Haqqani network" area in southeastern Afghanistan that left at least 50 alleged insurgents dead. The Kandahar provincial council chief was considered an influential power-broker and key presidential ally in the country's southern provinces. Last week, militants stormed the compound of the governor of Afghanistan's Uruzgan province. Meanwhile, coalition forces say they captured a senior Haqqani leader, responsible for more than 250 fighters, in the southeastern province of Paktiya.
