Police knock down Bynes sex harassment claim Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, they said. Once inside, the officers noticed a bong and other marijuana paraphernalia sitting on a coffee table, which Bynes immediately started to throw out a window, police said. Police charged Bynes with tampering with physical evidence, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of marijuana after they were called to her building in Manhattan's theater district. Bynes wore a waist-length aqua and blonde-colored wig from her unusual collection of hair pieces, a tank top, sweatpants and sneakers as she stood silently before the Manhattan Criminal Court judge. New York police later said an internal affairs investigation found no evidence of the sexual harassment claim.
