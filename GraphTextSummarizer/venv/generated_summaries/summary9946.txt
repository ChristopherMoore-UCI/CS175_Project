Still, I don't get why he's not completely hyper-crazy-bonkers-insane about food like other dogs. I simply can't imagine how one actually gains that much weight sitting behind bars, presumably separated by several states and (at the very least) a sheet of plexiglass from Paula Deen. A relative of the elderly couple eventually put out a plea for help, and a willing foster mom emerged in Portland, Oregon. But despite my dog's disinterest in food, what's even more amazing is that Obie -- that short, stumpy dachshund -- actually weighs more than Mikey. Vanatta started a Facebook page for Obie -- who's otherwise healthy -- to track his weight loss and solicit donations for help.
