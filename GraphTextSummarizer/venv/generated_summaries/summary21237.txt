If Uruguay beat Tahiti on Sunday, then Nigeria's Super Eagles would have to inflict Spain's first defeat of the tournament in order to qualify. However, the battle for semifinal places will go to the last round of Group B matches, following Uruguay's 2-1 victory over Uruguay in Thursday's late match. "Tahiti set an example in terms of fair play and went forward whenever they had the opportunity," Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said. Captain Diego Lugano gave Uruguay the lead in the 19th minute but Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel equalized eight minutes before the break. Spain, the reigning world and European champions taking on Tahiti, ranked 138th by the game's governing body FIFA, one place below Syria.
