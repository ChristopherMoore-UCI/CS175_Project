"It is extremely unfortunate that this couple's trip into the Yellowstone backcountry has ended in tragedy," said Dan Wenk, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park. A man was killed by a grizzly bear Wednesday morning at Yellowstone National Park, according to the National Park Service. Park visitors are advised to hike in groups of three or more people and to be alert for bears and make noise in blind spots. A bear warning sign was posted at the head of the trail because of known bear activity along access points. There have been no reports of bear encounters along or near the Wapiti Lake trail this season, park spokesman Al Nash said in the statement.
