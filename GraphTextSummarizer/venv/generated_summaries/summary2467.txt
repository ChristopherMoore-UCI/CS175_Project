Von Hagens says he relies on donors not only as a source of specimens, but also as representations of Body Worlds' philosophy. In 1993, von Hagens founded the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany, a research center that performs plastination and manages the Body Worlds exhibits. Years later, Dixon's curiosity drew her and her twin sister, Erlyene Toney-Alvarez, to Body Worlds, an exhibit that shows preserved human specimens bisected and stripped of skin. Legislation is pending in several states that would require shows like Body Worlds to prove donor consent before they open. He insists that the specimens in Body Worlds exhibits come from donors.
