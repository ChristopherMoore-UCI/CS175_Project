As they rethink their role, states should adopt a first step of providing for an independent, special counsel to investigate police deadly force cases -- stepping in for the local prosecutor and presenting evidence to the grand jury. There are already thousands of defendants across the country jailed pending trial, trying to choose between pleading guilty to a shaky charge or risking a much higher sentence at trial. But a typical case with substantial defense evidence (for example, bystanders who support the defendant's account and corroborating physical evidence) never gets to a grand jury in the first place. Not because there is a "high bar" to federal prosecution as some reporting suggests, but because there is not enough evidence to go to trial. One of the worst outcomes of recent events would be if prosecutors and grand jurors internalize the notion that the public wants cases to advance to trial notwithstanding substantial doubts about guilt.
