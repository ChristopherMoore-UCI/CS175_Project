In a letter this month to ISAF forces, Petraeus said the attacks may increase the risk of civilian casualties and put Afghan and ISAF forces in difficult situations. The strike provoked the ire of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who strongly condemned the airstrike and insisted he was warning the U.S military and government "for the last time" on behalf of the Afghan people about civilian deaths. "Unfortunately, the compound the insurgents purposefully occupied was later discovered to house innocent civilians," Toolan said in his statement.. Even as a full investigation into the incident continues, the ISAF commander said, "We will ensure we make amends to the families (of those killed) in accordance with Afghan culture. In March, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates offered a personal apology to Afghan President Karzai for the killings of nine boys in a helicopter attack targeting insurgents. Residents claimed that projectiles coming from a coalition helicopter hit two houses where women and children were staying, ISAF spokesman Daud Ahamadi had said earlier.
