McNamara was first invited by the Nazar√© Town Hall in 2010 as part of a three-year project to explore the local coast's unique geomorphic phenomenon and to bring more awareness to the area as a destination for big-wave enthusiasts. Simultaneously fearsome and awesome, this may be the moment Hawaiian rider Garret McNamara on Monday broke his own record for the largest wave ever surfed. "It was just this endless drop and my feet were popping out of the straps," McNamara told CNN's Anderson Cooper. There's definitely something wrong," McNamara said in his interview with Cooper. A group of extreme surfers descended on the Portugal coast this past week, providing some amazing experiences for onshore observers and some very social media-friendly video and photos.
