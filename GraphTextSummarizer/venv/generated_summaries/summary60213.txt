Toben also testified about an alleged sex tape involving Edwards and Hunter, which will not be shown to the jury, and whether Young had ever suggested he wanted to sell it. The defense team for the former U.S. senator has argued that Andrew Young, an Edwards aide, had largely used the money for his own personal gain while also paying for Hunter's medical expenses during her pregnancy to hide the affair from Edwards' wife. The witness said he found the idea "astonishing," given the then-rampant rumors of Edwards' affair and child with Hunter. Attorney: Donor knew money wasn't for Edwards' campaign "While I never asked Fred Baron to spend a dime, I stood by and watched him support Quinn," he said in an early draft, Button testified. Prosecution witness Tim Toben, a developer and green energy entrepreneur, said during cross examination that during a dinner with Edwards, the candidate was optimistic about his chances of his being selected as Obama's running mate.
