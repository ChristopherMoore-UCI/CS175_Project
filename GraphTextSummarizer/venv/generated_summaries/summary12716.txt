In a televised speech Monday, Vice President Amado Boudou said the situation was similar to the time when Fernandez temporarily handed presidential powers over to him when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid. -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is doing well as she recovers from surgery, officials said Tuesday. The president is in her room and is in very good spirits," presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said in a statement. Over the weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work. Doctors said there were no complications in the surgery to remove a blood clot from the surface of Fernandez's brain.
