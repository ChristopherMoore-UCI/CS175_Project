Like other Obama online portals, the site encourages user interaction. Visitors to Recovery.gov are greeted with a video message from President Obama. Clicking on "Where is Your Money Going" on the new site brings up a chart displaying key areas where the $787 billion will be distributed, including tax relief, energy, health care and infrastructure and science. Recovery.gov, launched within hours of Obama's signing of the stimulus bill Tuesday, continues the theme of offering information in a user-friendly format. The site will publish information on how the stimulus funds will be spent in a "timely, targeted and transparent manner," Obama said.
