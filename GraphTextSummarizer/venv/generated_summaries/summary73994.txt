The export producers federation Fepex issued a statement Wednesday saying the "priority now is to return to normal in the European markets for fruits and vegetables and re-establish confidence in Spanish products after Germany corrected itself on Tuesday and removed Spanish cucumbers as the origin of the lethal strain of E. coli. The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Spain will not rule out "taking action against the authorities (in Germany) who questioned the quality of our products." The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, has reported 1,064 cases of E. coli infection, and 470 cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious complication that can result from E. coli. Spanish officials have been denying accusations that their country was the cause of a deadly E. coli outbreak that has swept across Germany and Sweden.
