Male chauvinism While Costa is the first ever female coach in French professional football, Nelly Viennot previously served as an assistant referee in France, also featuring in Champions League games. But both were forced to leave the broadcaster in 2011 shortly after they were caught making derogatory remarks about female match official Sian Massey. French second-tier side Clermont Foot hinted at a new dawn for the sport after appointing the country's first ever professional female coach for a male team. "This appointment will allow Clermont Foot 63 to begin a new era, relying on a group of 17 players currently under contract, which will be added by young players from the club." The 36-year-old will become the first female coach of a French professional football club, while her appointment, announced Wednesday, represents the first time a team in the top two divisions of one of Europe's big five leagues -- Spain, Germany, England, Italy and France -- has hired a female manager.
