-- Singer Amy Winehouse's death this summer was the result of alcohol poisoning, an inquest ruled Wednesday, as it reached a verdict of "death by misadventure. Winehouse was determined to do things her own way, including therapy, Romete said, but was aware of the risks of alcohol abuse. Testimony at her inquest showed no traces of illegal drugs in Winehouse's system -- but more details emerged about her losing battle with alcohol. Goodman said the ruling "underlines how important our work with the Amy Winehouse Foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name." Winehouse's family said in August that toxicology tests had found that "no illegal substances" were in her system at the time of her death but alcohol was present. "The court heard that Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time.
