-- A former Kaufman County, Texas, justice of the peace -- whose home, one day ago, was searched by authorities investigating the deaths of two Texas prosecutors -- is under arrest, law officers said Saturday. Williams told North Texas TV station KXAS earlier this month that he understands why authorities wanted to meet with him. Williams has a history with law enforcement authorities, including the Kaufman County District Attorney's office. Federal, state and local authorities looking into Hasse's and the McLellands' deaths executed a search warrant at Williams' home on Friday afternoon, FBI spokeswoman Katherine Chaumont said. Eric Williams was arrested by sheriff's office members in Kaufman County and charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a "terroristic threat."
