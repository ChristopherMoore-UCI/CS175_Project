Lebwohl says one of his colleagues at Mount Sinai has done great work in mapping the causes of vitiligo in the immune system. "The body acts as if it's allergic to its pigment cells," said Dr. Mark Lebwohl, a professor and dermatologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. After Thomas explained he had vitiligo, the boy asked if they could play Frisbee. "It's not really the ignorance," Thomas said about the lack of awareness surrounding vitiligo. Thomas has written a book, "Turning White," and often speaks about his experience with vitiligo.
