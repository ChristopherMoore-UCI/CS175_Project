Primatologist Dr. Jatna Supriatna scans the treetops in a national park on the island of Java, looking for gibbons. Gibbons are a vital part of this already fragile ecosystem, crucial to seed distribution and the health of the ecosystem. Baby gibbons are also subject to illegal poaching because they are considered cute pets and, according to Supriatna, selling for thousands of dollars on the black market. " In a project run by Conservation International, primatologists are trying to rehabilitate gibbons they saved from people's homes. UuUu, a 7-year-old female, is tranquilized and gently moved to the "introduction cage." Because gibbons live in family groups, her only chance of survival in the wild is with a mate.
