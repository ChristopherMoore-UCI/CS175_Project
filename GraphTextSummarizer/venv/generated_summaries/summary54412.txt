Bautista, who has flown planes ranging from small Cessnas to fighter jets to Boeing 747 airliners, spoke with CNN from his home in California's central San Joaquin Valley about his work on "Planes," and he pulled back the curtain to reveal a few behind-the-scenes details. Although aviation enthusiasts tend to appreciate authenticity, attention to detail and accuracy, let's remind ourselves that this is a fantasy movie about planes that talk. Or are these characters just amalgamations of planes that might look familiar to us but are not actual aircraft that we might see in real life? We can't have them go faster than they would in real life compared to other airplanes. "Planes" aims to celebrate the same passion for travel across skyways that "Cars" did for highways.
