Controversial sketches Vilks made depicting the Prophet Mohammed in 2007 landed him on an al Qaeda hit list with a $100,000 bounty on his head and have sparked a number of threats and attacks against him. Vilks receives regular death threats and regularly sweeps his car for explosives. And if you have people who want to go out with guns and start murdering people, the thing you should do is put these people in prison, because we cannot accept people murdering and trying in that way to stop the discussion you have," he said. "And as long as that goes on, criticism of Islam is to be continued, and rightly so." Vilks said his work and those who are discussing it are "part of a political conversation." "They were just waiting (to see) who is going to open the door there and who will come in."
