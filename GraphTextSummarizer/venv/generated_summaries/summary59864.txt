Never showed up for family birthday party His family reported him missing the following day, after Quick failed to show up for the birthday party for his brother that he'd planned.

In 1990, Quick joined his father in the reserve arm of the Waynesboro, Virginia, police department -- members of which aren't paid but hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms like full-timers.
