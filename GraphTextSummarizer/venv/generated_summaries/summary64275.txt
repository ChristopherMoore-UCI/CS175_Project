Bolivia's constitutional court voted unanimously to allow President Evo Morales to run for a third term in office, a decision that the opposition decried as abusive. Bolivia's constitution limits presidential terms to two five-year periods, but Morales was elected under a previous constitution with different rules. Morales' current term may be his second, but it is his first under the new constitution and therefore he is allowed to run for re-election, the court ruled Monday night. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ushered in a new constitution and also successfully argued that his first term under the old one did not count against his re-election. "This court has proved that it is working outside of the constitution and the law," opposition leader Samuel Doria Medina of the National Unity party said.
