The crash happened in Rosedale, just to the east of Baltimore, firefighter Jonathan Meehan of Baltimore County said. Bruce Schultz with Baltimore County Fire Department said. "CSX indicates that there is no toxic inhalants, so we do not believe there is any substantial risk to the community," Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz told reporters. Kevin Lindemann told CNN he was working in Baltimore Windustrial, a plumbing supply warehouse along the track, when he felt something "like an earthquake." -- A CSX freight train collided with a commercial truck and derailed in the Baltimore area Tuesday, officials said, seriously injuring the truck's driver and leading to an explosion that a witness said could be felt blocks away.
