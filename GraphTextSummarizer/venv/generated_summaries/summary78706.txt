The same goes for Puerto Madero, the last neighborhood built on land reclaimed from the city of Rio de la Plata, where restaurants, hotels and luxury buildings give it a unique look. The vast majority have motifs related to tango and you can even pay for photos of tango dancers doing their seductive moves. Palermo is my favorite neighborhood because it has a bit of everything that makes the city attractive: the nostalgia and elegance of the tango, with the energy and vitality of modern places to eat. One place tourists rarely miss on their way through Buenos Aires is the Caminito, a quaint seaside town of colorful houses in the La Boca neighborhood. Local celebrities often go to restaurants in Palermo Viejo, a traditional old quarter of the city, that in recent years has grown with its trendy restaurants and boutique hotels.
