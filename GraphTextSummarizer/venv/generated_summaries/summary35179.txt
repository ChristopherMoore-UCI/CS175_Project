" Adam Lanza, 20, killed the children and staff with a semi-automatic rife on December 14, 2012. In a heavily redacted page in the report, an unidentified witness told investigators 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza hated his mother, Nancy, and Sandy Hook Elementary School. Over lunch, Nancy Lanza told the friend she had traveled to New Hampshire for a brief trip as "an experiment to allow Adam to stay at home alone for a few days." If they went to North Carolina, Adam was to work for a friend of Nancy Lanza who owned a computer technology business. After the shooting, the items investigators removed from the Lanza home included a military-style uniform that was found in Adam Lanza's room.
