" This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. "Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight." Nigeria said officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby. Days later,  the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria. Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in April have been converted to Islam and married off. Boko Haram, whose name translates to "Western education is sin" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.
