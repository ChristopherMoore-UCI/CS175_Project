"The evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive," police said in a statement the day of the shooting. Ferrell had wrecked his car down the street and had simply gone to the nearest home seeking help, family attorney Chris Chestnut said. "Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter." The statement further said, "It has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization." Police used the words "charged," "ran" and "advanced" in describing Ferrell's interaction with police. But Chestnut said the young man merely walked "briskly" toward them and surmised that Ferrell was relieved police had arrived to help him. Describing the incident allegedly caught by the dashboard camera, Chestnut said Ferrell was on the sidewalk when police arrived.
