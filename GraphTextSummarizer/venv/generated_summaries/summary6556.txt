He also questioned the entire premise of hair analysis, citing a 2009 National Academies of Science report that broadly questioned the use of microscopic hair analysis and other forensic science results in criminal cases. Lowe said she agreed with the report's findings -- that hair can't uniquely identify an individual and that it's important to send samples for DNA analysis, which she said she did in the Anthony case. A crime scene investigator, the operator of a towing company and members of Anthony's family all have testified they smelled a bad odor coming from Anthony's car after it was found abandoned in a parking lot on June 27, 2008, then towed four days later. A crime scene investigator, Gerardo Bloise, testified Friday that he recovered a human hair from the trunk of Anthony's car, and also that the car smelled of decomposition.
