Cleveland police have slammed Cleveland Browns player Andrew Hawkins for wearing a T-shirt calling for justice in the police shooting of Tamir Rice during a warm-up before Sunday's NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Tamir, 12, was fatally shot in November by a Cleveland police officer, while police shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, in August. The police criticism of Hawkins in Cleveland followed a similar controversy involving St. Louis Rams players over the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Tamir was pointing a pellet gun at people outside a recreation center before he was shot, police said. Within two seconds of exiting the car, Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir, and the boy died the next day, police said.
