On June 20, the Samsung event will fall between Apple's WWDC developers conference, which runs June 10-14, and Microsoft's own developers conference, Build, which begins June 26. -- Samsung on Monday announced a "premiere" event set for next month in London, along with a set of cryptic images suggesting new devices for its Galaxy and Windows-based lines. (But analysts say Windows Phone devices have moved into third place in the market, passing BlackBerry while still trailing Android and Apple by a wide margin.) The event is set for Thursday, June 20, at the Earls Court exhibition center in London. The line includes tablets and laptops, but with a focus on mobile, the event could include the launch of a new smartphone running Microsoft's operating system.
