Friday's announcement is "the biggest tender for renewables ever," said Antonio Mexia, chairman of EDP Renovaveis, a Portuguese company that won a license to build in the Moray Firth, off Scotland's eastern coast. It owns half of the United Kingdom's foreshore, 55 percent of tidal river beds and estuaries, and almost the entire seabed out to 12-nautical-mile territorial limit. Mainstream, together with Germany's Siemens Project Ventures, won the license to build off Hornsea, on England's eastern coast. Under the Energy Act of 2004, the Crown Estate can also issue leases for development beyond the territorial limit, out to 200 nautical miles. "This is about delivering a whole new industry for the U.K., one that provides sustainable, secure, and indigenous power as well as tens of thousands of new jobs throughout the supply chain," said Eddie O'Connor, the chief executive of Irish company Mainstream Renewable Power.
