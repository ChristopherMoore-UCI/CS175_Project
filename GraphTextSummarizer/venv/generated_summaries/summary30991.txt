In a game of few clear-cut chances at the Estadio do Benguelam, Egypt took the lead two minutes after halftime when Mozambique defender Dario Khan turned a low right-wing cross from Hosni Abd Rabo into his own net despite no attacking players in his near vicinity. Nigeria kept alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages after edging past Benin 1-0 in Saturday's earlier Group C tie, bouncing back from their opening 3-1 defeat by the Pharaohs four days ago. The Everton striker should have scored as early as the 15th minute when he shot wide when clean through on goal, and Benin almost took the lead six minutes before halftime when Stephane Sessegnon hit the crossbar. Nigeria's Super Eagles can go through with a draw after Aiyegbeni Yakubu's first-half penalty was enough to beat bottom nation Benin in Benguela. Defending champions Egypt became the second team to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations with a 2-0 victory over Mozambique in Angola on Saturday night.
