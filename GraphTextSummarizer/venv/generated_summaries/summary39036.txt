Baseball pitching great Roger Clemens was found not guilty Monday of lying to Congress during an investigation of steroid use among major league players. "I hope those in the public that made up their mind (about Clemens' steroid use) before there was a trial will now back up and entertain the possibility of what he's always said: Using steroids and HGH is cheating, and is totally contrary to his entire career," said Hardin. Six days earlier, federal prosecutor Courtney Saleski told jurors in closing arguments that Clemens "wanted to protect his brand, he wanted to protect his livelihood," in denying the use of steroids during a 2008 investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives into the problem. It took about eight weeks for the prosecution and defense to question 46 witnesses, and the most direct conflict came among expert witnesses as to how to interpret a collection of discarded medical items that allegedly linked Clemens to steroid use. Yet despite being accused by his longtime former trainer, Clemens has consistently and strongly denied using steroids.
