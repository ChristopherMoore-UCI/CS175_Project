On Thursday morning, police spotted Bourque at least three times in the area, but did not catch him, New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Marlene Snowman said. As the hunt dragged into Thursday morning, police continued giving updates and warnings. But more than a day after a gunman killed three police officers and wounded two others in the Canadian city of Moncton, New Brunswick, investigators hadn't found the suspect. The rampage began Wednesday evening when police responded to a report of an armed man in the north end of Moncton. Police say the suspect is 24-year-old Justin Bourque of Moncton.
