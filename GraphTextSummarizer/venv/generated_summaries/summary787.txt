Without higher education, most people face a grim future. Translation of online courses further helps increase access to people from diverse backgrounds, and thereby enables the true globalization of education. To me, achieving a "global classroom" means using education to erase barriers between people of different cultures and backgrounds; it means giving people the opportunity to learn without the limits imposed by physical or socio-economic circumstances; and it means giving schools and instructors around the world the ability to transcend boundaries to bring high-quality education to their students. In Russia, for example, new student enrollments rose 230% since January 2013 (surpassing new student growth from the U.S., which is up 178%). -- Around the world, and in developing nations especially, there is an overwhelming demand for higher education.
