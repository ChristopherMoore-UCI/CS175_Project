O'Brien brought the homeless to light, first in articles for the alternative weekly newspaper, Las Vegas CityLife, and then in a book titled "Beneath the Neon: Life and Death in the Tunnels of Las Vegas." "After you've done it a few hundred times like I have, you can walk down here without any light at all," said tunnel dweller Steve Dommer. O'Brien noted the irony of one tunnel entrance near the famous "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" neon sign. Yet few tourists ever see the dingy world beneath the bright lights: tunnel dwellings that have become home to those down on their luck. O'Brien has become an expert on the more than 300 miles of underground flood channels and its tunnel dwellers.
