The social network on Wednesday said it's rolling out an audio-recognition feature that lets you automatically tag music, TV shows or movies in status updates. For movies, the feature will presumably work best for people watching at home, since most movie houses (and moviegoers) frown on glowing screens in the theater. That means the feature is listening and trying to find a match; if it does, you can then add the song, TV show or movie to your post. For TV shows, Facebook said your News Feed post will highlight the specific season and episode you're watching, "so you can avoid any spoilers and join in conversations with your friends after you've caught up." Facebook said the unnamed feature will be available to U.S. users on Android and iOS devices "in the coming weeks."
