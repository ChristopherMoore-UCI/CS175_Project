-- Government soldiers in Homs are showing the strain of war against opposition forces the government refers to as "terrorists." "Omran al-Zoubi said that dialogue in the preliminary stage must cover the widest possible spectrum of Syrians, stressing that Syria is heading towards a national dialogue conference and there's no turning back from that, voicing readiness to invite everyone including coordinators and those who abandon weapons to engage in dialogue and affirming that none of those who respond to this national call will be harmed," SANA reported, citing an interview on Syrian TV. Al-Zoubi said that the Syrian Arab Red Crescent was contacting Syrians who have fled to neighboring countries -- "regardless of reason or political opinion -- to arrange their return, stressing that Syria is the homeland of all Syrians and that none of those who return will be detained or punished." The calls for dialogue came as the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported 121 people were killed Friday, But the access given to CNN to a hospital here underscored the price Syrian soldiers are paying.
