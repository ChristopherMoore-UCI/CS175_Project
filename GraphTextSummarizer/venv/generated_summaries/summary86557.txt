But according to the conservative website Newsmax.com, they really have asked Trump to be the moderator of a real GOP presidential debate, hoping the men and women who desire to be commander-in-chief will show up to be quizzed by a reality TV show star. But let's just call this what it is: a publicity stunt by Newsmax.com to gain more subscribers to its growing media empire and a chance for Trump to bask in the glow of being taken seriously by the candidates who want to occupy the White House. So when I began to see tweets Friday about the maniacal real estate mogul Donald Trump moderating a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on December 27, I had the same reaction as the Spud-strip team press release: this is a bad joke. It's time that real Republicans and conservatives put an end to this silly infatuation with Donald Trump. Let's not even start with the idea of Trump moderating a Newsmax.com debate.
