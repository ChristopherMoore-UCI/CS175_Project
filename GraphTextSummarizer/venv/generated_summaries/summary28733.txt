-- Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the gates of Quantico Marine Base in Virginia Sunday to protest the treatment of Bradley Manning, who is being held at the base prison on charges that he released classified government documents to WikiLeaks. The controversy even played a hand in the resignation of former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley, who reportedly suggested that the Defense Department is mistreating Manning. Reports that Manning has been held in near-total isolation and forced to sleep without clothing during his nearly eight-month detention has sparked outrage from human rights and peace activists. Supporters of Manning and WikiLeaks also made speeches deploring Manning's alleged mistreatment in prison and asserted that the dissemination of secret military documents is vital for democracy. The protesters marched near the base carrying placards, shouting slogans and chanting "Free Bradley Manning."
