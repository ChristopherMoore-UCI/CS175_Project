The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time.
