The cameras were found in two separate tanning rooms at Planet Fitness in Moline and reported to police on November 5th and 6th, Sgt. Hamer was a member of the gym, not an employee, Planet Fitness spokeswoman McCall Gosselin said in an email. Sgt Kevin Cox told CNN. A police investigation led to the Friday arrest of 27-year-old Trent Hamer on charges of unauthorized videotaping. Hamer was released on $2,500 bond the following day, Cox said.
