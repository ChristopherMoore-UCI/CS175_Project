Because there are certain risks with even mild changes in thyroid levels, those considered at high risk, including pregnant women and those with a family history of thyroid problems, need to get tested earlier and more frequently, Smith said. "Our thyroid, even though it's a small gland in your neck, controls everything," says endocrinologist Karen Smith. She just might have been right pointing her finger at her thyroid, because, according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, as many as 27 million Americans suffer from some type of thyroid gland misfiring. It took almost a year for her to figure it out since she had no family history to worry about, and most thyroid problems are usually genetic, even though she displayed all the classic symptoms. That was 15 years ago and our awareness of thyroid and its many problems has grown.
