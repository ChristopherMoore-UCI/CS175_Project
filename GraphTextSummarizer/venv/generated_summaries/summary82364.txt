Much of the season, which -- spoiler alert -- left several main characters dead, centered on the conflict between a man called the Governor (David Morrissey) and the group led by protagonist Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln). For the most part, the new season will bring fans right back into the action of last season. Last season raised the stakes for the already tumultuous show by introducing a human threat to the zombie-infested world. "He's a man that is wrestling with a modus operandi that didn't work last season," Lincoln said. Morrissey said the character has gone through some changes, however, as the events of last season weigh heavily upon him.
