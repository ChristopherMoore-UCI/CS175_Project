The first tweet on @cnnbrk wasn't news, and it wasn't written by an employee of CNN. Lila King (@lilacina), our senior director for social news, is a spirit guide over all of CNN's social media efforts. Breaking news, from an organization that built its brand on breaking news. The news team at Twitter called @cnnbrk the "Lady Gaga" of news. The CNN homepage team has managed @cnnbrk for the past three years, hand-crafting every tweet, 24-7, mostly from our home base in Atlanta.
