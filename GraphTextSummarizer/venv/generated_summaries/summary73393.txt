-- A clash between Lebanon and Israel along their volatile shared border Tuesday left an Israeli officer and several Lebanese soldiers dead while escalating fears of renewed violence between the nations. It issued a statement saying that the soldiers were in "an area that lies between the 'blue line' [the internationally recognized border between Israel and Lebanon] and the security fence, thus within Israeli territory." Israel said the Lebanese fired on Israeli soldiers who were on the Israeli side of the border. Israel has accused Lebanon-based Hezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States, of violating the resolution by smuggling arms into southern Lebanon. He said Israel would not tolerate attacks on Israeli territory.
