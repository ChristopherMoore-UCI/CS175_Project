"We make clear to governments, without discussing particular identities that, you know, if -- if they do for some reason move on individuals that may be exposed in cables, that that will be something that affects our relations." "In certain cases, the people who might be identified are already well known to us and well known to specific governments." "We are focused on people who have been identified in documents," spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday, "and assess whether there's a greater risk to them of violence, imprisonment, or other, you know, serious harm, particularly in repressive societies around the world." In particular cases, Crowley said, the United States has "made it clear to governments that any adverse actions against individuals identified by WikiLeaks will affect, you know, future relations with those governments. -- The State Department says it has helped relocate a number of people in other countries who, it says, could be in danger because their names have appeared in diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks. Potential targets include, Crowley "civil society, journalists, government officials."
