--  A spokesman for Illinois Sen. Roland Burris resigned Thursday in the wake of new disclosures about requests that Burris raise money for disgraced former Gov. Rod Blagojevich while seeking a U.S. Senate appointment. Burris told reporters earlier in the week that he informed Blagojevich's brother Robert in November  that it would be inappropriate to raise money because he was interested in a Senate seat. Burris said Wednesday that he did not hide his desire to be appointed to the Senate, but never had a conversation about a possible appointment with anyone close to Blagojevich other than the former governor's attorney. A defiant Sen. Burris insisted Wednesday that he was innocent of any wrongdoing in his appointment to President Barack Obama's former Senate seat, as calls for his resignation intensified. The Senate Ethics Committee has launched an investigation in the wake of disclosures that Burris spoke with Rod Blagojevich's brother about possibly raising money for the former governor.
