As millions of Europeans feel the biting impact of austerity measures, IMF boss Christine Lagarde says it's time to hit the brakes. " It started on Monday when the IMF said that specific debt reduction targets, which underpin most of the austerity programs in place across recession-ravaged Europe, have a much deeper impact that expected. New IMF research says that pruning a budget deficit by one percentage point could mean a cut in economic growth of between 0.9% and 1.7%. It's led Lagarde to say that the austerity programs should not focus on specific targets and that countries should be given more time to cut their debt. In other words, debt reduction is having a much more severe affect on growth than first thought.
