There were the Progressive Republicans (Irving Babbitt), the anti-communists (Whittaker Chambers), the libertarians (Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman), the traditionalists (Russell Kirk), the neo-conservatives (Leo Strauss), and the sages of the National Review (James Burnham, L. Brent Bozell, Willmoore Kendall) -- the latter embodied by the urbane, cosmopolitan wit of William F. Buckley. Sometime in the 1970s, the intellectual right made common cause with populism, and historians such as Rick Perlstein tell us that this is when they surrendered their brains to cultural conservatism. Last month the aged rocker called President Barack Obama a "subhuman mongrel" in an interview with Guns.com. I ask that question as someone who self-defines as conservative and who is sick and tired of being embarrassed by Ted Nugent. Animal from the Muppets also speaks his mind, but we've yet to see him headlining a rally for Chris Christie.
