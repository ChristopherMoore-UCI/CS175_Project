Then show us your video skills in this week's Boot Camp challenge on capturing images. Images that transcend snapshots require extra effort. As a rule, image alteration should not change the content of the image.

Camera phones are small and lightweight, which makes them easy to carry and unobtrusive to use in chaotic situations, but this also makes them more difficult to hold steady.
