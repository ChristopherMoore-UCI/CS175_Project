-- Japanese car manufacturer Honda is returning to Formula One in 2015 as an engine partner with British racing team McLaren, a deal which will renew one of the most successful partnerships in motorsport's elite class. Honda blamed the economic crisis for its decision to pull its team out of F1 in 2008 with then Honda president Takeo Fukui saying in an emotional press conference: "This difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry ... and the sudden contraction of the world economies." " McLaren has used Mercedes-Benz engines since 1995 and will honor its contract with the German company -- which now owns the defunct Honda F1 team -- to use its equipment in 2014. F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone has now backed Honda to return to the front of the grid in partnership with McLaren, which lost former world champion Lewis Hamilton to Brawn's Mercedes team after last season and has struggled this year. "It's fantastic news for everyone who loves Formula One to be able to welcome Honda back," said McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh as the news was announced in Tokyo.
