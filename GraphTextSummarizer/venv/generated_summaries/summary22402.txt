We have even resorted to water divining -- a traditional method using metal rods in the hope of detecting ground water. But as water sources run out or dry up and more and more refugees arrive, competition for water is beginning to cause conflict here too. The rains will flood large parts of the camp, bringing the threat of disease and making trucking water in very difficult -- perhaps impossible as the roads deteriorate into impassable mud slicks. The conflict in Blue Nile has been going on for months, and now in the past few weeks fighting between Sudan and South Sudan threatens to further destabilize the wider border region these refugees still live in. Unless all parties involved in the fighting stop and focus on long-term peace then I fear that the situation in Sudan and South Sudan will reverse to how it was during wartime, Africa's longest civil war, the most recent phase of which lasted 22 years and left around 2 million people dead.
