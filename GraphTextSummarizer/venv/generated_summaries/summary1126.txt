-- Five-time Olympic swimming champion Ian Thorpe is sick from post-surgery infections and probably won't ever swim competitively again, his manager James Erskine said Tuesday to Australian news media, including CNN affiliate Seven Network. Erskine denied earlier media reports that Thorpe could lose the use of an arm, the AAP reported Tuesday. The Australian's condition is serious but not life-threatening, and he is being treated at a hospital in Sydney, Erskine told the Australian Associated Press. Seven Network had reported that "those close to Thorpe" were worried infections could jeopardize the use of an arm. The swimmer, nicknamed "Thorpedo," won three gold and two silver medals at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
