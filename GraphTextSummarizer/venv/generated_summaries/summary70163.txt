If that doesn't raise eyebrows it may surprise you to learn that the Dutch have now won the dubious accolade of being the most indebted people in Europe, with outstanding consumer borrowings amounting 250% of available income. The tale may be fictional but it is symbolic of one tiny country's struggle against erstwhile indomitable elements and it is told the world over as an example of how the smallest of deeds -- or fingers in this case -- can have a huge impact on the lives of many. With property prices now plunging around 10% a year, a growing number of Dutchmen and women have become trapped in a negative equity spiral, littering their banks' books with bad loans. With households tightening their belts to service mortgages, consumers' spending has plunged, prompting businesses to scale back on investments and shed staff. -- You don't have to know the Netherlands well to be familiar with the story of Hans Brinker, the little Dutch boy who saved a nation from the sea in Mary Mapes Dodge's novel by plugging a leaking dyke with his finger.
