Last month, the International Game Developers Association honored Lawson's pioneering efforts at Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. In the 1970s, living and working in Silicon Valley, he joined the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of early hackers that included Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. " Much of Lawson's background is discussed in a wide-ranging interview he gave Vintage Computing and Gaming in 2009. "Jerry was an amazing personality," said family friend David Erhart, who broke the news of Lawson's death Monday on the Digital Press website. "The whole reason I did games was because people said, 'You can't do it,'" he told the San Jose Mercury News last month.
