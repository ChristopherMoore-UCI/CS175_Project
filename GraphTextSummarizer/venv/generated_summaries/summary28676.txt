If you want more "Frozen," plan to see "Cinderella" in March. Walt Disney Studios announced that its "Frozen"-inspired short film, "Frozen Fever," will bow in theaters next year in front of its live-action version of "Cinderella." That movie, directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Lily James, Helena Bonham Carter and Richard Madden, opens on March 13. In "Frozen Fever," Anna, Elsa, Olaf and Kristoff are all reunited for Anna's birthday, which may be put at risk because of Elsa's chilly abilities. 'Strange Magic' not the 'Frozen' sequel Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the duo who gave us the ironically titled "Let It Go," have also committed to supplying a new song for "Frozen Fever."
