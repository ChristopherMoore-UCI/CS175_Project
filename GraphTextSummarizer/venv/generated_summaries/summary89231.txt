The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $3 million to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, on Saturday. On Sunday, the British government said it will provide emergency evacuation flights to repatriate 500 stranded Bangladeshis. One flight left early Sunday and three others will do so by Sunday afternoon, said Adam Lefringhouse, a defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis. On Saturday, U.S. military planes carried out similar evacuations, returning passengers to Egypt.
