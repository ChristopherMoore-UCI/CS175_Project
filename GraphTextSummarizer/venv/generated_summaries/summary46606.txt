The 38-year-old batsman made 73 in the first innings of India's 122-run defeat in Melbourne, and this time the "Little Master" fell for 80 after being caught by Michael Hussey off the part-time bowling of Australia captain Michael Clarke. What we have seen in the last couple of Test matches is everybody has scored at least a 50 which gives us an indication that we need to convert those fifties into big innings and put runs on the board. The 21-year-old played a major role in Australia's victory, taking four wickets in the first innings and one in the second, and has an impressive haul of 25 wickets in his first four Test matches. " Hilfenhaus ended the Sydney match with figures of 8-157, but Australia's celebrations were tempered by the news that promising young fast bowler James Pattinson will miss the final two clashes of the series due to a foot injury. But Vernon Philander trapped all-rounder Mathews leg before wicket for 63, and the fast bowler then claimed his third wicket as young wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal went for one.
