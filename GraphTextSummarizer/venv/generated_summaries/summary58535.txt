" French President Nicolas Sarkozy: "A man of culture and a writer of great talent, Vaclav Havel was the incarnation of tireless commitment to democracy and freedom. -- International leaders expressed their condolences Sunday after the death of former Czech President Vaclav Havel, one of the leading anti-Communist dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s. With the death of Vaclav Havel, the Czech Republic loses one of its great patriots, France loses a friend, Europe loses one of its sages. His ascension to the presidency after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 capped a life entirely dedicated to the fight against totalitarianism and for the defense of values that inspired his action -- tolerance, the promotion of human rights and the struggle against oppression. As the Czech Republic's first democratically elected president, he played a pivotal role in the development of freedom in Europe.
