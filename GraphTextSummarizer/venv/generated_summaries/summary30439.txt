Prosecutors say at least two men with Simpson had guns as they robbed a pair of sports memorabilia dealers. Prosecutors say Simpson and five other men stormed into a Las Vegas hotel room on September 13, 2007 to recover sports memorabilia that Simpson said belonged to him. "O.J. Simpson did not know that there were guns in that room," Galanter said. -- A jury of nine women and three men -- none of them black -- was seated Thursday for the trial of O.J. Simpson on kidnapping and armed robbery charges. Opening arguments are scheduled to begin Monday in the case against Simpson and a co-defendant, Clarence Stewart.
