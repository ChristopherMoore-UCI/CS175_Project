The tourists -- mostly from Europe -- were on what was supposed to be an exotic getaway: a cruise from west to east, departing from the island of Lombok -- which lies opposite Bali -- in the province of West Nusa Tenggara and ending in Labuan Bajo, in East Nusa Tenggara, with a number of stops along the way. They were retrieved by local fishermen on Sunday evening, in the waters of Sape. Budiawan said authorities were first notified of the incident on Sunday morning and immediately deployed rescuers to the site. "There was a coastline visible, a deserted island about five kilometers (3.1 miles) through rough water," Tony Lawton from New Zealand told CNN affiliate the Seven Network. He did admit he did not have a full list of the passengers' names and passport numbers.
