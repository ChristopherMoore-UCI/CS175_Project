-- Ronaldinho rounded on critics who said he was finished after he helped lead Brazilian side Atletico Mineiro to the Copa Libertadores title after a penalty shootout victory over Olimpia. After a goalless extra half an hour Victor saved Olimpia's first spot kick in the shootout, from defender Herminio Miranda, as Atletico went on to convert all four of their penalties. Having saved penalties to help his side past Tijuana and Newell's Old Boys, he made a crucial penalty save after the match had gone to a shootout, Atletico winning 4-3 to land their first major international title. Trailing 2-0 from the first leg in Paraguay, Atletico halved the deficit with a goal from former Manchester City striker Jo moments after the second half began. Their semifinal against Newell's Old Boys, of Argentina, was interrupted by a floodlight failure, Atletico scoring late on to force another shootout in which Victor again starred.
