This is why any young celebrity supporting Romney will make headlines a la Lindsay Lohan and Stacey Dash. I get the feeling that Obama has thought about the future of American youth and has made a clear effort to bring them into his cause. Opinion: Does Romney 'get' women who work? A recent "Saturday Night Live" skit had Jay Pharoah portraying Obama. Romney reminds me of everyone's embarrassing Grandpa Eddie, who thinks gays can be "turned" and doesn't understand why you can't roll down your windows on an airplane.
