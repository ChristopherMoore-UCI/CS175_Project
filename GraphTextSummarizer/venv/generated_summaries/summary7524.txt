The victim, identified as Matthew Yussman, chief financial officer of Achieve Financial Credit Union, told police that multiple attackers broke into his home Monday morning and attached a device -- subsequently believed to be fake, according to a law enforcement source -- to his body. "There is no question that this was a scary situation," said New Britain Mayor Erin E. Stewart. New Britain police asked anyone with information to call the department's tip line at 860-826-3199. New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said the FBI will analyze the device further, but declined to say whether the bomb was fake, citing the ongoing investigation. The suspects then ordered Yussman to go to the credit union in nearby New Britain and clean out its vault, according to the source.
