Today, Sprung tells CNN, there are approximately 290,000 Android users and 300,000 iPhone users worldwide, based on information from Apple's iTunes store and Google Play store. Red Alert receives notifications when rockets are being launched from Gaza, and automatically sends out a push notification to users via the downloaded app. As a live interview with Sprung and CNN's Brooke Baldwin began Wednesday, both phones -- one in Jerusalem, the other in Atlanta -- sounded in real time as rockets were fired toward the Israeli cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod. The Android app isn't available outside of Israel due to limited server space; instead users with an Android device wanting to receive updates can do so through the "Yo" app. Before the latest Gaza operation, there were 60,000 Android users and 80,000 iPhone users, all in Israel.
