Their mission is like something Ian Fleming would have dreamed up in an old James Bond novel: Five different space agencies from nations across the Earth, cooperating to populate and support a self-contained outpost -- a colony the size of a football field -- that circles endlessly above us at unimaginable velocity. But if astronaut Mastracchio wants more people to know about the astounding things he is seeing and experiencing up there, perhaps he can prevail upon Justin Bieber to retweet him. There are already plans for privately owned "space taxis" to take future astronauts to and from the station, a far cry from the breathless years of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. The International Space Station has been continuously occupied by different teams of astronauts and cosmonauts for more than 13 years. An international team of intrepid explorers living in space, conducting experiments and research and gazing through the blackness toward the rest of us.
