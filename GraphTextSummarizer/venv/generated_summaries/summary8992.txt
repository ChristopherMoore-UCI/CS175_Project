The Sudanese leader is wanted by the ICC on allegations of war crimes and genocide in western Sudan's Darfur region, where violence that erupted in 2003 left at least 300,000 people dead. The ICC based in the Hague has issued arrest warrants for al-Bashir on alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes. He has denied the charges and accused western nations of "neo-colonialism." A Kenyan judge on Monday ruled that President Omar al-Bashir be arrested if he sets foot in the nation again after the government failed to execute an International Criminal Court warrant when he visited Nairobi last year. The Kenyan government plans to appeal a warrant issued by its high court calling for the arrest of the Sudanese president over alleged war crimes.
