Human Rights Watch urged the court to go beyond the latest wave of violence and look into other possible crimes committed during years of conflict and civil war. The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court requested authorization Thursday to open an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ivory Coast during months of post-election turmoil. "The reports quoted by the prosecution provide reasonable basis to believe that pro-Gbagbo forces and pro-Ouattara forces committed crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the ICC," said a court statement Thursday. "The ICC prosecutor's decision underscores the importance of holding perpetrators to account for (Ivory Coast's) deadly spate of post-election violence," said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. "President Ouattara sent a letter urging the prosecution to open the investigation and he is working closely with the regional organization ECOWAS to make sure that crimes do not go unpunished," the court's statement said.
