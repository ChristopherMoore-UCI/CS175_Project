Joan Jett & The Blackhearts were scheduled to sing atop a South Dakota tourism float, but the band was removed from the float after protests that Jett, a vegetarian and PETA advocate, was representing the state where cattle are important to the economy. Many livestock producers expressed concern about whether Joan Jett was an appropriate representative for an agriculturally oriented state like South Dakota," Jodie Anderson of the South Dakota Cattlemen's Association told CNN. Another year of magic kicks off Thursday morning at the 87th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, with its signature giant balloons, whimsical floats  and performers taking over the streets of New York City, but a couple of displays are generating some controversy. PETA is also connected to a float controversy involving rocker Joan Jett. "This planned float is deceptive in the extreme because it shows orcas frolicking in a magnificent sea alongside their families when really we all know now that SeaWorld deprives orcas of all these things," Ashley Byrne, a spokeswoman for PETA, told CNN.
