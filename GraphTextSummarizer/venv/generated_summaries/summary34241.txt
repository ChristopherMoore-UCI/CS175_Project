The demonstrators were killed when Bahraini security forces cleared protesters from the Pearl Roundabout in the capital, Manama, on Tuesday. Thousands of people have been demonstrating in Bahrain since last month, part of a wave that has spread through North Africa and the Middle East. Police also arrested several prominent opposition figures in armed raids and without warrants, Amnesty International said. To quell the unrest, Bahrain called in troops from members states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Bahrain to allow its people to demonstrate peacefully as opposition members reported the death of a fifth protester.
