"Nik was a very talented young ski racer and a great athlete who was much loved by his teammates and fellow competitors," Alpine Canada president Max Gartner said. -- Canadian skier Nik Zoricic died of head injuries sustained from a crash while racing Saturday at a World Cup Ski Cross event in Grindelwald, Switzerland. His first World Cup podium finish was in January 2011. Zoricic's death on Saturday comes in the wake of the death of another 29-year-old Canadian skier, who died following a brutal crash during a training run in Park City, Utah. Dave Campbell, coach of Zoricic's home ski club in Collingwood, Ontario, said the community was in shock.
