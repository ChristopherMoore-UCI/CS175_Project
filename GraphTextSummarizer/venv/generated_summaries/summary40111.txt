Fellow competitors Janel Parrish and Sadie Robertson were right at his heels, with "Pretty Little Liars" actress Parrish going into Tuesday's finale with a score of 77 and "Duck Dynasty" star Robertson in second place with a score of 78. Although they all earned perfect scores for their performances on Tuesday, neither Parrish nor Robertson could overtake Ribeiro. " Ribeiro has been a strong competitor and an audience favorite throughout season 19, even treating us to "The Carlton" more than once. Despite his injuries, Ribeiro performed impeccably during Monday's episode and had the lead score going into Tuesday's finale. During Tuesday night's finale, the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" star was crowned the king of the dance floor as he and his pro partner, Witney Carson, were awarded the mirrorball trophy.
