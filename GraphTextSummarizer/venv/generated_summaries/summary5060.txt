" Two families of Airbus planes use a system design that limits available rudder pedal deflection as airspeed decreases, according to the safety board. "Consequently, at high airspeeds require lighter pedal forces ... to obtain maximum available rudder than at low speeds," the safety board wrote. -- Federal officials say a plane crash that killed 265 people was caused in part by a rudder system design featured in various Airbus models. "The Airbus 320 family is also susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeeds," the safety board  wrote. Safety board officials recommended the European Aviation Safety Agency review options for modifying some Airbus planes "to provide increased protection from potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs."
