-- AT&T's wireless network will face major challenges "in the short term" unless the carrier is able to begin integrating T-Mobile USA's infrastructure, said AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega. De la Vega, the AT&T executive, said he expects Verizon will face issues down the road if it doesn't continue to aggressively buy spectrum. AT&T is positioning the T-Mobile purchase as a proactive move to alleviate overflow in major cities. Analysts predict that AT&T could see major scrutiny from the regulating bodies that must approve the deal. Poor service quality in cities such as New York and San Francisco has been a criticism lobbed at AT&T over the past several years.
