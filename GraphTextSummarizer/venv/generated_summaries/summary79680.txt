The latest discovery was made Tuesday, and the remains were recovered Wednesday, Albuquerque police spokesman John Walsh said. -- Another body was found in the same 92-acre parcel west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the remains of 10 other people have been discovered, police said Thursday. Police believe the bodies were buried sometime in the earlier part of the decade, Walsh said Thursday. Earlier, police had identified another set of remains as belonging to Victoria Chavez, a prostitute and drug user who was last seen in 2003 and reported missing in 2004. Valdez's father, Dan Valdez, told KRQE she was 22 when he reported her missing four years ago.
