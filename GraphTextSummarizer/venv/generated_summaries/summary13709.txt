Wang explains that most workers have a deep-rooted mistrust of unions. "The fact that we have seen individual trade union officials leading workers is a sign that the union is beginning to move in the right direction," says Crothall. In early March, trade union chairman of Walmart's Chengde store in Hebei Province led workers in a fight for fair compensation when the store closed down. "In the past, elections of union leaders were controlled by the enterprise; workers can vote but not nominate. Of the more than 1,000 recorded strikes and protests that took place from June 2011 to the end of 2013, 40% were amongst factory workers, according to employment watchdog China Labour Bulletin.
