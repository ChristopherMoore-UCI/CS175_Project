The powerful psychological mechanisms that lead people to stay in abusive relationships may have developed for survival reasons, Stosny said. Crawford has seen many women stay in relationships because they couldn't bear the guilt of an outcome such as this. Abuse happens in both low-income and high-income couples, said Joanna Snawder, who counsels students and community members at the Metropolitan State College of Denver in Colorado. Sometimes the abuser can get his partner to stay with him through manipulation, for instance, telling a woman that he will kill himself if she leaves him, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. On the other hand, some people who grow up in abusive households do not repeat the behavior they saw at home, she said.
