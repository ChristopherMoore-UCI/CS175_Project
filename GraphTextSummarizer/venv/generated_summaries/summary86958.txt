The Bosnian striker should have made it 2-0 in the 18th minute but produced a tame shot which was comfortably palmed away by United goalkeeper David De Gea. Two goals from Edin Dzeko and a late strike from Yaya Toure eased Manuel Pellegrini's title chasers to within three points of leaders Chelsea while consigning United to a 10th league defeat this season. David Moyes' old side, Everton continue to thrive under new manager Roberto Martinez. As the half wore on United came back into the game but created little in front of goal. But disaster struck in the shape of a Mathieu Flamini own goal in injury time to see Arsene Wenger's side lose further ground on the leaders following a 6-0 mauling at Stamford Bridge last Saturday.
