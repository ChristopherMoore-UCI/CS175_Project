-- Brazilian police have arrested three people suspected of killing at least two women, eating parts of their bodies and using their remains to make stuffed meat pies sold in the northeastern town of Garanhuns. The three suspects -- 51-year-old Jorge Beltrao Negroponte, his wife, Cristina da Silveira, and his mistress, Bruna da Silva-- were arrested Wednesday and have confessed to the crimes, the police said on local television. During the police deposition, she said she stuffed them with human flesh and sold them to neighbors, schools and hospitals. Interviewed behind bars, Negroponte told SBT Television that he followed the instructions of voices in his head. The remains of two women were found buried in the backyard of the house, police said.
