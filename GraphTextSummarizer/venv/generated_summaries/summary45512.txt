Woodley says director Robert Schwentke granted her request to keep her naturally short hair -- which she cut for her role in another young adult novel adaptation, "The Fault in Our Stars" -- instead of wearing a wig. "I think wigs always look wiggy, especially in an action movie," Woodley told Buzzfeed. Shailene Woodley reprises the role of Tris, a teen living in a dystopian future where people are divided into categories based on character attributes. Tris and her fellow "divergents," who don't fit into any of the categories, continue their struggle to survive as Jeanine Matthews (played by Kate Winslet) hunts them down. A trailer released this week shows a greater emphasis on action scenes this go-around.
