However, "Desperate Housewives" actress Lupe Ontiveros, comedian Phyllis Diller, "The Jeffersons" star Sherman Hemsley and many more are not included. At the 85th Academy Awards on Sunday night, Andy Griffith and Larry Hagman were among the stars left out of the show's annual tribute to the Hollywood folks who passed away in the last year. Soon after, Barbra Streisand took the stage to pay tribute to Oscar-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch by singing "The Way We Were." The Oscars can be unpredictable, but one thing is for certain: Each year there will be at least one glaring oversight in the "In Memoriam" montage. With limited time during the 3Â½-hour telecast to commemorate everyone, the academy published a gallery online honoring more than 100 late stars, some of whom weren't included in the reel on the telecast.
