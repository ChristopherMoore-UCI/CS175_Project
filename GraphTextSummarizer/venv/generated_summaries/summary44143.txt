Apple assigns content ratings to apps to give users an idea of who the app is suitable for. Like many other apps with photo communities, including Tumblr and Flickr, some of the photographers who use 500px use it to take photographs that contain nudity â€” not pornographic images, but nudity nonetheless. The general reaction from both 500px employees and app users was disbelief. Based on feedback he's heard from other developers, Tchebotarev's theory is that Apple's review team (a team that is notoriously overworked) doesn't always check to ensure that apps have the proper content rating. For one thing, 500px actually makes it difficult for new users to browse or search for nude photos.
