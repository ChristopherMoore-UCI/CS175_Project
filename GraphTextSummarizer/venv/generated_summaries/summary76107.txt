The Dutch, who reached the semifinals of the World Cup under Louis van Gaal, at last showed some of that form as Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar both scored twice with captain Robin van Persie and Jeffrey Bruma also on target for the Oranje. In other key clashes, Gareth Bale's Wales maintained its unbeaten start to Group B by holding favorites Belgium goalless in Brussels. Most of the flares, coming from the Croatian supporters in the stadium, appeared to be aimed at Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. The result leaves Croatia top of Group H on goal difference from the Italians. Antonio Candreva had put Italy ahead early in the match, but Ivan Perisic soon leveled after an assist from Barcelona's Ivan Rakitic.
