On Saturday, Israeli police shot and killed a Palestinian man who attacked police officers with a knife in a village in northern Israel, police said. The political party Fatah said Sunday it will scrap a series of events to commemorate the death 10 years ago of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. "The atmosphere of violence rides the wave of Palestinian incitement," Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said on Twitter. After the Tel Aviv stabbing, a Palestinian suspect from Nablus in the West Bank was arrested "with the help of eyewitnesses while he was hiding in an apartment building in the fourth floor nearby the central bus station," police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The incidents Monday -- the latest in a string of attacks -- came amid a new round of infighting between Palestinian factions.
