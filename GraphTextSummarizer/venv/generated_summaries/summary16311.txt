Most of the rounds were fired, said Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan. At a news conference Wednesday, District Attorney Nancy E. O'Malley clarified that Goh voluntarily left Oikos last November and wasn't expelled as earlier reported. Jordan also provided new details on how Goh was arrested after he allegedly fled the college in a victim's car. Goh went to a Safeway grocery and asked an employee, if he could use the telephone, Jordan said. Authorities are investigating whether Goh was phoning a family member, Jordan said.
