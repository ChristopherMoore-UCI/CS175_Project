Kaci Hickox, a nurse placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey, went on CNN on Sunday and criticized the "knee-jerk reaction by politicians" to Ebola, saying "to quarantine someone without a better plan in place, without more forethought, is just preposterous." Hickox, an epidemiologist who was working to help treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, has tested negative twice for Ebola and does not have symptoms, she said. " Hickox told Crowley that mandatory quarantine is "not a sound public health decision" and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to Ebola and public safety. "I feel incredibly privileged to be able to do this work." After hearing Hickox's phone interview with Candy Crowley on Sunday, New Jersey Health officials emailed CNN's "State of the Union" to refute some of the claims made by Hickox. Ebola gets political 'To put me in prison is just inhumane' Hickox arrived in Newark Liberty Airport on Friday afternoon and after a seven-hour wait at the hospital. Hickox said she worries that her experience will discourage other aid workers from going to West Africa to help quell the Ebola outbreak.
