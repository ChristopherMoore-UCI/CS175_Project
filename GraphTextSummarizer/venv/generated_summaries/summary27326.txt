The attorney has met with his client, police and National Transportation Safety Board representatives. William Rockefeller Jr., or Billy, has worked as a locomotive engineer for almost 11 years, according to Anthony Bottalico, a union representative who has been meeting with the man. The representative described Rockefeller, who is cooperating with authorities, as a good human being, a strong person and someone who goes out of his way for others. You know, strong men are people who can come out and tell it like it is, and, you know, be accountable. And that's what Billy is," said Bottalico.
