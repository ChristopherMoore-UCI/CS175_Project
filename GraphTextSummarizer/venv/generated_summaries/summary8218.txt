-- The Endreson family lottery pool -- a tradition born out of their mother's long-term dreams -- finally paid off when the 17 siblings won a $20 million jackpot, New Jersey lottery officials said Thursday. Instead of taking the remaining money back, the siblings started a new lottery pool in their mother's honor, said family spokeswoman Marie McHenry. The total jackpot was $20.1 million with the family opting to take a lump sum payment of $14 million, about $10 million after taxes, according to the New Jersey lottery. "We're a family of working people," McHenry said, "We just go to work every day like everyone else." The pair had 19 children, according to N.J. lottery.
