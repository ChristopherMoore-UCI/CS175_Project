A medical condition caused the driver participating in the parade with hikers to lose control and plow into spectators, WJHL reported, citing Pokey Harris, an emergency management coordinator with Washington County. Rescuers lifted the car to free people trapped beneath it after the accident in Damascus, said Bill Nunly, the town's police chief. Revelers and trail blazers were filing down a street in the town near the Tennessee state line to celebrate the Appalachian Trail when the sedan veered off the road. Dalton Thomson told CNN affiliate WCYB that he was pushed out of the way of the oncoming car by a hiker. It "then moved into the hiker parade, where it started striking hikers," Nunly said.
