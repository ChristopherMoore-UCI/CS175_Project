The unraveling security situation in Yemen -- the same country President Barack Obama cited as a model for his fight against ISIS -- could throw the President's counterterror message into question ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address. Yemen is "a place where the American counterterrorism strategy that has been put in place by President Obama has succeeded in degrading the threat that those organizations pose to the United States," press secretary Josh Earnest said. " During Tuesday's State of the Union, Obama will "talk broadly about our counterterrorism strategy as part of our national security strategy, and as part of our way to make sure American principles are held up throughout the world," according to White House spokesman Eric Schultz. Explaining why he was ruling out sending American troops to fight ISIS, Obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in Yemen and Somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists. Republicans have seized upon the latest news from Yemen to illustrate their opposition to Obama's terrorism strategy.
