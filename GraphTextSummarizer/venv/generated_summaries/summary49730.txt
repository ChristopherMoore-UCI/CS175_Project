Not content with solo trips, Zhang said he also booked flights to China and hotel rooms for 40 of Bo's friends from Harvard University around mid-March 2011. But that's exactly what the case of former political kingpin Bo Xilai offered observers in China, many of whom -- more than half a million -- followed proceedings on social media courtesy of court officials in the eastern city of Jinan. During Friday's proceedings, Gu told the court via video that their son, Bo Guagua, bought his father some meat as a present from Africa. The younger Bo also went to Germany in 2006 to watch the World Cup, as well as Venice, Argentina, Cuba, Paris and Africa. Zhang -- who is also serving time for Heywood's murder -- said he booked numerous flights for the younger Bo to and from China, the United Kingdom and the United States, where Bo was studying.
