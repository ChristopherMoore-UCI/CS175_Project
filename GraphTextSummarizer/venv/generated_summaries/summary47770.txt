The law, which pushes schools to aggressively investigate bullying incidents and provide counseling to victims, is scheduled to go into effect in 2011. Bermudez told CNN that Jaheem, a fifth-grader, had been complaining about bullying at Dunaire Elementary School in DeKalb County. Gerald Rose, who heads the nonprofit New Order National Human Rights Organization, said the type of discipline that might prevent bullying needs to begin at the home. Masika Bermudez-Carrasquillo, who Friday asked the White House for help in a campaign to end school bullying, said her daughter, 12, was also recently harassed by a boy who kept referring to her dead brother. "I feel like I failed him," Bermudez said of Jaheem.
