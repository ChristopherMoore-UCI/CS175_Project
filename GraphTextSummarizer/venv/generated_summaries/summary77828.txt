We were given an overview of basic swimming techniques, tips to help our running form and information on healthy nutrition. I did know that, I told him, but swimming in a pool had been such an overwhelming undertaking for me that I had not spent much time actually processing how much different swimming in the ocean was going to be. This past week, my teammates and I wrapped up our "midway" training trip in Clermont, Florida. That was the moment that I knew I had to take the leap and actually get into water above my knees. Thanks to the patience and teaching of my coaches and teammates, I arrived in Florida holding my own in the pool.
