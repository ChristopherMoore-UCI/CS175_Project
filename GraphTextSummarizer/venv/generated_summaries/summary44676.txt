"Navalny's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger," said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Europe division Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director, John Dalhuisen, said, "This was a parody of a prosecution and a parody of a trial. -- Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, facing a five-year prison term and free pending an appeal, returned to Moscow on Saturday and vowed he will be elected mayor. " Navalny has been a prominent organizer of street protests, and has attacked corruption in Russian government. Navalny was detained overnight Thursday after a court in Kirov city found him guilty of misappropriating about $500,000 in a lumber deal when he was an adviser to the region's governor. Hundreds of supporters and journalists met Navalny's train as he returned from his trial in Kirov, according to state-run Ria Novosti.
