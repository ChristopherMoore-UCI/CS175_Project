-- Gunmen shot and killed a Saudi diplomat in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, on Tuesday, police said. Bangladesh police said Khalaf Al Ali, 45, had served two years at the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Dhaka as head of citizens' affairs. Ali was shot dead in the city's highly secured Gulshan diplomatic zone in front of his rented apartment at about 1 a.m. Tuesday, and he died at a local hospital about 5 p.m., authorities said. Shamsul Islam, a junior Bangladeshi minister for home affairs, said "the matter is being investigated, and we'll bring the perpetrators to justice as soon as possible. We'll use all possible means to bring the culprits to book," Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said.
