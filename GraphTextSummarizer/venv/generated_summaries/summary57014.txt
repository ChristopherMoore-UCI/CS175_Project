"The lack of accountability for killings of civilians by US/NATO forces in Afghanistan sends a message that foreign troops have free rein to commit abuses in Afghanistan and that the lives of Afghan civilians have little or no value," said Richard Bennett, Asia-Pacific director at Amnesty International. A U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province killed 11 civilians, including women and children, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Wednesday. The governor of Kunar province said that two women and two children were among the civilians killed in the strike Tuesday night in Narang district and that 12 others, including women and children, were injured. An August Amnesty report, "Left in the Dark," documented how it says previous killings of civilians during U.S. and NATO military operations have not been properly investigated. Villagers reportedly brought the bodies of their relatives to the provincial capital to show that civilians had been killed, the organization said Wednesday.
