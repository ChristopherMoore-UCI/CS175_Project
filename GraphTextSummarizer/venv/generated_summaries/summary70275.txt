The category of persons recognized in the courts has expanded to include entities and characters including natural persons aside from men (such as women, slaves, human aliens, illegitimate children and minors) as well as unnatural or juridical persons, such as corporations, labor unions, nursing homes, municipalities and government units. And that outcome means we need to start grappling with whether machines with artificial intelligence should be considered persons, as far as the law is concerned. To make the case for granting personhood to robots, it's not necessary to show that they can function as persons in all the ways that a "person" may be understood by a legal system. We as a society have given robots power, and with that power should come the responsibility of personhood. Throughout history, women, children and slaves have all at times been considered property rather than persons.
