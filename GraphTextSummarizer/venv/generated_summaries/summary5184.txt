President Obama and his counterparts in other liberal democracies should help explain the West's vision of democratic principles and tolerance. The other electoral surprise, in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world, is just how badly liberal groups -- the ones who launched the uprisings and embrace the kind of democracy we would recognize in the West -- fared at the polls. Do Islamist parties believe in freedom, democracy and equality? Leaders of parties affiliated with or inspired by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood who have won elections in Tunisia and even in Morocco, where King Mohamed VI allowed elections to prevent an uprising, say they support democratic principles. In every Arab country where popular uprisings have pushed dictators out of power, Islamist parties have become the most powerful political force.
