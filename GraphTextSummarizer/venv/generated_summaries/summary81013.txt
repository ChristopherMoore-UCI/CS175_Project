Sigurdardottir, the country's 66-year-old minister of social affairs and social security, is on track to succeed Prime Minister Geir Haarde, who resigned Monday following the collapse of the country's main banks, currency and stock market. Sigurdardottir has been a member of Iceland's Parliament for 30 years, and is in her second stint as minister of social affairs. We really warmly welcome that," said Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for Stonewall UK, a British gay-rights group. If they succeed, she will become interim prime minister until Iceland next goes to the polls, which must happen by May. She would become Iceland's first female prime minister, although not the North Atlantic nation's first female head of state -- Vigdis Finnbogadottir became its fourth president in 1980.
