Benghazi was also the site of a September 11 assault on the U.S. consulate that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. -- A vehicle belonging to Italian diplomats appeared to be the target of a homemade bomb in the capital of Tripoli, the Libyan state news agency LANA reported Tuesday. The Facebook page of the government's Supreme Security Committee in Tripoli said officials suspected the Toyota Previa had been rigged with an bomb and cordoned off the area. Consul General Guido de Sanctis was in an armored car pulling out of the garage when the gunmen pulled up alongside the vehicle and opened fire, he told CNN. LANA said officials suspected a small homemade bomb of blasting gelatin was used in the attack.
