The DayGlo- and dubstep-fueled assault on the senses was written by Korine ("Kids," "Trash Humpers") while doing some immersion research in a hotel room in Panama City, Florida, where, he told an audience at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, "people were blasting Taylor Swift music 24 hours a day, vomiting on my door and snorting donuts. The art-sleaze film about the decadent rites of American college kids stars former Disney sweethearts Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens alongside "Pretty Little Liars' " Ashley Benson and Korine's wife, Rachel, as broke coeds who stick up a chicken shack to fund the spring break of their dreams. It's a nice backdrop but also a metaphor for what happens later in the film once they meet Alien and what the movie becomes." Though Faith, Gomez's comparatively pious character, scans as someone who might have grown out of the "Wizards of Waverly Place" and Justin Bieber trajectory, she explained that she chose the role because "I wanted to see how far I could go. But, Gomez cautioned, "I don't necessarily want to know what people are going to say or think" about her choice. " Benson said, "People are used to seeing us in certain roles, and this was a movie where we were able to show people a different side of us, and it was more exciting than anything."
