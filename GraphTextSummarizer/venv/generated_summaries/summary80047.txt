Here is a list of the terror attacks on U.S. soil since 1980 that involved casualties: 1978-1995: Three people die and 23 others are wounded after a string of mail bombings carried out by Ted Kaczynski. Two are flown into the Twin Towers in New York, one crashes into the Pentagon and another crashes into the Pennsylvania countryside after passengers attempt to wrest control of the aircraft to prevent an attack on the U.S. Capitol. -- Though the attacks have been relatively rare and the bombings in Boston on Monday were shocking, Americans are not total strangers to terror attacks at home. Bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph is arrested in North Carolina in 2003, after being indicted in 2000 for the Atlanta bombing and for other bombings, including one at an abortion clinic where one person died. He was not charged with terrorism, but the string of bombings is considered to be a terror case.
