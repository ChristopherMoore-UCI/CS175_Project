Prosecutors allege Jenkins may have been following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to dispose of the bag in a dumpster. In a Massachusetts court Tuesday, during testimony by one of three cleaning ladies in the Hernandez household, prosecutors showed video of  Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, taking a trash bag from the house and placing it in the trunk of her sister's car. Four weeks into testimony against murder suspect Aaron Hernandez, the prosecution is beginning to link together certain elements of the case against the former New England Patriot. In an effort to prevent her from pleading the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, prosecutors have granted Jenkins immunity, compelling her to testify when they call her as witness in Lloyd's murder. Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement, according to search warrants.
