"Our message is blunt: migrants are dying who need not," said IOM Director General William Lacy Swing. " By highlighting the awful toll of migration, the IOM hopes to discourage would-be migrants from falling into the hands of unscrupulous criminal gangs and traffickers, as well as pressuring developed nations to change their policies to create more safe avenues of legal migration. "Limited opportunities for safe and regular migration drive would-be migrants into the hands of smugglers, feeding an unscrupulous trade that threatens the lives of desperate people. Many migrants disappear and die without a trace as they make perilous journeys across deserts or seas. It is time to engage the world to stop this violence against desperate migrants."
