Saudi Arabia, Yemen's northern neighbor, turned its air force against suspected Houthi rebels last week after it said the rebels had crossed into Saudi territory. A Yemeni government official told CNN on Tuesday that Yemen's navy was "on the highest state of alert" after an Iranian boat was captured near Yemeni and Saudi territorial waters last week. " Battles between Yemeni government forces and rebels have raged intermittently for five years, and government troops launched a new offensive in late summer. The Houthi claimed that the airstrikes occurred within Yemeni territory, a claim both the Saudi and Yemeni governments denied. The persistent fighting has raised concerns that Yemen -- where U.S. officials say al Qaeda is attempting to establish a new foothold in the region -- could be the stage for a proxy struggle between Shiite-dominated Iran and the Sunni-led Saudi monarchy.
