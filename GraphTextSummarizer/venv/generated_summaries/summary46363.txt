In his "Space Project," Vincent pays homage to the world's great centers of space exploration and study: Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia, Mars Desert Research Station in Utah, various observatories and antenna arrays, and, most recently, the Ariane Space Center in French Guiana. Vincent (with us tailing him) was graciously afforded an almost all-access behind the scenes tour of Kennedy Space Center -- mission control was a no-go, unsurprisingly -- which included a pilgrimage to launchpad 39A, site of the impending STS-135 mission, NASA's last in the Space Transportation System (STS, or Space Shuttle) era. Just this past month, Vincent finally got permission to shoot in NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, home of the soon-to-be-closed space shuttle program, and Vincent's holy grail. See the rest of Picture Perfect: Vincent Fournier at VBS.TV Throughout our visit, Vincent kept asking the kind NASA public affairs officers if there were "clean rooms" or "white rooms" he could photograph in, and they were generous enough to let him navigate his way through a handful. He also got a peek at the NASA engine shop, shuttle landing facility and control tower, vehicle assembly building, and mobile launch platforms, as well as several other difficult-to-remember locales.
