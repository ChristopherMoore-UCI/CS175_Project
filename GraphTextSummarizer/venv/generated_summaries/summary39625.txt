Voters may have given the Astrodome, Houston's iconic and once cutting-edge stadium, the kiss of death. Voters in Harris County were given a voice on whether to issue $217 million in bonds to transform the deteriorating structure into a mammoth exhibition and event space. The dome was the primary home of the Houston Astros and the Houston Oilers, in addition to hosting rodeos, concerts and other events. The Astrodome was always a symbol of pride for the city, said Bowen Shepard, a 32-year-old Houston native. Harris County Judge Ed Emmett "said that with voters rejecting the only viable public option and no viable private option on the table, there's little choice but to demolish the dome," the judge's spokesman, Joe Stinebaker, said.
