In the nearly 18 months since the iPad went on sale, tablet rivals have come and gone. One reason iPad competitors have had a hard time catching on is that, to make a profit, they're priced about the same as Apple's hit device, which costs $499 to $829, depending on storage capacity and 3G capability. Finally, the Fire has only 8GB of storage (compared with the iPad 2's bottom end at 16GB) but makes up for it by offering free cloud storage on Amazon's gargantuan bank of servers. On the flip side, the Fire is smaller and 50% lighter than the iPad, and Amazon says it's "easy to hold in one hand." The iPad has a proven track record and more bells and whistles, although that $199 Kindle Fire price is sure to tempt consumers.
