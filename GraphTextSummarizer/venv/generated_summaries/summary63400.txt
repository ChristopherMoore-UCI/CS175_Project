Besides Congress and car salesmen, also bringing up the rear in this poll are the usual suspects, among them lawyers, stockbrokers and bankers. At least these are the findings of a Gallup poll released this week that asked people to rate "the honesty and ethical standards of people" in different professions. But no, when given a chance last month to vote out Congress, we sent home only 9% of those up for re-election. First, how can car salesmen be viewed as less trustworthy than Congress? In fact, I have no doubt that a group of car salesmen could iron out a deal on the budget quicker than our recalcitrant Congress -- plus get us all to buy some undercoating for our cars to boot.
