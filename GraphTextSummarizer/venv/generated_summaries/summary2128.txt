In the wake of Hurricane Isaac, state officials reported tar balls and a large oil mat along the Gulf shore south of New Orleans. It's not clear whether the hurricane swept tar balls ashore or exposed them under the sand, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill Colclough said. However, the proximity of these other oil mats is very close to those that tested positive for BP oil," she told CNN in an e-mail. BP said Wednesday it was heading to the coast to test whether tar balls and oil are from the 2010 spill. BP spokesman Ray Melick said the area is one where BP teams were already helping with cleanup from the 2010 spill before Isaac arrived.
