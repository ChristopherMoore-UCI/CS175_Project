The turbulent political environment and a flood of outside spending from Republican backed Super PACs are throwing House Democrats on defense twenty days before the midterm elections, and they are putting out the call for help from their allies. "Chairman Israel needs stop the Washington blame game and admit that President Obama and his devastating policies are casting a large shadow over the landscape for House Democrats," Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the NRCC said in a written statement. In a sign of how difficult Nov. 4th is likely to be for House Democrats, Israel acknowledged that Democrats were having a tough time competing against New York Republican Congressman Michael Grimm, who faces a 20 count federal indictment for mail fraud, wire fraud, filing false tax returns, hiring unauthorized aliens and perjury. The House Democrats' campaign arm pulled resources way from a race in Northern Virginia to replace a retiring Republican, where Democratic challenger John Foust is competing against former House GOP aide Barbara Comstock. A spokeswoman for the House GOP's campaign committee said Israel's focus on outside factors ignored the drag that the president was having on congressional Democrats.
