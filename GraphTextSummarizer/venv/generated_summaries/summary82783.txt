That was until a Virginia woman named Martha Mullen came into the picture, reaching out to representatives of her church plus local Muslim, Jewish and Hindu representatives in an effort to find a final resting place for Tsarnaev, according to the Islamic Society of Greater Richmond. The previous day, when news came out that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been buried in Caroline County, local officials said they would review the matter to make sure all protocols were followed. In Caroline County, local officials do not need to be consulted or have to approve the burial of a person on county land in advance. " As Thomas pointed out, Tamerlan Tsarnaev had "no ties to Caroline County." That includes looking at Tsarnaev's death certificate, burial permit official disposition, a removal or transportation permit from Massachusetts and deeds recorded at the Caroline County Circuit Court.
