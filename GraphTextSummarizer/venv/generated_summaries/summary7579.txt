Police didn't say in February what condition the Bible was in, but they believed Wagoner's miracle story back then. The account by a public transit bus driver who said a devotional Bible carried in his chest pocket stopped two shots fired at his heart isn't true, said Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl on Wednesday. Wagoner said that three young men assailed him possibly as part of a gang initiation in February. Police Chief Biehl cast a wrench into that part of the story on Wednesday, doubting the attack even happened. On Wednesday, the driver, Rickey Wagoner, stuck by his narrative.
