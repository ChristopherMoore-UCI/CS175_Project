-- Israeli Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein announced Wednesday he intends to indict Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman on charges of fraud, money laundering, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. Liberman received the news of Weinstein's decision while attending a conference for his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, in Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement saying Netanyahu "hopes Liberman will prove his innocence." "I have always operated according to the law and I have no reason to worry," Liberman said Wednesday in reaction to Weinstein's announcement. Weinstein decided not to charge Liberman with bribery as police recommended due to lack of evidence, he said.
