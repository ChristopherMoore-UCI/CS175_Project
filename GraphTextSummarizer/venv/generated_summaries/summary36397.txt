-- U.S. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson called an incident in which a man scaled a fence and entered the White House "unacceptable" and told a congressional committee Tuesday that she takes "full responsibility." Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old knife-wielding Iraq war veteran, entered an unlocked door to the executive mansion, Pierson told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which grilled her on the September 19 security breach. Republicans and Democrats questioned how Gonzalez penetrated "five rings of security" in jumping the White House fence, overpowering a Secret Service officer and running deep into the White House, where he was finally subdued. The Secret Service should take a more aggressive posture, not a restrained one, Chaffetz said, and if agents kill someone who has breached White House security, "I will have their back. Pierson confirmed reports raised by a committee member that two Secret Service agents saw Gonzalez near the White House fence on September 19, prior to the breach, and "observed him for some time." Holding up a sign featuring the blue ADT security logo, Rep John Mica, R-Florida, asked Pierson, "have you ever heard of these guys?" White House fence jumpers Pierson told the committee that people jump the White House fence a few times a year.
