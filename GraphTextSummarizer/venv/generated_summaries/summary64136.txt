The problem is not the attempt to resolve the crisis through diplomacy, but rather that the current diplomacy neither takes into account past Iranian behavior nor the lessons from similar diplomacy two decades ago to resolve North Korea's clandestine nuclear work. So, back to Iran: Assessing the Islamic Republic's previous nuclear negotiations, Iranian negotiator Hossein Mousavian once reportedly bragged that Iranian negotiators had "managed to make far greater progress than North Korea." North Korea viewed the agreement as a means to a cash infusion, not as an obligation to forfeit nuclear ambitions. Iran has, for several decades, declared nuclear enrichment and experimentation to be its unalienable right. But, as evidence surfaced that North Korea was cheating, diplomats sought to exculpate Pyongyang so as to preserve the appearance that diplomacy had worked.
