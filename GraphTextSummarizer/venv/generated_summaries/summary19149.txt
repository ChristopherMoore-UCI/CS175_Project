" In December, Kerri Kasem told CNN that her stepmother was preventing Kasem's children from visiting their ailing father. Last year, a judge ruled that Kasem was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem. The petition last year said that Julie Kasem and her husband had been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. "These children single-handedly and irreparably shattered the lives of their father, his wife and youngest daughter, the calm of their home and their neighborhood by engaging in uncalled for public demonstrations and personal attacks in the media," she said in court papers, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. "There is no communication between Jean and us and his daughters," said brother Mouner Kasem.
