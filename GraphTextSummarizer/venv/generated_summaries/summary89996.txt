The U.N. mission in Nepal was set up four years ago to push for peace following a decade-long conflict between Maoist insurgents and state forces. "I congratulate the government and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist for agreeing on arms monitoring arrangements, which are so crucial to reinforcing confidence in the peace process," said Karin Landgren, U.N. envoy to Nepal. The U.N. said in a statement that its mandate included monitoring arms and armed personnel to the Nepal and Maoist armies. Reintegration of former Maoist rebels into the Nepal army or the police was left up to the parties involved, the United Nations said. The Nepalese government has reached a deal to help reinforce peace after the United Nations ends its mandate in the nation early Sunday morning.
