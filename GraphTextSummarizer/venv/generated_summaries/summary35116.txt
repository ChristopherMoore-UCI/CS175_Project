Aware that powerful interest groups in the United States have paralyzed the enforcement of immigration laws, many ambitious Mexicans have ignored U.S. law to seek those jobs and higher wages north of the border. The overall plan aims to rationalize tax collections, curtail tax evasion and shift Mexico away from dependence on oil revenues. But high soda taxes would likely encourage smuggling, tax evasion and other efforts to game the system.

Almost one in 10 of people born in Mexico now live in the United States, mostly illegally.
