China Daily reported that an estimated 400 million births have been prevented by the policy, according to official statistics. Under the proposed law, dog owners would be required to neuter their dogs, give away their puppies to adopters or send them to government-approved adoption agencies by the time they are three months old, China Daily said. In September, officials said they planned to continue China's 30-year one-child policy, which limits most Chinese couples to one child.
