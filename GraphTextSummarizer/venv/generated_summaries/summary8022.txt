Creator Jakob Skjerning's blog said he analyzed popular Facebook games and distilled their gameplay into core game mechanics "to point out the pointlessness of many casual games." According to New York University games researcher and theorist Jesper Juul, social games are "brain hacks that exploit human psychology in order to make money." "Unlike previous games, you're playing light games with real friends that you have actual 'real-world' social connections with, not meeting strangers online. " "This is partially I think because they're so simple," he suggested, "and partially because people just aren't used to the business model or games being able to speak to such a large mass market audience." Reynolds, the former head of Big Huge Games and a strategy game designer whose credited work includes contributions to the "Civilization" franchise, thinks social network titles are a major positive for the field. -- Even as Facebook titles like "FrontierVille" and "Restaurant City" continue to attract millions of players, interest in social games may be waning.
