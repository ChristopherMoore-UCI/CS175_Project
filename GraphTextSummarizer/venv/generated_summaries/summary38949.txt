-- What seemed like hundreds of anti-government protesters gathered near Sanaa University in Yemen's capital early Thursday morning, a clear indication that many in the country were not satisfied with President Ali Abdullah Saleh's recent announcement that he would not seek re-election. Trying to quell a growing discontent in the country, Saleh said he will not seek re-election once his current term ends in 2013, after more than three decades in office. Thursday's protest come amidst a similiar ongoing unrest in Egypt and a revolt in Tunisia that forced that nation's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January. Demonstrators had said they would continue Thursday with a planned "Day of Rage" march in Yemen despite Saleh's concession Saleh on Wednesday. He won't install his son to replace him also, he said.
