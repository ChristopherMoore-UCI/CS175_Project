White House officials remained firm in their assertion that releasing graphic photos of bin Laden could incite more violence. "And secondly, the closest sources for Sheikh Osama bin Laden have not confirmed" the death. Despite mounting pressure from some lawmakers and dissent within the ranks of his top advisers, President Barack Obama decided not to release photos of Osama bin Laden's dead body, a White House spokesman said Wednesday. And at a university in the affluent Pakistani town where U.S. officials say troops killed bin Laden, a group of students clamored to tell CNN why they doubted the al Qaeda leader had been killed in the raid. The fact of the matter is, you will not see bin Laden walking on this Earth again," Obama told CBS.
