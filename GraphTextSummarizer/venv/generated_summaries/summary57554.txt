Juanes sang with Cuban performers barred from visiting the United States, like Silvio Rodriguez. -- Hundreds of thousands of people packed a main square in the Cuban capital Sunday to witness a rare and ambitious concert that, despite its nonpolitical theme, drew criticism from some Cuban exiles in the United States. He said he had spoken to Cuban exile leaders in Miami to explain his motives. But the reaction in Miami, Florida, home to both Juanes and a large Cuban exile community, has not been entirely peaceful. Colombian singer Juanes, creator of the "Peace without Borders" concert, performs at Sunday's event in Havana.
