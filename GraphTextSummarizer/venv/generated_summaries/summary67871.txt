Obama: U.S. ready to take the lead in Ebola fight Speaking about the deadly Ebola outbreak centered in West Africa, Obama said Tuesday the world is looking to" the United States to lead international efforts to combat the virus. While President Barack Obama acknowledged Tuesday that the chances of an Ebola outbreak in the United States "are extremely low," roughly one in four Americans are worried that they or someone in their family will become a victim of the virus, according to a new survey. Senator: Ebola as serious as ISIS "If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound political, economic and security implications for all of us," Obama said from the Atlanta headquarters of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the new survey, more women than men fear that someone in their family will contract the disease, 32% to 21%. He described the fight as a "national security priority" because its further spread could lead to dangerous instability in West Africa and beyond.
