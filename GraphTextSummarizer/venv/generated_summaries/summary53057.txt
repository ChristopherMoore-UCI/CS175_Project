The medal was accepted by Seely's grandson, Brough Scott, who is a horse racing journalist and broadcaster. Warrior's life has been used as an inspiration by the likes of film director Steven Spielberg, whose film Warhorse won critical acclaim and was nominated for an Oscar. I only wish Jack Seely were here today to witness Warrior receiving the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross." Warrior is the 66th winner of the medal from the PDSA but is the first to receive an honorary award and the first to have done so having been involved in WW1. -- Hailed as the horse "the Germans could not kill" after surviving machine gun attacks and falling shells, one of World War I's most famous animals has been honored with its own version of Britain's most prestigious medal the Victoria Cross. But now he rides again 100 years later, thanks to PDSA," said Scott.
