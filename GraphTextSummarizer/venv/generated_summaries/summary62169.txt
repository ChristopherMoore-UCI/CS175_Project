China's Li Na took down the No. 4 seed Caroline Wozniacki at the Australian Open on Monday in Melbourne, following compatriot Zheng Jie into the quarterfinals -- the first time Chinese women have made it this far in the season's first Grand Slam. She next faces the unseeded Kirilenko, who put out former champion Maria Sharapova in the first round. Zheng Jie on Sunday became the first Chinese player to make the last eight of the Australian Open by beating Ukraine's Alona Bondarenko 7-6 6-4. Schiavone hit five aces compared to none for Williams, but she also made more unforced errors -- 32 -- as opposed to 29 for her opponent. Others in the quarterfinals include former world number one Justine Henin, Maria Kirilenko and Nadia Petrova.
