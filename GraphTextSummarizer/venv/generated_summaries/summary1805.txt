South Africa are currently No.1 rated in Test cricket, but are facing a series defeat to resurgent Australia, with the series tied at 1-1 going into the game at Newlands. -- Graeme Smith has led South Africa to the top of the rankings, but Monday he made the shock announcement he would quit international cricket at the completion of their current Test match against Australia in Cape Town. He is the latest leading figure in world cricket to announce their retirement, with Indian maestro Sachin Tendulkar quitting at the end of last year and Kallis calling it a day before the series against Australia. " South Africa are having to cope without record run scorer Jacques Kallis, who quit Tests earlier this year although he will carry on playing in one-day internationals. " Smith, who is set to continue playing cricket with English county side Surrey this summer, said he would reflect on his career with pride.
