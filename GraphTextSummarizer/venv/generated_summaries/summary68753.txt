Kamrava lost his California medical license July 1 after state officials ruled that he committed "gross negligence" with "repeated negligent acts, for an excessive number of embryo transfers" into Suleman in 2008, the state's medical board wrote. "He wrote something, he gave it to me to sign," Suleman told HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky on Thursday night. But while she admitted she did want more children, she insisted she was in no condition to understand a form Dr. Michael Kamrava put in front of her before implanting 12 embryos. Suleman admits that she has a host of problems, including anxiety, panic attacks, hyperactivity and obsessive compulsive disorder. And now, Suleman said she is grateful for money she gets from media interviews, especially with overseas outlets.
