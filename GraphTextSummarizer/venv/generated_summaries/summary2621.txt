- Dr. Carter G. Woodson (1875-1950) on founding Negro History Week, 1926 Dr. Carter G. Woodson, considered a pioneer in the study of African-American history, is given much of the credit for Black History Month, and has been called the "Father of Black History." February marks the beginning of Black History Month, a federally recognized, nationwide celebration that provides the opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the significant roles that African-Americans have played in the shaping of U.S. history. In 1976, Negro History Week expanded into Black History Month. Disturbed that history textbooks largely ignored America's black population, Woodson took on the challenge of writing black Americans into the nation's history. We should emphasize not Negro History, but the Negro in history.
