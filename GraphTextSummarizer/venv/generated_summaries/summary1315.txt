-- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed legislation that requires the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states while such marriages were legal in California. But Senate Bill 54 splits a legal hair and requires the state to recognize such marriages as "unions," providing "the same legal protections that would otherwise be available to couples that enter into civil unions or domestic partnerships out-of-state," the governor said. "In short, this measure honors the will of the people in enacting Proposition 8 while providing important protections to those unions legally entered into in other states," Schwarzenegger said in a signing statement accompanying his signature. California will recognize same-sex marriages from a period of time before Proposition 8 was enacted. However, today the governor has joined with other elected representatives by choosing to place the demands of special interest groups over more than 7 million California voters."
