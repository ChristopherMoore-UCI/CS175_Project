"There's no question in my mind that this book is one of the most important pieces of Americana to come to the market in decades," said Chris Coover, senior specialist for books and manuscripts at Christie's. " The 1789 annotated volume, titled "Acts of Congress," will be displayed in the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington, which opens in 2013 at Mount Vernon. This copy of the Acts of Congress stayed in the library at Mount Vernon after Washington's death in 1799. "This is our mission to bring home all things Washington," Bookout said. "It has such resonance of Washington the man," Coover said.
