Ray left an Arizona prison Friday after serving 20 months for the negligent homicides of three followers who sought spiritual breakthroughs but died of overheating in a sweat lodge near Sedona in October 2009. Ray was driven Friday afternoon from a minimum-security prison in Buckeye, said Arizona corrections spokesman Bill Lamoreaux. He was was riding high as he planned his October 2009 Spiritual Warrior weekend at the 70-acre Angel Valley retreat outside Sedona. New Age guru James Arthur Ray is out of prison, but the families of three acolytes who died in a sweat lodge ceremony vow to keep on eye on him if he tries to rebuild his self-help empire. Ray said the stones were symbolic of earthly ancestors and called them "grandfathers." Participants believed the ritual would lead them to powerful spiritual breakthroughs.
