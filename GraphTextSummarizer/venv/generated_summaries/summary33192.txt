Faulkner's brother, Dr. Scott Faulkner, said Tuesday that Gary Faulkner does not have mental problems. Dr. Scott Faulkner said Jim Flowers from the U.S. consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan, told him the Pakistani government is still questioning Gary Faulkner and that he has not been charged with anything. Faulkner told police that he had been looking for bin Laden since al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, and had traveled to the area several times before, Ahmed said. Faulkner said he had no intention of killing bin Laden, but because of the weapons he was carrying, police did not believe him, Ahmed said. Islamabad, Pakistan -- Gary Faulkner, the Colorado man arrested in Pakistan while hunting for Osama bin Laden, has been moved to Islamabad by the Pakistani government, his brother said Wednesday.
