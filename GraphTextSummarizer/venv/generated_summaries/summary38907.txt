Francis, the first pope from Latin America, played a role in restarting diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, earning praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. Pope Francis will visit Cuba on his way to the United States in September, the Vatican said Wednesday -- a trip that will come months after he helped negotiate a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. "I want to thank His Holiness, Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is," Obama said in December as he announced a U.S. policy shift on Cuba. Cuba's state-run television reported that Francis would visit, but like the Vatican did not report exactly when he would arrive. Officials from the Vatican are expected to travel to the island soon to finalize logistics for Francis' trip, the officials said CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Havana.
