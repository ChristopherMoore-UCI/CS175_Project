It puts into question how well the CIA and other intelligence agencies can penetrate al Qaeda. But IntelCenter also pointed out al-Balawi appears in the video next to TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud, and that it was TTP that released the video. If al-Balawi did know about the plot, it could indicate a greater degree of communication between TTP and al Qaeda than previously thought. "The TTP and al Qaeda have a close relationship, and in all likelihood al Qaeda was involved at some level in the operation," IntelCenter said in an analysis of the video. "However, the release of the video with TTP Emir Hakimullah Mehsud firmly places the attack under the TTP banner."
