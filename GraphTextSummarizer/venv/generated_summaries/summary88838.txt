Ann Romney: 'Dad' is always with Mitt at the debates Since Mitt Romney is known as someone who doesn't like to talk about himself and his record spanning private business and turning around the 2002 Olympics, his wife is trying to fill the void. He understands what's missing in an economic recovery," she told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger in a recent interview in Reno, Nevada. Originally she wanted to go to back to the press section of the campaign plane to complain to reporters about some of the coverage of his European trip this past summer, but officials urged her not to do that, campaign aides confirmed to CNN. In light of polls that show a large majority of Americans say they don't believe Mitt Romney understands the concerns of average Americans, one of his wife's main missions is to convince them otherwise -- especially after the secretly recorded video at a fundraiser where he said 47% of people would not vote for him because they don't pay income taxes.
