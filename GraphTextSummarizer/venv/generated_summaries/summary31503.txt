Australian journalist and editor of news website Phuketwan, Alan Morison and his Thai colleague Chutima Sidasathian, appeared in court Thursday over a report connecting military personnel to human trafficking. The report included information from a Reuters investigative piece that alleged some Thai security forces, including navy personnel and police, have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic Rohingya people fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar. Human Rights Watch said the navy should allow authorities to investigate the allegations of trafficking and other mistreatment of Rohingya migrants. Chutima, 33, has worked as a fixer for several international media organizations whose staff have traveled to Phuket and nearby regions to cover the Rohingya issue, including Reuters. The Thai government says it is committed to combating human trafficking but denies that the Rohingya are victims of trafficking.
