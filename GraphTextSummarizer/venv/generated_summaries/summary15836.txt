The talks on Monday followed controversial comments by Karzai in recent weeks that seemed to accuse U.S. forces of working with the Taliban to kill Afghan civilians, a charge denied by U.S. officials. Kerry's stop came on the same day that U.S. forces turned over control of a prison that has caused tension between the two nations, with Americans retaining a say on the handling of certain Taliban inmates. Karzai called the development a major boost for the transition, while Kerry emphasized several times that the agreement respected Afghanistan's sovereignty to operate the prison that holds Taliban figures. Karzai outlined a process in which U.S. officials provide intelligence to Afghan officials on specific prisoners, and further consultations follow if the Afghans want to set them free. Karzai explained that he was talking about Taliban violence, especially how a bombing in Kabul that killed nine people didn't help achieve the Taliban goal of getting foreign troops to withdraw.
