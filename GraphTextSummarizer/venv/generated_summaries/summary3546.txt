Except we love chocolate -- and so its makers need more quality cocoa beans:  Where there is an insatiable demand, there is surely hope for cocoa farmers. The international market price of cocoa is set by a multitude of market forces, and the truth is cocoa farmers are at the wrong end of the supply chain, limited by the value they can extract from raw beans. "So tell me," an old school friend asked, "if the demand for chocolate is so high, why are cocoa farmers so poor?" And so among the grinding poverty, signs of positive change -- albeit on a small scale -- are clearly visible: School children in khaki uniforms, the next generation of farmers who, in turn, will insist their children are educated. Two years after CNN's Freedom Project exposed Chocolate's Child Slaves, it was time to return to the cocoa plantations to unwrap the chocolate supply chain, to investigate what progress has been made to stop child labor and to explore how farmers can get more money for their beans.
