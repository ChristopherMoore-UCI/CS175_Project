Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore, died early Monday morning, according to a statement released by the office of Singapore's current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. "The first of our founding fathers is no more," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is Lee's son,  told the nation in a televised speech Monday. Former President George H. W. Bush said he respected Lee's effective leadership of a "wonderful, resilient and innovative country in ways that lifted living standards without indulging a culture of corruption." He added, " Because of the example set by Lee Kuan Yew's singular leadership, I am confident that the future will be bright for Singapore. " China's foreign ministry called Lee "a uniquely influential Asian statesman," and Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said "our region owes much to Lee Kuan Yew." Singapore's President Tony Tan Keng Yam called Lee the "architect of our modern Republic," in a letter to Lee's son, the current prime minister.
