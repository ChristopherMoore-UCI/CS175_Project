Although the interior spaces are pushed towards the aft of the vessel, there is still room for an owners suite and six further double-king sized suites. The vessel boasts over 1000 square meters in forward deck space, allowing for such features as a full garden and pool, a tennis court, or several heli-pads. Designed by super-yacht designers Wally is still in the design stage as the company has not yet managed to sell the concept to a buyer. However, the giant mega-yacht 'Wally Island' offers exactly that. In addition to this there are numerous rooms for entertaining guests.
