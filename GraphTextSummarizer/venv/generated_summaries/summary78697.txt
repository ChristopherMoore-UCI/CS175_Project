Dow cited a 2010 survey by Consensus Research, which found that U.S. travelers would take an additional two to three flights per year if the hassles in security screening system were eliminated. The TSA screens more than 628 million airline passengers every year at U.S. airports, and the vast majority present little to no risk of committing an act of terrorism, TSA Administrator John Pistole said in a speech earlier this month. -- Calling for an airport screening process that maximizes security but cuts down on passenger hassles, the U.S. Travel Association on Wednesday recommended key changes to the current system. In response to Wednesday's report, TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said Pistole's vision for the future of airport security screening is "one that is more risk-based and intelligence-driven, shifting away from a one-size-fits-all approach at checkpoints. It also proposed allowing each traveler to check one bag without a fee to reduce the amount of luggage going through security checkpoints.
