The surreal tale of a cat campaigning first picked up steam with local media coverage, then quickly caught the eye of national and international media. Now, Morris has a website featuring a slick campaign video telling his story, and a red and blue picture of the cat that looks like the well-known portrait of U.S. President Barack Obama that became popular during his 2008 campaign. The black and white feline named Morris has popped up on campaign posters and garnered a devoted social media following, with more than 100,000 likes on his Facebook page. But his supporters say his growing popularity shows widespread frustration with corrupt  politicians, known as rats in local lingo. "Facing the quantity of rats that lurk in these posts," the feline's Facebook page says, "only a cat can bring order."
