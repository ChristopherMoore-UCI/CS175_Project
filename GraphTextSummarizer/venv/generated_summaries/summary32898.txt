Earlier in the day, Philip was taken from Sandringham to the cardiothoracic unit at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge after complaining of chest pains, according to a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman. Philip turned 90 in June, at which point a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Duke of Edinburgh would gradually "wind down" his workload. -- Britain's Prince Philip was treated successfully for a blocked coronary artery on Friday and will remain at the hospital for observation, the Press Association reported, citing a statement from Buckingham Palace. Philip has made more than 5,000 public speeches during his working life, according to Buckingham Palace. "I reckon I've done my bit, I want to enjoy myself now ... have less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say," Philip said then, in an interview with the BBC.
