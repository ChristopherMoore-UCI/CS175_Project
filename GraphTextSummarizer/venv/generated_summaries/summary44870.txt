One of the greatest strengths of "Breaking Bad" is how its plotlines pit characters -- Walt, wife Skyler, meth-cook partner Jesse, DEA agent brother-in-law Hank and assorted drug-world bad guys -- against each other in a complex, ever-shifting geometry of alliances and manipulations. Federal agent Hank Schrader has long been obsessed with nailing his near-mythical "Heisenberg," the shadowy figure supplying crystal meth to most of the American Southwest. What will Hank do now that he suspects Walt? But he has no conclusive evidence against Walt, and his new chief suspect is married to the sister of Hank's wife, who will not be pleased to see her family torn apart. Complicating things further: Unbeknownst to Hank, Walt's drug money paid for Hank's medical care after he was seriously wounded by members of a Mexican cartel.
