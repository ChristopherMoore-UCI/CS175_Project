The small town near Lake Chad was home to the base of the Multinational Joint Task Force, comprising troops from Nigeria, Niger and Chad -- but despite the military presence, Baga was surrounded in the country's northeastern corner by what has become Boko Haram territory. For Boko Haram, taking Baga -- a small town in Nigeria's Borno State -- closes a gap in its map, fulfills a strategic purpose with its proximity to the border with Chad, where it is reported to have set up camps on islands in Lake Chad, and further bolsters its resources and sense of confidence with a win over a multinational military force. Despite increased attacks in northern Cameroon and growing concern in southern Niger and western Chad, it is not clear that Boko Haram would seek immediately to open new fronts in this conflict by taking on the armies of Chad and Niger. Some voters -- not all -- will assess Goodluck Jonathan's performance as president since 2011 through his handling of the Boko Haram crisis. The West -- and others -- should be worried because of the human cost of the Boko Haram crisis and the legacy this violence will leave.
