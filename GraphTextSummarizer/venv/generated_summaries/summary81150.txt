"Playing a semi-final here at Roland Garros is a great moment and playing such a great player is what we train for," Federer said in a court side interview after beating Monfils. Monfils had won their last meeting but never looked capable of repeating the feat despite offering stiff resistance in the third set where he hit back to level after falling behind again. -- Roger Federer made it five straight wins in a row as he reached the semifinals of the French Open Tuesday at the expense of home favorite Gael Monfils. Monfils retrieved one of the breaks but Federer served out at 5-3 to take a comfortable two-set lead.
