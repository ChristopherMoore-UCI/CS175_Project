He also was involved with Turner in the Atlanta Braves baseball team and Atlanta Hawks basketball team. -- Robert J. Wussler, a pioneering television news executive at CBS before he joined Ted Turner to help build Turner Broadcasting System and CNN into cable industry giants, died on June 5 at his Connecticut home after a long illness, according to a family spokesman. In 1980, Wussler joined cable pioneer Ted Turner at Turner Broadcasting System and took part in developing and managing CNN, Headline News, TBS Sports and TNT. "Bob Wussler was instrumental in helping Ted Turner build Turner Broadcasting and CNN," said Tom Johnson, a former CNN president. " Terry McGuirk, a former TBS chief executive officer who now holds that post for the Atlanta Braves, said Wussler "brought a new level of professionalism to Turner Broadcasting." "His arrival at TBS validated the maturity of programming in the cable industry and the businesses that Turner Broadcasting was building in that programming arena," McGuirk said.
