The BBC's director-general, Tony Hall, has allegedly received death threats days after "Top Gear" host Jeremy Clarkson was dropped. " Placing emphasis on Clarkson's legacy, Hall added that the BBC will be looking into a new host for "Top Gear" in 2016. "It is with great regret that I have told Jeremy Clarkson today that the BBC will not be renewing his contract," he announced.
