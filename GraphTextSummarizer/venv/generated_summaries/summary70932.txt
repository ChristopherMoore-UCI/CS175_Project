-- Ohio has executed its second inmate using a new one-drug method, officials said Thursday. It was Ohio's first execution since September, when Gov. Ted Strickland and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. Darwish, a 28-year-old from Saudi Arabia, had a year-old daughter, and his wife was pregnant with another daughter, the Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported Thursday. Smith was convicted of killing Toledo, Ohio, store owner Sohail Darwish during a robbery in 1993. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for Broom's lethal injections.
