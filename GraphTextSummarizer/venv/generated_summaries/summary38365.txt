Sharlene Simonson, 24, a photography student at the City College in San Francisco, was on top of Sentinel Dome with her family on Saturday, and they saw a small line of smoke wafting near Half Dome, she said Wednesday. The park in California remains open to the public, who may be able to see heavy smoke in the morning, which clears by afternoon, said Scott Gediman, a National Park Service spokesman at Yosemite. The fire is within Little Yosemite Valley between Half Dome and Mount Starr King on both sides of the Merced River, the park service said. Several hiking trails remained closed, and the park service wasn't issuing its usual 300 permits a day to hikers seeking to climb Half Dome, Gediman said. "Seeing the plume of smoke the next day completely overpower the glory of Half Dome put us in complete awe at its extending reach," said Simonson, who posted photos of the fire on her CNN iReport page.
