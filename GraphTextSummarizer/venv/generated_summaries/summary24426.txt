The 34,000-acre Bastrop County fire remained 30% contained late Thursday afternoon, said County Emergency Management Coordinator Mike Fisher. In Camp Bullis, north of San Antonio, a wildfire that broke out Wednesday afternoon had burned 290 acres by Thursday afternoon, said Bexar County Fire Marshall spokeswoman Laura Jesse. Officials were expected to enlist the help of a DC-10 tanker to fight the flames, but it cannot be used until Friday, when the decision will be made about when and where to use the resource, Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald said. Jerry Hooten found little more than ashes when he returned to his home in Bastrop County. The weather may bring "a sliver of hope in the next five to six days," said HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen.
