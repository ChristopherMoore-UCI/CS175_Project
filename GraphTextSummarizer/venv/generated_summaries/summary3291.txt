At least four people died when a plane made an emergency crash-landing in Ukraine on Wednesday, the Russian news outlet, state-run RIA Novosti, reported. They were heading to a UEFA Champions League game between Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Dortmund, the Ukrainskaya Pravda website reported. The Donetsk-bound charter flight was carrying soccer fans from Odessa. "The plane missed the landing strip, turned upside down and broke into pieces," the official said. There were 45 people on board when the AN-24 crashed in the Donetsk region, an emergency official said.
