Beirut's Rescued Animals We visit an animal shelter in Beirut that has taken up the often overlooked cause of animal abuse and rescue. Encouraging adoption and humane treatment of animals, BETA also helps humans -- the animals are part of a therapy program to help children with special needs. From camels to desert falcons, animals provided food, transportation, and even companionship in the harsh, isolated land. A seven-star hotel recently opened in Abu Dhabi caters to cats and dogs with suites that even include plasma screens. For centuries, Bedouins of the Middle East survived a nomadic lifestyle in unforgiving deserts by relying on animals.
