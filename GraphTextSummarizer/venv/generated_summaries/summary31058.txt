They say ferries arrived first on the scene, followed quickly by emergency boats and helicopters. "I'm seeing flashing lights on the water from the many rescue vehicles -- tug boats, ferries, helicopters. ... You can only see the tail of the plane."

Police boats and helicopters arrived shortly after, he said. He lives in New Jersey but was in Manhattan when the plane went down, and said his first thought after seeing the plane go down was to get back home, thinking that the state's border might be closed in case of terrorism.
