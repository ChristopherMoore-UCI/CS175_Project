Brawley said if he were Jolie's doctor he would have advised her to do what she did because her mother, aunt, and grandmother all had ovarian cancer, and her mother had breast cancer as well. Instead of screening, experts in cancer genetics recommend that women at a very high risk for ovarian cancer, like Jolie, remove their ovaries as soon as they're done having children. Angelina Jolie's decision to remove her breasts and ovaries to prevent cancer (as she detailed in today's New York Times op-ed) might sound extreme, but breast cancer experts say she was spot on. Plus, Jolie has a gene that gives her about an 87% chance of getting breast cancer sometime in her life. Brawley added that Jolie's decision likely wouldn't be right for someone with a different kind of breast cancer gene mutation.
