Earlier this month, attackers left ominous threats mentioning two websites on signs beside mutilated bodies in northern Mexico. Signs left near the bodies declared the pair, both apparently in their 20s, were killed for posting denouncements of drug cartel activities. Attackers left her topless, dangling by her feet and hands from a bridge in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Maria Elizabeth Macias Castro, 39, was the editor in chief of the newspaper, Primera Hora. Her body was found Saturday morning, according to the attorney general's office in the northern Tamaulipas state.
