Through online investigations, authorities traced Kate back to Mykhaylivskyy, who admitted the "joke" in an interview with State Department investigators earlier this month, according to authorities.. Mykhaylivskyy allegedly created a fake online persona named Kate Brianna Fulton and proceeded to initiate a year-long online relationship between "Kate" and one of his male high school classmates, according to the criminal complaint. The high school friend, who was not in on the ruse, called Bulgaria himself and had two tweets from Kate's Twitter account including one that said, "Someone help me. In July, he contacted a U.S. Embassy in Eastern Europe to report that Kate had been kidnapped in Bulgaria and was being held for $50,000 ransom. But there was no kidnapped Kate to be found in Bulgaria -- because there was no Kate.
