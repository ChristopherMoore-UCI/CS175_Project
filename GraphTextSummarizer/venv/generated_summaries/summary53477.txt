Yes, this is government and humans are humans. "One of the things you find after working in government is that, under tremendous pressure, organizations that are supposed to produce accurate information, often don't," says a former senior administration official (think Benghazi). Obama the campaigner was incomparably good at establishing metrics and using information technology to assess the extent to which those metrics were being hit. And so the ultimate irony may be this -- a President who extols the virtues of government has now been sucked into the big government vortex, experiencing (up close and personal, as they say) what it feels like to lose control to the bureaucrats. You believe in the affirmative use of government.
