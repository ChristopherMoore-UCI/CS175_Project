His football career was cut short when he left for Switzerland to train as a banker but when he returned to Munich he was soon elected as president of Bayern in 1913. During four terms as president of the German football club, Landauer is credited with establishing Bayern as an international force and nurturing the club's youth policy. The former youth player and four time club president has joined player Franz Beckenbauer -- star of the team which won three European Cupss in the mid-Seventies --  and former president Wilhelm Neudecker as Bayern's only honorary presidents. The legacy of Landauer,  who served as a soldier for the German army in World War I but was later imprisoned in Dachau, is to be remembered by the club, who has named him as Bayern's third honorary president. "His efforts were pioneering during an extremely difficult time for FC Bayern," Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge recalled in 2009.
