There are dozens of St. Joseph home-selling kits on Ebay. St. Teresa of Avila, a nun in the 16th century, buried a medal of the saint and prayed to St. Joseph to help secure land for a convent. According to the tradition, burying St. Joseph began hundreds of years ago in Europe. From glow in the dark St. Joseph statues to mini pocket shrines, St. Joseph has a whole new following. Robert Malhame, who runs Malhame & Co -- a Catholic supply company on Long Island, says sales of the St. Joseph Statue spiked last year.
