Hours later, Routh showed up at Watson's home and allegedly said, "I'm driving a dead man's truck" -- apparently a reference to Kyle's truck, which he allegedly stole after the killings. He is charged with murder in the February 2, 2013, shooting deaths of Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was the subject of "American Sniper," and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a firing range. In the video played in court Thursday, Routh was sitting in Kyle's stolen truck when he told a detective: "I don't know if I'm going insane." Routh left the house abruptly, apparently because Kyle had arrived to take him to the firing range, Watson said. After the killings, Adcock said, Routh drove Kyle's pickup to a Taco Bell off Interstate 35 and purchased two bean burritos, leaving a restaurant receipt in the driver's side door of the truck.
