Reagan National Airport was still closed early Sunday afternoon as crews continued to plow snow and chip away at 5 inches of ice that developed overnight, Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority spokeswoman Tara Hamilton said. Conrad told CNN that many roads still were covered by snow Sunday, even though snow plows were working 24 hours a day to clear them. Airport personnel were still removing snow from the Baltimore-Washington International Airport on Sunday, and it remained uncertain when flights would resume, spokesman Jonathan Dean told CNN. "I'm not sure how many people will have their power back on by Super Bowl time, but things are going really well today," said Joe Gilbert with a Dominion Power crew working Sunday afternoon to restore power to about 3,000 in one McLean, Virginia, neighborhood. Dulles reopened Sunday to limited service, according to Rob Yingling, spokesman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
