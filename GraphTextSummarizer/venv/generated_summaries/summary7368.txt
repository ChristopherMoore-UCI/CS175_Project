Since its debut November 17, it's remained in the top 10 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and is at No. 40 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart. "The Hanging Tree" was written by "Hunger Games" author Suzanne Collins and Lumineers musicians Jeremiah Fraites and Wesley Schultz. Lawrence shares a credit on the song with James Newton Howard, who provided the score for "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I." The soundtrack for the movie, which features Lorde, Bat for Lashes, Charli XCX and CHVRCHES, is proving just as popular as Lawrence's song. Lawrence's song "The Hanging Tree" from "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I" debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. According to Billboard, Lawrence is just the 13th acting Oscar winner to also notch a spot on the Hot 100 chart.
