One clip from the special that has been making the rounds on YouTube features Ansari poking fun at the institution of marriage and family, life events a few of the 30-year-old's friends are experiencing now. Yes, he's getting older, but Ansari said he doesn't miss being in his 20s, other than "being able to say you're in your 20s." The comic is known for being innovative in getting his comedy to fans and said the online streaming service made sense to him. On the controversy surrounding the Chick-fil-A boycott, he said it was a bit of a conundrum: "Obviously I'm very pro gay marriage, but I'm also very pro delicious chicken sandwich." Ansari, who started doing standup while a student at New York University, said today's aspiring comics should focus on their material.
