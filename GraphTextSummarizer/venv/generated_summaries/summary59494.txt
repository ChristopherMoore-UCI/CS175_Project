-- Maria Cole, the widow of singer Nat "King" Cole and mother of singer Natalie Cole, died Tuesday after a short battle with cancer, her family said. " Maria Cole, a jazz singer when she married Cole in 1948, was known for her strength as her husband's stardom rose and racial threats increased. "There were refusals at hotels, there were places we'd go he wouldn't let me get out of the car because they would go in first to see if we could get the rooms," Maria Cole told CNN in an interview last year. "Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark," Cole said after quitting the show, making reference to the street in New York on which many advertising firms were located. " Maria Cole was also at his side when Nat "King" Cole's groundbreaking television show, launched in 1957, folded after only a year because no national advertiser would risk a Southern boycott by sponsoring the first program hosted by an African-American.
