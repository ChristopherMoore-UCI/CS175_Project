-- Academy Award-winning actress Tatum O'Neal was released after an arraignment at a Manhattan courtroom Monday after her weekend arrest for buying crack cocaine. She is the daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, who starred in the 1973 film, and the ex-wife of tennis star John McEnroe, with whom she has three children. At 10, O'Neal won an Oscar for best supporting actress in the movie "Paper Moon." The 44-year-old actress, who penned a 2004 memoir about her long road to sobriety, was arrested around 7:30 p.m. Sunday on the Lower East Side of Manhattan after she was seen making a purchase from a drug dealer, police said. Her next court date is scheduled for July 28.
