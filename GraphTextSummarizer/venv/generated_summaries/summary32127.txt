-- Veteran Australian paceman Brett Lee has confirmed that he is retiring from Test cricket after being plagued by injuries in recent years. "Brett has played a key role in helping the Australian team be one of the most successful Test teams in history," said Cricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland. " Lee made his debut against India in Melbourne in 1999 and is fourth on Australia's all-time Test wicket-takers list, behind Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee. Lee, who claimed 310 wickets for Australia, missed last year's Ashes series against England after suffering a side strain on the eve of the first Test and has not played for his country since the 2008 Boxing Day Test against South Africa. "I am extremely proud to have played Test cricket for Australia," Lee told a news conference.
