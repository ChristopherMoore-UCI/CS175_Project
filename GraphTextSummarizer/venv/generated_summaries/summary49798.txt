Uncle Phil was constantly getting ribbed by his family -- and especially Will -- about his weight, but the regal patriarch wasn't without a sense of humor. Most of the humor came from that dynamic, but when Will -- and, often, Phil's son Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) -- really needed him, he didn't hesitate to help them out. That was established clearly with an episode in season one, when Phil came to Will's rescue at a pool hall after the kid lost money and a car to a hustler. -- James Avery was a prolific and versatile actor during his 68 years, but he's best known to several as Uncle Phil. Every "Fresh Prince" fan probably has his or her own reasons why Uncle Phil was at the heart of the memorable comedy.
