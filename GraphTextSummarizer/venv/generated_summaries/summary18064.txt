The Dutch Safety Board was founded in 2005, is noted for its thoroughness and technical skill, and has conducted many aviation investigations. As the NTSB did in the investigation of TWA 800 using black box data, a sound spectrum study can provide telling information on where on the aircraft and when the explosion occurred. As more details come in, U.S. officials believe that pro-Russian rebels fired the missiles. We cannot afford to have another aviation accident investigation that appears to stumble at its outset. It is critical that investigators obtain possession of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, the "black box."
