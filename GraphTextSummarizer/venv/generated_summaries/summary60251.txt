The sun may be setting on Mark Webber's Formula One career, but the veteran Australian driver lit up Abu Dhabi on Saturday by snatching pole position from all-conquering Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel. " Vettel, who last weekend became only the third driver in F1 history to win four successive championships, appeared happy to share the limelight with a man who he denied victory in Malaysia after ignoring team orders. Kimi Raikkonen, who will replace the Brazilian at Ferrari next year, shrugged off his pay dispute with Lotus by claiming fifth place in qualifying, while teammate Romain Grosjean -- seeking a fourth consecutive podium finish -- was seventh. That would be sweet for the 37-year-old, who will drive in endurance racing for Porsche next season after a frustrating time in Vettel's shadow. " Ferrari's focus, despite all statements to the contrary, seems to be on next season already, with Fernando Alonso -- second in the championship -- failing to make Q3 for the first time this year.
