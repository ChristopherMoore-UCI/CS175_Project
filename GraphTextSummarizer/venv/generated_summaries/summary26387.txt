It includes three counts of making false statements to investigators about the use of human growth hormone, steroids and vitamin B12, and two counts of perjury stemming from his appearance before Waxman's committee in 2008. Clemens told investigators that Pettite -- who admitted to using human growth hormone on two occasions himself -- must have "misheard" him, and he accused McNamee of lying "to save his own skin" as federal authorities began probing the use of steroids in major sports. A federal grand jury in Washington has charged the seven-time Cy Young winner with perjury, obstruction of Congress and making false statements over his insistence to a House committee that he never used steroids or human growth hormone. That testimony put him at odds with McNamee as well as one-time Yankees teammate Andy Pettite, who told a league investigation led by Mitchell that Clemens admitted using human growth hormone. He said he warned Clemens he would be called before the House committee if he issued that denial, and if he repeated it in front of Congress, he would likely face perjury charges If he had used steroids, "All he had to do was just admit he did it and move on like Andy," Hardin said.
