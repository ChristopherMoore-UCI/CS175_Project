The death toll included the city secretary, who was also a member of the volunteer fire department, said Mayor Tommy Muska. The victim was the only person with the password to the city's Facebook account, Muska said, preventing others from posting updates about the incident. "It's going to be a long recovery for this community," Gov. Rick Perry said. Felton and Muska joined Perry in thanking volunteers from across the state who came to assist in cleanup. The destruction made it hard to account for exactly how many people had been displaced, McLennan County Judge Scott Felton said Friday.
