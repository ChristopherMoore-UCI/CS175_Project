-- A bomb threat delayed flights and prompted evacuations Monday at Schiphol airport in The Netherlands, authorities said. The airport website showed many flights scheduled to arrive or depart early Monday afternoon were delayed. One suspect was arrested inside the airport, in Amsterdam, said Martyn Peelen, a police spokesman. Investigators were focused on the international terminal, Peelen, said. Authorities do not know whether the threat is legitimate.
