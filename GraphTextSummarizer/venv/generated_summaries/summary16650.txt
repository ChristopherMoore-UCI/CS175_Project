-- The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel to allow it immediate access to Gaza, saying a trip into Gaza City revealed weak children laying with their dead mothers and other "shocking" scenes. Red Cross workers and four ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society managed to enter the Zaytun neighborhood of Gaza City on Wednesday, according to a written release. Israel says the purpose of the operation is to stop Hamas militants from firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel. Israeli artillery fires a shell toward Gaza from the Israel-Gaza border on Wednesday. The Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed at least 680 people and injured more than 3,000 since it launched December 27, Palestinian medical sources said Wednesday.
