"Today, a great injustice has been righted," said actress Joanna Lumley, who has been a fierce campaigner for Gurkhas' rights. The Gurkha brigade originated in the 19th century with Nepalese soldiers, who impressed the British imperial troops with their ferocity and military ability. The new rules announced by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith apply to about 36,000 retired Gurkhas who have served more than four years in the U.K. armed forces.
