-- I ran my eighth Boston Marathon on Monday, the day the bombs went off. This was an especially exciting year because it was the first time my three children, who are 13, 11 and 10, came to watch mommy run the Boston race. It passed, the gun went off, and I was on my way to Boston. Are you scared to run the Boston Marathon again, Mommy?" Runners will continue to participate in the Boston Marathon -- but it may take years for the fear to go away completely. And I think my children have seen their mom run the Boston Marathon for the first and last time.
