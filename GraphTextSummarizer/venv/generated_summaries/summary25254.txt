The away side dominated the match, having 17 attempts on goal compared to Genoa's four, but wasted chances to take the lead before the hour mark through Marco Faraoni, Andrea Poli and Diego Milito. -- A goal from Japan defender Yuto Nagatomo handed Inter Milan a 1-0 win at Genoa that lifted them to seventh in the Italian Serie A table. Jose Mourinho's side got back to winning ways after their crushing 3-1 defeat to Barcelona on Saturday that saw their arch rivals leapfrog Real to go top of La Liga. Genoa had a late chance to claim a point but Miguel Veloso spurned the opportunity to ensure Inter made it four wins out of five in the league. But Ponferradina never looked like causing an upset after Jose Callejon put the defending champions ahead in the 29th minute from Sami Khedira's cross. Cristiano Ronaldo, who was criticized in the aftermath of the defeat to Barcelona for missing two clear chances, latched onto Gonzalo Higuain's pass to seal the win on 74 minutes.
