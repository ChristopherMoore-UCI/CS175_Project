"The goal has to be trying to open up the possibilities, the access for women to sports in Saudi Arabia." "The IOC is confident that Saudi Arabia is working to include women athletes and officials at the Olympic Games in London in accordance with the International Federations' rules," the IOC said. "Government policy hasn't been effectively challenged -- there is a predominant conservative view in society that doesn't afford women equality in a number of issues, including sports," Wilcke, senior researcher in the organization's Middle East and North Africa Division, told CNN. "There is high unemployment, it is 17% across Saudi Arabia -- 7% among men, and 28% among women," she said. Saudi Arabia is one of only three countries -- along with Qatar and Brunei -- which have never sent female athletes to an Olympic Games.
