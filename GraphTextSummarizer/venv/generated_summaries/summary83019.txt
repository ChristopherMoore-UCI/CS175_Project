Woodson's departure is the first big move by team President Phil Jackson -- who won championships as a coach with the Bulls and Lakers -- since the latter arrived last month. -- One year after leading the New York Knicks to their first division title in nearly two decades, head coach Mike Woodson is out of a job. Woodson was 109-79 as head coach for the Knicks. "I have a tremendous amount of respect for Mike Woodson and his entire staff," Jackson said in a statement. The Knicks announced Monday they fired Woodson and his coaching staff, days after the team failed to clinch a playoff spot.
