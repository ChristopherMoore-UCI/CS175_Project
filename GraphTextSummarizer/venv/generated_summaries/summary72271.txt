Facing cancer for so long changed her, Brown told People in September. At the time, she didn't let the diagnosis or the treatment slow her goals: After having an ovary, several lymph nodes and part of a fallopian tube removed, Brown packed up and set off for Australia to take part in MTV's "Real World/Road Rules Challenge," People magazine reports. Brown was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 23. Diem Brown, the MTV reality star whose fight against cancer was an inspiration to many, lost that long battle on Friday. "MTV is tremendously sad to hear the news that Diem Brown has lost her long battle with cancer," the network said in a statement.
