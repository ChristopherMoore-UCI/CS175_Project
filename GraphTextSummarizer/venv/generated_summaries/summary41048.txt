The Sanford Police Department said officers were prohibited from arresting Zimmerman the night of the shooting because physical evidence and testimony supported his claim that he acted in self-defense in accordance with Florida law.

If you won't give us justice, we will have to take justice," said Florida organizer Mikhail Muhammad. Protesters upset about Martin's death took to streets in cities across the country Saturday, with some questioning why Zimmerman has not been arrested. Martin was black and Zimmerman is white Hispanic.
