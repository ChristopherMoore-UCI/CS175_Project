Opposition to immigration reform will likely take a toll on the GOP in upcoming elections. The proposed law would greatly increase border security by requiring the completion of a 700-mile fence along our Mexican boundary, adding 20,000 more border agents and spending more than $3 billion in border monitoring technology. Well, House Republicans did say there's a chance of enacting laws that focuses on border security. Why would House Republicans refuse to enact a law that is good policy and good politics? -- I can't believe I'm saying this, but George W. Bush is 100% correct -- at least when it comes to immigration reform.
