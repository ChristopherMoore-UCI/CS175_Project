By midafternoon, witnesses reported gunshots and isolated cases of riots. Tensions between the Buganda kingdom -- headed by King Ronald Mutebi II -- and President Yoweri Museveni have intensified in recent years. An uneasy calm had swept over Kampala early in the day as police and the army patrolled the city in military convoys. The unrest Saturday started after rumors circulated by text messages that the king of the Buganda kingdom had been detained, said Judith Nabakooba, a police spokeswoman. Rioters also burned tires and cars, set buildings on fire and looted stores, according to witnesses.
