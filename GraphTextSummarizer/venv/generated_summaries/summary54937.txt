Getafe enjoyed a 2-1 away to Racing Santander with goals from Jaime Gavilan (26th minute) and Nicolas Miku (83rd minute) after Christian Stuani had given the home side the lead in the 14th minute. Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. Brazilian Jose Altafini is the joint third highest scorer (along with Giuseppe Meazza) in Serie A history with 216 goals. A superb free kick from Benat gave the home side the lead in 26th minute, but Alvaro Negredo leveled the scores before half-time with a header. Juventus' 2-0 win over Atalanta sees them maintain their advantage at the top of Serie A over their nearest rivals AC Milan (who play Novara on Sunday) and Udinese (who host Catania).
