The good-natured Forte essentially admitted that he and director Jorma Taccone had laid a box-office egg last year when my colleague Grady Smith puckishly asked him, in the course of an "Awkward Questions" Q&A, what he had planned for "MacGruber 3." " True, the film has yet to accrue the kind of cult fanbase which has developed around Tommy Wiseau's so-bad-it's-amazing "The Room" -- a movie referenced in "MacGruber" -- but that may be because it's not that bad (for the record, this reporter supports any project in which Val Kilmer plays a character called "Dieter Von Cunth"). The chances of anyone ever putting up the dough for "MacGruber 2" seemed subatomically slight after the film garnered some dismal reviews -- EW's Liza Schwarzbaum dismissed it as "90 minutes of talented performers doing and saying dumb, crude stuff in pursuit of an elusive laugh" -- and a mere $4.1 million on its opening weekend. So it comes as a surprise to learn that Forte and Taccone have been discussing a "MacGruber" sequel. Devin Fraci of the Alamo Drafthouse blog Bada-- Digest actually made "MacGruber" one of his top 10 movies of 2010, hailing Taccone's directorial debut as "exactly the right combination of raunchy, stupid, anarchic and plain weird."
