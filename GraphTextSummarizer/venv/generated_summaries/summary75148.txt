So for now, book buyers of the future who want to buy books from the past will need to walk to a bookstore -- or get Harvard Bookstore to use the bicycle, a 19th-century invention, to bring them a book printed with 21st-century technology. Dane Neller, On Demand Books CEO, says the announcement flips book distribution on its head. On Demand Books suggests that book stores price the books at about $8, leaving retailers with a $3 profit after both Google and On Demand Books collect a buck-a-book fee. (All the books that are being added to On Demand Books repertoire in this agreement are out of copyright in the country where it will be printed.) There's a certain irony to that, too, according to Google spokeswoman Jennie Johnson, since the bookstore is right next to Harvard's library, one of the libraries that partnered with Google to turn its millions of books into an online library of the future.
