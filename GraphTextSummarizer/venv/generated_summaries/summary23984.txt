An urn with Freed's ashes was taken from its spot at the Cleveland museum on Friday, and Freed's son will pick up his father's remains Monday, according to Executive Director Greg Harris. Lance Freed told CNN that the museum was being "disrespectful" to his father's legacy as a pioneer of rock 'n' roll, but Harris said Freed will continue to be "very prominent" in the hall. Harris suggested that Freed's son might feel better about the move after he visits the museum Monday morning. " Lance Freed said he believed his father's exhibit is being downsized and moved to another area of the museum, but Harris said it is not being changed beyond removal of the gold urn. Freed started playing R&B records on his Cleveland radio show in 1951, a time when stations that targeted white listeners ignored black artists.
