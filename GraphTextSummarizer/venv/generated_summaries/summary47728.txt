Charney and others will now enter a new phase of talks with city officials in a collaborative attempt to reform the policy that dictates how and when police officers can stop and question someone on the street. The first time Nicholas Peart, who is black,  was stopped and frisked by police officers he was celebrating his 18th birthday. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio Thursday announced a settlement in the long legal battle over the police department's controversial stop-and-frisk policies, which a federal judge ruled violated the rights of minority residents. The city will also take part in a process with community members "to ensure people affected by stop-and-frisk play an active role in shaping reform," de Blasio said in a statement. Police department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people "stopped and frisked" in 2011 were African-American or Hispanic.
