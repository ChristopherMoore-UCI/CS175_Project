"A really nice child, who loved school, good friends, respected the staff, behaved herself and achieved good academic results," recalls school headmaster Serge Cefai. But there is one family member missing from these photos: the oldest sister, Samantha, now 21, in prison in Laos charged with smuggling heroin. There is a glimmer of hope: The Laos government said Samantha Orobator will no longer face the death penalty, because Laotian law does not allow the execution of a pregnant woman. In August Samantha was arrested at the Wattan Airport in Vientiane, Laos, allegedly in possession of 1.5 pounds of heroin -- an offense punishable by death. But Jane Orobator is clearly baffled and mystified as to how her daughter ended up in Laos in the first place.
