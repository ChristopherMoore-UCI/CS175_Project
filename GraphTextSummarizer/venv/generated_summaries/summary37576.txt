"Jacques Cousteau changed the way ocean exploration was done," said Eric Stackpole, who along with partner David Lang is behind a submersible robotic watercraft -- sort of an underwater drone -- that could open a whole new world of undersea exploration. This affordability is how Stackpole and Lang hope to bring OpenROV to the masses, turning average people into Cousteau-like undersea adventurers. " With a flow of new ideas coming in from all over the world, Stackpole and Lang have decided not to get a patent  for the OpenROV -- at least not yet. The two met when Stackpole was interning with NASA and Lang was between jobs, and both immediately bonded over the idea of a new way to explore the ocean. Even though the project is growing, Stackpole and Lang are sticking with their do-it-yourself ethos.
