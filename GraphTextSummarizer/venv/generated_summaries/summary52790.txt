In his account to CNN, Wilson said when they arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. " Privately administration officials are alarmed about the incident, but so far the White House and CIA officials have declined to comment publicly. The White House accidentally revealed the name of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan to some 6,000 journalists.
