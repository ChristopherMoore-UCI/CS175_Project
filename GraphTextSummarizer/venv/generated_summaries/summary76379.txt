Last week, the shipper asked that the containers be re-loaded and sent to Gambia, CMA CGM said in a statement, adding that the trader had obtained the necessary documentation and clearance for customs. The shipping containers filled with illegal weapons seized in Lagos, Nigeria, earlier this week came from Iran, a leading global shipping company said Saturday. " The containers in question were loaded in Bandar Abbas, a port in southern Iran, and discharged in Lagos in July, the company said. Nigeria's security service said earlier this week that it had seized 13 shipping containers in the Lagos port filled with illegal weapons, including rockets, grenades and bullets. The company, CMA CGM, said it was a victim of false cargo declaration.
