Obama's claim that he "took an action to change the law," though, could fuel more complaints from congressional Republicans and governors in states like Texas who have accused the President of overstepping his constitutional bounds. Obama has shot back that House Republicans who object to his action should pass an immigration reform bill; he's endorsed one approved by the Senate in 2013. President Barack Obama told three people who repeatedly interrupted his latest speech on immigration to stop their yelling because he "just took an action to change the law." About 20 minutes into the speech, three women -- one standing four rows behind Obama, holding a sign reading "Stop Deportations Now," and the other two in the crowd -- shouted a series of complaints. Texas Governor-elect Greg Abbott is readying a legal challenge to Obama's executive order, while GOP lawmakers consider using spending bills this December to cut funding for the agencies that would implement Obama's order.
