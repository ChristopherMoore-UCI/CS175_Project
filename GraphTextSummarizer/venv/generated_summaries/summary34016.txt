CDC responds to sick passenger on flight Other Ebola scares As nervous Dallas residents watch Duncan's case unfold, more Ebola scares have popped up in other parts of the nation. About 10 people are at "higher risk" of catching Ebola after coming into contact with Duncan but have showed no symptoms, health officials said. Howard University Hospital in Washington said Friday that it had admitted a low-risk patient with symptoms that could be associated with Ebola, but health officials said Saturday that Ebola had been ruled out in that case. Monitoring high and low-risk contacts Relatives will be monitored for 21 days from their last contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the only patient to develop Ebola in the United States. Louise, who does not want her last name used, said Duncan told hospital staff that he had a fever and abdominal pain and had recently arrived from Liberia, key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola.
