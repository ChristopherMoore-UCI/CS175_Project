An Israeli think tank with close links to the government has simulated what would happen in the Mideast and internationally if Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities -- and concluded that reaction would be "in the direction of containment and restraint," not the trigger for a larger war. For its war game, INSS used ex-Israeli diplomats and military officials who played different roles, such as pretending to be the heads of state from Israel, the United States, Russia and Iran, reacting to developments in the first 48 hours after such an attack. The war game was planned and enacted in September -- the same month that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the United Nations General Assembly to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, holding up a picture of a spherical bomb and drawing a red line below the fuse. The Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) says it held a "war game" several weeks ago -- when "it appeared that the fall of 2012 would be a critical period" -- simulating the initial ramifications of Israeli airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The think tank's analysis of its simulation doesn't go into details about how Barack Obama or Mitt Romney might respond as U.S. president if Israel attacked Iranian nuclear sites.
