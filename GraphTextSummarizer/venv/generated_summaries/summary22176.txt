In Japan every person in the country has at least one mobile phone and when the tsunami tore across northern Japan, thousands like Takahashi pulled out a device from their pockets and started filming, making last year's disaster one of the most recorded in history. Nagata points out that Japan is recognizable to many people, even if they haven't visited the country. "To be able to do this in near real time and to do it to audiences across the globe is unprecedented in how much power it's giving to individuals," Nagata said. That voice belongs to 16 year old Mao Takahashi, who used his camera to record the moment the tsunami struck his neighborhood in Ishinomaki, Japan, on March 11, 2011. They no longer have to imagine what a tsunami is, they saw it live," said Tokyo-based technology consultant Steve Nagata.
