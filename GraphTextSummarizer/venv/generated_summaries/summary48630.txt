Expanding Wi-Fi service in New York has been a priority for Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Kim noted that more public Wi-Fi could lessen congestion on busy cellular networks in big, tech-savvy cities like New York and San Francisco, where chasing down those elusive 3G (or 4G) bars can be a frustrating experience. This might sound crazy, but if New York City has its way, people might actually start using them again to communicate with each other. "I think it's a good start for reusing payphones, which serve less and less need in our mobile-centric world," Ryan Kim wrote for tech blog GigaOm. In an era when it seems like everyone has a phone, smart or dumb, in their pocket, payphones may seem like just another technological dinosaur that the mobile age has relegated to the digital trash heap alongside pagers, beepers and busy signals.
