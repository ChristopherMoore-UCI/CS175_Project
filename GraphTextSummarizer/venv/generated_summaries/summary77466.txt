-- Former South African President Nelson Mandela is "resting at his home" in Qunu, Eastern Cape, South Africa announced Monday, amid concerns that his health is in decline. Earlier this year, concerns over Mandela's health flared after he was rushed from Cape Town and admitted to a Johannesburg hospital with pnemonia. " Mandela spent 27 years in prison under the white-dominated South African apartheid regime, finally walking free from Robben Island in 1990. He and South Africa's then-President F. W. de Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, and Mandela was elected president a year later. Since the health scare, neither the South African government, the Mandela family or the Mandela Foundation has released specific information on his health, saying it is a private matter.
