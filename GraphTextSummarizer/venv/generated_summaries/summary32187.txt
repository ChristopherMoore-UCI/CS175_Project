Kelly Gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals, the attorney general said in a statement last week. Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: Kelly Gissendaner and Owen planned the murder for months. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. The state was scheduled to snap that 70-year streak last week before Gissendaner's execution was first postponed.
