The six others identified are Joseph Wogan, 22, of Arizona; George and Wendy Hewitt of Washington state; Regina Bynum, 53, of Texas; Sharon Stewart, 47, of Nevada; and Gregory Morcom, 47, from Washington state. NTSB member Mark Rosekind described the devices, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as "significant new information." Five patients remained hospitalized Tuesday at Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center, four in serious condition and one in fair condition, the hospital said in a statement. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show. Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for a full analysis, Rosekind said.
