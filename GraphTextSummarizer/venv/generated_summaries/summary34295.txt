In the seven years since, Koner's determination to help families in Pembroke led to the creation of Family-to-Family, a nonprofit that connects more than 600 sponsor and recipient families in 13 communities nationwide. In addition to providing basic essentials, families exchange letters, swap photographs and share stories about cultural traditions and family events. "There are plenty of communities where families are struggling themselves, but will keep this as part of their budget," she says. " Through monthly food donations, Koner's organization has provided nearly 800,000 meals to struggling families across the country. Koner also learned of families in her own Hastings-on-Hudson community in need of help.
