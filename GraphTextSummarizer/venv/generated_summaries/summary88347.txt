The away victory saw the nine time European champions kick off a new era of European football under manager Carlo Ancelotti in some style. David Moyes also came through his first game as Manchester United manager unscathed as the club made its first European outing without Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm since 1985. Arjen Robben volleyed in a scooped pass from Alaba to tick off a first European win for Guardiola and his defending champions. -- Cristiano Ronaldo underlined just why Real Madrid agreed to pay him the big bucks on a scintillating evening of European football. Moyes watched Rooney -- the star striker he sold to United from Everton in 2004 -- pounce again with his 200th goal for Manchester United.
