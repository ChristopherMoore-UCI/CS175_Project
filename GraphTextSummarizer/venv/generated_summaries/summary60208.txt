The Islamic Center's leaders have said plans for the $100 million facility call for a community center including a mosque, performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. -- New details emerged Tuesday about the controversial "Park51" project, involving the proposed Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York City. It will be built on property the center already owns, two blocks from where the World Trade Center was destroyed by Islamic extremists on September 11, 2001. Within that space, the source said, 10,000 square feet -- just more than 8 percent -- would be designated for the Muslim prayer space. A source familiar with the project told CNN's Allan Chernoff the structure is being planned as an 11-story building.
