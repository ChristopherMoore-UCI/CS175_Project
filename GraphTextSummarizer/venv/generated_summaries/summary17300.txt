-- Two New Jersey men are facing charges of running a 9/11 memorial scam allegedly by collecting donations and selling memorial T-shirts from the back of a pickup truck painted with the World Trade Center towers, according to the state attorney general's office. Niemczyk was also charged with failure to file a personal state income tax return in 2011, and for failing to report thousands of dollars in proceeds from the 9/11 T-shirt sales and donations and other money he had won at a casino. The vendors charged between $3 and $6.90 per shirt, which Niemczyk and Scaglione then sold for $20 apiece, according to the state attorney general's office. Mark Niemczyk, 66, of Tinton Falls, and Thomas Scalgione, 41, of Manahawkin, allegedly sold T-shirts and collected donations out of their truck at 9/11 events from June 2010 until July 2012. according to a statement from the New Jersey attorney general.
