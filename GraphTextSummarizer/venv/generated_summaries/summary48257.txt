It owns the Venetian and the Palazzo gambling resorts in Las Vegas and has expanded into Asian markets, including resorts in Singapore and Macau. The project was officially unveiled to much fanfare in February, and Spanish government officials appeared receptive to the promise of tens of thousands of jobs to build and later operate the casino and hotels, to help get Spain back on its feet economically. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said that Las Vegas Sands had made demands regarding tax issues and other conditions that couldn't be met under Spanish and European Union law. As a result, we will no longer pursue this opportunity," said Las Vegas Sands Chairman Sheldon Adelson, the American billionaire political activist, in a statement. Opponents all along said the Vegas-style resort would create only low-skilled and low-paying jobs -- not the development model needed for Spain, and they also seemed concerned the resort would attract organized crime.
