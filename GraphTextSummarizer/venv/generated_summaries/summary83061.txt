"The environmental significance of the Coral Sea lies in its diverse array of coral reefs, sandy cays, deep sea plains and canyons. The proposed Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve will cover 989,842 square kilometers (around 380,000 square miles) -- an area roughly one tenth the size of the U.S. "Australia's vast oceans provide a source of food and resources, and are a place of recreation. It contains more than 20 outstanding examples of isolated tropical reefs, sandy cays and islands," he added. The largely uninhabited islands also support critical nesting sites for green turtles and a range of seabird species. The western half contains most of the species-rich coral reefs and critical spawning sites for black marlin and threatened tuna," Darren Kindleysides from the Australian Marine Conservation Society said in a statement.
