South Korea Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the move was in accordance with international norms. "The new KADIZ's southern region was adjusted so that it is in line with Incheon Flight Information Region, which is internationally used (recognized) and does not overlap with that of neighboring countries. -- China has expressed "regret" over South Korea's decision to expand its air defense zone to include an area claimed by both countries, the country's official Xinhua news agency has reported. South Korea's move came after China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea last month. The Chinese zone covers a disputed reef, called the Suyan rock by China and Ieodo by South Korea.
