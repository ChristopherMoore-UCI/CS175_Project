But a lot of public school teachers want nothing to do with it. It was not smart of Damon to attack high-stakes testing -- especially since his own kids, because they attend private school, don't have to worry about how bad some of our public schools would be without the accountability measures that their daddy opposes so vehemently. Damon is himself a product of public schools, a fact that he eagerly shared with the crowd of teachers that he addressed in Washington in July 2011 as part of a protest called "Save Our Schools." So despite his fondness for public schools, the 42-year-old actor doesn't want his children anywhere near them. "Sending our kids in my family to private school was a big, big, big deal," Damon said in the interview.
