-- A video purporting to be from a vigilante group whose goal is the eradication of the Zetas cartel from the state of Veracruz, Mexico, has surfaced on the Internet, but its credibility remains unproven. But U.S. officials with knowledge of the group said Gente Nueva was not a vigilante group but a facade for the Sinaloa cartel, which at the time was battling the Zetas and Gulf Cartel in Veracruz. The speaker says that the group's only goal is to kill members of the Zetas, a ruthless cartel whose area of influence includes the eastern state of Veracruz. In 2007, a group named the "Gente Nueva," or New People, made itself known through menacing notes, web-posted videos, torture and executions and quasi-patriotic rhetoric. The Zetas and Gulf cartel have since split into warring factions.
