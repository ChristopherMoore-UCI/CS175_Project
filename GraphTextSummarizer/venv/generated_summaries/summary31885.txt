But Confederation of African Football (CAF) president Hayatou has since confirmed to CNN that they had not been expelled from the tournament but were granted special dispensation. Angolan authorities have arrested two people involved in the attack, state media reported, while goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale remains in a stable condition in a South African hospital but needs a ventilator as he recovers from being shot. African football federation president Issa Hayatou has exclusively told CNN that Togo were not disqualified from the Africa Cup of Nations but were granted permission to leave. Togo left the competition following the tragic events that the delegation went through," Hayatou told CNN. "Because of what happened the Togolese delegation didn't have the morale or the conscience for them to participate in the tournament. " Group B has now been reduced to three teams: Ghana, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso.
