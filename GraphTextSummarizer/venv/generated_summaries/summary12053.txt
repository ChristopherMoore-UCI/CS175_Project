Luis Figo has entered the race to become FIFA president determined to change an organization he describes as all too often associated with "scandal." " Figo joins former Paris Saint-Germain star David Ginola, independent candidate Jerome Champagne, Asian Football Confederation vice-president Prince Ali and Michael van Praag, the head of Dutch football, in the running to become president. Soccer's governing body enlisted U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia to probe claims that former FIFA member Mohamed Bin Hammam used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid, charges he and Qatar have strenuously denied. His work for Inter Milan and the Portuguese national team also means he satisfies FIFA's rule that states all candidates must have played an active role in association football for two of the five years. "I care about football, so what I'm seeing regarding the image of FIFA -- not only now but in the past years -- I don't like it," he told Alex Thomas in Madrid.
