" As of Monday afternoon, the Kickstarter project to fund Salmon's short film had raised about $124,000 -- some of it donated by fans of Gaiman, the internationally celebrated author of "Coraline" and other works. Searching for funds to make his film a reality, Salmon turned to Kickstarter, an online fundraising site for creative projects. Since Kickstarter's launch in April 2009, more than 300,000 people have pledged more than $25 million toward what the site calls "creative ideas and ambitious endeavors," co-founder Yancey Strickler said. On Salmon's project, a $25 pledge gets a digital download of the film, $50 gets a DVD and, at the top end, a $5,000 pledge [there have been six so far] earns an associate producer credit, VIP seating with Gaiman and Salmon at a screening of the movie and other rewards. "I think that the best thing about Kickstarter is it takes the ability to decide what you see, what happens, from the privileged few to the crowd," Gaiman said Monday via e-mail.
