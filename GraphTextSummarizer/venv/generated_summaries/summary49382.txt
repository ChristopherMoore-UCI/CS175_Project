While  BP successfully stopped the flow of oil on July 15 by embedding a  cement plug near the top of the well, permanently sealing the well has  been a process full of fits and starts. Instead, it failed, triggering the  world's largest   accidental oil spill and sending 4.1 million barrels of oil into  the   Gulf. Installing the device  "resulted in the necessary conditions to commence the finalization of  the relief well," Thad Allen, the government's appointed national  incident commander in charge of overseeing the oil spill response, said  in a statement Monday. Just last week,  Allen laid out a possible timetable that pushed the "bottom kill" -- a  process in which heavy mud and cement are pumped into the bottom part of  the original well via the relief well -- into October. -- BP said it resumed drilling Monday on a relief well, as efforts to  permanently seal the previously leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well appeared  to be entering their final stages.
