France, temporarily dazed by conceding, began to assert itself with the impressive Mathieu Valbuena beginning to cause Germany problems. Germany, the "bogey team" as it is known in France, wrote another painful chapter into Les Bleus' World Cup history on Friday. At the time, France's World Cup hopes were in the balance with the game at 1-1 when Patrick Battiston ran on to meet Michel Platini's pass. In 10 previous ties where it had trailed at halftime of a World Cup tie, France had lost on each and every occasion. Battiston was the overwhelming favorite to reach the ball first -- and he did so, but as he approached, West Germany goalkeeper Toni Schumacher laid the Frenchman out cold with a brutal attack.
