-- Jerome Champagne, the only candidate currently standing against FIFA president Sepp Blatter, is resolutely refusing to take the gloves off against his rival in the race to decide who will lead football's world governing body. " England's Football Association chairman Greg Dyke recently described a FIFA meeting as "like something out of North Korea" in which the organization's federations adopted an attitude to Blatter of "hail to the leader." During his time there, Champagne worked closely with Blatter, tasked with overseeing improvements in relations with national associations and other international sporting bodies including the International Olympic Committee. But Champagne rejected the idea that Blatter ruthlessly controls things from the top, rather seeing the man who has been at FIFA's helm for the past 16 years as akin to the leader of a democratically elected head of state. Champagne's enthusiasm to expose his own record to public scrutiny is something that FIFA should be doing with U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia's report into that bidding process, the Frenchman argues.
