The Slingbox is a device that streams content from cable and satellite providers to mobile devices and computer, allowing you to watch whatever is playing on your TV or recorded on your DVR far from your home. Until cable companies and content creators embrace Ã  la carte television, tools like Slingbox are a necessary stopgap for a lot of people. The Slingbox is a pat solution for people willing to pay for cable or satellite subscriptions, who want to watch shows on other devices (a trend called "place shifting"). For the many people playing device Jenga in their entertainment centers, that means the 500 will always have to be perched on top of the Xbox, DVR, DVD player or Wii. It can be hard work that requires time and a larger amount of technical know-how than many cable subscribers are likely to have.
