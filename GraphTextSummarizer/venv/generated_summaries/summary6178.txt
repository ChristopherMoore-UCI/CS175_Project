Promosing Briton Amir Khan took a huge step towards a world title shot at lightweight after a fifth-round technical decision win over Mexican legend Marco Antonio Barrera in Manchester on Saturday. The 2004 Olympic silver medalist faced a major step up in class against Barrera but victory means he could be in line for a world title shot later in the year, probably against WBO champion Juan Manuel Marquez. Amir Khan (right) lands another punch on Marco Antonio Barrera on his way to a points victory on Saturday. Despite being far from home, Barrera received a rapturous reception from the British crowd while Khan was amazingly booed by some. Barrera could only really see from one eye and his task was made more difficult as Khan boxed, moved and showboated in the style of a future champion.
