With Hernandez and his family watching, as well as the family and friends of victim Odin Lloyd, we're about to find out. Jury selection begins Friday, as attorneys begin to whittle down a pool of more than 1,100 potential jurors to the small group that will decide whether Hernandez is guilty of murdering semipro football player Odin Lloyd. If they had been admitted, McCann said, the defense and prosecution could have debated the meaning and let the jurors weigh the arguments Hernandez's texts to Lloyd: Jurors will, however, be able to see texts between Hernandez and Lloyd from earlier that night when the football player invited Lloyd to hang out. For example, if former Hernandez friend Alexander Bradley testifies, he won't be able to mention he's suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the right eye a few months before Lloyd's death. At about 3:20 a.m. on June 17, 2013, prosecutors say, Lloyd was in a car driven by Hernandez with Wallace and Ortiz.
