Like my dear Uncle Frank, who died at 48 -- an astonishingly young age, I later realized -- of throat cancer, when I was in eighth grade. Depression and cigarettes made comfortable bedfellows. Too young to go to Woodstock, I could still bang out a Joan Baez tune on my guitar, recite enough lines of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" to prove I was cooler than cool and buy cigarettes. Heck, I was bringing home $52 a week and spending less than $3 on my nicotine habit, with cigarettes costing 35 cents a pack. Compared to a lot of things I could be spending my money on, cigarettes were tame and cheaper, I kept telling myself.
