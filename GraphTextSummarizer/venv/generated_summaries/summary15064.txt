Rose is also in the hunt in a big group at eight under, including fellow Englishman Lee Westwood.

The World No.1 has been followed by sizable and sometimes over enthusiastic galleries in Antalya and was left frustrated by rain delays on the first day. But most eyes will be on Woods, who is hunting his first win in a European Tour event for four years to add to his five victories on the PGA Tour this season to take him back to the top of the rankings.
