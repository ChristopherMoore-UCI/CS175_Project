In today's funding climate, when 90% of applications requesting financial support for new ideas from most OECD governmental sources are turned down, peer review committees shift their support to work that is safe and incremental. At a time when governmental support for science in many OECD countries has not kept up with inflation, caution overrides our craving for originality. Most scientists believe that creativity is innate, yet 30 years of research has demonstrated that novel thinking can be taught. What should be the ascendant end of the scale, the joy of producing surprising improvements in health and prosperity, has become outweighed by societal caution. Although we know that some of the most novel ideas come from young people, we are not giving our best and brightest their intellectual independence until they are middle aged.
