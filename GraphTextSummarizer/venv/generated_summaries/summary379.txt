He was near the camp at Atmeh, Syria, close to the Turkey border, when he was abducted in March 2013, ACTED spokesman Adrien Tomarchio said. ISIS, one of the major belligerents in Syria's civil war pitting rebel groups against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has taken large swaths of northern and eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate. A British hostage whose life ISIS threatened in a video was helping to provide humanitarian relief in Syria when he was abducted last year, an aid agency said. ISIS, an Islamist militant group that calls itself the Islamic State, posted a video online this week showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff -- the second beheading of a U.S. journalist by ISIS in two weeks. David Haines is a logistics and security manager for ACTED, a Paris-based relief organization that was helping provide food, tents and water at a camp for tens of thousands of people displaced by Syria's civil war, the agency said Friday.
