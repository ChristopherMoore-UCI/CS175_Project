TV show and movie costume designer Patricia Field dressed the characters in haute couture as they skipped down the streets of New York City in $600 stilettos. Kristin Davis surrounded by models and Belk store official Arlene Goldstein. Wearing a plaid green A-line spring skirt from her new fashion line, paired with a black patent leather belt and black leather gladiator sandal stilettos, "Sex and the City" actress Kristin Davis is the perfect combination of sweet and fierce when we meet up after her fashion show at the Belk department store in Atlanta, Georgia. Target features affordable lines from high-end designers like Alexander McQueen and Isaac Mizrahi. It's a look that totally says her character, Charlotte, with a little bit of screen pal Carrie.
