There's no law that bars women from driving in Saudi Arabia, and I hope more women will go out and drive." In recent years, though, more women have challenged the government, urging officials to overturn the ban and taking to streets in remarkable displays of civil disobedience. "We're asking girls in different regions to go out," she said, "because we're trying to see if police in different regions react differently to cases of women driving." Alyami, who's been an avid supporter of a two-month-old campaign seeking to gain the right to drive for women in Saudi Arabia, told CNN she and Naseef were hoping to get caught. The issue of women driving is a particularly sensitive and controversial one in Saudi Arabia, the last country on Earth where females don't have that right.
