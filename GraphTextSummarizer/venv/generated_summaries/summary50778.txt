Britney Spears kicks off Las Vegas casino residency KISS, known for its fireworks and over-the-top energy and volume, "will unleash its signature elaborate set designs, jam-packed set list, intense pyrotechnics and much more for nine of the biggest shows in KISS performance history," the Hard Rock news release said. The group, which is in the middle of a summer tour with Def Leppard, will play nine nights in The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas in November. Extended stays in Las Vegas are proving profitable for a growing list of music acts, including Olivia Newton John and Britney Spears. While KISS usually plays for tens of thousands of fans in arena and stadium shows, the Vegas shows will be much more intimate, with less than 4,000 seats. Both singers have filled Vegas venues for weeks at a time this year.
