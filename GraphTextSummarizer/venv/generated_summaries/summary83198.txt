The agency alleged that Orbitz failed to "clearly and prominently" inform travelers about potential baggage fees during the airline ticket purchasing process, and in doing so, violated a new rule intended to make airline fees more transparent. "The Department adopted its rules on baggage fees to ensure that consumers have complete and accurate information about how much they will have to pay when they book a flight, and we will continue to take enforcement action when carriers and ticket agents fail to comply with our rules," Transportation Secretary Ray Lahood said in a statement. Tim Enstice, Orbitz communications manager, told CNN: "As the order acknowledges, we promptly corrected how we displayed airline baggage fee information to be consistent with DOT's preference. -- Online travel company Orbitz was fined $50,000 Monday by the Department of Transportation for failing to properly disclose baggage fees on its website. In announcing the fine, the DOT said it had ordered Orbitz to immediately fix the problem to avoid further fines.
