Crouse was trained as a crisis intervention officer, firearms instructor and defensive tactics instructor. A witness saw Ashley approach the officer's vehicle -- where Crouse was at the time -- and open fire, then flee the scene, police said. "He was a lifelong public servant," Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said of Crouse at Monday's service. -- The Virginia Tech community on Monday remembered Deriek Crouse, the police officer who was gunned down last week while conducting a routine traffic stop on campus. An online effort known as "Hokies for Crouse" had raised nearly $75,000 for the Crouse family as of early Monday afternoon.
