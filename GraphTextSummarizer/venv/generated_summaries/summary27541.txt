Miranda Kerr was all smiles as she left the Stella McCartney show at the Opera Garnier in Paris on Monday morning, but despite her cheery disposition, she says juggling mommyhood and modeling is no easy task. "I'm still breastfeeding so I have to express milk and send it back to [9-month-old son Flynn Christopher], and then try and see him on my breaks," the Australian model, 28, told PEOPLE as she left the show, one of many she has walked in during Paris Fashion Week. "It's funny because Stella's little girl Reiley is almost the same age as Flynn so watch out -- Flynn might start dating her," she said with a giggle. Having recently left Paris for London where Bloom is promoting his new film "The Three Musketeers," Kerr admits she's already looking forward to being reunited after the shows and getting some much-needed sleep. But luckily husband Orlando Bloom is usually on hand to help out, especially when it comes to diaper-changing duties.
