He further said that her quick reaction was a result of training that military police took after the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, in which Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 31 others on the base. "It was clearly heroic what she did in that moment in time," said Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commander. It was there he "was engaged by local law enforcement here at Fort Hood." Though not much is yet known about the policewoman involved in ending Wednesday's shooting spree, Fort Hood is home to the 89th Military Police Brigade, a "combat-ready, deployable force" that can support worldwide operations, according to the brigade's web page. A soldier has committed a deadly mass shooting at Texas' Fort Hood again.
