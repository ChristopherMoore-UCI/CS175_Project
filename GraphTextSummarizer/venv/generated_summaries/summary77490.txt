That's the way much of Ferguson feels as it waits for the St. Louis County grand jury to decide whether Officer Darren Wilson should stand trial in the shooting of Michael Brown. They point to witness testimony and leaked grand jury documents that suggest Brown might have attacked Wilson, struggled for his gun and perhaps even charged the officer after the tussle over the weapon. Brown's shooting on August 9 also touched a national nerve, with protests decrying racism and police brutality taking place around the country since his death. Brown's supporters have turned out in force, but Wilson's supporters have demonstrated on occasion as well. Many told CNN in August that other witnesses allege Wilson shot Brown at least six times as he stood about 30 feet from Wilson's police cruiser.
