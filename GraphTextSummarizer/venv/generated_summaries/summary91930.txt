"I feel bad for the tournament," said the 28-year-old, whose partner is Paulina Gretzky, the model daughter of ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. U.S. Ryder Cup stars Dustin Johnson and Zach Johnson withdrew from the Ballantine's Championship Monday, citing concerns over recent tensions between North and South Korea. The sponsor of a top golf tournament in South Korea insists it is safe to go ahead despite two American players pulling out due to security fears. However, I don't want to take the chance."
