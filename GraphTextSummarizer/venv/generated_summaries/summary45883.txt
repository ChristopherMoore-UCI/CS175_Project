"This is amazing, I definitely did not know they were doing this, and I just got a call from a friend saying they were, so I just ran over here and it's amazing," Guerrero told CNN affiliate WFTS. Dunedin City Manager Rob DiSpirito told CNN that the first complaint was lodged by 61-year-old Doug Wilkey in 2013. In at least four e-mails to the city since then, Wilkey complained that Guerrero's stand caused excessive trash, traffic, noise, and affected the property value of his home, which is next door to where the stand is set up. On Monday, the station surprised Guerrero and sent an employee to work the lemonade stand until he got home from school. "We respect his right to have an opinion and took it seriously enough to do an investigation," said DiSpirito, who added that there has only been one person who has submitted complaints.
