Texas A&M's Corps of Cadets, the nation's largest, will be under the command of a woman next year for the first time ever, the school announced on Monday. Seven members of the Corps who joined the military have been awarded the Medal of Honor, given to American soldiers who display conspicuous "gallantry above and beyond the call of duty. More cadets have been commissioned into the armed services from Texas A&M than any other university in the nation, with the exception of the service academies themselves. The Corps has specialized units to prepare cadets for the elite Army Rangers or Navy SEALs. Many know the Corps for its Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, a precision military band that plays at many of Texas A&M's football games.
