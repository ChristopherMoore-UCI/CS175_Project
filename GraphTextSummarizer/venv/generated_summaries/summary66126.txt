While taking all possible measures to prevent further loss of life, we adamantly refuse to forfeit our way of life. In an act of terror, those responsible destroyed and forever altered the lives of hundreds of people. American security forces and policy-makers face complex challenges. Though questions remain about those responsible for the attack, the horrendous bombing attack on the Boston Marathon sought to instill paralyzing fear, inflict debilitating trauma and force us to forfeit our freedom. Anyone who has suffered the agony of terror knows the pain of the victims and their families as well as the radius of the emotional damage inflicted on countless citizens.
