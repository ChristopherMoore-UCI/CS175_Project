The 36-year-old called for a referral after England batsman Kevin Pietersen was ruled not to have edged a delivery from Ryan Harris to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. -- Frustrated Australia captain Ricky Ponting was fined for arguing with the umpires as England took complete control of the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne on Monday thanks to Jonathan Trott's century. Australia level Ashes series with emphatic Perth win Mitchell Johnson continued his revival of form which saw Australia level the series at 1-1 with victory in the last match in Perth, as the left-arm paceman had Paul Collingwood (8) and the in-form Ian Bell (1) caught hooking at short deliveries. Video replays and sound technology showed no contact with the bat, but Ponting nonetheless remonstrated with umpires Aleem Dar and Tony Hill. He apologized for his action and stated that he has nothing but respect for the umpires and his on-field actions were not intended to show disrespect to Aleem Dar or Tony Hill."
