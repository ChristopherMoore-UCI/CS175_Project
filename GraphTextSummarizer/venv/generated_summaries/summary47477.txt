American Edwards also fell but escaped serious injury, while former multi-world champion Rossi returned unhurt to the pits on his Ducati. The Italian sports community was left stunned by Simoncelli's death and a minute's silence was held at all major events, including Serie A football games. "Marco Simoncelli succumbed to injuries sustained in the Malaysian MotoGP," read a short statement on the official MotoGP website to confirm the fatality. The tragic accident happened when Simoncelli came off at Turn 11 of the Sepang circuit while in fourth place. The race was abandoned and Simoncelli was given emergency treatment at the track's medical center, but it was to no avail.
