But in the early stages of mass casualty disasters, families often share the experience of grief with other families whose loved ones have died, sometimes joining together in a family assistance center to await news of their loved ones and the identification of the remains. This may be particularly useful if family and friends don't seem to understand or appreciate the grief one is experiencing. Grief isn't magically resolved through these rituals, but it is one step in the process of building a new life without the presence of the loved one. Indeed, cultures around the world (and religions are a part of one's culture) still observe different, important, traditions for what happens with human remains, most commonly ranging from burial to various forms of cremation. The most helpful process in dealing with grief seems to be talking with family, friends and spiritual leaders.
