He had just signed it "Mark at High View Books"; I was able to find him in Smithfield, which is how I found out that he was Mark Dalton. -- I wish the titans of Wall Street could meet Mark Dalton. With Wall Street losing people's confidence in recent days over the way it is alleged to treat its customers' money, I got the letter out again. You see them all the time describing used books: "Fair," "Good," "Very Good," "Near Fine," "Fine"-- they would seem to be approximations. I asked Dalton if he had been following the recent reports from Wall Street.
