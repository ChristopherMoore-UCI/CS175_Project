Ships and aircraft battled the blaze on the Shoko Maru, a 998-ton tanker anchored about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the port of Himeji in western Japan, the coast guard said. The coast guard said it was still investigating the cause the explosion on the ship, which belongs to Shoho Shopping Co. Ltd, a company based in Hiroshima, Japan. There was no immediate danger to other ships, as the tanker was located outside of the port facility, the coast guard said, adding that an exclusion zone was being set up around the damaged vessel. The tanker wasn't loaded when the blast went off Thursday morning, the coast guard said, reducing fears of a major environmental disaster.
