The gunman responsible for the terrorist attack in Ottawa last week was "driven by ideological and political motives" and made a video of himself, police said Sunday. Zehaf-Bibeau had ties to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources said last week. He was a Canadian citizen who may have had dual Libyan-Canadian citizenship, according to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson. He opened fire Wednesday at Canada's National War Memorial and Parliament Hill, killing army reservist Cpl. Zehaf-Bibeau was applying for a passport -- an application that was under investigation -- at the time of the attack, Paulson said.
