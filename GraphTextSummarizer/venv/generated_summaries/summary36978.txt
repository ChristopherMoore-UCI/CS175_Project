Clinton broached the issue of human rights with Chinese leaders, but drew criticism from human rights activists for downplaying the issue's importance in the overall relationship with China. While not delving into U.S. human rights practices, the report acknowledged that the U.S. human rights record remains a concern around the world, and it said President Obama has vowed to apply global human rights ideals at home. "The government of China's human rights record remained poor and worsened in some areas," the report said in reviewing the last year, finding Chinese authorities "committed extrajudicial killings and torture, coerced confessions of prisoners and used forced labor." The "2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices," the annual report of human rights around the world, also accused China of "severe cultural and religious repression" of minorities in Tibet and other regions and increasing harassment and detention of dissidents and activists who signed a petition calling for respect of human rights. But officials have said privately that a new approach to dealing with China's human rights record, including less public criticism and more private discussions, may prove more productive in changing Chinese behavior.
