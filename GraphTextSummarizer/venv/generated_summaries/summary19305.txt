Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston has been cleared by a school panel that considered whether he violated the student conduct code in relation to allegations that he sexually assaulted another student two years ago. Florida State's investigation was launched under Title IX, which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if criminal charges are never filed. The independent hearing officer on the panel, Major B. Harding, ruled that "in sum, the preponderance of the evidence has not shown that you are responsible for any of the charged violations of the code. Winston, who won the Heisman trophy in 2013, led the Seminoles to an undefeated regular season and a place in the inaugural College Football Playoff. Winston was not arrested in the alleged 2012 incident, but he faced a code-of-conduct violation charge for sexual misconduct in the university hearing.
