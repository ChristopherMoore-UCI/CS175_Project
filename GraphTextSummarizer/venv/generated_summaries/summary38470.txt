Anyway, Latinos believed Barack Obama; 67 percent of Latinos voted for Barack Obama and at the end President Barack Obama didn't keep his promise. So, Obama broke his promise, Democrats don't have the political will to push for immigration reform right now and Republicans are missing in action during immigration. So they are not willing to push their luck right now on immigration and since immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, can't vote there is really nothing to gain. They don't get the fact that immigration is the most important symbolic issue for Latinos. The Republican Party has to make peace with Latinos, otherwise they're going to keep on losing election after election after election.
