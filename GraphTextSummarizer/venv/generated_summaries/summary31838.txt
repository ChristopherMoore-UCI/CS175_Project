Ron Darling: I think what has been extraordinary is that all the pitchers, whether they came through trades (Phillies with Roy Halladay and Roy Oswalt; Texas with Cliff Lee) or up through the farm system like the San Francisco Giants, or a free agent like CC Sabathia in New York, the great thing about it is they all deliver. Whether it's Tim Lincecum's 14 strikeouts, Cliff Lee and his ability to throw complete games and strike out hitters without walking anybody, and of course Roy Halladay's no-hitter. This is an edited transcript: CNN: Has this been an extraordinary post-season for pitching, or does it always improve in the playoffs? CNN: What were your thoughts on the Texas Rangers celebrating their division series win over Tampa Bay with ginger ale instead of champagne because their star, Josh Hamilton, is recovering from drug and alcohol abuse? Darling: I thought it was one of the special moments of the post-season. CNN: Why have there been so many errors in this post-season? Darling: There have been 31 errors so far, and what we should read into it is that the game has changed.
