The unrest comes amid Syria's three-year civil war pitting government forces against rebels trying to end the rule of al-Assad. If confirmed, a chlorine attack would undermine a deal brokered by Russia last fall and approved by the U.N. Security Council that requires Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to the international community. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last week that the United States "had indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month in the opposition-dominated village of Kfar Zeita." -- At least 58 people in Syria were killed Tuesday in "terrorist" mortar and car bomb attacks in the city of Homs and the Damascus area, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. The agreement halted threats of U.S. military action after allegations Syria launched a chemical attack last August that killed over 1,400 people.
