The group has created an online petition, multiple YouTube videos and launched website called AdsForDictators.org calling on Facebook to return the money and take down the Assad campaign page. Even though it removed the ads promoting the page, Facebook says it is not considering taking down the Assad campaign page. -- Facebook is facing pressure to return money it accepted to run ads promoting its page for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's presidential campaign. It is regularly updated with photos from the Assad campaign, including pictures of Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma, going to a polling station to vote Tuesday. The campaign to reelect al-Assad has maintained an active presence on Facebook and other social media with additional accounts on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, which are all regularly updated.
