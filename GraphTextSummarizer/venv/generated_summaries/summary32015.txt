Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names, released Saturday. Among the biggest drops last year were Mylee and Miley, as in singer Miley Cyrus. The Social Security Administration started compiling name lists in 1997. As always, religious names retained their popularity -- even if some were somewhat unconventional. The 10 most popular girls' names, in order, are: Isabella, Emma, Olivia, Sophia, Ava, Emily, Madison, Abigail, Chloe and Mia.
