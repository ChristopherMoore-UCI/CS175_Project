" "Five or six years ago, we probably had one female-led series on the stands," pointed out Marvel editor Sana Amanat, who has made it her mission to make comics for women and other underserved demographics. 2014 was a banner year for female characters, with new series for the aforementioned "Captain Marvel," as well as "She-Hulk," "Ms. Marvel" and "Angela: Asgard's Assassin." Tuesday night's premiere of "Marvel's Agent Carter," which drew ecstatic reactions on social media, is just the latest example of more action series and films featuring women. " And characters such as Agent Carter show how things have changed in portraying heroic women. "It feels like we have great roles in Black Widow and Pepper Potts, and Marvel is leading the way for more female characters," she said.
