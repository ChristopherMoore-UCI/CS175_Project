In a court filing in New York, government lawyers asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by Victor Restis against the group United Against Nuclear Iran. UANI lawyers had sought to obtain a deposition of Restis to question him about alleged Iran ties. Government lawyers also filed a classified court filing that ostensibly provided more information to the judge. The government filing said an unnamed U.S. agency had determined the case risked revealing government secrets. Restis' lawyers had sought to compel legal discovery -- the turning over of documents and other information -- from the group, its executives, and from Wall Street investor Thomas Kaplan, who Restis' lawyers claim is a funder of UANI.
