Iran's vital oil industry appears to be the latest front in a power struggle between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- a fight that overseas analysts say the colorful president appears to be losing. "I think it's a symptom of the general dissatisfaction with President Ahmadinejad that his powers and movement are being curtailed by the various power centers in Iran," said Nader, an expert on Iranian politics at the RAND Corp., an American think tank. "I think Ahmadinejad underestimated the power of Khamenei, and he overestimated his own power," said Esfandiari, who was jailed for more than three months in 2007 during a visit to Iran. Esfandiari said Ahmadinejad appears to have violated one of Khamenei's cardinal principles for Iran's leadership: Settle your differences in private. In early May, Ahmadinejad publicly swore allegiance to Khamenei and stressed his dedication to the principle of Velayat-e-Faqih, or Guardianship of the Supreme Jurisprudence, which forms the bedrock of Iran's Shiite theocratic rule.
