" Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the Peoples Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian "zoning" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. The primaries will be held between October 18 and 20, said Rufai Alkali, a spokesman for the People's Democratic Party. On Wednesday, President Goodluck Jonathan said he intends to run, and will make a formal declaration on Saturday. A single candidate will be ratified on October 23, Alkali said.
