-- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, may have to fold his efforts to push a measure legalizing online poker in the United States into a tax-cut bill, in light of strenuous opposition from Republicans. "Creating a federal right to gamble that has never existed in our country's history and imposing an unprecedented new tax regime on such activity require careful deliberation, not back-room deals or earmarks for special interests," Republican Reps. Spencer Bachus of the Financial Services Committee; Dave Camp of the Ways and Means Committee and Lamar Smith of the Judiciary Committee wrote last week to Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. It would legalize online poker basically only in Nevada and New Jersey. Some House Republicans also bristled at news Reid was attempting to shoehorn the Nevada-friendly legislation into the tax deal. Democratic and Republican sources had told CNN Reid was pushing for the provision to be included in the bill to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.
