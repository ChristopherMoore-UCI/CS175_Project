"We expect to see about 20 meteors per hour when the shower peaks on Tuesday morning, Oct 21st," Bill Cooke, the head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, said in a NASA press release. The predawn sky may be full of meteors as the Earth passes through a debris stream from Halley's Comet. "Meteoroids from Halley's Comet strike Earth's atmosphere traveling 148,000 mph. For the best viewing, Cooke suggests going outside one to two hours before sunrise when the constellation Orion is high overhead. This happens every October, NASA says.
