A British expatriate who retires to Australia, for example, receives less money each week than if they had contributed the same amount during their working life and then emigrated to Barbados, Croatia, the Philippines, the United States, or one of more than 40 countries which do have reciprocal UK agreements. "I don't think we're going to make it the end of the road," said John Markham, director of UK parliamentary affairs for the International Consortium of British Pensioners. Under British rules, pensioners in a number of countries who do not have reciprocal agreements with the UK receive the same pension they were entitled to in the year they left Britain. The first court case was brought against the UK government in 2002 by Annette Carson, a British resident who moved to South Africa in 1989. -- British pensioner Ethel Kendall was "only 72" when she left the United Kingdom in 1986 to be closer to her family in Canada.
