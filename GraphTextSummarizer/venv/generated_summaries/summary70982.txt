-- Vice President Joe Biden emphasized a "new tone" in Washington and around the world as he delivered his first major speech Saturday in Munich, Germany. "America will do more," Vice President Joe Biden told the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday. "We reject as false the choice between our safety and ideals," Biden told the Munich Security Conference audience, which included German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. He said nations working together can help persuade Iran to forgo the development of nuclear weapons, an "illicit" program that Biden said is not conducive to peace. Biden stressed a commitment to reach peace in the Middle East and draw down U.S. forces in Iraq.
