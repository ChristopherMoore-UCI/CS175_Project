"A lot of people actually like that recipe." Based in the city of Blantyre, Malawi's chief commercial and industrial hub, Mtalimanja's baking business produces all sorts of custom-made "sweet temptations" -- from delicious red velvet cakes topped with moist cream cheese frosting to fluffy chocolate cupcakes full of rich flavor. "Red velvet [cake] -- that's a big thing at the moment," says Mtalimanja, founder of Sweet Temptations by Sungeni. "I worked late nights and was up very early for a period of six months." 'Everyone wants cake' Yet, as word spread out and orders started piling in, Mtalimanja decided to make Sweet Temptations her priority and main source of income. "I'm very passionate about what I do." Thus, last year, Mtalimanja decided to turn her passion for cake making into something bigger. A trained lawyer, Mtalimanja had been working in the local legal industry for a number of years when one day in late 2012 she began helping her sister-in-law bake desserts.
