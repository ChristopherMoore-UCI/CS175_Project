Andreini had been flying since he was 16 and had been performing at air shows for the past 25 years, Mott said. Col. David Mott identified the deceased as 77-year-old Eddie Andreini. He added: "No one wants to see an event like this and certainly ... our hearts go out and our condolences go out to the Andreini family and his crew, who have been working together for many years." -- A pilot died Sunday when his small plane crashed at an air show at Travis Air Force Base in California, an official said. The aircraft was upside down when it hit the ground, Mott said.
