It came at a steep price: Last year was the deadliest for coalition and U.S. troops in Afghanistan since the war began. "The year ahead is likely to be a tough one, too." President Barack Obama has promised to begin a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan starting in July, a pledge he reiterated during his recent State of the Union address. By 2015, Karzai predicted that Afghanistan will have "binding agreements with the United States and long-term partnerships with NATO" -- noting that the shift in security responsibility does not mean a clean break with international forces that have been engaged there for nearly a decade. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in an interview conducted with conference organizers and posted on its website, explained this move next month marks the start of "a gradual transition to lead Afghan responsibility -- province by province, district by district." In a letter to troops late last month, U.S. Gen. David Petraeus voiced a similar sentiment, saying the surge "inflicted enormous losses" on militants and weakened terror networks.
