Former Manchester United star Ronaldo will win the Pichichi crown, the award given for the league's top-scorer, the first Real Madrid player to claim the honor since Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy won it in 2007. -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice to break the record for goals in a La Liga season as Real Madrid routed Almeria 8-1 in the Bernabeu Saturday night. Earlier, three-time title winners Barcelona warmed up for their Champions League final against Manchester United with a 3-1 win at Malaga. Ronaldo's goals in each half took him to 40 for the season, two clear of the  previous record set by Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra in 1951 and matched by Real Madrid's Mexican star Hugo Sanchez in 1990. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola rested several of his star players, including Lionel Messi, ahead of next Saturday's game at Wembley.
