According to a CNN analysis of congressional records that looked at bills that became law and the number of days lawmakers worked, members of the House have spent more than 150 days and Senate just over 140 days in session so far, comparable to previous Congresses at this point in the term. "The Republican majority in the House, it has been one of the least productive in modern history, not surprisingly," Mann said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, recently called on House Speaker John Boehner to nix additional recesses, although some saw it as more of a political move. In the previous Congress, the House worked 286 days and the Senate worked 349 days. Leaders on both sides of the aisle point to the split nature of the current Congress -- with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate -- as the source of partisan showdowns that have further slowed legislative progress.
