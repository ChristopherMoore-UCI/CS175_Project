All kinds of excuses Shanon and Justin Boyles were high school sweethearts. For example, at dinner Justin usually eats a spinach leaf salad with tuna or baked chicken with broccoli. Their team wore matching black T-shirts with a new slogan: "Do you pinky promise?" On his website Justin has included a section where he asks readers to make their own promises -- to themselves or to their family -- to get healthy. Her mom had tried to explain why Justin was so sad, but Autumn didn't really understand diabetes or its dangerous implications. Since his diagnosis with type 2 diabetes in March -- and his pinky promise to Autumn -- Justin has lost more than 65 pounds.
