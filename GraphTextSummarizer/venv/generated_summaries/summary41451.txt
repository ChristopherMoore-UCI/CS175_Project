The numbers of civilian casualties have fallen off in recent months, since Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as U.S. commander in Afghanistan. U.S. and other international forces have been working to stop such fatalities, and they have accused Taliban militants of putting civilians in harm's way. In this Kunar province incident, Fazelayallah said the operation was launched without the knowledge of government officials in the province. -- Nine people killed in a military action targeting militants in eastern Afghanistan apparently were members of an insurgent network, a U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday. Coalition forces said they killed their targets, he said, but a delegation sent by the governor to investigate reported the civilian casualties.
