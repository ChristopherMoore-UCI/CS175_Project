When Bayern defeated outsider Raja Casablanca 2-0 in the final of FIFA's Club World Cup in Marrakech on Saturday, it collected a fifth trophy this year. Third-place in the Club World Cup went to Atletico Mineiro, which beat Guangzhou Evergrande 3-2 thanks to a stoppage time winner from Luan. Raja Casablanca failed in its bid to become the first African side to win the competition, although the Moroccan champion did well to reach the finale after upsetting South America's Atletico Mineiro. Bayern won the Bundesliga, Champions League and German Cup last season under Jupp Heynckes, with the European Super Cup and now Club World Cup coming with Pep Guardiola at the helm. Former world player of the year Ronaldinho scored for Brazili's Atletico Mineiro but was sent off in the 87th minute when he retaliated after being fouled.
