Women face shocking disparities when buying health insurance on the individual market: In the vast majority of states, nearly all the best-selling plans charge women more than men for the same coverage, a discriminatory practice known as "gender rating." On top of that, women may be required to pay extra for inadequate maternity coverage, or pay the full cost of maternity care itself, which averages $9,600 for an uncomplicated delivery. It bans pre-existing condition exclusions, prohibits gender rating and other forms of sex discrimination in health care, guarantees maternity coverage for all, and ensures that new plans cover recommended preventive care -- such as birth control, without co-payments or deductibles. The obstacles women face in gaining access to insurance and health care take an acute economic toll on them, as our report shows, and on the U.S. economy as a whole. As we've seen recently in the debate over access to birth control, the promise of expanded access to affordable health care for women only comes with the force of law behind it.
