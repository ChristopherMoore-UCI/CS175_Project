"I know, at 22, there are things that many of us have done in this  courtroom that we may not be proud of, decisions we may have made,"  Superior Court Judge Kimberly M. Esmond Adams, her voice quavering, told  defendant Aimee Michael. All four occupants of the Mercedes -- Robert Carter, his wife, Delisia Carter, their infant son Ethan Carter, and Kayla Lemons, Delisia Carter's 9-year-old daughter -- were killed, the newspaper reported. " Robert Carter's mother and sister, Sherry Fain and Tomeika Fain, told HLN's "Prime News" they were unmoved by the Michaels' apologies. They don't." Tomeika Fain said Aimee Michael should have received a longer sentence. Michael's mother, Sheila Michael, was sentenced to eight years for tampering with evidence and hindering her daughter's apprehension.
