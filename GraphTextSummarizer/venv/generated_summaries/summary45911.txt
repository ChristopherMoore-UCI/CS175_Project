The Old Lady of Turn had already secured their third scudetto in a row but goals from Fernando Llorente, Claudio Marchisio and an own goal by Cagliari goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, from a stunning Andrea Pirlo free kick that hit the post and bounced in off Silvestri, ensured that Juve finished on a record 102 points. "I want to say a massive thank you to all the players, every one of them has been phenomenal," Conte told Sky Sports Italia after the match. It has been a chaotic season of football in Italy, marred by fan violence, racism and continued failure in the UEFA Champions League. The victory ensured that they maintained a 100 percent record of home victories throughout the season, winning 33 of their 38 games and finishing an incredible 17 points clear of their nearest rivals Roma. -- Juventus became the first Italian club to reach 100 points in the league after comfortably defeating Cagliari 3-0 in their final Serie A match of the season.
