Directly below him hang the huge portraits of the man North Koreans call the Great Leader, Kim il Sung, and his son the so-called Dear Leader, One man beaming at our camera says, "we want to tell the world how proud we are to have such a man to lead us." Kim has inherited the power, adulation and responsibility few people could possibly be prepared for. Kim Jong Un is speaking to two audiences: his people and the outside world he stands apart from. In a rare concession, Kim says this regime will not allow people to suffer any more -- as close as he could get to admitting the government had failed the people in the past.
