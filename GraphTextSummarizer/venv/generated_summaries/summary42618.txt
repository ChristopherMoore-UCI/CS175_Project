A CNN 50 states pick: Crater of Diamonds Before Filppula's find, park staff had plowed the area to bring more diamonds to the surface for visitors to find. The sparkling wedge-shaped stone is about the size of an English pea, park interpreter Waymon Cox said in a news release. When fields get plowed, diamonds don't usually pop up. The area, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- you can dig for diamonds and keep them. "More than half an inch of rain had fallen two days before his visit, washing loose soil from the surface of the diamond search area, and, no doubt, uncovering the large, yellow gem," Cox said.
