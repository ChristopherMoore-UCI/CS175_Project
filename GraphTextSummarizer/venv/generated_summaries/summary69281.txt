" "We are concerned about reports of extremist groups operating in Syria and we take very seriously any claims that British nationals are among foreign fighters there," the Foreign Office statement added. -- British police arrested a man and a woman at London's Heathrow Airport as part of an probe into people traveling to Syria participate in alleged terror activities. The UK Foreign Office did not want to comment directly on the arrests but said the "deteriorating security situation (in Syria) leaves dangerous space for foreign fighters. One line of inquiry being followed by investigators, the police sources said, is whether the two suspects were involved in an incident in July in which Sunday Times photographer John Cantlie said he was held at gunpoint by rebels in Syria. The pair were taken to a central London police station and authorities began searches of two homes in east London as part of the investigation, police said.
