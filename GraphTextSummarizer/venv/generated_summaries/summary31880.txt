No one in Israel's armed forces intentionally acted to harm Egyptian security personnel, Amos Gilad, a defense official involved in maintaining Israel's relationship with the Egyptian military, told Israeli Radio on Saturday. -- Israel has issued a rare statement of "regret" for the recent deaths of several Egyptian security personnel, hours after Egypt said it was recalling its ambassador. The Egyptian claims of Israeli forces killing three of its security members and injuring four surfaced Thursday, the same day Israel launched airstrikes on Gaza. "The security at border has not been affected by the revolution, and no one from Egypt has crossed through to conduct the attacks on Israel,"  said Khaled Fouda, the governor of Southern Sinai, an Egyptian province. " Israel believes that the attacks had their roots in Gaza, but were coming out of the neighboring Egyptian region of Sinai.
