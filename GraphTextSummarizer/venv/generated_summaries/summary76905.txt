After passing through Dresden, the Elbe's floodwater will continue to flow to the north and west and should reach Torgau, in Saxony, and Wittenberg, in Saxony-Anhalt, over the weekend, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. A state of emergency has been declared in Bratislava, where the Danube is expected to rise further on Thursday, Slovakian fire department spokeswoman Silvia Jancovicova told CNN Thursday. Some 700 towns were affected by the floods, Czech fire service spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova said Thursday. The German city of Dresden waited anxiously Thursday to see if the swollen River Elbe, which has brought misery to thousands in the Czech Republic, would breach its flood defenses. River levels are declining across the country but roads, railway connections and river transport remain affected.
