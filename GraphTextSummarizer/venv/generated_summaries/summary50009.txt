Canada led three times in the match thanks to a hat-trick from captain Christine Sinclair, but each time the U.S. responded and eventually prevailed thanks to Morgan's dramatic winner. Undeterred Canada hit back, Sinclair powering a fine header beyond the despairing Hope Solo in the U.S. goal after 67 minutes. Protecting a proud Olympic record the U.S. responded and finally drew level when Megan Rapinoe's corner squeezed between Canada goalkeeper Erin McLeod and the near post 10 minutes into the second half. -- Team USA's women booked a fifth successive Olympic soccer final after Alex Morgan's header 20 seconds from the end of extra time handed them a dramatic 4-3 victory over Canada. Morgan nodded home in the final minute of extra-time to book the United States a tie with Japan in Thursday's Wembley final, where Pia Sundhage's team will go for a third Olympic gold.
