"Amnesty International delegates in Libya have met detainees being held in and around Tripoli, Misrata and Gharyan, who showed visible marks indicating torture inflicted in recent days and weeks. "Patients were brought to us for medical care between interrogation sessions, so that they would be fit for further interrogation. Our role is to provide medical care to war casualties and sick detainees, not to repeatedly treat the same patients between torture sessions. Several detainees in Libya have died after being tortured in recent weeks, the human rights group Amnesty International said Thursday. " The agency, known by its French acronym MSF, said it has treated 115 people with torture-related wounds from interrogation sessions.
