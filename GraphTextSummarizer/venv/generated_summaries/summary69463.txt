-- A man who jumped the White House fence on Tuesday was apprehended by uniformed Secret Service officers who approached him with guns drawn. The incident was broadcast live on CNN's "John King USA" program, which was produced from the North Lawn of the White House on Tuesday night. He will be charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court because he previously had been ordered to stay away from the White House due to past incidents, the agency said. After the man jumped the fence, armed officers ordered him to lie down and then handcuffed him before taking him into custody. A backpack thrown over the fence and lying on the ground nearby was being checked by security officers, who locked down the area as a precaution.
