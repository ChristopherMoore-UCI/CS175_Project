The BHA said there has only been one other case of anabolic steroids being found in a tested horse in recent years, which was when British trainer Howard Johnson allowed horses to run under the substances in 2008 and 2009. "I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules. "However, it is appropriate to charge the trainer with breaches of the rules related to medication records and conduct prejudicial to horse racing related to these horses, and therefore the trainer now faces 15 counts of these charges. The BHA carries out testing during race meetings and while horses are in training. The BHA conducted between 600-700 tests in 2012 while horses were in training.
