Michael Howlett, assistant director of the International Maritime Bureau, said the number of pirate attacks was "totally out of control... and totally unprecedented." There have been 101 reports of ships being attacked by pirates, including 40 hijackings, 34 cases of ships being fired upon, with over 800 crew members being affected, he said. The WFP in Somalia had been under threat with pirate attacks a serious danger for shipments of food into the impoverished country. Over on the west coast of Africa, in the waters off the coast of Nigeria, frequent attacks by pirates are causing similar concerns. As of December 5, a staggering 286 crew members aboard 14 vessels were still being held captive by pirates after a significant flurry of attacks that started in July this year. In a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks onshipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate.
