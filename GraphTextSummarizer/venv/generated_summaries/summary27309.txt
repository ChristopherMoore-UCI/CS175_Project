Turkey still bears the scars of a long guerrilla war waged between Kurdish separatist guerillas and the Turkish state. A city government official, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, confirmed reports that police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse Kurdish youths hurling firecrackers and gasoline bombs. -- The party of Turkey's ruling prime minister sailed to an easy victory in parliamentary elections on Sunday, winning a third term in office with 49.9% of the vote with 99.9% of the votes counted. "To the Turkish nation, whether you voted for AKP or not, the real winner of the 2011 elections is Turkey," Erdogan roared, to a crowd of flag-waving supporters. In his victory speech, Erdogan addressed the Kurds, Turkey's largest -- and long-oppressed -- ethnic minority.
