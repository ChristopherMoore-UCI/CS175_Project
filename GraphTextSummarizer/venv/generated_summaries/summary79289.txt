The people of Raqqa, the ISIS "capital" in Syria, have seen men crucified in the streets, a punishment for transgressions that serves as warning to anyone who might plan to defy the new authorities' rule and their version of Sharia, Islamic law. The religious justification for the executions, described by ISIS as part of its jihad -- a war to return the reign of an Islamic caliphate and impose the Quran's dictates -- gives the killings moral, theological clearance, all but precluding empathy toward non-members. Long before we heard what happened to James Foley, months before we learned that ISIS had killed hundreds of men, women and children of Iraq's Yazidi minority, burying some of them alive, the people of the Middle East had become acquainted with the mass executions, the brutal persecution of minorities, the killing of Christians, of Shiites, and of Sunnis or anyone else who posed a challenge, hesitated to follow its religious dictates, or resisted the ISIS advance in Syria and then Iraq. ISIS is not the first organization to use barbarism as a weapon of war; to use cruelty as a method of policy enforcement. Far from apologizing for its inhumanity, ISIS advertises it proudly, it taunts the world with it, and goes to great lengths to confirm that the acts that horrify us are not the work of rogue members but are, indeed, the organization's policy.
