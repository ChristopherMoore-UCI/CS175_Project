For Valentine's Day this year, zoo officials brought Wang a box filled with fruit and meat, and decorated it with love hearts and a note that said, "We Love You Wang!" Wang was born at a Japanese zoo, and GeeBee came from Canada after both were swapped for lions. Companies also showered him with toys and gifts, including an offer of a snow machine in the hopes that it might excite the animal long associated with subzero temperatures. GeeBee and Wang had spent their days together at the zoo since they were 6 months old. After her death, Wang walked around listless and shunned food and swimming, the latter a favorite pastime with GeeBee.
