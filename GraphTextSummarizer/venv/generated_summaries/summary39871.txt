House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the two party leaders at the center of the budget negotiations that led to a shutdown, "have become more unpopular since earlier this year, and both are facing the highest unfavorable ratings they have ever received in CNN polling," Holland said. The unfavorable numbers for the tea party movement are also at an all-time high in CNN surveys. And 87% say they disapprove of the job federal lawmakers are doing, higher than it's ever been in CNN polling. Those numbers are the reverse of where they stood in CNN polling in May when more respondents had a favorable view of the party than an unfavorable one. The Democratic and Republican unfavorable ratings are also all-time highs in CNN polling.
