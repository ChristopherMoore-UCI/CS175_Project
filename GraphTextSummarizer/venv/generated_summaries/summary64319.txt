Alexander Beltran Herrera, 35, was arraigned Monday on charges connected with the imprisonment of U.S. citizens Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell. On Monday, prosecutors described Beltran Herrera as a "fairly high ranking" member of the FARC. Beltran Herrera's extradition "underscores our resolve to hold accountable all those responsible for this crime and we will not rest until every one of them is brought to justice," said Lisa Monaco, assistant attorney general for national security, in a written statement. For part of a two-year period beginning in November 2004, Beltran Herrera was responsible for moving the hostages and keeping them imprisoned, the Justice Department said in a statement released Monday. Beltran Herrera appeared in court Monday wearing an orange jumpsuit.
