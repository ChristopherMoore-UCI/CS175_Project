Salaheddin Deputy Governor Ameen Mohammed told Iraqiya state TV that security forces in the province are on full alert, and police said the local government announced a three-day mourning period in Salaheddin. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group for al Qaeda in Iraq and other Sunni extremist groups, claimed responsibility for that bombing, authorities said. The explosion caused a fire at a fuel station nearby, police in Tikrit said, and most of those killed and wounded were young men who came to join police forces. The vice president called on authorities to tackle unemployment and to keep young people from sinking into hunger and crime. Tikrit's general hospital was overwhelmed with wounded people, some of whom had to be sent to hospitals in nearby towns of the Salaheddin province and to other locations, such as Irbil and Kirkuk.
