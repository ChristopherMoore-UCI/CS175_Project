The American, who has not been identified, was detained Monday for trespassing on North Korea's border with China, state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Thursday. " At the time, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Washington was concerned by reports that a Korean-American missionary, Robert Park, had gone into North Korea, but could not confirm them. North Korea announced December 29 that it was holding an American who had entered the country illegally from China on Christmas Eve. -- The North Korean government informed the State Department on Friday that it is holding a second American citizen who the North Koreans say entered the country from China, a State Department spokesman said. The United States relies on the Swedish Embassy to look after U.S. interests in North Korea.
