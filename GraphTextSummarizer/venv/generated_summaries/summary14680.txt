The Millennium Stadium -- Cardiff, Wales Now used only for Welsh international home fixtures, the Millennium stadium proved a revelation as a temporary home for English finals while Wembley was being refurbished, so much so that many people -- myself included -- felt that it was the perfect stage for such major matches as the FA Cup final.
