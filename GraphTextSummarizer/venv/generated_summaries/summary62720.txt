"Mike Tindall's actions reached a level of misconduct that was unacceptable in a senior England player and amounted to a very serious breach of the EPS Code of Conduct," England's professional rugby director Rob Andrew said in a statement Friday. Mike Tindall was fined Â£25,000 ($40,000) Friday and expelled from England's elite squad for his conduct on September 11 in Queenstown. He later said she was a friend, but the incident erupted in the British media and disrupted England's on-field focus. Manu Tuilagi was fined after jumping into the sea from a ferry in Auckland the day after England's quarterfinal defeat by France. "However, the incident is precisely the kind of dangerous, compromising situation the players were warned about prior to departure for New Zealand and that they were specifically told to avoid in the Code of Conduct."
