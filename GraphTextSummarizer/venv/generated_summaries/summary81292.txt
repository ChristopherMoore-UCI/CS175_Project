Encouraging laid-off and deferred attorneys to go into public service is filling a desperate need at public interest firms. Some attorneys and law students worry that paying corporate attorneys to work in public interest firms may displace those who actually wanted to work in the public sector in the first place. Public interest and legal aid firms serving the underprivileged have long been under-funded and overwhelmed with cases even in a good economy. "There is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity coming out of a difficult situation," said Esther Lardent, president of the Pro Bono Institute in Washington D.C., who began discussions this month with at least 15 corporate firms nationwide about placing unemployed attorneys in public interest firms. Other firms have already encouraged attorneys to go into the public sector.
