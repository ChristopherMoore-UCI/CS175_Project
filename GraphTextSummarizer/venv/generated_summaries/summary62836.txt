It was a horrible feeling." Parts of UK lift lifetime ban on gay men donating blood Nathan Schaefer with GMHC, an AIDS service organization, said Denney normally would be the type of donor blood banks are hungry for. Since the 1980s, when the AIDS epidemic decimated their community, gay men -- or MSMs (men who have sex with men) as they are called by federal agencies -- have not been allowed to donate blood. That number may seem small, but blood banks say it could help enormously, especially now, when blood supply shortages are common. Studies show those who give blood when they are young become regular lifetime donors, something most blood banks are struggling to find these days. A 2010 study by the Williams Institute at the University of California-Los Angeles estimated that if gay men who had not had sexual contact for the past 12 months were allowed to donate blood, more than 53,000 additional men would likely make more than 89,000 blood donations.
