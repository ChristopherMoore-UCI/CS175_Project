"When you think about it, this weekend has twofold meaning," says Kathie, who, along with Antonio, says the Valentine's Day timing is pure coincidence. "We started DivorceHotel because a lot of divorce procedures end up in fights that drag on for months and sometimes years," says company founder Jim Halfens, who is neither married nor divorced. "We're not trying to be flip about divorce," says Kathie. Though combining divorce and vacation might seem as American (and heart-friendly) as fried chicken and waffles, DivorceHotel is actually a Dutch company, founded in the Netherlands in 2011 on, if you can believe it, Valentine's Day. Antonio works in the construction business in New York City, Kathie is a medical professional.
