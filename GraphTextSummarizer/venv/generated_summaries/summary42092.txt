-- A woman suspected of snatching an infant from a New York hospital in 1987 has been indicted on federal kidnapping charges, according to court papers released Thursday. White's mother, Joy White, told the New York Post last month that she last saw her daughter when she was 19 days old. Pettway turned herself in last month at the FBI office in Bridgeport, Connecticut, FBI spokesman William Reiner said. She took her to a Harlem hospital on August 4, 1987, because the baby had a high fever, a New York police official said. Ann Pettway was charged with one count of kidnapping in the abduction of Carlina Renae White, now 23, who was reunited with her biological mother in January.
