After graduating from law school, Marchand was ready to do the same for Reynolds. Along with finding time to impart knowledge, Marchand tried to expose Reynolds to things she otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to. "I saw a need for her to have a Big Sister to show her a better life." Reynolds was matched with Nicole Marchand, a chief assistant district attorney in Atlanta, six years ago. Marchand also helped Reynolds turn her grades around. If she continues on this path, Reynolds will not only be the first in her family to go to college, but the first to graduate high school.
