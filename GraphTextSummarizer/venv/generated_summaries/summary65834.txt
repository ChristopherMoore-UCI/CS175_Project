Rodrigue, who is also chairman of the board of the city's convention center, said that Labor Day weekend isn't really a big deal in the big picture of New Orleans tourism. " In terms of numbers, 2012 could break a key record for New Orleans: there's "a distinct possibility" that visitor numbers will reach pre-Katrina numbers for the first time, Rodrigue said. But Joseph is optimistic about the future and has no doubt the tourists will keep coming, not only the usual visitors seeking New Orleans music and culture, but also the growing numbers of travelers who arrive via cruise ship, adding yet another set of faces to the NOLA tourism crowd. Business as usual is also the mantra at another New Orleans dining institution, Galatoire's on Bourbon Street. Have no doubt, as far as tourism is concerned, New Orleans is up and running and ready as ever to welcome visitors.
