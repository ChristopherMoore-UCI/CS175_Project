In 2011, after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya blamed on Al-Shabaab, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. Decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made Somalia a target for radical Islamist groups. It wants to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training.
