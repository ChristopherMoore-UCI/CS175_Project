Given the name Eugenie because of her mother's fascination with British royalty, destiny appeared to be on Bouchard's side when she made July's Wimbledon final -- she was the first player representing Canada to play in a grand slam singles final. The rapid success has surprised Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau, who achieved a career high of No. 90 in 1988.
