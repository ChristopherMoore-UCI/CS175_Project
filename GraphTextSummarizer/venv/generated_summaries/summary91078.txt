The company says statistics show that Jeep models such as the Cherokee are no worse or better in rear-end crashes than similar vehicles by other makers from that period. Chrysler Group, which owns Jeep, says that the model of the Grand Cherokee meets safety standards. "This tragedy was the result of a violent, high energy crash caused by a distracted tractor-trailer truck driver who rammed into the back of the 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee at highway speed," it says. The 1998 Jeep Cherokee crumpled like an accordion when a tractor-trailer hit it at more than 60 mph.
