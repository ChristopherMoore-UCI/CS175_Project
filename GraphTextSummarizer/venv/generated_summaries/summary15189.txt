Israeli Defense MInister Ehud Barak did not explicitly confirm or deny such an attack, but called the event "another proof that when we say something we mean it -- we say that we don't think that it should be allowable to bring advanced weapon systems into Lebanon. Last month, Israeli fighter jets struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, a senior U.S. official said. Ziv Medical Center treated soldiers and a Syrian pilot during the 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon, hospital officials said. Ziv Medical Center in Safed, Israel,  "cannot confirm" whether the seven Syrians being treated are from the Syrian opposition or the military, said Dr. Oscar Embon, the hospital's director. After treatment at the hospital, they will be returned to the Israeli military, which brought them in for help, and they will need rehabilitation, Embon said.
