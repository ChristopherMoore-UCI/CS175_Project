Cops: Body of missing girl, 19, found in woods Bihlmaier and two friends drove from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Portland last weekend to celebrate his graduation from Harvard. Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck confirmed Tuesday that a body pulled from Portland Harbor in the city's Old Port area is that of 31-year-old Nathan Bihlmaier. "It's a day that will now be forever tinged with sadness," Nitin Nohria, dean of Harvard Business School, told reporters after learning Bihlmaier's body had been found. The desperate search in Portland, Maine, for a Harvard Business School student missing since Sunday ended in heartbreak after his body was found just days before he was to graduate. He said there's no indication of foul play, but investigators are working to piece together Bihlmaier's final hours using security camera video from nearby businesses.
