Organizations such as the nonprofit LiNK (Liberty in North Korea) are on the frontlines of raising awareness about the desperate plight of North Korean defectors and helping escapees find refuge in countries where they can begin new lives. As we made our way back to China, North Korean soldiers chased us onto Chinese soil and violently dragged us back into North Korea. Recently a bill was introduced in Congress by Sam Brownback, R-Kansas in the Senate, and Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, and Diane Watson, D-California, in the House that seeks to address the issue of North Korean orphans and stateless children in China. In June, I stood before a North Korean judge and expressed my hope that the United States and North Korea might one day establish closer relations. This video shows North Korean defector, Ki-Won, and his journey to freedom with the help of LiNK.
