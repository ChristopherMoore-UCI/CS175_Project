-- A former University of Central Florida student found dead in his dorm room of an apparent suicide, alongside weapons and a backpack of bombs, planned a larger attack, officials said Monday. Seevakumaran developed an outline for the attack, but that never came to fruition, thanks in part to the rapid response of law enforcement, Beary said. Beary said police are still investigating to find out "what made him tick," but early indications were that Seevakumaran had very few friends and had anger issues. Beary told CNN that Seevakumaran pulled the fire alarm, perhaps to draw many people out into the open. When police entered the dorm room, they found Seevakumaran dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, a handgun, an assault weapon, a couple hundred rounds of ammunition and four homemade bombs in a backpack.
