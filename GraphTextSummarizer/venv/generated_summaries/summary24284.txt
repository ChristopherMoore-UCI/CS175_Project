Paris police had no information about the man's motive, and prosecutors issued a plea for witnesses who may have seen a man "making death threats while carrying a gun," according to a statement. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins earlier said he was in intensive care. Another man told police he was carjacked in the neighborhood of La Defense. Liberation Publisher Nicolas Demorand told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Monday that the victim was "a little better" Tuesday but still in critical condition. -- French police have released a second photo of the man suspected of shooting a photographer at the daily newspaper Liberation Monday, as their manhunt continues.
