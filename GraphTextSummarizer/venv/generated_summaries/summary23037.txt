Embrace same-sex marriage Catholic people are relatively welcoming to the idea of same-sex marriage or civil unions -- especially in the United States. Either it must take steps to accept gay and lesbian people as part of its flock -- including them as full members, embracing their unions, decrying Catholic schools that fire gay and lesbian teachers and calling for the full protection of LGBT people around the world. The church, meanwhile, in its report on Monday, continues to assert that "unions between people of the same sex cannot be considered on the same footing as matrimony between man and woman." My sense is that the church wants to be seen as tolerating gay people -- and therefore not out of touch with the modern world -- without actually embracing them. Catholicism isn't truly welcoming to gay people until it updates that policy.
