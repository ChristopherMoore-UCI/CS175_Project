On the violent streets of south Los Angeles, Carter had urged a better life for youths and young men, Carraway said. Police in Los Angeles say a man matching Knight's description drove over Carter and another man with his red pickup truck in Compton, a city adjacent to south Los Angeles that's renowned in rap music. His death "will bring a lot of people together, you know, from all different walks of life, Bloods, Crips, ex-gang members, current gang members, whatever, people on the streets, foster kids, whatever the case may be," Carraway said. Terry Carter, 55, wasn't a product of the thug life, but he did found and own the defunct Heavyweight Records, said friend Darcell Carraway, 38. "To my knowledge, there was no altercations ever whatsoever between him and Suge Knight," Carraway said.
