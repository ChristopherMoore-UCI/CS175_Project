The global hub for peace and security opened its doors to ambassadors and fashionistas alike Monday night when Ambassador Riyad Mansour, head of the Palestinian permanent observer mission to the U.N., hosted Palestinian-Italian fashion designer Jamal Taslaq. Despite the current tension in the Middle East, which has spanned multiple weeks, both Mansour and Taslaq said they believe that fashion and design can play a role in promoting peace. The fabrics themselves donned elements of peace and conflict: garments featured wood from olive branches brought from Palestine to Taslaq's studio in Italy as well as embroideries -- a classic Palestinian design heritage -- made by Palestinian refugees. "This is a racist remark, as if we, the Palestinians, cannot be a part of humanity to share the rest of humanity and the rest of the international community our creativity in the field of fashion," Mansour said. "Music has a role, fashion has a role, cinema has a role, intellectuals have a role, parliamentarians, politicians, diplomats -- all of it," Mansour said.
