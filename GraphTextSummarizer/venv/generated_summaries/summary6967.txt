The McMillins recently attended a nearby Big Green Egg demonstration and cookout. The couple is headed to Atlanta in October for the annual EGGtoberfest, an annual event where more than 1,000 Eggheads converge to share recipes, meet fellow fanatics and purchase additional Eggs. Frey received a Big Green Egg -- a ceramic cooker that serves as a smoker, grill and oven -- for Christmas last year. Tell us about your grill of choice Frey began grilling more than 20 years ago but got his first Egg in 2008. McMillin bought his first Egg, which he calls Lily, in 1999.
