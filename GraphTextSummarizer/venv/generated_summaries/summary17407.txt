The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, a group of Gulf Arab states, has come up with a plan to ease Saleh out of office, a move that would placate widespread anti-government sentiment in the impoverished Arab nation. -- Yemen's embattled president has been huddling with members of his ruling party in neighboring Saudi Arabia as world and regional powers press for an end to the political crisis in his country and a smooth transition of political power. Ali Abdullah Saleh met on Wednesday with officials and leaders of his ruling General People's Congress party, the state-run news agency SABA and a high-level party official said This comes amid "Immense pressure from the international community" to accept an agreement for a transition of power, the official told CNN. "He underlined the significance of keeping on the positive dealing with the Gulf initiative and to look for the appropriate mechanism to be carried out and to ensure peaceful and smooth transfer of power in accordance with the constitution," SABA said. The official said Salehwants to make sure he consults senior party officials before he would sign a power transfer deal.
