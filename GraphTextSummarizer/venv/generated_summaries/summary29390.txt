"Those who ordered the killing of Armando were wrong because those who are left are more seasoned and we are working," said Luz del Carmen Sosa, a reporter for El Diario de Juarez newspaper who took over Rodriguez's crime beat after his death. Of the five publications in Juarez, El Diario de Juarez is the most popular paper in terms of circulation and has made a reputation for aggressively covering drug violence. His colleagues believe he was targeted because of his coverage of drug cartels in the border town of Ciudad Juarez. In the wake of Rodriguez's death, del Carmen Sosa said she has no fear and was ready to take full responsibility for her work, even if it means death. "Unlike Armando Luis Carlos (Rodriquez), I'm alive," del Carmen Sosa said.
