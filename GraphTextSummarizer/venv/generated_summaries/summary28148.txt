National Zoo says goodbye to Tai Shan The flight from Washington to China will be about 15 hours, said Dave Bronczek, president and CEO of FedEx. Three-year-old Mei Lan left Zoo Atlanta in Georgia early Thursday morning and was flown to Washington aboard a FedEx 777 christened the "Panda Express." Tai Shan is headed to a different facility in China's Sichuan province. In Washington, the plane picked up Mei Lan's 4-year-old cousin, Tai Shan, who left Washington's National Zoo. -- Two beloved giant pandas left the United States for their new homes in China on Thursday.
