Heart-tugging photos of the forlorn dog attracted thousands of shares and sympathetic comments on social media, with many people condemning his former owner. Authorities in Scotland are looking for whomever abandoned a mixed-breed dog outside a railway station, along with a suitcase containing his food and other belongings. Some people noted that Kai's plight echoes that of Paddington, the fictional bear in a series of popular kids' books, who was adopted by a family after they found him sitting on his suitcase at Paddington Railway Station in London. The Scottish SPCA is appealing for information on Facebook after the male shar-pei crossbreed was discovered Friday night, tied to a railing outside the Ayr train station. Beside him was a suitcase with some of the dog's belongings, including a pillow, toy, a bowl and food.
