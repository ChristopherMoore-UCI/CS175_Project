-- Striker Carlos Tevez has been suspended by Manchester City after the furore surrounding his non-appearance from the substitutes' bench during the 2-0 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich on Tuesday. A statement on City's official website read: "Manchester City can confirm that striker Carlos Tevez has been suspended until further notice for a maximum period of two weeks. As a result, Tevez has struggled to break into City's starting line-up so far this season and has seen defender Vincent Kompany replace him as club captain. "I would like to apologise to all Manchester City fans, with whom I have always had a strong relationship, for any misunderstanding that occurred in Munich," read the statement from Tevez. Tuesday's controversy is the latest development in a saga which has seen Tevez move close to an exit from the Etihad Stadium on several occasions.
