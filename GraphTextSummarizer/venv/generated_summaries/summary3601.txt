Barring a major upset, the task of banishing the storm clouds and restoring normality after the tumultuous events of the last seven months will fall to Petro Poroshenko, the veteran insider who won national approval by becoming the only oligarch to support the Maidan protest movement that overthrew Viktor Yanukovych earlier this year. It may take a painful split within the democratic bloc followed by a major realignment and new parliamentary elections in the autumn before Poroshenko gets the government he wants. But they are likely to cover things like Russian access to Ukraine's military-industrial facilities, new gas transit arrangements, the status of Crimea and perhaps an agreement that Ukraine will remain non-aligned. To avert popular disillusionment Poroshenko needs to change the relationship between private wealth and public power. Whether he can go far enough to satisfy the Maidan movement, while securing the cooperation of Ukraine's power elite in meeting the other difficult challenges he has to face is the question that will probably define his presidency.
