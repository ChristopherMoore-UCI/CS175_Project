-- There are happy songs -- and then there is "Happy." Williams has partnered with the United Nations Foundation in celebration of Thursday's International Day of Happiness, encouraging fans to donate to the organization and submit content to his 24Hoursof Happiness.com site. Is it the insistent nature of such lyrics as "Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth"? There is even a YouTube version of "Happy" that has gone completely to the dogs. Not a bad trick for a tune that slowly grew from a single on last summer's "Despicable Me 2" soundtrack to such popularity that Robert Morast, a writer for the Virginian-Pilot, recently entered into a debate of whether it should be considered for the official state song of Virginia.
