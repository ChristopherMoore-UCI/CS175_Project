"Lesotho provide(s) ideal, pristine environmental conditions for the farming of large trout," explains Fred Formanek, managing partner of Advance Africa Management Services, who has developed the Highlands Trout project since 2009. The flashing neon advertising signs and crowded crosswalks of Tokyo may not resemble the slow suburban settlement of Maseru -- the capital of the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho in southern Africa. "We employ just over 100 [local people] on a permanent basis," explains managing director of Highlands Trout Grant Merrick. The remainder is sold to South Africa  (10%) and Lesotho (5%). While Highlands Trout may not swamp the supermarkets anytime soon, their use of Lesotho's natural resources and remote mountain landscape could help the operation see some success.
