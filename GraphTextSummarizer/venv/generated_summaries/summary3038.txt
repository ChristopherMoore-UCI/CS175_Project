-- A Philadelphia judge sentenced a faith healing couple to up to seven years in state prison Wednesday for failing to seek medical care for their 7-month-old son, who died last year. Catherine and Herbert Schaible turned to prayer rather than medicine to treat their son Brandon, who died in April from bacterial pneumonia, dehydration and strep, according to the district attorney's office. The Schaibles were already on probation for the 2009 death of another son, Kent, who also died from untreated bacterial pneumonia. CNN's Sarah Hoye contributed to this report. The couple were sentenced to 3Â½ to seven years at the Criminal Justice Center in Center City.
