A 2009 salmonella outbreak that prompted a massive recall of peanut goods led to nine deaths and more than 700 illnesses in more than 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. -- Four former officials of the now-closed Peanut Corporation of America were indicted Thursday on charges related to salmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut products, the Justice Department said. A plant in Blakely, Georgia, roasted and processed raw peanuts. Three of the four were also charged with obstruction of justice, Justice Department officials said. The 76-count indictment, unsealed in Georgia, alleged mail and wire fraud, the introduction of adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead, and conspiracy.
