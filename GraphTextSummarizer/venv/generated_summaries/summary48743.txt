Syria's numbers: How they compare with past wars The tally, which CNN cannot independently verify, does not include people who are held in detention centers or who have been kidnapped by rebels.

"It has become a struggle now to move food from one area to the other with our warehouses and trucks getting increasingly caught in the crossfire," said program spokesman Muhannad Hadi. Thousand died, 2 million were uprooted from their homes and more than 4 million are in dire need of humanitarian aid, from food to medical care, according to the United Nations. The group said 6,005 people were killed in Syria last month.
