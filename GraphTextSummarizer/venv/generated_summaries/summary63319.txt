Ben Ali's trial will start on Monday, interim Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi told Al Jazeera television. Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year after a revolt led to his ouster and triggered a wave of protests against longtime rulers across North Africa and the Middle East. -- Former Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali will be tried in absentia next week, the country's interim prime minister said Tuesday. Earlier this month, Ben Ali said he has been unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. Protests against Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- began to erupt late last year.
