-- Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says relations with China are "extremely important," but Beijing's demand for an apology and compensation over the detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain is "completely groundless and is utterly unacceptable for Japan." The statement Saturday went on to assert Japanese jurisdiction over the islands where the captain was detained and declared that the dispute was handled in accordance with Japanese law. Zhan was accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed their duties, China's Xinhua news agency said. Despite this call for an apology, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the two sides should resolve the problems through dialogue and consultation, according to Chinese state media. Earlier, Satoru Sato, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, made similar statements to Japan's Kyodo news agency in response to China's apology demand. Word of the captain's release quickly followed the arrest of four Japanese nationals in China.
