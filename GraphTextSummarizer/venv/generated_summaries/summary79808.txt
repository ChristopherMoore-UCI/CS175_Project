"Research shows higher drug use among individuals receiving government assistance, and drug abuse also forces children into welfare assistance," Scott said while signing the bill into law. He added it was "unfair for Florida taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction." Florida is not the first state to pass such legislation. Attorneys for the state say pre-employment drug testing is commonplace and that the Navy vet himself could have been subjected to random drug testing while in the military. "It shows that a little bit more than 2% of the welfare applicants tested positive for drugs where it's about 8Â½% in the general public," said Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida. The Navy veteran, an undergraduate at the University of Central Florida, contends the law violates his rights and adds he has never used illegal drugs.
