-- Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre will meet this week with an NFL official as part of the league's investigation into allegations that he sent sexually explicit messages to women, an NFL spokesman said Monday. Deadspin first reported in August that Favre sent text messages, left voice mails and sent pictures of himself naked from the waist down to Jenn Sterger, who worked as a sideline personality and host for the Jets at the time. Jesse Derris, a spokesman for the Jets, told HLN's "Prime News" that the team has no role in the allegations against Favre, who played one season in New York and now plays for the Minnesota Vikings. A.J. Daulerio, Deadspin's editor-in-chief and author of the Favre stories, told CNN last week that no one from the NFL has contacted him about an investigation into Favre. Afterward, Deadspin reported that a second woman had come forward to allege that she had received other lewd messages from the quarterback and that a third woman, whom the site did not identify, had received similar messages.
