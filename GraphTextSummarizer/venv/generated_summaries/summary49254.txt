," said Dr. Gavin Hayes, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. The Los Angeles-area quakes occurred within the Puente Hills thrust zone, which while not as large or as well-known as California's infamous San Andreas fault, is potentially as destructive because of its precarious location under downtown Los Angeles, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. -- The powerful 8.2-magnitude earthquake that struck northern Chile on Tuesday night came after a series of quakes had shaken the Los Angeles area in recent weeks. Your state and Chile lie on different faults that "are too far apart" for the earthquakes to be linked, according to Hayes. As for why the quakes all occurred around the same time period: "It's just a natural cycle of seismicity," Hayes said.
