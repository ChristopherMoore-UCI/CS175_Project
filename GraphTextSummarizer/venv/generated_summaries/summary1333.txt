Their latest, "I Live Real Close to Where You Used to Live," is a collection of student letters to First Lady Michelle Obama. Writing is the primary focus at 826 centers, which also work with middle school and high school students. "I think the kids are tricked in and then, as they are talking to the person at the front desk, they are learning about what's going on in the tutoring center," said Gerald Richards, the chief executive of 826 National, the nonprofit network of tutoring centers that look nothing like classrooms. The book is a companion to one that came out last year that contains letters to President Barack Obama, "Thanks and Have Fun Running the Country." Each of the eight centers has an imaginative storefront that helps raise money and encourage creativity among students.
