" Williams, the 62-year-old son of the legendary country singer Hank Williams and a widely popular entertainer himself, compared President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler, a remark that prompted controversy and resulted in "Monday Night Football" pulling his popular musical introduction from this week's game. In an appearance on Fox News' "Fox and Friends" on Monday morning, Williams referred to a June golf game in which Obama and House Speaker John Boehner were on the same team, against Vice President Joe Biden and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, as "one of the biggest political mistakes ever." -- ESPN says it has severed its relationship with singer Hank Williams Jr. The "McCain-Palin Tradition" song, which is a riff on the Williams tune "Family Tradition," included a line suggesting that Obama has "terrorist friends.". The Anti-Defamation League condemned Williams' comments on Tuesday and praised ESPN for pulling his "Are You Ready for Some Football?" musical recording that has opened "Monday Night Football" for years.
