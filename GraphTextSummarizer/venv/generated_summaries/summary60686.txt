Italy must now worry about themselves after a 1-0 loss to outsider Costa Rica left the Azzurri in danger of being eliminated from the group stage for the second consecutive World Cup. A toothless Italy appeared to wilt in the second half and barely threatened the Costa Rica goal, unable to break the offside trap, with Randall Brenes almost doubling Costa Rica's advantage in injury time. "We're delighted with the win ... but we don't want to stop there," Costa Rica manager Jorge Luis Pinto told reporters. "It was a defeat where Costa Rica were much more aggressive and played with passion," Italy manager Cesare Prandelli told RAI Sport in quotes carried by the Football Italia website. England had to hope -- at the least -- that Italy would beat both Costa Rica and Uruguay to have any chance of going through from Group D. After Costa Rica had a penalty appeal waved away when Joel Campbell appeared to be fouled by Italian hard-man Giorgio Chiellini, Costa Rica netted the lone goal when Ruiz converted a close-range header in the 44th minute past the fit again Gianluigi Buffon.
