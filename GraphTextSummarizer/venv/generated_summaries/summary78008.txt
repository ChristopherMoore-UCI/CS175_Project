" The crew of a Coast Guard patrol aircraft spotted the panga-style boat near Santa Cruz Island, suspecting "it was engaged in illegal activity," said Jenkins, who did not elaborate on the type of activity. "Chief Petty Officer Horne was an outstanding Coast Guard member," Jenkins said. "The Coast Guard, along with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state and local level, are actively working to make sure all of the individuals who are involved with this illegal activity are brought to justice," Jenkins said. The other Coast Guardsman tossed overboard was treated and released later Sunday morning from a hospital after suffering "relatively minor injuries," Jenkins said. The panga boat fled the scene but was later interdicted by a different Coast Guard boat and helicopter, he added.
