Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, "She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly." When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see. The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale. Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked. In a statement obtained by KDVR, Michelle Wilkins' family says, "We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out.
