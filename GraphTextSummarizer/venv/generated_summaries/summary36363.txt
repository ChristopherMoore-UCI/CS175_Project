The Georgia Department of Community Health and the hospital have identified 680 patients who were exposed to tuberculosis between November and February, said hospital spokesman Lance Skelly. Patients will begin getting tested for tuberculosis next week, Skelly said. -- Nearly 700 patients and 100 employees at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta have been exposed to tuberculosis after coming in contact with a hospital employee carrying the disease, a hospital spokesman said Thursday. To date, no patients or employees have reported symptoms of tuberculosis, he said. The employee did not know he had tuberculosis when he came in contact with employees and patients, the hospital said.
