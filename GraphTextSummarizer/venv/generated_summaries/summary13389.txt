Counselors have been made available today to children and teachers at Kyron's school, Shelby said. According to investigators, the boy's stepmother said she last saw Kyron on Friday morning while he was walking down the hallway toward his classroom. Searches in the school area were conducted Friday and over the weekend by several agencies, including the Portland Police Bureau, Gresham Police Department, Fairview Police Department, Oregon State Patrol, and the FBI. Kyron Horman, 7, did not return home Friday from Skyline Elementary School, police said. "There was a science fair here at the school," Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby told CNN.
