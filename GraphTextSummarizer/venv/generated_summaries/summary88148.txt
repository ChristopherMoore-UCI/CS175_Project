Microsoft, at least so far, appears to have only Windows, in its various flavors. Windows 95, which was separate from the company's business-oriented Windows NT product, added a number of features over its predecessors including better network support, the ability to send faxes (yes, there was a time when that was a big deal) along with basic audio recording, audio playback, and video playback tools. While the company has expanded far beyond its Windows roots, Windows and Office remain the engine driving the vast majority of the company's profits even as it looks to cell phones, search, and online services to augment its mainstay businesses. Second, it could evolve Windows and Windows Live to offer a dramatically better way of doing the same tasks that most people do on the Web. At the moment, the Windows business is doing quite well, with Windows 7 selling at an impressive clip.
