Despite starting with a bogey at the first, McIlroy recovered to sink seven birdies and comfortably leads the way from America's Dustin Johnson who lies four shots back in second place at 8-under-par. The Northern Irishman stretched his overnight lead at the British Open at Hoylake Friday with a majestic second round of 66 -- matching his score Thursday -- to finish the day on 12-under-par. It was almost a disastrous day for Tiger Woods, however, as the three-time Open champion carded a round of 77 to end the day at 2-over-par and only just make the cut. A chasing group featuring Francesco Molinari, Ryan Moore, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia and Louis Oosthuizen are all tied for third at 6-under-par. In truth, Woods exhibited the kind of frustrating yo-yo form between first and second rounds that has inhibited McIlroy over the past months.
