In a statement to CNN, Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kansas, insisted the provision included in the spending bill would not lead to a collapse on Wall Street, followed by a bailout from taxpayers. In his statement, Yoder touted his provision as needed protection for smaller financial institutions, rather than a boon to Wall Street. Ultimately, farmers, manufacturers and other Main Street businesses would be harmed the most," Yoder added. "Other backstops exist in Dodd-Frank to prevent a bailout based on those instruments." As the spending bill, dubbed the CRomnibus by Capitol Hill insiders, was debated in Congress last week, Warren blasted the banking provision as a "loophole" that would allow Wall Street to gamble with taxpayer money. "The White House, regardless of who wrote the provision, strongly opposes it and doesn't think it's a good idea, because it does water down one element of Wall Street reform," Earnest told reporters Tuesday.
