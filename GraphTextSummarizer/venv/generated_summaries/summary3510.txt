-- Oil companies Shell and BP began evacuating nonessential personnel from their drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday as officials kept a wary eye on a tropical storm churning toward Mexico that could wreak havoc on oil spill cleanup efforts. Gulf Coast residents feared that high winds and storm surges could spread the slick and push more oil ashore into bays, estuaries and pristine beaches, exacerbating the oil disaster triggered by BP's ruptured well. As much as 2.5 million gallons of oil could flow into the Gulf for two weeks if Tropical Storm Alex forces a work stoppage at the ruptured BP well, the government's disaster response manager said. CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the "preferred scenario" actually would be for Alex to head to northern Florida. While protesters lined the sand, Alex moved toward Mexico, no one knowing whether it would make a sudden turn north into the open Gulf.
