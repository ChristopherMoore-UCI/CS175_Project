Five workers have died on World Cup stadium construction sites, the latest the death of Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, who fell from the roof of a stadium in the Amazonian city of Manaus in December. A total of 12 venues scattered throughout Brazil are due to host World Cup games this summer but many of them have been beset with problems. World Cup holder Spain is due to play the first match at the stadium against Australia on June 26. Many of the stadiums are behind with their construction deadlines and there have been concerns that Brazil's transport network could create major logistical problems. The 2014 tournament is due to open on June 12 with Brazil taking on Croatia in Sao Paulo's Arena Corinthians -- a stadium which has had its own renovation issues.
