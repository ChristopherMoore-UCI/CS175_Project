Starr: A lot of young people love "Peace and Love." He produced it himself and recorded it in Los Angeles with a number of his buddies, including producers Don Was and Dave Stewart and Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh, who also happens to be his brother-in-law. Starr remains touched that Macca showed up at his 70th birthday party at Radio City Music Hall. Looking at least a decade younger than his 71 years, Starr settles into the corner of a couch and talks about celebrity then vs. celebrity now -- this from the perspective of a man who has been famous for nearly 50 years. We did the David Lynch show a couple of years ago, so we have done that.
