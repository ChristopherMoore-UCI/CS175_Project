The 40-year-old Caceres, who played for Argentina in the 1994 World Cup, was gunned down as a gang tried to steal his BMW car in the early hours of Sunday morning. The attack happened in the Fort Apache area of Buenos Aires, which is where Manchester City star Carlos Tevez grew up, and is notorious for high crime levels. Caceres won the league title with River Plate in 1991 and the European Cup Winners Cup with Spanish side Real Zaragoza in 1995. Players from two of his former clubs, Argentinos Juniors and Independiente displayed a banner of support for him ahead of their later match in the Argentine league on Sunday. Caceres was visited by his former Boca Juniors teammate and national coach Diego Maradona, who clearly distressed, told reporters outside the hospital that crime was rife in the Argentine capital.
