The real verdict on health reform will likely come in 2014 when an expected 32 million people will be added to insurance exchanges, state Medicaid programs and other private insurance plans. Health reform starts at birth -- health plans will no longer be able to refuse to cover children younger than 19 simply because they were born with a medical condition. But health care reform will not be repealed, and despite messy politics and angry voices, policymakers, providers, insurance companies and other stakeholders are moving quickly to implement the bill. Less than half understood that health reform would allow for them to receive preventive care services without having to pay anything. But more importantly, a repeal of health care reform, followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes, is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall, with no net to catch them.
