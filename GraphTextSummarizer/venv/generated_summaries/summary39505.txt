The dictionary's entry for tweet now includes the verb -- "to make a posting on the social networking service Twitter" -- and the noun -- "a posting made on the social networking service Twitter." The concise dictionary, a different product that seeks to be "progressive and up to date," already included the word "retweet" -- meaning to repost or forward a message posted by another user on Twitter -- in its 12th edition in 2011. Although the move may seem behind the curve given the widespread use of "tweet" to refer to activity on Twitter, the dictionary's chief editor says he's actually broken one of its rules by including it so soon. It has nonetheless ingested several new tech-related words in this month's update, along with "tweet." By recognizing that people can tweet, too, the main Oxford English Dictionary is playing catch up with its smaller, snappier cousin, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary.
