"The two asteroids must each have been over 10 kilometers across -- it would have been curtains for many life species on the planet at the time," said lead researcher Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University. "There are two huge deep domes in the crust, formed by the Earth's crust rebounding after the huge impacts, and bringing up rock from the mantle below," Glikson said. A big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks. The devastating event took place on our planet many millions of years ago, but researchers are only now beginning to discover what happened. "Large impacts like these may have had a far more significant role in the Earth's evolution than previously thought," Glikson said.
