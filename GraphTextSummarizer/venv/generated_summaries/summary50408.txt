Rather than being piloted by Bruce Wayne's vigilante alter ego, the first two drivers of the DeltaWing will be Britain's Marino Franchitti, the younger brother of IndyCar legend Dario Franchitti, and Michael Krumm of Germany. Nissan's experimental DeltaWing, which bears a startling resemblance to the vehicle made famous by the "Caped Crusader," was unveiled by the Japanese manufacturer in London on Tuesday. "As motor racing rulebooks have become tighter over time, racing cars look more and more similar and the technology used has had less and less relevance to road car development. Despite being granted entry to the marquee French race, the DeltaWing will not be counted in the final Le Mans 24 Hour classification as it is participating as an experimental vehicle. No, it's a Batmobile-like race car which will take to the track at the legendary Le Mans 24 Hour event in June.
