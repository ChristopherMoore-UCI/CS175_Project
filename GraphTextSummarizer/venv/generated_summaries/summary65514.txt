Boehi told CNN he expected joining the EU would increase demand for products and open new markets. Serbia, which begins EU membership negotiations next year, is struggling with sluggish growth, high inflation, unemployment at 25%, and excessive public debt. "New opportunities might open up, mostly with surrounding markets like Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Croatia," he said. "We are not sleeping, we are not waiting until these things [entering the EU] come about," its COO, Daniel Boehi told CNN. While Serbia aspires to EU membership, such a move will also provide challenges.
