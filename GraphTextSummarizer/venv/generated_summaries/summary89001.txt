The report by the Government Accountability Office -- which notes a 53 percent increase in controller errors within five miles of airports and a 166 percent jump in errors handling approaching flights up to 40 miles out -- comes at a time of remarkable commercial aviation safety in the United States. That may have reduced the number of errors directly reported to FAA supervisors, the GAO said. The GAO also said 65% of the errors reported through the non-punitive system, some of which may have involved violations of the standards separating aircraft in flight, were not fed into a separate FAA reporting system for operational errors. " Bill Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, said he supports the FAA's non-punitive reporting system, saying it is bringing to light errors that would have gone unreported under the old system. That may have led to more errors, according to the GAO, which also said some FAA officials told them the rule also limits the ability of managers to take action against employees who make a mistake.
