Affected passengers may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. "The ill person did not exhibit symptoms of Ebola during the flights from West Africa and CDC does not recommend that people on the same commercial airline flights undergo monitoring, as Ebola is contagious only if the person is experiencing active symptoms," advised the CDC, in a statement. Most people who have become infected with Ebola lived with or cared for an ill patient, said Stephen Monroe, deputy director of CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases. Ebola symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat; followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and at advanced stage, both internal and external bleeding, according to the World Health Organization. Duncan flew on United Airlines for two legs of his journey, and passengers on those flights are not in danger, said a United spokesperson, noting the CDC advice on symptoms.
