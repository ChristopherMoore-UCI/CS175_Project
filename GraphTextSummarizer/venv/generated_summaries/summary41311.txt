"Ahtisaari is an outstanding international mediator," said Ole Danbolt Mjoes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The peace prize is one of five Nobel prizes awarded annually. Ahtisaari and his group, Crisis Management Initiative, also contributed to resolving other conflicts in Northern Ireland, Central Asia, and the Horn of Africa, the committee said. The committee awards the peace prize annually according to guidelines laid down in the will of its founder, Alfred Nobel. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore shared last year's prize with the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change.
