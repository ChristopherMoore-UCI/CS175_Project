-- Italian champions Inter Milan have unveiled new signing Samuel Eto'o, with the Cameroon striker immediately being forced to deny suggestions from the Italian media that he has ever had a problem with new coach Jose Mourinho. Eto'o, who completed his switch from Barcelona on Monda, denied he has issues with Portuguese coach Mourinho and insists he never insulted his team's style of play after a Champions League match between Barca and Chelsea.

Mourinho also laughed off suggestions the pair do not see eye to eye, insisting they have very similar personalities. I am very happy to have him with us and I'm not talking only as Jose Mourinho but on behalf of the whole squad.
