-- Former U.S. Rep. Gary Condit's semen was found on underwear belonging to Chandra Levy, according to an FBI biologist testifying Wednesday in the trial of Ingmar Guandique, who is accused of murdering the Washington intern in 2001. Regarding lab tests of the underwear recovered from Levy's apartment, Giusti said that "the sperm DNA profile was compared to and matched to Gary Condit." Condit, who testified in the trial on November 1, has refused to address the question of whether he had sex with Levy. The disappearance of Levy, then an intern for the federal Bureau of Prisons, drew national attention after her parents discovered a connection with Condit. Prosecutors believe Guandique, a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha, attacked Levy while she was jogging and then killed her when she began to scream. The testimony addresses the question of whether Condit, a sitting congressman from California at the time Levy vanished, was having an affair with the intern, who had just turned 24 when she disappeared.
