The FBI believes the suspect is responsible for robbing 10 banks in San Diego County and one in Riverside County. "In these types of crimes, the potential for violence is significant," April Langwell, spokeswoman for the San Diego office of the FBI, said in May. He is approximately 6 feet, 190 pounds, of average build and has been known to wear prescription eyeglasses and various hats and caps, including a blue baseball cap with a script style "P" on the front. "During (the) robbery, the robber approached the victim teller and presented a demand note for cash," a statement from the FBI said. -- A Southern California bank robber dubbed the "geezer bandit" has struck again, possibly knocking off his 11th bank, the FBI said.
