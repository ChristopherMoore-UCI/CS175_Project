Last November, the Tiangong-1successfully completed China's first space docking mission with an unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou-8, according to Xinhua. In March, Niu Hongguang, deputy commander-in-chief of China's manned space program, spoke about the possibility of including female astronauts and was quoted in Xinhua as saying the final selection will be decided "on the very last condition." China's efforts come as the United States refocuses its space program toward deep space exploration, and private companies like SpaceX make strides toward the commercialization of spaceflight. The Chinese news agency reported that female astronauts may be among the three-person crew to dock on the Tiangong-1 space lab module, which was launched into space in September. The spacecraft, called the Shenzhou-9 and its carrier rocket, the Long March-2F, were moved to a launch platform in northwest China's Gansu province Saturday to allow scientists to conduct tests before the launch, according to Xinhua.
