The ball, thrown by Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Mike Fiers, hit Stanton during an at-bat in the fifth inning of Thursday night's game in Milwaukee. The team later said on Twitter he'd suffered facial cuts, broken bones and tooth damage. "I mean, for his season to end like that, that's not good." Fiers, who hit another player after Stanton -- sparking a bench-clearing altercation -- was apologetic on Twitter: Stanton, who has a .288 batting average, leads the National League with 37 home runs and 105 RBIs. Marlins manager Mike Redmond said Stanton would be out for the rest of the year. The impact shattered bones and caused tooth damage, according to the team.
