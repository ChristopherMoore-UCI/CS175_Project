On Monday, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, called for the U.S. Department of State to restrict Gadhafi's travel to the area around U.N. headquarters in New York City, saying in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton he "was particularly concerned by news reports indicating that [Gadhafi] plans to stay in New Jersey, where the families of many Pan Am 103 victims reside. In just a few short weeks, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach could wake up at his home in Englewood, New Jersey, with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi camped a few feet from his front lawn. Gadhafi may be staying in a tent on the front lawn of a New Jersey house owned by the Libyan Mission. " Wildes said the Libyan Mission has "not paid a nickel" on taxes for the property, and said he would only be "willing to sit down with him if he brings a check to cover years of back taxes and overtime pay for the additional police forces needed for his stay, and apologizes to the Jewish residents and the Lockerbie victims' families of New Jersey." Boteach, in a piece posted Thursday on The Huffington Post, where he is a regular contributor, said the residence had been left "derelict and neglected" for many years until the recent construction. Media reports have said that his request to pitch his tent in Central Park had been denied, and the New Jersey property was a likely second choice.
