An American Airlines charter plane carrying the Miami Dolphins home from a losing 30-13 game against the Dallas Cowboys clipped the tail of a parked plane at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport early Thursday morning, forcing both planes out of service and prolonging the team's return. The winglet of the Dolphins charter plane -- a Boeing 767 -- clipped the tail of an empty MD-80 aircraft, causing minor damage to the 767's winglet.
