It was the highest-level statement so far by the U.S. government on the accelerating strife in Libya, where reports Monday indicated a deteriorating situation with some military forces and pro-government allies attacking anti-government demonstrators. Two Republican senators called Monday for President Barack Obama to publicly denounce what they called "egregious violations of human rights" by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. The State Department, meanwhile, ordered all U.S. Embassy family members and non-emergency personnel to depart Libya. U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya's rapidly unfolding political crisis, in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform, a senior Obama administration official said. Skeptics, including several U.S. senators, contend that al-Megrahi was released as part of a deal fueled by British business interests in Libya, including oil giant BP.
