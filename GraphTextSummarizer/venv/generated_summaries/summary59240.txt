-- President Barack Obama left for Camp David on Marine One Friday but, in a twist that has left some White House reporters scratching their heads, he apparently arrived at the presidential retreat by car. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney explained the decision not to land at Camp David was made in advance because of the weather. Also Friday, a fighter under the direction of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) intercepted an aircraft in the vicinity of Camp David. They usually go all the way to Camp David," said Kristy Rossignuolo, a customer service representative at the Frederick Municipal Airport. Meanwhile, CNN's weather team found no signs of stormy weather in the area at the time Marine One departed the White House.
