-- Authorities on Friday denied published reports that Marisol Valles Garcia -- the 20-year-old criminology student who made headlines when she became the police chief in the town of Praxedis G. Guerrero, Mexico -- had left the country for the United States and was seeking asylum. Andres Morales, town secretary in Praxedis, also said reports that Valles Garcia has fled were false. Valles Garcia grabbed international attention last year when she took over the top job in a police force whose officers have been abducted and killed. Meanwhile, the news service Agence France-Presse also reported that Valles Garcia had fled to the United States and was seeking asylum. Last year, Valles Garcia was the only person who accepted the top police job.
