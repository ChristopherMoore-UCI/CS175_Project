North Korea is closing its borders to international tourists because of concerns about Ebola, tour agencies specializing in the country were told. Beijing-based Koryo Tours and Young Pioneers Tours issued statements Thursday saying they received news "from our partners in Pyongyang" that international tourists will not be allowed to enter North Korea, starting Friday. In recent years, North Korea has become an increasingly popular destination for international tourists, including Americans, despite a U.S. State Department warning not to travel there because of the recent detentions of its citizens. But fears about Ebola's spread have mounted since the infections of health care workers in the United States and Spain. KCNA, the country's state-run news agency, said North Korea is taking "preventive measures" Friday to "control the infection by Ebola."
