A few kilometers outside Shirahama on the way to the city of Tanabe sits Nakata, one of Wakayama's biggest ume (Japanese apricot) fruit processing and brewing factories, which is open for tours. Just outside of Shirahama lies the massive Tore Tore Ichiba Market. Things are no different at historic Sakinoyu Onsen, a gorgeous hot spring facility right on the coast of Shirahama in Japan's Wakayama prefecture.
