Opponents of marriage equality have claimed that letting gays and lesbians marry would devalue marriage, subvert its purposes, lead to the collapse of families. It's akin to the way that immigrants have revitalized dying rural towns and neglected urban neighborhoods, injecting new blood, new money, and new energy into dilapidated structures. The analogy seemed direct, and the need for straight allies of color to stand up for marriage equality seemed urgent. Since the passage of marriage equality she's been the go-to judge for same-sex weddings. And when our big wedding ceremony a week later concluded with vows that all our people made to us, the larger implications of marriage equality became vividly clear.
