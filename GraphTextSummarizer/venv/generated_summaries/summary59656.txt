According to the BBC, Severn Trent Water said around 75% of sewer blockages stem from foreign objects (see: Winnie the Pooh, hundreds of tennis balls) introduced into the system. "We expect sewers to get blocked with fats or baby wipes," said sewerage network manager Scott Burgin to the BBC. "The wastewater drain which runs from your house to the public sewer is usually only about four inches wide, which is less than the diameter of a DVD," Chris Wallace, director of communications at Scottish Water, told The Independent. Pooh's subterranean counterparts found blocking drains and manholes include a pair of trousers, a snake, a traffic cone, a tractor tire, a still-functional clothing iron, a live badger, a mattress and a fully grown dead cow, The Independent reported. "How on Earth people have managed to flush quite so many (balls), I don't know, but this is just one example of amazing things we find blocking the sewers," Burgin said.
