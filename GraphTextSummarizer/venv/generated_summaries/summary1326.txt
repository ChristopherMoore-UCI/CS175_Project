Addressing crowds at the weigh-in Tuesday, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg got in the spirit, rattling off a string of hot dog puns -- "dogged," "catch up," "cut the mustard" and "pronounced wiener." "It's an American institution," said George Shea, who along with his brother, Richard Shea, and partner David Baer took competitive eating to a new level. Why gorge on hot dogs when people are starving? "America is able to celebrate freedom -- its rights, its freedoms, all of the joys that comes with that -- by eating hot dogs in the most absurd practice ever in mankind's history. In addition to Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest, the Sheas have organized other competitions, which they've dubbed Major League Eating.
