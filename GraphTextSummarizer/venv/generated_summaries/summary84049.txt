I have cystic fibrosis (CF) and I have never been able to take a full breath of air. I could be having the greatest day of my life one day, but the next I could be hunched over coughing up blood. " I realize I am still pretty young, but I like to think that I have a pretty good understanding about the value of life and how fragile it can be. All I want to do is give CF patients a voice, so that one day we aren't dealing with the pain that comes along with the disease. I often get asked what CF is, or what it is like to live with CF.
