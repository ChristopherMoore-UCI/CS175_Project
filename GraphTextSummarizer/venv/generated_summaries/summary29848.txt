Tyler: I always tell people that success is not the absence of failure, success is persistence through failure. In "Self-Inflicted Wounds," her second book, Tyler argues that the path to success is paved with epic failures. It doesn't mean that you're going to be successful, or traditionally successful because sometimes the world is just unfair, and untalented people get promoted and talented people get left behind, but if you are doing something that you love and you put a lot of hard work into it, you will be rewarded, and that's been the thing I've hewn to for my entire adult life. In some way it is an anti-self-help book, showing how failure can help in your success. So it does show how failure can help.
