Movie review: 'Last Vegas' Thanks to strong word-of-mouth and an "A-" CinemaScore grade, older audiences may flock to the theater gradually over the next few weeks and push "Vegas'" total as high as $60 million. Relativity's $55 million animated entry, which features the voice of Amy Poehler, opened in an ultra-wide 3,736 theaters with virtually no family competition ("Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2" arrived six weeks ago), but it could only muster a $4,336 per theater average. On the bright side, "Free Birds" did spike 82 percent from Friday to Saturday, which suggests that it is playing well with young tots during matinee shows, and it should hold up well as Thanksgiving approaches â€” especially with an "A-" CinemaScore. Summit and OddLot Entertainment spent $110 million on the space adventure starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford, but "Ender's Game" will need great legs domestically and strong returns overseas to justify its cost (and any potential sequels). Third place belonged to CBS Films' "Last Vegas," which opened with $16.5 million in 3,065 theaters.
