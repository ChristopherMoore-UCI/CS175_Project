After limping along for weeks, Gingrich's campaign ended last week after a disappointing last stand in Delaware, one of five states that went for Romney that day. "Republicans wanted an ideas guy like Newt Gingrich to be president so badly that at times we even turned to Newt Gingrich, a fatally flawed candidate," said Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor who advised Romney's campaign in 2008. Campaign sources said a day later that Gingrich would end his campaign this week. Gingrich led efforts to impeach Clinton over an investigation of his infidelities with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, but Clinton was acquitted. "You know, this is not a choice between Mitt Romney and Ronald Reagan, this is a choice between Mitt Romney and the most radical leftist president in American history," Gingrich said.
