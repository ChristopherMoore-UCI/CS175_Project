It left him 1.15 seconds faster than Croatian veteran Ivica Kostelic, with Romed Baumann, giving the hosts some rare cheer by taking the final podium spot. He edged inside the time set by Kostelic, then watched as a succession of challengers, including two-time defending champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, ski out in trying to match his time. I think I didn't deserve be on the podium after such as bad slalom run following that great downhill leg earlier today. Ligety was already celebrating when Baumann gave Austria just its second bronze of the championships. Vonn was expected to lead the U.S. medal charge in Austria, but Ligety took the men's super-G title to compensate for her early exit -- his first ever major victory in that discipline.
