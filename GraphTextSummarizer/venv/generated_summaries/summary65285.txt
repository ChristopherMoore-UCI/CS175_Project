The battle for a key Syrian city on the Turkish border intensified Monday as ISIS continued its push for control of Kobani while also scoring a victory in neighboring Iraq, taking a strategically important military base in Anbar province. Iraqi forces abandon base Despite airstrikes by the United States and its allies in Iraq over the weekend, reports suggest ISIS has continued to gain ground in Anbar province and has encircled Haditha, the province's last large town not yet under its control. "They have said that their facilities inside Turkey can be used by coalition forces, American and otherwise, to engage in activities inside Iraq and Syria," Rice told NBC's "Meet the Press." "That's a new commitment and one that we very much welcome," she said. The group's presence has been bolstered by as many as 10,000 fighters, dispatched from Syria and northern Iraq, the provincial council said. From Baghdad area to Raqqa, Syria Should all of Anbar fall, the Sunni extremists would rule from the perimeter of Iraq's capital to Raqqa in Syria, at least, according to the deputy head of the provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi.
