-- A report by the Massachusetts inspector general released Tuesday said that former drug lab technician Annie Dookhan was the "sole bad actor" at a Boston drug lab once responsible for tests related to thousands of criminal cases, and that directors of the facility were "ill-suited" to oversee her and other lab technicians. The state of Massachusetts says Dookhan doctored evidence to change test results at the Hinton State Drug Laboratory. "The directors were ill-suited to oversee a forensic drug lab, provided almost no supervision, were habitually unresponsive to chemists' complaints and suspicions, and severely downplayed Dookhan's major breach in chain-of-custody protocol upon discovering it," according to the inspector general's report. " In addition to the drug samples Dookhan mishandled, an additional 2,000 drug samples not handled by Dookhan were found to potentially contain "exculpatory evidence" to defendants in criminal cases because the drug lab failed to disclose "additional, inconsistent testing results," the report said. The Inspector General's Office reviewed more than 200,000 documents -- including e-mails, lab results and lab records -- and interviewed more than 40 people who worked with the drug lab to check for deficiencies, the report said.
