Introduced in the late 1990s, deep brain stimulation is becoming more widely accepted to treat such patients. People with Parkinson's disease who have a pacemaker-like device implanted in the brain spend an extra four-plus hours a day free of tremors and involuntary movements than they do on medication, according to the largest study of the treatment, which is known as deep brain stimulation. Charles is conducting a clinical trial of deep brain stimulation in patients with very early Parkinson's disease, which, like Weaver's research, is partially funded by the company that makes the stimulation device -- Medtronic. People who had deep brain stimulation were also more likely to develop depression, confusion, and anxiety, although these changes were minor, according to Weaver and her colleagues, and it's not yet clear how much of an effect they had on patients.
