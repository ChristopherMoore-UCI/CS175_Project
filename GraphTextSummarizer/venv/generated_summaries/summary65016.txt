In fairness to my conservative friends, there's noooooo way they could have ever known that their newest hero, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, would let loose a racist rant. Politicians denounce Bundy's racist remarks That's what's so interesting, not about this racist moron but about the Republicans who supported him until he revealed his views on slavery. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? Not the subsidies that provide grassland to Nevada ranchers at below-market values. Or, umm, what if Bundy had been a Muslim, declaring a tiny caliphate on that dusty piece of Nevada?
