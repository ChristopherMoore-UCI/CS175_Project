Julia and I were all ready to have our first bike ride. I may have crashed on my bike faster than anyone in the entire history of Fit Nation, but the lesson I learned in the process was well worth it. Was I too old and out of shape to really do this Fit Nation challenge? It all seemed to happen in vivid slow motion. Our first ride as a married couple, with our own bikes.
