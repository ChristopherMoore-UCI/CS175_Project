Despite the weather, a sizeable crowd of Walter Reed staff and military personnel attended the outdoor ceremony with their families. The official closing was conducted a day earlier than originally planned in order to avoid the worst of Hurricane Irene, but the ceremony was still marked by grey skies, heavy rain and strong winds. -- Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington closed its doors Saturday, completing the military hospital's merger with the Bethesda National Naval Medical Center. The new combined facility, known as the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, is now the country's largest military medical center. The hospital center has been in operation for more than a century and has provided medical care to many of the nation's wounded soldiers.
