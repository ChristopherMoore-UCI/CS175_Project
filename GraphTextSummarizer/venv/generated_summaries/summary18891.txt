Tate will be joined in "X Factor" finals by soloist Carly Rose Sonenclar and girl band Fifth Harmony. "X Factor," which runs on Fox, competes for viewers with similar sing-offs - "American Idol," also on Fox, and "The Voice," on NBC. The song contest show has seen some other turnover this year, with Britney Spears and Demi Lovato replacing first season judges Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul. But the end of season two will be another finale of sorts, as judge L.A. Reid announced Thursday he is leaving the show. They have since doled out millions to lure new stars to judge and host positions to attract more viewers.
