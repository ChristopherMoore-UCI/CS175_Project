He also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola," Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas said. Asked repeatedly by Gupta whether the patient should have been tested for Ebola during his first visit to the hospital, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said officials were still looking at details about how the case was handled. But when they arrived back in the United States, and asked travel officials about whether their temperatures would be taken or whether they'd be screened for Ebola, they were given unclear explanations about how the process worked and ultimately were not tested. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has helped lead the international response to Ebola, advises that all medical facilities should ask patients with symptoms consistent with Ebola for their travel history. People who have Ebola are contagious -- but only through contact with infected bodily fluids -- when they display active symptoms of the virus, such as a high fever, severe headache, diarrhea and vomiting, among others.
