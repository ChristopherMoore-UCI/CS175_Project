-- Sen. Ted Stevens repeatedly asked for invoices to cover home renovations and otherwise complied with Senate rules on accepting and reporting gifts of value, his defense attorney said in closing arguments Tuesday. In closing arguments, prosecutors said Stevens engaged in an elaborate scheme to accept thousands of dollars in gifts from Alaskan oil industry executive Bill Allen, who has admitted he tried to bribe state legislators, including the senator's son. Sen. Ted Stevens leaves the federal courthouse Tuesday evening with his daughter Beth Stevens. The judge will remind the jury that Allen's testimony against Stevens is part of a deal with prosecutors that could reduce his jail time when sentenced for attempted bribery. Stevens is not accused of bribery, but one prosecutor suggested he accepted gifts, concealed them from the public, and "took care of Bill" -- referring to Allen, the founder of oil services contractor Veco Corp.
