Science freezers, of course, being the technical description for freezers that hold ... science. I admit that it's an irrational new fear, but it all stems from several popular online reports this week about Japanese scientists at Kyoto University creating a very specific sperm bank for endangered species using new innovations in freeze-drying. But, while my freezer probably doesn't contain any animal sperm, soon we might be seeing science freezers that do. Animal sperm isn't one of them. Now, as Kaneko's endangered animal sperm bank moves forward, he's keen to get his hands on a bunch of larger animals that are at risk.
