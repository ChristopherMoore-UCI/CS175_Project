A wish that something new would come out of this battle was evident in late August when, after the tragic death of socialist candidate Eduardo Campos in a plane crash, his running mate and environmentalist Marina Silva took the helm on their ticket. The task of trying to dethrone Rousseff in the second round fell to Aecio Neves, with support from a defeated Marina Silva. After Sunday's polls gave President Dilma Rousseff, from the left-wing Worker's Party (PT), another four-year term with a narrow margin of victory, Brazilians embarked on a guessing exercise about what her next government will look like. But the scaremongering from the government's camp that Silva's lack of political support could lead her government to collapse made her support drop as quickly as it had risen. In a few weeks opinion polls showed Silva ahead of Dilma Rousseff in a second round simulation.
