The President and first lady dined at Estela in downtown Manhattan during Obama's stay in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly session in September. Obama was at the financial agency Friday to sign an executive order bolstering security measures for government credit cards. The restaurant is run by a former staffer at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, a farm-to-table mecca in the Hudson Valley where the Obama family attended the wedding of their personal chef this summer. Based on a photo of their kitchen order that the restaurant posted online, we know the Obamas dined on burrata with salsa verde and charred bread, and an endive salad with walnuts and anchovies. Speaking to workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington on Friday, he recalled a moment last month when, at the end of a dinner out in New York City, his plastic was declined.
