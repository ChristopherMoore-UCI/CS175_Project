"They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall," said Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest. The devastating earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday set off avalanches that left large numbers of climbers dead, missing, injured or trapped on Mount Everest. "We were sitting here in base camp, feeling the situation was getting better," said climber Carsten Pederson. " The base camp on the Nepal side of Everest is in a vulnerable spot, sitting in a valley surrounded by high Himalayan peaks. And they came down -- they were large, they were massive avalanches," said Jon Reiter, an American mountaineer at the base camp.
