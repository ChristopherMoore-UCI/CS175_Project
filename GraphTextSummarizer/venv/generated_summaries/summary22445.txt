We found that children who were spanked by their mothers at age 5, even relatively infrequently, went on to have higher levels of behavior problems at age 9, even after taking into account other family risk factors that also affect child behavior. Parents have a host of tools they can use -- talking, using time-outs and so on -- and all of us who see young parents and children can help demonstrate how effective these other forms of discipline can be. Studies that simply look at whether children have been spanked at all find that the vast majority of American children are still spanked today. In my first job in high school stocking the shelves with fresh produce at the grocery store, I often saw parents struggling with misbehaving children. That might explain why, even though the evidence is mounting that spanking leads to the very acting-out behavior most parents want to stop and even hurts a child's development, many parents in the United States continue to spank.
