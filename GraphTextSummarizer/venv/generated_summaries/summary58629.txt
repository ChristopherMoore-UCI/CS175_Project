The recipients do not keep them, as they are turned over to government archives in accordance with federal law, which prohibits officials from accepting personal gifts. Saudi Arabia topped the State Department's annual inventory of gifts to top administration officials. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice received gifts of jewelry, but federal law mandates they go to archives. Gifts by HM King Abdullah II to U.S. officials are always symbolic and of little material value. The source of gifts to U.S. intelligence officials is classified, but CIA chief Michael Hayden raked in $8,000 in gifts, including a gold cow plaque, a silk rug and a strand of pearls.
