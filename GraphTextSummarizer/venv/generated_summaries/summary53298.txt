At a hearing Wednesday to discuss the request, defense attorneys told the judge that Holmes was taken to a hospital but still did not specify his condition, saying his medical or pyschiatric statuses were privileged information, according to CNN affiliate KMGH.

Holmes' attorneys requested the delay, filing a motion that said because of "developments over the past 24 hours, Mr. Holmes is in a condition that renders him unable to be present in court for tomorrow's hearing." "It's not as simple as a migraine and not as simple as 'will be resolved in the morning,'" defense attorney Tamara Brady said, according to KMGH.
