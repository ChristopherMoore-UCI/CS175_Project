King: Petraeus story 'doesn't add up' House majority leader knew of Petraeus affair in October Petraeus letter: 'I showed extremely poor judgment' Opinion: How Petraeus changed the U.S. military But since Obama sent Petraeus to Langley last year, he has kept an unusually low profile. During the Iraq invasion in 2003, Petraeus, then commanding the 101st Airborne, allowed Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to shadow him, including on a Black Hawk helicopter. As NBC's longtime defense correspondent Fred Francis told me on CNN's "Reliable Sources," Petraeus would call him and other reporters regularly to chat off the record or on background. Turns out FBI investigators stumbled upon the affair while looking into Petraeus' e-mail account.
