Microsoft earned only $853 million from the Surface between its launch last fall and the close of the company's fiscal year -- a small fraction of iPad sales revenue during that time. Hits Windows XP -- This version of Microsoft's desktop operating system was released in 2001 and used on more than 80% of PCs at its peak. The burly Microsoft CEO, who announced Friday that he will retire next year, has been the victim of some unfortunate timing. Then Ballmer was blindsided by the swift rise of Steve Jobs and Apple, whose iPod, iPhone and iPad led a mobile revolution and made Microsoft appear slow and out of touch. Again, Microsoft found itself chasing Apple, this time with a belated attempt to dethrone the market-leading iPad.
