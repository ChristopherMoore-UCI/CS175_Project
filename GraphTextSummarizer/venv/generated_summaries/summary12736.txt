Other pictures include owl chicks peeking out of a tree hole, tiny fungi in front of massive trees, eerie underwater world inhabitants, and a deer in a housing estate. The British Wildlife Photography Awards were established four years ago to recognize the talents of wildlife photographers working in Britain and raise awareness for the country's biodiversity and habitats. "I've had quite a few encounters with dolphins there before but that day I was just looking to capture some underwater rolling barrel shots when I got a present of this incredibly playful dolphin, which joined me for some underwater body surfing for a few waves and then left," he said of the winning picture. Titled "In the Living Room," it was taken by photographer George Karbus, a Czech photographer who is based in Ireland. A photo of a dolphin surfing in the waves off Northern Ireland is this year's overall winner.
