CNN reported earlier this month that Sebelius met in Washington with senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett about the job, a sign that the administration has been giving her a close look since Daschle dropped out. -- President Obama on Saturday asked Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, according to two White House officials. The post is still vacant after the first pick, former Sen. Tom Daschle, stepped aside after questions were raised about his failure to pay more than $100,000 in taxes for use of a car and driver. Sebelius, who administration officials say Obama seriously considered to be his vice-presidential nominee, has been rumored to be a top contender for the job for weeks. Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius walks with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal after meeting with the president this week.
