"The cargo in question is a U.S. government-approved export that is moving in full conformance with U.S. and international law. According to the ship's manifest, it was carrying soy for a South African non-governmental organization working in Benguela, a city in western Angola, but authorities said they discovered that the soy in four of the containers was covering a cache of guns, ammunition and rockets. Local police authorities said that the vessel, en route from Senegal to Kenya, was seized Monday when it docked in Lobito, said Journalist Jose Manuel Alberto. A U.S. Embassy statement said the seizure was related to customs questions. "Maersk Constellation has been detained by Angolan authorities in order to verify proper documentation of hazardous cargo," Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers said in a written statement.
