The Chicago Police Memorial Foundation offered a $10,000 reward late Saturday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever killed Flisk. The officer, an evidence technician, died at 2:30 p.m., one hour after the shootings in the 8100 block of South Burnham Avenue, said Police Superintendent Jody Weis. The second victim was a retired Chicago Housing Authority officer, CNN affiliate WLS reported. Flisk was collecting evidence at a garage involved in a burglary, Weis said. "The thought that someone can shoot and kill a police officer is unacceptable," Weis said.
