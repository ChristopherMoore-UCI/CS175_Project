Entebbe, Uganda -- A Ugandan court has sent a Muslim couple to jail on charges of insulting the Christian religion by allegedly having sex in a church in Entebbe. The prosecution alleges that Abbasi Kigongo and Aisha Namazzi were found having sex near the altar of Kigungu Miracle Centre Church in Uganda's capital on May 14. The prosecution alleges that a churchgoer near the scene heard strange loud noises in the church, investigated the situation, and  found the couple having sex. The charge sheet says that "the duo willfully decided to have sex in the church with intentions of insulting a religion. An official at the magistrate's office said if found guilty, the couple could be subject to the Ugandan penal code, which says that "insulting a religion attracts a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment."
