Aguirre-Sacasa: Archie's still gonna have red hair, Betty is still gonna have blond hair and Veronica's gonna have dark hair. Aguirre-Sacasa: Archie Comics have thousands of characters in their library. Archie Andrews' prior big foray onto the small screen was "The Archie Show," which aired on Saturday mornings in the late 1960s. Fox is now bringing him back, as early as next fall, in a live-action show called "Riverdale" that promises to be pretty different from the traditional Archie comics we're used to reading. CNN spoke to writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who also does the creepy "Afterlife With Archie" comic books, about "Riverdale" after the series was announced Thursday.
