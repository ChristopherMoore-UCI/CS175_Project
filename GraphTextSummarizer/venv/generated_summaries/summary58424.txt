Hiroo Onoda was 91 years old. In  1944, Onoda was sent to the small island of Lubang in the western Philippines to spy on U.S. forces in the area. After losing his comrades to various circumstances, Onoda was eventually persuaded to come out of hiding in 1974. "Japan's philosophy and ideas changed dramatically after World War II," Onoda told ABC. Allied forces defeated the Japanese imperial army in the Philippines in the latter stages of the war, but Onoda, a lieutenant, evaded capture.
