Paul, currently resident at the Sea Life Center in Oberhausen, Germany, not only predicted Spain's win over the Netherlands in the final but also the team's semifinal success against Germany. Now the city's aquarium has launched an audacious bid to bring the unlikely star of the recent World Cup to the Spanish capital with a "name your price" offer for Paul the octopus -- the psychic cephalopod who correctly predicted Spain's triumph at the tournament. Last summer, Real Madrid, the world's most successful club, splashed out more than $200 million to bring former world players of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka to the city. Prior to that it had correctly predicted all five of Germany's earlier results, and picked Germany to beat Uruguay in the third-place playoff, ending the tournament with a remarkable eight-for-eight record. Zookeepers said they were also ready to offer other animals in exchange for the octopus and said Paul could expect the "best care" befitting of a national hero.
