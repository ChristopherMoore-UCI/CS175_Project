The Oscar-winning actress has to pay over $16,000 in child support each month to her ex, Gabriel Aubry, to provide for their 6-year-old daughter Nahla, the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered. Berry and Aubry's legal battles also include Berry seeking to relocate their daughter to France, and Nahla's nanny filing a restraining order against Aubry. Tensions erupted in a physical altercation between Aubry and Berry's husband, Olivier Martinez, on Thanksgiving Day 2012, when Aubry came to Berry's home to drop off then 4-year-old Nahla. Nahla is Aubry's only child. Berry and the Canadian model met in 2005 and split in spring 2010 and have since been entangled in bitter custody and child support litigation.
