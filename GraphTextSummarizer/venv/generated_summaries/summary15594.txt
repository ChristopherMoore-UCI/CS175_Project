-- Evander Holyfield failed in his bid to become the oldest heavyweight champion when he lost on points to giant Russian Nikolai Valuev in Zurich, Switzerland on Saturday. American Holyfield will take time to consider whether to return to the ring after his defeat. " With Valuev controlling the centre of the ring in the opening rounds, Holyfield danced around his opponent, hitting with occasional single shots. Holyfield struggles to escape the reach of seven-foot Russian world champion Valuez in Zurich. I think I showed tonight that I still can box and that age does not matter." Valuev said it was an honor to fight a legend like Holyfield.
