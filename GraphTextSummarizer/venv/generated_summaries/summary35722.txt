Wisniewski described relations between New Jersey Democrats and Christie as "very difficult," saying the governor "set lines in the sand" and "said it's my way or the highway. Last week, the New Jersey State Assembly committee investigating the matter made public more than 2,000 pages of documents suggesting politics was behind the unannounced lane closures on the New Jersey side of the bridge last September that caused traffic gridlock in Fort Lee. In the new inquiry, federal auditors will examine New Jersey's use of $25 million of the funds for the marketing campaign, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told CNN. His administration will cooperate "with all appropriate inquiries" into the controversy to "ensure this breach of trust does not happen again," Christie said before shifting away from the issue by saying the scandal "does not define us or our state" and will not delay "the work that needs to be done to improve the people's lives in New Jersey." The documents suggest that top Christie aides orchestrated the traffic mess to punish that town's mayor for not endorsing their boss, and that they allegedly tried to stonewall media inquiries into the matter.
