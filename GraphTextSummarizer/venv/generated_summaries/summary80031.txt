Shortly after the incident, soccer fans traded accusations with the Interior Ministry, which blamed the violence on riots from ticketless fans who tried to push their way in. Authorities later partially lifted the ban by allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, state media reported. Three years ago, a riot at a match between Al-Masry and Al-Ahly teams left more than 70 people dead in Port Said city. After that incident, Egypt banned soccer fans from games. Soccer fans posted social media images of what they said were bodies from the riots, some still wearing jerseys with their teams' names.
