The British government has cited Savage -- who is on the list under his real name, Michael Alan Weiner -- for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence. Savage was referring to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, whose office recently excluded 22 people from entering the country because the government feels they have been "stirring up hatred." -- American radio talk-show host Michael Savage said he wants an apology from Britain's home secretary and his name removed from a list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom. " Smith has said she is determined to keep those who "spread extremism, hatred and violent messages" out of the country. " "She lumped me in with known murderers and terrorists, people who have been in prison for killing people," Savage said of Smith.
