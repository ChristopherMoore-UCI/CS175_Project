On Wednesday night, barring an intervention of common decency, common sense and common compassion, the state of Texas will execute a man who scarcely comprehends who he is, let alone the reason why he will be put to death. Nor does anyone dispute that at the time, Panetti was enmeshed in deep psychosis. The man is Scott Panetti, a hopelessly unhinged paranoid schizophrenic. In Panetti's case it did, and on Wednesday, barring a commutation by the Supreme Court or Texas Gov. Rick Perry, he will pay the ultimate price for suffering the ultimate bad luck. Nor would it give comfort to Victoria Panetti, his sister.
