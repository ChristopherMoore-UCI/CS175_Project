Two friends of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez were indicted on murder charges Friday in connection with the 2013 homicide of Odin Lloyd in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, according to the Bristol County District Attorney's Office. Hernandez, 24, is being held on first-degree murder and weapons charges in the shooting death of Lloyd. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in the early morning of June 17. Asked to elaborate, he said, "Maybe you should ask the DA." Wallace, who also was indicted last fall on an accessory-after-the-fact-to-murder charge, had turned himself in to police in Miramar, Florida, at his family's home more than a week later after taking a bus to Florida from Georgia. Surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home.
