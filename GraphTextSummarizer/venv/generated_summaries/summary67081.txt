His lawyers have argued in federal court the money was a gift unrelated to campaign expenditures and that legally, donors can help pay for a candidate's personal expenses unrelated to the campaign, according to a report by CNN affiliate WTVD in Raleigh, North Carolina, last October. In federal court in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday, Judge Catherine Eagles said that attorneys in the case should expect Hunter to testify on behalf of the government. At issue in the approaching North Carolina trial is whether money given to support Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, by the then-candidate's benefactors should have been considered donations toward his presidential campaign. The attorneys also said money from donors never went directly to Edwards, but was handled through third parties, WTVD said. He is accused of conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws.
