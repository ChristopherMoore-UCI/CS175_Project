Stevens, however, did say he would relinquish his co-chairmanships and ranking member positions, in accordance with Senate Republican rules. Reacting to the indictment, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said it was up to Senate Republicans to decide if any punishment was warranted. The indictment says the home improvements provided by Veco and its chief executive officer, Bill Allen, a "personal friend of Stevens," included a new first floor, a new garage, a new first- and second-story wraparound deck, new plumbing and new wiring. -- Sen. Ted Stevens declared his innocence Tuesday after his indictment on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and services from a company in his home state. In the 28-page indictment, Stevens was charged with seven counts of making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms.
