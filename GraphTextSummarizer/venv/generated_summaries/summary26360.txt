"Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter," police said in a statement Monday. And Randall Kerrick, the police officer who shot him, faces a felony charge of voluntary manslaughter. Now police say Kerrick used excessive force and had no cause to shoot Ferrell. They've charged Kerrick with voluntary manslaughter, a felony. Chestnut says the video, filmed from the dashboard of one of the police cruisers on scene, shows a clearly unarmed Ferrell moving forward toward police with his hands out, then panicking as two laser beams hit the center of his chest.
