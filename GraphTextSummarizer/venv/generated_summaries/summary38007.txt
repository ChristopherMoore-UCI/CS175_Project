Among the bidding groups are retired Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson and former Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals executive Stan Kasten; former CNN talk show host Larry King and agent Dennis Gilbert; former Dodger stars Steve Garvey and Orel Hershiser; former Dodger and New York Yankees manager Joe Torre; Los Angeles shopping center developer Rick Caruso; and former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley. Attorneys' fees for both sides in the divorce could reach $35 million -- more than what the Dodgers pay any player -- and Jamie McCourt's attorneys said that figure is unheard of in California divorces, even with its share of expensive celebrity divorces. When contacted by CNN, a McCourt spokesman said the owner didn't have an immediate comment Thursday. "So much money is coming into this, really, whoever gets it, the Dodgers will be really happy," Lee Jenkins of Sports Illustrated told CNN. Adding to the team's woes are the acrimonious divorce proceedings between Frank McCourt -- the current owner -- and Jamie McCourt.
