I want them to be worried about math tests and track meets and about science fairs and student council elections -- the kind of normal school stuff that builds character. But our epidemic of gun violence is creating a culture of fear in our schools, where students are anxious about safety and intruders. Our children deserve enhanced school security: This includes identifying who is in the school and sensible steps to keep the building secure -- without bringing guns into the place of learning or turning it into a fortress. And at the very least, it should include comprehensive and enforceable background checks to help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. On that morning, I headed to school worried about my 10th grade math test and my upcoming track meet.
