The prince attended the service at Camp Bastion, the main British military base in Afghanistan, along with Liam Fox, Britain's Secretary of State for Defense, according to Clarence House. Britain's Prince William attended a remembrance service Sunday in Afghanistan's Helmand Province to honor British and Commonwealth war dead, his press office said in a statement. He is known as Flight Lieutenant Wales within the British air force. Fox and the prince, the second in line to the British throne, also attended a parade and spent the morning meeting with troops from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, and visited Camp Bastion's medical center. "Prince William laid a wreath to pay homage to British and Commonwealth sailors, soldiers and airmen who have fallen in battle," the statement said.
