Here is a program that will restore U.S. economic performance: • Cancel all the tax increases scheduled to take effect at the end of 2012 and provide tax stability going forward. By expanding immigration for low-skill workers, we restrain labor costs and reduce out-migration of manufacturing and other business. Anti-business rhetoric, which casts all success as undeserved, and which fails to recognize the improvements in material well-being that result from entrepreneurial success, just drive away talented people and guarantee our economic demise. In this recession, the rapid recovery phase has so far been absent; real GDP is still well below where one would have predicted pre-2008, and with average growth under 3% since the recession ended, the gap grows larger every quarter. • Reform the tax code by eliminating the misguided deductions, exemptions, credits and loopholes that distort incentives and reward special interests.
