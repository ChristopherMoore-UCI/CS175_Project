Palestinian officials have refused to enter into new talks with Israel until it stops building settlements on West Bank land. New Israeli settlements a 'set back' for peace with Palestinians Israeli settlements are widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel insists they are not. The Palestinian bid to the United Nations and news of Israeli settlement construction came just days after a cease-fire took hold between Israel and Hamas that brought about an end to a series of Israeli military airstrikes against Gaza launched in an effort to stop the Hamas rocket attacks. Hamas has since regularly launched rocket attacks into southern Israel. "The answer to the attack on the Zionist character of the state of Israel obliges us to increase the tempo of settlement building plans in all the areas that the government has decided to settle in," Netanyahu said in remarks before the start of his weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.
