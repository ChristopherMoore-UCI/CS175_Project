Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski had argued that the results were illegitimate and called for new elections. Maduro, Chavez's political heir, was sworn in as president at an April 19 inauguration ceremony. In the Venezuelan version of the "birther" movement, its proponents say Maduro was born in neighboring Colombia and is either a Colombian citizen or a dual citizen, either of which would make him ineligible to be president. Maduro has stressed that he won a clear majority of votes in the election and accused Capriles and his supporters of inciting violence. At a press conference Wednesday, Supreme Court President Gladys Gutierrez said that all the lawsuits filed challenging the election were invalid because they did not present enough proof or documentation, Venezuela's information ministry said in a statement.
