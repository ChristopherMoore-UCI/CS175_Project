The writer of "Free Nelson Mandela," Jerry Dammers -- the founder of the multiracial English ska-punk band The Specials, later renamed The Special AKA  -- admits he knew little about Mandela before he attended an anti-apartheid concert in London in 1983. Free Nelson Mandela, I'm begging you Free Nelson Mandela Veteran DJ and broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said the song was effective in educating people about Mandela, whose reputation was low in the West at the time. " As the impact of the concert rippled around the world, the South African government was secretly holding talks with Mandela. Four years later, in 1988, Dammers and the band Simple Minds helped organize the Nelson Mandela 70th birthday concert at London's Wembley Stadium, featuring acts such as Dire Straits, George Michael and Sting. "I'd never actually heard of Nelson Mandela, although I knew a lot about the anti-apartheid movement and he was becoming a figurehead for the whole movement," Dammers told CNN.
