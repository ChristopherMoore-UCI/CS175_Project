In nationally televised comments a week after the slayings, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said, "There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people, through vicious, violent video games." Related: NRA video game smacks of hypocracy Gene Grabowski, a longtime crisis-management expert who has advised gun manufacturers, called the timing of the app "startling." "But the NRA has long ignored what anyone but its base cares about," he said. Critics are questioning the timing of the game's release Monday -- a month to the day after the December 14 shootings -- and accusing the NRA of hypocrisy because one of its leaders recently blamed video games for stoking gun violence. "I think video games should be part of the dialogue" about gun violence in the U.S., he added. "In its post-Sandy Hook press conference, the NRA blamed violent media instead of gun ownership for the tragedy, singling out video games in particular. NRA opponents will reflexively see the game as inappropriate, but to gun-rights supporters, "a firing-range game that embraces the NRA's overall position on safety and gun rights probably seems like a welcome alternative to public discourse about gun control," he said.
