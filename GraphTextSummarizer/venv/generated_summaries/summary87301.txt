While declining to give specific numbers, United Airlines is "reducing operations at Houston Intercontinental Airport and other airports in the mid-South and Southeast regions today due to severe weather," said spokesman Charles Hobart, Tuesday. #ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport Chicago's O'Hare has been hit by airlines that are proactively canceling flights. "This is due to airline pull downs (reductions because of bad weather in other locations) and not because of weather," said airport spokeswoman Jacqueline Mayo. Citing near-record lows in the Midwest, United is also reducing operations Tuesday at their Chicago and Cleveland hubs and other Midwest airports. Depending on how-hard hit they are, Houston and Atlanta airports may still be recovering from storm conditions on Wednesday, said David Baker, FlightAware's chief executive officer.
