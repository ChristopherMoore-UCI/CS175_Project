"What we're actually seeing because of the groundswell of anti-abortion overreach, we're seeing the entire movement put into an offensive posture," said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. Tara Shaver said the state legislature has repeatedly refused to take up a parental notification measure, one of the most basic steps for abortion opponents. She added that Roe v. Wade is settled law and any attempt to roll back abortion access will get caught up in litigation. But the tactic also appeals to anti-abortion activists who hope the courts roll back Roe v. Wade. Sarah Warbelow, state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign, said her group "works with municipalities all the time" to pass and implement LGBT rights measures.
