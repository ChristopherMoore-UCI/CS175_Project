Meet the Strati, the concept vehicle that was selected from more than 200 entries as the winner of the 3D Printed Car Design Challenge -- back in mid-April, US-based company Local Motors invited designers from around the world to submit their concepts for a car that can be manufactured using 3D printing. "By the end of this summer it will be less than 20 hours of printing, and we believe we can get it down to less than an hour of assembly by two people -- what this means is that is really the first production 3D printed car when you can reach those numbers," he continues. The judges chose Anoe's design for its compatibility with existing 3D printing technologies and explained it offered "an excellent balance between innovation, complexity and practicality." "Our goal in the end is to be radically different about the creation of cars; we sort of commonly say a car today is over 20,000 parts -- we would like cars of the future to have less than 20 parts. Local Motors, a crowd-sourced car maker, has already developed a working model to check the process and has also released a video of its first test drive.
