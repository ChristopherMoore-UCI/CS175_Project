The African National Congress has won South Africa's general election, holding on to power despite economic woes and corruption allegations that some felt might weaken its grip. The millions of voters who participated in Wednesday's elections were charged with electing 400 members of Parliament, as well as representatives in new legislatures in South Africa's nine provinces, according to the South African Press Association. The ANC, which has governed for the past 20 years, still enjoys widespread support after the defeat of the apartheid system and the beginning of democracy in South Africa. But its popularity and that of President Jacob Zuma have been hit by various issues, including a scandal centered in Zuma's rural homestead in Nkandla, in the province of KwaZulu Natal. Earlier, South Africa's Government Communication and Information System called the elections "a resounding success."
