Ziona's father, Chana, founded the Christian sect in Baktwang village that promotes polygamy as God's will. But as word gets out, Baktwang village and Ziona's family may not remain so isolated. Four hours away from Mizoram's only airport, in the isolated village of Baktwang, Ziona's bright purple house with 22 bedrooms stands out. Some are doing carpentry work, some take care of the piggery and poultry farm and others cultivate crops," Ziona says. He has set up a school nearby for children of the community, the curriculum comes from the government but Ziona has added some sect-specific teachings.
