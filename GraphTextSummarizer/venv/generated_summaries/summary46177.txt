Once endangered, the Florida alligator has made a comeback and can be found in county water bodies, according to Pinellas County's Animal Services website. Deputies took him into custody after he was treated for multiple puncture wounds to the face, arm and armpit area, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Authorities booked him into the county jail on various charges, including driving without a license and fleeing police. The incident started after deputies pulled over the 20-year-old in Pinellas Park for allegedly failing to maintain a single lane. -- A Florida man fleeing a traffic stop almost got away, police say.
