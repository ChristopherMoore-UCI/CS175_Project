Just three days before his San Antonio plunge, Steve-O posted an Instagram video of a throwback stunt with striking similarities. City statutes forbid anyone jumping into or swimming in the San Antonio River. A photo shared on Facebook some 7,000 times (a related video got over 10,000 shares) shows the wild man in mid-leap. "I did a good deed today by proving it's not safe to jump off the bridge at the San Antonio River Walk," he wrote. Steve-O, best known for his grimace-inducing stunts on the "Jackass" TV show and films, was in San Antonio this weekend and flipped out.
