Nodding to co-star Hugh Laurie, who played Dr. Gregory House on "House," Clooney issued a challenge to other actors who played doctors on television. "It is not lost on me that I am spending my honeymoon at Comic Con," said Clooney, according to several reports from the event. (Clooney played Dr. Doug Ross on "ER.") George Clooney took an apparent break from his honeymoon with Amal Alamuddin to make a surprise appearance Thursday at New York Comic Con. " "Tomorrowland," directed by Brad Bird ("The Incredibles") and written by Bird and Damon Lindelof, opens in May 2015.
