-- Several hundred union and other progressive activists sought to capitalize on the growing "Occupy Wall Street" protests Wednesday, holding a rally on Capitol Hill to demand new public spending on job creation and an end to federal budget cuts. The rally, led by former White House clean energy adviser Van Jones, highlighted growing liberal frustration with a public policy agenda increasingly dominated by deficit reduction efforts as opposed to more traditional economic stimulus measures. " Mahlon Mitchell, head of the Professional Firefighters of Wisconsin, complained that "we see Wall Street flourishing right now" while other Americans continue to struggle with the economic downturn. A number of progressive Democrats are hoping to use the growing protests on Wall Street and elsewhere to energize the party's base in advance of the 2012 elections. The "real problem," he asserted, is the "deregulation of banking" and Wall Street.
