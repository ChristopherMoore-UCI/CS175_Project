"Everyone loves horse racing in Mongolia; it's our national sport," says Battsetseg Erdenekhuu, who works as a guide for adventure tourists in Mongolia. "For the main games of wrestling, archery and horse racing, it's still very traditional," she says. As a celebration of Mongolia's nomadic past, the games will undoubtedly persist, believes Erdenekhuu. "For the naadam opening ceremony in Ulaanbaatar, because more tourists come just for that, it's a bit touristy as there are different shows held just for them. The wrestle-fest is part of "naadam", the annual celebration of traditional Mongolian sports -- wrestling, archery and horse-racing -- that captivates villages, towns and cities across the country for three days.
