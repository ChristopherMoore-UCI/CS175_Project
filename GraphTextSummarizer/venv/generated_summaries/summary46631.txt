Tuesday, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, sent a letter to Holder demanding to know who at the Justice Department was aware of a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives memo on questionable tactics, which was forwarded to ATF headquarters and possibly to the Justice Department one day before Justice sent a faulty letter to Grassley denying any "gunwalking." "Which DOJ personnel received a copy of the February 3, 2011 memorandum before the February 4, 2011 reply was sent to me?" Grassley said information he has received, apparently from whistleblowers, indicated the memo questioning Fast and Furious from ATF field agent Gary Styers had caused a stir at ATF headquarters. A senior Justice Department official familiar with the Grassley letter when asked for reaction said only, "We will respond appropriately." But the Justice Department 10 months later had to admit to Congress that letter was wrong, and it was formally withdrawn by senior Justice officials. The issue is significant because the February 4 letter from Justice denied any "gunwalking" of illegally purchased firearms that had made their way across the Mexican border to drug cartels.
