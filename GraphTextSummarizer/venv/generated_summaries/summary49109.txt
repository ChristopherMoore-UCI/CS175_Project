A statement on the German Football Association's Web site read: "German captain Michael Ballack will not be able to play at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. -- Germany captain Michael Ballack will miss the World Cup after he picked up an ankle injury during Chelsea's FA Cup final victory over Portsmouth at Wembley. "German team doctor Hans-Wilhelm MÃ¼ller-Wohlfahrt said, that according to today's diagnosis, Ballack can look for a complete recovery, but that it should require a minimum of eight weeks before a possible re-entry into regular practice sessions." The 33-year-old sustained ligament damage in a strong tackle from Portsmouth midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng that forced him to hobble off before half-time in a game that Chelsea won 1-0. Ballack has 98 caps for Germany and made 36 appearances for Chelsea this season.
