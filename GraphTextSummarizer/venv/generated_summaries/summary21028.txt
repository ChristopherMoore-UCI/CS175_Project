President Asif Ali Zardari postponed a trip to Russia to huddle with senior members of his Pakistan Peoples Party to nominate a candidate. What's next for Pakistan Federal Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said senior party members have decided that Zardari, who is the party chairman, will make a final decision on how to proceed after he meets with coalition partners. " The speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly had 30 days from the day of the April verdict to ask the Election Commission to pursue disqualification proceedings if she viewed Gilani's conviction as cause for dismissal. The Supreme Court declared Gilani disqualified retroactive to April 26, the day he was convicted of contempt charges stemming from his refusal to call on Swiss authorities to reopen old corruption charges against Zardari. Supporters of Gilani and the party say the court's ruling was politically motivated because of bad blood between the Supreme Court's popular Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and Zardari.
