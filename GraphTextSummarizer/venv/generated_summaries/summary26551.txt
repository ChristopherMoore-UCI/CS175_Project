-- The widower of actress Brittany Murphy, found dead in his home Sunday night, was scheduled to undergo heart bypass surgery this summer Sharon Murphy, who shared the house with Monjack, "loved him like a son" and is devastated by his death, Neal said. Roger Neal, a spokesman for Murphy's mother, Sharon, said Monjack delayed the heart surgery until after a fundraising gala for the Brittany Murphy Foundation in September. Sharon Murphy found Monjack unconscious in his bedroom and called the fire department, a family friend said. Monjack and Murphy were married in May 2007.
