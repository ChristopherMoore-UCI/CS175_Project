The prosecution of Special Agent William G. Clark for the 2008 shooting death of Marcus Sukow has enraged many federal law enforcement officers, who say Clark was heroically coming to the defense of a battered woman. "The ATF family supports Special Agent Clark and seeks an immediate, non-criminal resolution in this matter." Clark's attorney fought to have the case transferred to federal court, saying Clark was acting as a federal agent and deserved federal protections. "William Clark is a federal ATF agent who does not have peace officer status under Virgin Islands law and therefore had no authority to enforce law including the domestic violence statutes," said Sara Lezama, a spokeswoman for the Virgin Islands Department of Justice. "Special Agent Clark intervened in a domestic dispute in order to protect a woman that was endangered by her boyfriend. The Clark prosecution "has the potential to create a chilling effect on the operation of federal law enforcement throughout the United States' territories," Schumer wrote.
