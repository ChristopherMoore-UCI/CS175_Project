It was my first week in the Clinton administration and I had joined a trip to South Africa with my boss, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. One can only imagine how discordant his new role as hero and dignitary and certain future president was with his fairly recent past as a prisoner. South Africa had yet to complete its transition to representative democracy, yet to put the stain of apartheid behind it. I just remember that Mandela took the time, made the connection, seemed to listen to what I was saying and that at the end of it all, he said, "Thank you for coming to South Africa." It is a coda to a great life, a reminder to cast aside resignation and defeatism and know that great hearts do exist.
