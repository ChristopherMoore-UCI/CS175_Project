In the past, Google has taken issue with third-party reports about Google+, noting that they don't track users who access the site remotely, among other factors. In a call with analysts last month, Google CEO Larry Page said Google+ had 90 million users compared to 40 million in October. -- Users spent just 3.3 minutes on Google+ in January compared to 7.5 hours for Facebook, according to a new comScore report. Google is putting a huge amount of emphasis on Google+. Despite the latest report, though, there's some encouraging news for Google: Website-Monitoring crunched the numbers this month and found that Google+ is getting less male dominated and is catching on big in India, where 13.69% of Plussers now originate.
