The unsavory issue of racism in Italian football could be tested like never before following the news that former Netherlands international Clarence Seedorf is to take charge of AC Milan. However, Seedorf had more immediate challenges to wrestle with as he took a phone call from Milan chairman Silvio Berlusconi on Monday. Seedorf, who won two Champions League and two Serie A titles with Milan as a player, must not only try to arrest the team's worrying slump but also run the potential gauntlet of racism in a country whose football has been plagued by it in recent times. The powerful midfielder made his debut for local side Ajax way back in 1992, prior to joining a host of Europe's top sides: Sampdoria, Real Madrid, Inter and Milan. During this time, he became the first man to win Champions League titles with three different clubs - triumphing with Ajax in 1995, Real in 1998 and Milan in both 2003 and 2007.
