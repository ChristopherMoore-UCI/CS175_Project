If a computer infected with malware is connected to a network, attackers can often access other connected systems and servers. A malware attack hit Yahoo's advertising server over the last few days, affecting thousands of users in various countries, an Internet security company said. Yahoo said it is aware of the attack and is monitoring and blocking such advertisements. In a blog post, Fox-IT said Yahoo's servers were releasing an "exploit kit" that exploited vulnerabilities in Java and installed malware. "At Yahoo, we take the safety and privacy of our users seriously," it said in a prepared statement Monday.
