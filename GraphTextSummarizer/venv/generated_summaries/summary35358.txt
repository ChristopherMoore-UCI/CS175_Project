The 1996 and 1999 surveys asked: "Looking to the future, do you think most children in this country will grow up to be better off or worse off than their parents." Conclusion: Surveys in the past three years, from two different organizations, show the majority of respondents don't expect today's children to be better off than their parents. The facts: Polls do appear to show a recent, downward trend in optimism for kids' futures, and four polls from two different organizations since 2009 indeed had a majority of adult respondents saying they don't expect today's children to be better off than their parents. 1999: 36% 2002: 50% 2006: 50% The 2002/2006 Pew surveys asked: "When children today in the U.S. grow up, do you think they will be better off or worse off than people are now?" Here's how those Gallup/USA Today numbers looked from 2008 to 2011 (sample of 1,013 adults, with a +/ 4% margin of error): February 2008: 33% somewhat/very unlikely December 2008: 42% March 2009: 40% January 2010: 38% October 2010: 48% April 2011: 55% Gallup also keeps a collection of older, CBS News/New York Times poll results that used the same question: October 1996: 42% January 1998: 34% December 2001: 27% January 2003: 31% Reports of majority pessimism, however, are not unique to the last three years. The GOP presidential nominee said Thursday at the Republican National Convention that America's immigrants would always arrive confident that they could build a better life, and "that in America their children would be more blessed than they." "But today, four years from the excitement of the last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future," Romney said.
