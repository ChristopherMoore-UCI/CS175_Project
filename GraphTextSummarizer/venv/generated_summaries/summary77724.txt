Both military spokesmen referenced Heglig, a key oil installation in South Kordofan state that produces nearly half of Sudan's oil and was seized by South Sudan's military this week. In late July, South Sudan halted oil production after accusing Sudan of "stealing" $815 million worth of its crude. Meanwhile, Khalid said that Sudanese military forces were "approaching Heglig from all sides." Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations welcomed a U.N. Security Council statement this week demanding "a complete, immediate and unconditional end to all fighting and a withdrawal of the SPLA from Heglig and an end to aerial bombardments. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three-quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. "South Sudan is prepared to withdraw troops as long as a mechanism is put in place that the area cannot be used to launch further attacks."
