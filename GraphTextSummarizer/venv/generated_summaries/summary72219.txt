Dr. Azeem Ahmed, medical director of the University of Iowa AirCare program, said the deaths had hit the Northern Iowa emergency responder community hard. Ahmed posted a photo of the note and a short caption to his Facebook page and on the Facebook page for University of Iowa AirCare. The 13 men and women, ages 25-60, are dressed in flight suits from University of Iowa AirCare. Russ Piehl and Shelly Lair-Langenbau, along with pilot Gene Grell, were killed just minutes after climbing into a Mercy Medical Center North helicopter to pick up a patient. At the start of the evening dinner rush on January 10, a group of 13 is seated at an Applebee's in Mason City, Iowa.
