If Google's aim was to create its own source of social voting data and avoid a nightmarish outcome -- being forced to rank your search results based solely on your Facebook connections -- then, by its own standards, Google+ is not a failure. Whatever the reason, I've been asked at least three times in the past week about whether Google+, Google's social networking service, will ever beat Facebook. Perhaps it's because Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called Google+ a "little version of Facebook." If Google's aim with Google+ was to topple Facebook, that's an audacious goal. So Facebook, the big blue social network, may be winning a battle with Google+ but is losing the mobile war with Google at large.
