Last season ended with the group having discovered a place called Terminus, which was anything but the sanctuary they were led to believe it was. Last season, he threw down a gauntlet, saying that the people of Terminus had no idea who they're dealing with -- which is quite a threat considering that they're locked in a train car. The residents of Terminus quickly locked them in a train car, but Rick was determined to make an escape with his friends. We've never left our group of survivors before, in such perilous circumstances. -- "The Walking Dead" returns for a fifth season on AMC Sunday, and fans have been waiting since March to find out the fate of Rick Grimes and many of the survivors.
