" China starts work on world's tallest building The infamous property index says construction booms that give rise to the world's tallest buildings are the harbingers of economic busts.

"The Skyscraper Index has a good 150-year correlation between the world's tallest buildings and economic slowdowns and recessions," says Andrew Lawrence, pioneer of the Skyscraper Index and head of Hong Kong and China property research at CIMB Group. If the Skyscraper Index maintains its track record, then China should steel itself for economic collapse.
