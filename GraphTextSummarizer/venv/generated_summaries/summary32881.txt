Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise The good news is that not only is CRE seen relatively infrequently in most U.S. facilities, but current surveillance systems haven't been able to find it commonly in otherwise healthy people in the community, says Dr. Alex Kallen, a CDC medical officer. "CRE are nightmare bacteria," CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement. While up to 50% of patients with CRE bloodstream infections die, similar antibiotic-susceptible bacteria kill about 20% of bloodstream-infected patients. Patients should also be screened for CREs, according to the CDC. That strategy includes making sure proper hand hygiene policies in health care facilities are actually followed.
