"I really enjoyed being around those women," said photographer Marie Baronnet, who documented them in her book "Legends: The Living Art of Risque." "I didn't want to do something that was too close (to what) they were used to doing for so many years -- and that men photographers especially ask -- which is to be like a pinup like the typical Bettie Page picture," Baronnet said. Baronnet became interested in burlesque during a trip to Las Vegas in 2011, where she met legendary dancer Dixie Evans. All of the women featured in Baronnet's book used to dance in burlesque theaters, enticing the audience with a strip show. Marie Baronnet is a French photographer based in Los Angeles.
