The gunman opened fire at a free speech forum in Copenhagen on February 14 before shooting several people outside a synagogue and then firing at police. The two victims in the shootings have been named as film director Finn Noergaard, 55, and 37-year-old Dan Uzan. He is due to appear before a court on Saturday charged with assisting the suspect of the shootings in Copenhagen on February 14-15. Police in Denmark said Friday they have arrested another suspect in connection with shootings earlier this month in Copenhagen in which two people died. The suspected gunman in the attacks has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, according to a senior member of the Danish government.
