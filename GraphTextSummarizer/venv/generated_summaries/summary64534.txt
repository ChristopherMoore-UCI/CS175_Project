BuzzFeed then fleshed out the discovery with color photos of the device next to an actual iPad. Called the 035 mockup, the glass-screened device was double the thickness of the first iPad, about an inch thick compared to .5 inches for the Apple tablet that hit stores in 2010. -- Even before Apple came out with its iPhone five years ago, it was experimenting with iPad-like tablets. As part of the case, Jonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, was deposed in December of last year. The latest interesting ruling in the case came on Thursday, when a UK court said Apple had to post a note on its UK site for six months and run a notice in British newspapers saying that Samsung did not copy the iPad design. Samsung is fighting Apple's claims the the Galaxy Tab infringes on the iPad's design.
