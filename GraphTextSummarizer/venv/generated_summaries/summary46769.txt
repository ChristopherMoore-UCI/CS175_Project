Rain-driven floods like those in Colorado a few weeks ago will also happen more often, as warmer air holds more water vapor. The consequences of poor planning will become all the more serious as climate warms and sea level rises. It was clear for years that the New York City subways were dangerously vulnerable to hurricane flooding. Even when the present has delivered an unprecedented shock, we still have trouble accepting that the future will bring new ones, unlike those before. The changes are already under way, results of human greenhouse gas emissions, and consistent with the predictions of climate scientists decades ago.
