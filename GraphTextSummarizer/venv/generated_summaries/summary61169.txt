Now, the 23-year-old university graduate earns up to Â£4,000 ($6,722) a month from the advertisements displayed on his YouTube video channel, Supercars of London. Wallace, still too young to get a driver's license, began filming supercars around London, and uploading them to YouTube. The visit, taking in Aston Martins, Ferraris and Lamborghinis, would prove the beginnings of his lucrative YouTube video channel. The street shots and low resolution videos brought the cars "to life" for fans unable to afford one, Wallace said. The purchase of a Â£55,000 Audi R8 enabled Wallace to return his mom's Ford Focus, which had been on loan.
