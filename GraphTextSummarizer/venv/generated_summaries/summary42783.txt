China's one child policy started in the 1980s curbed population growth, but Beijing now faces a rising tide of retiring workers. In his speech at the opening of the Party Congress, outgoing leader Hu Jintao made an ambitious target for 2020 to double per capita income in China from 2010 levels for both rural and urban dwellers -- the first time a resident's per capita income has been included in economic targets, state-run media Xinhua notes. " The challenge is moving China from an export and investment led economy to one based on domestic consumer-based growth. On the other hand, the pair will be the first leaders in three decades since China opened to economic reform that haven't presided over double-digit growth. The stability of modern Communist Party rule has been built on the promise that it will create a better future for China's 1.3 billion citizens, one that has largely been delivered by leaders since Deng Xiaoping opened the country to economic reform in 1979.
