However, Bayern equalized before halftime when Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic deflected in Franck Ribery's low free-kick for his eighth in the league this season, and the Frenchman was also involved as Thomas Muller scrambled a second-half winner from close range. The home side had scored more goals this season than any other in the Bundesliga, and extended that when 18-year-old defender Niklas Sule became the youngest player in Hoffenheim history to find the back of the net. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen dropped four points behind Bayern, losing 1-0 at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig thanks to an 81st-minute goal by Congolese striker Domi Kumbela. Meetings with Hoffenheim in recent years have always been close, but we did have a little bit of luck today." "We gave a good account of ourselves against the best team in the world," said Sule, who capitalized when Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer failed to deal with a corner.
