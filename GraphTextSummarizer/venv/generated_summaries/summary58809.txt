The issue of DEA involvement came up when a Secret Service agent voluntarily reported to his supervisors that had attended a party with the DEA agents and several women at a Cartagena apartment on April 13. Allegations concerning the DEA agents came to light following reports concerning twelve Secret Service agents who went out drinking at Cartagena night clubs on April 11 and ended up bringing women back to their hotel rooms. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, noted that nine Secret Service agents lost their jobs for spending time with prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, in April. "One significant concern was that there were DEA agents on the ground and care had to be taken not to accidentally identify them or disrupt any ongoing investigations," said the law enforcement official. That Secret Service agent said he accepted a massage from a woman he thought was a masseuse and that when things started to turn sexual he stopped it.
