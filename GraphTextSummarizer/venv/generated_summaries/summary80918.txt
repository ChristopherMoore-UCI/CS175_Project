"A rhino is killed every seven hours, and when you mention rhinos to anyone, they tend to shake their head in desperation," says Dereck Joubert, who, along with his wife Beverly set up Rhinos Without Borders, a charity that has recently come up with a novel approach to saving one of Africa's most iconic creatures. Making the move Rhinos Without Borders has partnered with tourism venture andBeyond, who moved rhinos from one of their private reserves to Botswana in 2011. In 2015, the charity will move 100 rhinos from South Africa -- which holds 80% of Africa's rhino population -- to Botswana, which has the lowest poaching rate in the continent. -- It's been a bad year for the African rhino, particularly for those that call South Africa home. "They won't be going in reserves near the borders either, because the president and the Botswana Defense Force don't want to attract poachers," explains Beverly Joubert.
