-- As I research my family history, preparing a book about my grandmother Madeleine Edison Sloane, "Edison's Daughter," I occasionally come across holiday pictures of Glenmont. Upon his winter visit to the Edison winter home in Florida, Seminole Lodge, he would have heralded news of unemployed former NASA scientists being scooped up by Florida's Lighting Science Group to advance initiatives in LED technology. Engineers sharing Edison's legacy are working on these better bulbs now—and with the advances in chemistry and materials since Edison's time—they're creating better lights and lower costs with more efficiency and far less pollution. Thomas Edison would have been the first to support technological advances, that's the real, obvious message of his 1,000-plus patents. Light and safety, and low cost, were all great features of Edison's light bulbs.
