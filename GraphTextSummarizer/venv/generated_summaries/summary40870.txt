Tsonga pulls out of New York Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, meanwhile, is skipping this year's U.S. Open because of the knee injury that forced him to retire at Wimbledon, he told his website. "You just got to keep moving with the times," said Williams, who missed the 2010 U.S. Open due to a foot injury. The United States Tennis Association said Thursday at a news conference in New York that tennis' largest stadium would benefit from a retractable roof as early as 2016, bringing the event in line with two other majors that already have cover -- the Australian Open and Wimbledon. -- Rain has played havoc with the U.S. Open in New York in recent years but two new retractable roofs mean the weather-related woes will soon be a thing of the past. The USTA has indeed for years looked into having a retractable roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium -- which seats 22,500 fans -- but it was thought the extra weight couldn't be supported.
