Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso said Tuesday the alleged gunman's wife had filed a rape complaint with police against Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center pastor Ronald Harris on September 25, two days before the shooting. He declined to release the report, saying it was part of the murder investigation against former church deacon Woodrow Karey. Witnesses told police that Karey walked into the Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center around 8:20 p.m. Friday and shot Harris twice -- the first time as Karey entered the church and then again at close range after Harris had fallen to the floor. " Karey fired his shotgun almost immediately, hitting a plant, Talisha Harris said. Days after the confrontation, Karey's wife filed the police report accusing the pastor of rape, Mancuso said.
