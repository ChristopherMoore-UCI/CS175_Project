In its statement, the FAA said companies from three other industries have filed similar appeals for exemptions to the federal ban on commercial drones: agriculture, power line and pipeline inspection, and oil and gas-line inspection. Companies would still have to apply individually for permission to use drones if the exemption is approved, the FAA said. Currently, there's only one exemption to the Federal Aviation Administration's nationwide ban on commercial drones, called unmanned aircraft systems or UAS. The U.S. government is considering a request from movie and TV producers to let them use unmanned aircraft to shoot aerial video. But one of the administration's key concerns is how to allow commercial drones without endangering airplanes and other existing, manned aircraft.
