" The U.K.'s Guardian found the effort to be lacking in coherence, but does believe it's a sound reminder of why "Jackson was once pop's premier genius, still cited by the likes of Pharrell Williams and Justin Timberlake," the review notes. Using an array of tracks that were worked on from 1983 to 1999, "Xscape" digs into Jackson's archives and updates the music to make it sound like a contemporary release. "Even with such dark subject matter, though, it's a joy to hear the joy in Jackson's voice." If you're a Michael Jackson fan, chances are you spent May 13 escaping with some of his new music. The artist died at 50 in 2009 and, as The New York Times points out in its review, a "contemporized" album such as "Xscape" can only do so much to sate a fan's desire to hear new music.
