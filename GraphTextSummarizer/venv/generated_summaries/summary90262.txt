Mandela, who is 91, played a key role in bringing the World Cup to South Africa but has made limited public appearances recently, although he did meet the South Africa squad last week. "We are sure that South Africans and people all over the world will stand in solidarity with Mr. Mandela and his family in the aftermath of this tragedy. The former leader had been expected to attend Friday's World Cup kickoff, his grandson Nkosi Mandela confirmed on Tuesday. -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela will not attend Friday's opening of the World Cup soccer tournament after the death of his great-grandchild in a car crash, a representative said. "It would therefore be inappropriate for him to personally attend the FIFA World Cup opening celebrations," said Sello Hatang, from the Mandela Foundation.
