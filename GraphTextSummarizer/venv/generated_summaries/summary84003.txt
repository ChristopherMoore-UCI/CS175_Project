Neil Armstrong: Celeb tributes on Twitter The $2.5 million indie, distributed by Rocky Mountain Pictures, has enjoyed increasing per theater averages over the last two weekends (read a more in-depth analysis about the film here), and although its per theater average decreased slightly from $7,365 to $5,718 this weekend (this was all but expected given the massive jump in theaters), it still notched the highest per theater average in the Top 20. Warner Bros.' $17 million horror entry "The Apparition" found just $3 million (enough for 12th place) despite the presence of two mega-franchise stars: "Twilight's" Ashley Greene and Harry Potter's Tom Felton. Focus Features' "ParaNorman" finished in third place with $8.6 million. Keep in mind that film had a major studio (Lionsgate) and marketing campaign behind it, and it opened in 868 theaters. Audiences issued the film a dismal "C+" CinemaScore grade.
