The bankruptcy filing did not affect Tully's Coffee online sales and wholesale business, which were purchased in 2009 by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. " Starbucks, however, cautioned that the final determination certifying the winning bid for Tully's will not occur until a bankruptcy hearing next week. "After a celebratory cup of Joe, we will immediately begin the transition of the company and implementing our vision for quality customer service and building the Tully's brand," Dempsey said in a statement released Thursday. According to Dempsey, Tully's Coffee operates 47 locations in Washington and California and has other franchises across the country. Dempsey's company, which said it beat out six other bidders, including Starbucks, will pay $9.15 million for Tully's.
