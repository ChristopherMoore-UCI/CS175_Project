All residents of the 12-unit building must be out by 5 p.m. PT Thursday, he told CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco, California. -- Tenants of apartments in Pacifica, California, were under evacuation Thursday after erosion  threatened the cliff on which their building sits, a city official said. Authorities have been watching the seaside building for years and were waiting for the erosion to reach a 12-foot safety zone behind it, said Doug Rider, a building official for Pacifica. Pacifica is about 15 miles southwest of San Francisco. The problem has reached that zone, he said, so officials notified the building's management and tenants began evacuating.
