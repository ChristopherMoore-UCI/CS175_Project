-- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday the appointment of the first woman parliamentarian in the chamber since that position was created in the 1930s. The soft-spoken and bookish Frumin gained Washington celebrity status in 2010 when he had to make a number of high-profile rulings related to the Senate's handling of President Barack Obama's health care bill. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky praised Frumin's smarts and his devotion to the Senate. Elizabeth MacDonough will replace retiring parliamentarian Alan Frumin. Frumin, who was the chief parliamentarian for the last 18 years, was "impartial to a fault," boasted Reid, D-Nevada.
