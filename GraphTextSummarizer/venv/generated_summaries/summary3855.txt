The super PAC American Crossroads argues in its campaign ad that Barack Obama is "too cool" to be president. Will we soon see ads claiming Obama is "too articulate" or in too good a shape to be president? Indeed, Rove's ad claims that "America got one cool president" but then cites statistics showing job losses for young people. Today it appears that being "cool" could be a bad thing, at least if you are running for president of the United States. So it appears that lack of cool does not equal fantastic president.
