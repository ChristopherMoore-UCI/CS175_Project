As often happens with car dealers, the advertised price was fiction. Credit unions and online banks tend to write car loans at about 1.5 percent lower than a traditional bank. For example, the credit union I am a member of is writing car loans for 3.90 percent right now. Cars are such a deal right now that you might feel you are stealing when you buy one. Add in the fact that manufacturers kept making cars in the fall when there were already no buyers, and that makes this the buyer's market of all time.
