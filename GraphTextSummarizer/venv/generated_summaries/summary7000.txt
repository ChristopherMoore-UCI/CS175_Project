-- Greece's top court ordered the government Monday to restart state broadcaster ERT, but only until it can set up a new media entity. To meet its commitments to its creditors -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- the Greek government must dismiss 2,000 people from the wider public sector by the end of the year and 15,000 by the end of 2014. The order partially overturns the government's controversial decision last week to take ERT off the air while it creates a smaller broadcaster with fewer staff as a budget-cutting move. ERT's TV channels and radio services were pulled off the air early Wednesday, although some employees have continued to broadcast via the Internet. The government's decision to suspend ERT led to protests and prompted the European Broadcast Union president to urge Greece to reconsider.
