U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning at the Yuchi Naval Base at Qingdao on Monday, becoming the first foreigner allowed on board. The Liaoning will be able to carry 30 J-15 fighter planes and will have a crew of 2,000, according to a People's Daily Online report published when it completed its first sea trials in August 2011. "The secretary was very pleased with his visit today aboard the carrier Liaoning," Pentagon Press Secretary Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement. Hagel's visit suggests that U.S. efforts to encourage greater U.S.-China military ties are bearing some fruit. The Secretary was impressed with the professionalism with the ship's officers and crew, Kirby added, and said that Hagel understood the significance of the PLA's granting of his request.
