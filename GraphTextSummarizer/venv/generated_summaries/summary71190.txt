High speed rail can play a major role in tackling climate change around the world -- if it's affordable, powered by clean energy and gets people out of their cars and off planes, we really will be speeding in the right direction. Over two thirds of the world's electricity comes from fossil fuels so until (or unless) power stations are weaned off fossil fuels, electric trains will still have a significant climate impact -- although rail travel is still better than flying or driving. Across the world governments are looking to high speed rail to provide fast, modern transport systems fit for the 21st century. But if governments want high speed rail to spearhead the drive towards a cleaner transport system they must look further than simply providing faster trains. So what's stopping high speed rail being a major part of a greener transport future in Britain?
