Delbert Belton was in the parking lot outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane on Wednesday night, waiting for a friend to pick him to go bowling, when the two teens robbed and assaulted him, leading to his death, police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said. Family says attack 'didn't seem real' Police found Belton prone in the parking lot, with the Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office determining he'd died Thursday of blunt facial and head injuries. According to the 42-year-old Denison, Belton never had problems outside the lodge before -- no threats, no altercations, nothing -- until Wednesday night. "But, if not, I can assure the community that he'll be in custody pretty quickly." 'A wonderful angel' A retired aluminum company worker who served in the Pacific arena, Belton took a bullet in the leg during the Battle of Okinawa, friends say. "Anybody that didn't get to know him missed out on a wonderful angel in their life." One who did was Ted Denison, who called himself "mechanic buddies" having worked on cars alongside Belton for over 20 years.
