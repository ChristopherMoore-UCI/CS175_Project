Ireland's low-cost airline Ryanair called Wednesday for the French government to get the French military, "if necessary," to take over air traffic control duties while civilian air traffic controllers are on strike. -- A strike by air-traffic controllers affected flights Wednesday across France, resulting in cancellations of 10 percent of scheduled flights from Paris' main international airport, the civil aviation authority DGAC said. FABEC is a cornerstone of the Single European Sky project, which advocates say will reduce fuel use and flight times by making it possible for planes to fly more direct routes across the continent. Controllers are striking over plans to unify European air traffic control. France is due to join Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to form what is being called Functional Airspace Block Europe Central (FABEC).
