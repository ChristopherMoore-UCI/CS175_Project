"Runaway" is Kanye's musical response to the Taylor Swift affair, but it's much more than that: a nine-minute meditation on romantic failure and public infamy. Katy Perry, "Teenage Dream" Co-written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, this buoyant electro-pop singalong is 2010's catchiest tune. Cee Lo Green, "F*** You" The title alone would have guaranteed hundreds of thousands of Web clicks. But Cee Lo didn't just say "F*** you" -- he said it with humor and serious panache. Sade, "Soldier of Love" Nobody knows where Sade disappears to for years at a time between hits, but "Soldier of Love" proves she knows how to make a hell of a re-entrance.
