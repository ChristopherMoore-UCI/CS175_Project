Rwanda and Congo traditionally have been on different sides of the ongoing conflict in eastern Congo, which pits ethnic Tutsis supported by Rwanda against Congo-backed ethnic Hutus. The arrest could cause the estimated 1,500 rebel soldiers still loyal to Nkunda to join government forces and put a halt to most of the fighting in eastern Congo, said Mounoubai. A scathing report by a U.N. Security Council panel last month said that Rwanda and Congo are, in effect, fighting a brutal proxy war for territory and precious natural resources in eastern Congo, and all parties involved in the conflict are using execution, rape and child soldiers as tools of war. Renewed fighting broke out in eastern Congo at the end of August between rebels under the command of Nkunda and government forces. Congolese forces first tried to capture the Tutsi rebel leader late Thursday evening near Bunagana, a village in eastern Congo.
