A significant minority in the medical profession continue to believe people with dead brains and beating hearts are still alive. It is not a vegetative state -- it is absence of brain activity, and constitutes a legal measure of death in all states. Just like it is not illegal to provide medical support for dead people, it is not necessarily illegal to stop life-support on someone who is still alive. Others take a position more liberal than the standard law that defines brain death. We need to have a default public policy -- the brain-based definition currently in law -- but people like Jahi's parents should have the option to record their conscientiously held positions and allow pronouncements of death to be based on those beliefs.
