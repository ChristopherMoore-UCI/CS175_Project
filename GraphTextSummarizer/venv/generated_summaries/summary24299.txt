An analysis by the CDC showed at least 30 of the Kansas City children tested positive for EV-D68, Missouri health officials said. The virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital, where about 15% of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, officials said. "Why one virus or another crops up in one part of the country or another part of the country from one year to the next is inexplicable," said William Schaffner, head of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University. A respiratory virus that has sent hundreds of children to hospitals in Missouri is causing alarm across the Midwest and beyond. Many of the EV-D68 infections "will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment," the Missouri health agency said.
