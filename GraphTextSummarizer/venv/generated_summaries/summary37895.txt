-- Libyan militia members have apparently turned the abandoned U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, into a water park, judging by amateur video posted to YouTube on Sunday. But Jones said "the U.S. Embassy Tripoli chancery & compound is now being safeguarded and has not been ransacked," and "those who have actually visited the embassy know the truth." Many homes in parts of Tripoli have been looted by and ransacked by different militia groups during the fighting, including as recently as last week, the home of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni." "The fighting in Tripoli that erupted between militias in July and lasted for weeks was described by Libyan officials as 'unprecedented.' U.S diplomats evacuated Tripoli last month amidst heavy militia violence.
