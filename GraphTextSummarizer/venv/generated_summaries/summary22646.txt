Griego told investigators he hoped to end his spree "at a Walmart, with mass destruction," Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston told reporters. Griego told investigators he was "frustrated with his mother," but "he did not articulate that to our investigators any further or give any explanation of that at all," Houston said. The killings had begun about four hours earlier, when Nehemiah Griego shot and killed his mother, Sarah Griego, while she slept. Houston said the arrest came after Griego went to the family's church with his girlfriend, to whom he had sent a picture of his slain mother, and a staff member called deputies. After the slayings, Griego "spent the majority of the day with his girlfriend," whose conduct remains a focus of the investigation, Houston said.
