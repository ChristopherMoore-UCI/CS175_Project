-- Seven NATO troops died after attacks in Afghanistan on Sunday, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. Another ISAF service member died following an improvised explosive device attack in southern Afghanistan, ISAF said Sunday, after earlier announcing the death of another servicemember in an IED attack in the southern part of the country. But the British defense ministry said in a statement Sunday that one of its soldiers died Sunday in southern Afghanistan. The soldier was part of a security patrol, Task Force Helmand spokesman Lt. Col. David Eastman said in a statement. Sunday marked the deadliest day for NATO forces in Afghanistan since October 14, when 7 NATO troops were killed.
