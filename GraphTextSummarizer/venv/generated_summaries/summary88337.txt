Many Falkland Island residents are of British origin. British officials have rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the people of the Falkland Islands have chosen to be British and "have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N. Charter." The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British Overseas Territories and have been under British rule since 1833. More than 99% of voters said yes, according to Darren Christie, public relations manager for the Falklands Islands government. A parade honoring British heritage marked the start of voting Sunday.
