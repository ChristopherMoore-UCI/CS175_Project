"The Vice President apologized for any implication that Turkey or other Allies and partners in the region had intentionally supplied or facilitated the growth of ISIL or other violent extremists in Syria," Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said. -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden apologized to Turkey's leader on Saturday for saying that President Recep Erdogan admitted his country had made mistakes allowing foreign fighters to cross into Syria. The problem appears to have originated during a question-and-answer session following a speech this week at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University when Biden was asked about Turkey and the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State terror group, known as ISIS or ISIL. While Biden is known for making blunt statements that sometimes embarrass the administration, Turkey is particularly sensitive to allegations of allowing terrorists to cross its border into Syria. The issue has arisen at a sensitive time, with Turkey's government authorizing the use of military force against terror groups, including ISIS as its fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border.
