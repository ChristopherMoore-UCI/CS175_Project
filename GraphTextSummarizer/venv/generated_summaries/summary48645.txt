The ICC said they would not comment on the case featuring three Pakistan players -- Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif -- who are currently suspended after claims of spot-fixing during the Test series with England, but they did maintain their determination to clean up the game. The ICC also said its Pakistan Task Team will work with the PCB to "carry out any reforms which may be deemed necessary to restore confidence in the administration of the game in Pakistan." -- The International Cricket Council has pointed to a lack of "compelling evidence" to support match-fixing claims relating to a one-day match between England and Pakistan in September. Butt later withdrew his comments after the England team threatened to take legal action against him. British newspaper The Sun claimed it had proof that bookmakers knew details of scoring patterns in Pakistan's innings before the match at The Oval in London began.
