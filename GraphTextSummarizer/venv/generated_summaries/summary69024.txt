-- House Democratic leaders are putting together a second economic stimulus package that could cost as much as $150 billion, according to Democratic leadership aides. These aides indicated that in addition to aid to states struggling with their budgets, the package could include things similar to what the House passed before, such as infrastructure money, an extension of unemployment benefits, food stamps and more money for low-income energy assistance. House Republican leadership aides said that GOP members have not been consulted on the details of a second stimulus. Pelosi and other House Democratic leaders are scheduled to meet Monday with a group of economists in Washington to discuss the size and components of a stimulus plan, the Democratic aides said. Before Congress recessed last week for the election, the House of Representatives passed economic aid measures totaling $61 billion to fund infrastructure projects, money for states' Medicaid costs, and unemployment assistance.
