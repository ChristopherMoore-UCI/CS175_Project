About 150 supporters of the royal family tried to get onto Bahrain University campus during the protest there, but only some managed to get in. -- Supporters of the rulers of Bahrain threatened about 5,000 university students protesting against the government at Bahrain University Sunday, eyewitnesses said. The government said attempts by uniformed police officers to persuade the protesters to re-open the road reached an impasse and that a group of protesters attacked unarmed police officers, resulting in one police officer being stabbed and another sustaining a serious head injury. Bahrain, which sits in the Persian Gulf and is the base of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, has been wracked by anti-government protests since mid-February. Many protesters mobilized to block off King Faisal highway to prevent the pro-regime groups from entering Bahrain's main island.
