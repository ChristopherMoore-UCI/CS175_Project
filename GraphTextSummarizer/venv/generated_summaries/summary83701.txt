-- A man shot this month when a gunman opened fire inside a busy Toronto shopping mall died as a result of his injuries Monday, raising the death toll from that shooting to two, police said. Gunfire started around 6:25 p.m. that day, as people were eating dinner in the crowded food court area of the Eaton Centre mall in downtown Toronto. The name of the second victim, a 22-year-old man, cannot be released because of a court-ordered publication ban, Toronto police said in a statement. Husbands, 23, was supposed to be under house arrest when police say he went to the mall and opened fire. He faces one count of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder, according to police.
