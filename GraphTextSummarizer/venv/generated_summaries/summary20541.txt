If Vatican II opened the windows for the spring air to come in, the papacy of Pope Francis opens the doors for the church and her pastors to go out -- and here I would like to quote from his homily to priests on Holy Thursday: "May (Jesus) renew his Spirit in our hearts, that this anointing may spread to everyone, even to those 'outskirts' where our faithful people most look for it and most appreciate it." One thought immediately came to my mind: It has been a year since the election of Pope Francis. Opinion: Why Pope Francis is so shocking That evening was auspicious. The "Pope Francis effect" I took advantage of this privilege that I am in Rome to follow closely what this new pope has to say and what he does. The spring evening in which Pope Francis was elected is an apt symbol of the beginning of his papacy and the years that will follow.
