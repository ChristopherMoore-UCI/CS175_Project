-- A man was gunned down Thursday in front of children at an elementary school as they were leaving for the day, local officials and witnesses told CNN. Juarez saw a decline in the number of homicides in 2011, but is still considered to be a flashpoint in Mexico's drug cartel-related violence. On Wednesday, the Mexican Attorney General's Office (PGR) said Juarez led the nation in homicides between January and September 2011, with a total of 1,206. In the first nine months of 2011 there were 12,903 homicides in Mexico, according to official statistics. Witnesses said one attacker shot the victim inside the school next to a basketball court, while another attacker stood outside.
