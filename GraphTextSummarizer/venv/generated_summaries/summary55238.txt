-- For months, Republicans derisively doubted if U.S. President Barack Obama was a true friend of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, questioning if Americans should re-elect someone who might not be on the same page with the long-time U.S. ally. In a statement congratulating Obama, Netanyahu said, "The security relationship between the United States and Israel is rock solid, and I look forward to working with President Obama to further strengthen this relationship." The White House later said no request had been made, and within hours of the story breaking, Obama called the prime minister and said the two countries maintain "close cooperation on Iran and other security issues." The Obama administration has stressed repeatedly that it is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with Israel. Despite sometimes blistering attacks over where his administration stands on Israel and against Iran's nuclear program, Obama this week emerged victorious in the U.S. presidential election. For months, Republicans hammered Obama, claiming he hadn't been a loyal enough friend to Netanyahu or tough enough on Iran.
