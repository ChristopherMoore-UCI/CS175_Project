Lyndon Johnson picked up one of his beagles by the ears, and heard dog lovers howl from coast to coast. Republicans have counterattacked by pointing out that President Obama wrote in his own book about eating dog as a child, helping the dog fight become a theme at this year's White House Correspondents Association dinner. In addition to dogs and horses, Roosevelt had parrots, ponies, bears, a zebra, snakes, lizards, and for reasons lost to time, a one-legged chicken. "Presidents and their pets have a long and storied history," says Garrett Graff, a goldfish owner and editor-in-chief at Washingtonian magazine. Ever since George Washington took office with horses and hounds in tow, presidents have welcomed animals into their lives.
