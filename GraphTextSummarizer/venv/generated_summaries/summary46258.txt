The 179th-ranked Evans didn't only beat Nishikori -- he won in straight sets 6-4 6-4 6-2. Now a third member of the U.S.'s older generation, James Blake -- like Williams 33 -- said Monday in an emotional news conference he would quit following the U.S. Open. And if he indeed gets to the round of 64, he will find qualifier Dan Evans alongside him. Nadal missed last year's U.S. Open due to knee troubles. Evans became the first men's player outside the top 150 in the world rankings to defeat a top-15 rival at the U.S. Open in six years when he dispatched Japan's Kei Nishikori.
