Making cameo appearances are CNN contributor Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker; Virginia's Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine; Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis; DC Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton; Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser; and to press the point, a losing presidential hopeful from each party, Democrat Howard Dean and Republican Bob Dole. Jim Messina, who ran the president's re-election, and Matt Rhoades, a veteran of the Romney operation, are working behind the scenes of Washington's bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. After duking it out in 2012's often nasty presidential race, the campaign managers for Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama have joined forces. The duo's specific project -- a small part of the overall mission -- is to convince the U.S. Olympic Committee, that yes, sometimes both parties can come together for a common purpose, and that Washington is not just a hotbed of partisan warfare all of the time. To make the case, the Washington bid's team put together this video, posted online Tuesday featuring a bipartisan cast.
