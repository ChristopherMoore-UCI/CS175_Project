-- American athletes are being warned not to wear their Olympic uniforms outside of the upcoming Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, where they will be under the watchful eye of U.S. security officials who will attend events with them, State Department officials said Friday. The officials did not say how many U.S. security officials would be on the ground with the U.S. Olympic team in Sochi, but the number is likely to be considerable given there are more than 230 athletes and 270 coaches and other U.S. officials. That doesn't take into account the roughly 10,000 U.S. citizens, according to State Department estimates, who are expected to attend the Games as spectators. State Department security personnel will be accompanying athletes to every single event, every single venue. "If you are an American Olympic athlete, you don't want to advertise that far outside the Olympic venues," another senior State Department official, speaking on background, told reporters during a briefing.
