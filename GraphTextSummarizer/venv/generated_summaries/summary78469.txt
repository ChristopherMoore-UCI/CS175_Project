A newly distributed ISIS release appears to show the decapitated body of captive Japanese journalist Kenji Goto, after an English-language lecture is given by masked ISIS member "Jihadi John" to the people of Japan. A video file posted online a week ago by a known ISIS supporter shows an image of Goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow captive, Haruna Yukawa. New questions raised about 'Jihadi John' The fate of a Jordanian pilot captured by ISIS in Syria, Moath al-Kasasbeh, was unclear. If there was no swap, ISIS said it would kill al-Kaseasbeh first, then Goto. Goto would be the second Japanese hostage to be killed by ISIS recently.
