Civil defense authorities in Buenos Aires advised residents to remain indoors with windows and doors shut as a cloud emanated from a container fire at the city's port. -- A foul-smelling cloud wound its way through Argentina's capital Thursday, but it was not toxic as initially feared, officials said. The container held sodium bicarbonate and posed little risk to the population, the country's security secretary, Sergio Berni, said. Nonetheless, the cloud was enough to disrupt the subway system in Argentina's largest city. The smelly cloud and reports that the burning container had chemicals inside caused alarm throughout the capital.
