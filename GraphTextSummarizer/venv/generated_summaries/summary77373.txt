Another method of creating a candidate virus also mixes wild virus with a second, fast-growing strain, but instead of growing them in eggs, lets the viruses mingle in a special solution while scientists manipulate them through a complex technique called reverse genetics. The CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have also created a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu, also known as 2009 H1N1, using reverse genetics, he said. -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu from one institution Friday, spokesman Thomas Skinner said in an e-mail. (That's NYMC as in "New York Medical Center;" it's a hybrid of an H3N2 seasonal virus and the so-called "Puerto Rico strain," A/PR/8/34, that's used to speed the growth of seasonal flu vaccine). Once that happens, vaccine makers will tweak the virus and have "pilot lots" of vaccine ready to be tested by mid- to late June.
