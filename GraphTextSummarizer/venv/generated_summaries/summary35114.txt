The United States finds intervention in Bahrain by the Persian Gulf kingdom's neighbors "alarming" and wants all players in the region to keep "their own agenda" out of the struggle between the monarchy and anti-government demonstrators, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday. At the White House, U.S. President Barack Obama called both Hamad and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to express his "deep concern over violence" and the need for "maximum restraint," according to White House spokesman Jay Carney. Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency Tuesday and launched a crackdown on anti-government protesters Wednesday, according to witnesses in the capital, Manama. "There are clearly other agendas are at work, but the only agenda that should matter is the future of the people of Bahrain," she said. Clinton said, "There is no room for anyone to be pursuing their own agenda in Bahrain, no matter who it is.
