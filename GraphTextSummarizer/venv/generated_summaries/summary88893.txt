"We have cautioned consumers that they should know what type of columbarium they are buying," says Hong Kong Health Secretary York Chow, whose department has published an A-list of legal operators and a B-list of operators who will need to apply for a government license. According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, 42,200 people died in Hong Kong last year -- an average the department says will only increase over the coming decades as Hong Kong's population ages. "I don't blame these private operators at all," Yu says from his shop in Hong Kong's Hum Hong district. " Hong Kong, however, is moving to control the industry. The government has canvassed alternatives such as constructing a large central columbarium on an outlying island off Hong Kong, and even flirted with the idea of importing Japanese technology for a mechanized facility.
