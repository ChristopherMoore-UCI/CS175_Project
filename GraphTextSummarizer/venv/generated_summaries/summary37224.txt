We were just aiming for a top-eight finish to secure me a spot for next year, because I didn't really want to be one of those riders that gets a wildcard every year."

I can do Germany on a Wednesday or Denmark or Czech Republic on a Wednesday if I wanted to, but you can do too much." Despite his Australian upbringing, Woffinden has been named captain of Britain's Grand Prix team this season, which kicked off domestically this month.

"They say your body's a temple, so why not decorate the walls," says Woffinden, who looks like any alternative skater kid with his backwards cap, skinny black jeans and gaping gauge earrings.
