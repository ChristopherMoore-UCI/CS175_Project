City slickers Chelsea's main challenge looks set to come from Manchester City which breezed to victory at Sunderland, a place where it has struggled in the past. City, 4-1 winners at Sunderland courtesy of another couple of goals from the irrepressible Sergio Aguero, are still in the hunt, but there is something about this Chelsea side which makes it look so imperious. A 3-0 victory over London rival Tottenham was achieved with minimum fuss and the usual efficiency as Chelsea recovered from the surprise of only managing a goalless draw at Sunderland last weekend. Spurs will not be the last team to be given a beating by Chelsea this season, this was the 11th time Mourinho's side have tasted success in 14 league games. Now, 10 years later, there is a feeling that a new generation of invincible players are ready to emerge -- and they are wearing the blue of Chelsea.
