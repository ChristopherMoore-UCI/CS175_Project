The subjects of this tracking -- who are unaware that their anonymity has been stripped -- include people who use online pseudonyms to discuss sensitive topics, such as mental illness or medical conditions. For instance, Choicepoint has 35 contracts with government agencies, including the Department of Justice, and through it, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, IRS and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. It is the one that, since 2000, has banned the selling of medical records, previously used by mortgage companies to call in loans of those who got cancer, or by employers in their hiring decisions. Beyond tracking and surveillance, select corporations keep dossiers on any crimes you have committed, any divorces, political leanings, the gender and age of any children in the household, as well as interests in topics including religion, the Bible, gambling and adult entertainment. However, some companies have developed software to match pseudonyms used on message boards and blogs with real names and personal e-mail addresses.
