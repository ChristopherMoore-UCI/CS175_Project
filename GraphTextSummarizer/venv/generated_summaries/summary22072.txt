The English language Yemen Post reported Wednesday that, according to local sources from Sa'ada, "army forces and fighter aircrafts launched a massive attack on Houthi leader Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi's headquarters in Saada province." Thursday, citing official sources, Yemen Post reported that, over a five-year period of sporadic battles between Yemeni forces and Houthi rebels, over 1,000 government soldiers have died and over 6,000 have been injured. The announcement of cease-fire conditions by Yemen's Supreme Security Committee comes only days after Yemeni forces began an offensive against the Houthi rebels in the northern mountainous province of Saada, which is on the Yemeni border with Saudi Arabia. However, Yemen's news agency later reported Houthi rebels accused drug cartels of abducting the group and killing the three. According to Yemen Post, "it is said that thousands of civilians and Houthi's followers died in the same period, but the real number is unspecified." Yemen's government and Houthi rebels have been involved in intermittent fighting since 2004. -- Yemen's government has laid out ceasefire terms to Houthi Shiite rebels fighting in the country's north, Yemen's official news agency reported Thursday.
