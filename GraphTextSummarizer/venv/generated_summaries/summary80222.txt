"If you know anything about migraines, as I do, "says Mosgrave, " you know there's a connection to a lot of different problems. Although there are different forms of complex migraines, all occur when blood vessels over dilate, when there's a decrease of blood flowing to the brain, or when the trigeminal nerve, found in the brain and responsible for sensation in the face, becomes irritated.
