The condition of the three crew members on the Twin Otter operated by Calgary-based Kenn Borek Air Ltd. was not known nearly three days after the flight went missing and rescue attempts began. The plane was flying from the South Pole to an Italian base at Terra Nova Bay, Maritime New Zealand said. "It is difficult to think of a more difficult environment," said Steve Rendle, spokesman for Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand. "Common sense would dictate you stay with the beacon." Kenn Borek Air Ltd. did not immediately return a message left by CNN on Friday night. Peter West, spokesman for the National Science Foundation, which oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, said 24 hours of daylight this time of year should help rescue efforts.
