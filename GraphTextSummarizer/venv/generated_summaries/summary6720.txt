Partial totals of what was spent so far show that between the candidate, his party and well-heeled outside groups, the "Red Team" spent more money on the effort to elect Republican Mitt Romney than the "Blue Team" did to re-elect President Barack Obama, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that monitors the influence of money on politics. Combined, the candidate, the national party, and outside spending groups, like conservative issue-oriented nonprofits and super PACs, had spent more than $1 billion on Romney's effort. Business group blows $29 million on election losers "I'd be surprised if he left anything in the bank," said Bill Allison, editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for greater government transparency. The liberal version of that combination of groups spent about $96 million less on the Obama re-election. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that outside groups spent some $1.3 billion and counting on the election.
