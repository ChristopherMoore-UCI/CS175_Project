The 1909 card of Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop Honus Wagner -- one of only about 50 in existence -- was auctioned off by Goldin Auctions in West Berlin, New Jersey. It's garnered such a place in baseball history that it has its own plaque at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The buyer chose to remain anonymous after the successful bid, but Ken Goldin, owner of Goldin Auctions, told CNN he is "best described as a wealthy individual investor and a baseball fan." The card was released as Wagner was on his way to winning his seventh batting title and about to lead the Pirates to their first World Series win. The final bid for a trading card that the National Baseball Hall of Fame calls "the Holy Grail" topped $2.1 million -- the highest price ever paid for a baseball card in a public auction.
