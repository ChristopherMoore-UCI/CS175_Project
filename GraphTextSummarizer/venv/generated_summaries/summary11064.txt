Vice President Joe Biden told Suleiman on Tuesday that Egypt needed "immediate, irreversible progress" toward meeting protesters' demands, and leading opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei said Suleiman and Mubarak "are twins." Suleiman quickly became the face of the government's reform pledges, announcing talks with opposition leaders and promising swift reforms. After a day of intense speculation, Mubarak repeated that he would remain in office to serve out his term -- but he announced that he was delegating power to Suleiman, who quickly urged Egyptians to go home and get back to work. "We call upon you to unite, and to think rationally and to look forward to the future," Suleiman said in a televised speech that followed Mubarak's. And in Alexandria, protesters met the announcement with chants of "No to Mubarak, no to Suleiman."
