Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west. -- Heavy flooding in central Mexico in the past week has killed at least 33 people and left thousands homeless, the government said Monday. Another 83 people still were missing Monday in Michoacan, a state in western coastal Mexico that has been beset by drug violence in the past few years. On Sunday, Mexican President Felipe Calderon toured Valle de Chalco, a city in Mexico state. A mudslide Saturday killed at least 11 people near the small town of Temascaltepec, in neighboring Mexico state.
