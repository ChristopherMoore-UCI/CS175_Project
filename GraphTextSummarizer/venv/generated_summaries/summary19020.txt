First lady will set the tone for the convention with Tuesday speech Americans should pay close attention to Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as he details Obama's foreign policy record. Finally, to see behind the president's cool exterior and better understand him as a man, husband and father, Americans can watch first lady Michelle Obama speak on behalf of the man she loves. Kerry's chairmanship, his record as a decorated war hero, and his long-time involvement in American foreign policy mean that his perspective carries tremendous weight. Actually, she'll explain how President Obama has kept alive the dream fought for by her father and uncles. Although we can expect each speaker to explain every reason to re-elect Obama, we can look to certain ones to speak on specific issues with authority, experience and passion.
