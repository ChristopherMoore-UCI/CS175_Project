The recyclable golf ball: Every club player will be familiar with the age-old problem of losing golf balls -- but what happens to the collection of wayward balls once the search is over? "We're also developing our first prototype putter made entirely from recycled crushed golf balls," said company owner Mike Carey. The design has proved so popular that golf clubs such as the Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course in Hong Kong and Sebonack Golf Club in the United States have recently converted entire fleets to use the power of the sun. -- In these eco-conscious times, there are few areas of life that have not been touched by the drive to go green, and golf is no exception. By recharging itself throughout the day, the cart can work in drizzly and damp conditions -- which could be good news for golf lovers in rain-soaked Britain and sun-baked Abu Dhabi alike.
