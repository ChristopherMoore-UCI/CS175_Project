Extended family usually takes orphans in, but fear has broken the chain, said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF's regional director. UNICEF is working on safely treating children who are sick. For every Ebola grave, there is roughly one child who lost a parent in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 2,500 survivors will get lessons on providing care to children quarantined in treatment centers. As Ebola killed parents, the fear of contact with orphaned children spread, even after they persistently showed no symptoms.
