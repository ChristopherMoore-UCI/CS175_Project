Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has postponed a meeting with the opposition light of the crash, his spokeswoman Natalya Timakova said. Specialists from France, Canada and Great Britain will take part in the crash investigation, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, citing the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee. Dozens of Yaroslavl Lokomotiv professional hockey players died in that crash, including several former National Hockey League players. "Malfunction and pilot's error are considered to be the most likely causes," Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Russian Investigation Committee, told the Itar-Tass news agency. Only one person survived the crash, which investigators found was caused by pilot error, RIA-Novosti reported.
