Two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot, who were serving two-year jail terms for their part in a performance critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, have been released from prison. The release was approved last week when Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law announced by Putin. She said Monday that she is eager to help Russian prisoners by calling attention to conditions they face. Pussy Riot's 2012 performance of a "punk prayer" that criticized Putin, who was prime minister at the time, was held at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have young children and therefore qualified for the amnesty, Russian media reported.
