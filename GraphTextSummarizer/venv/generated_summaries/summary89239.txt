-- A bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington State voted Wednesday in favor of a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, putting Washington on the path toward becoming the seventh state in the nation to legalize marriage for gay and lesbian couples. "With today's vote, we tell the nation that Washington state will no longer deny our citizens the opportunity to marry the person they love," said Gov. Chris Gregoire, a Demorcrat who has vowed to sign it. "Like thousands of other same-sex couples, my partner Eric and I are very grateful for these protections that the law now provide," said state Rep. Jamie Pedersen, a Democrat, moments before the vote. Similar battles have unfolded in Maryland, where same-sex marriage opponents have pressed for referendums to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their state houses. The benefits of same-sex marriage translate into benefits for the larger community, said Zepatos, citing one study that predicted $88 million in additional spending would occur in Washington once the practice becomes legal.
