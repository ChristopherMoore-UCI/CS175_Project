Parts of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma are under excessive heat warnings until the end of the week, the National Weather Service said Monday. To avoid heat stroke or heat exhaustion, the National Weather Service advises people to drink plenty of fluids, stay in air-conditioned rooms and check on neighbors and the elderly. Those areas -- including Wichita, Topeka and Goodland, Kansas; St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield and Pleasant Hill, Missouri; and Tulsa, Oklahoma -- should experience heat indices between 105 and 110 degrees on most days, the weather service said. Parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina and Texas are under heat advisories for the remainder of the week as well, according to the service. Nationally, more than 20 heat-related deaths were reported last week.
