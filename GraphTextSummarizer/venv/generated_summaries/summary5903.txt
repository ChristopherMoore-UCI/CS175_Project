On Sunday, a man in a subdivision in Superior discovered Jessica's backpack outside his house about 7 miles from the girl's hometown of Westminster, said Westminster Police Investigator Trevor Materasso. Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk told reporters that a body found earlier this week "has been positively identified" as that of Jessica Ridgeway. As of Friday, authorities had searched more than 500 homes and 1,000 vehicles, responded to more than 1,500 tips and "covered thoroughly more than 800 leads," said Jim Yacone, special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver office. A body -- which was "not intact," according to police -- was found Wednesday at a park in Arvada, a Denver suburb just five miles from Westminster. "Our focus has changed from a search for Jessica to a mission of justice for Jessica," Birk said.
