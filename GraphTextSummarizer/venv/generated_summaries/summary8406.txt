According to Kerri Kasem, about three months ago, her stepmother, Jean Kasem, suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him. Asked about accusations that her family was trying to become beneficiaries of Kasem's will, Kerri Kasem told CNN that wasn't the case. Los Angeles TV station KABC reported that Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem's Holmby Hills house on Tuesday. "I don't get it, I don't understand it," Kerri Kasem, who co-hosts the radio show "Sixx Sense" with Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx, told CNN. Casey Kasem, known for his years hosting the countdown shows "American Top 40" and "Casey's Top 40," is suffering from Parkinson's disease.
