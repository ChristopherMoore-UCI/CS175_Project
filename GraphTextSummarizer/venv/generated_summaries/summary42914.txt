Mazursky was known for his compassionate touch as a writer and director, guiding such performers as Dyan Cannon (1969's "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"), Art Carney (1974's "Harry and Tonto") and Jill Clayburgh (1978's "An Unmarried Woman") to Academy Award nominations for acting. In a 1977 interview with Film Comment, Mazursky said that studios would have preferred him to make films for more money and with bigger stars, but he followed his gut, opted for a lower budget and went with character actor types over movie stars. He made frequent appearances in his own films and was an often wise-cracking presence in other works, including "The Sopranos," in which he played a card dealer friend of Junior Soprano, and "Curb Your Enthusiasm," in which he played Norm, an assistant of Mel Brooks. In real life, Brooks and Mazursky were close friends. When Mazursky received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame late last year, Brooks said, "If he were gay, and I were gay, I think we would hang out together.
