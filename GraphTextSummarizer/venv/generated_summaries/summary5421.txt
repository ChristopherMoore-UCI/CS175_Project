The 36-year-old Ponting stood down as skipper of Australia's Test and one-day teams on Tuesday following last week's World Cup quarterfinal exit, but will continue as a batsman after being named in the 14-man squad to tour Bangladesh next month. Ponting was one of the most successful captains in modern cricket, having led Australia to victory at the 2003 and 2007 World Cups before last week's defeat by India. -- Australia's new captain Michael Clarke admits that he will have to earn the respect of the nation's cricket fans after being confirmed as the successor to Ricky Ponting on Wednesday. Clarke, who turns 30 on Sunday, said he was happy to have Ponting in the team for the short trip to Bangladesh, which comprises three one-day internationals in Dhaka from April 9-13. People are always going to have their own views, but for me it's about respect.
