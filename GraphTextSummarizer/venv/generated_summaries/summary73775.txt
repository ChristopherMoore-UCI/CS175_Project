In a bid to jump start the year's governing — and exploit momentum following the raft of late-2014 executive actions — Obama next week will start a three-week preview period for his late-January State of the Union address. On areas like tax reform and trade, Obama has said he's open to working with Republicans, who made major gains in November's elections and now control the Senate. "We certainly hope they work with Congress instead of continuing to campaign against it," said Don Stewart, a spokesman for the incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. His weeks-long stay in Hawaii largely uninterrupted by major news, President Barack Obama flies back to a redrawn Washington late Saturday prepared for a renewed economic push he hopes will set up a productive final presidential quarter. Areas of compromise exist: both Republicans and Obama say they're interested in overhauling the corporate tax structure and pushing through major trade deals with Europe and Asia.
