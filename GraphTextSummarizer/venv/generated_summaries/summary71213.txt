Prosecutor: Whitey Bulger 'deserves no mercy,' should get life sentence Bulger didn't testify at his trial, complaining the proceedings were "a sham." " Theresa Bond, the daughter of Arthur "Bucky" Barrett, who went missing in 1983 after a dispute with Bulger, politely asked, "Mr. Bulger, could you please look at me?" After he fled, investigators learned that the longtime head of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang had been an FBI informant and that Bulger's FBI handler had not only tipped him off to the charges, but also gave up another informant, who was later killed.

On Wednesday, Casper ruled -- despite the objections of Bulger's attorneys -- that the families of all 19 people killed by him or his associates would deliver victim impact statements.
