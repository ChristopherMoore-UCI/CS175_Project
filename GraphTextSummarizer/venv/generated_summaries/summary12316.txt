-- Lone wolf terror attacks remain a significant threat within the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Sunday, and could occur without warning. Johnson added that, while the U.S. government has largely been successful in disrupting plots hatched by terrorist cells abroad, catching individuals who are not formally connected requires them to take a different tactic -- relying heavily on state and local law enforcement. "We have to be vigilant against an independent actor here in the homeland who might choose to strike at any moment," Johnson told CNN's Barbara Starr in an interview at the Reagan National Defense Forum Sunday. The Department of Homeland Security is also turning to religious and community organizations in its fight against extremism, Johnson said. But Johnson's concerns show how challenging counter-terrorism has become.
