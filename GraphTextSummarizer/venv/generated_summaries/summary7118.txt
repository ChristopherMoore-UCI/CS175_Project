"One of the most important things about Radio Flyer products is that they really help [keep kids active outdoors]," Schlegel said. Since then, Radio Flyer has become perhaps the world's most famous maker of wagons, tricycles and other toys. "Radio Flyer survived the Great Depression, and this year has been a difficult year for a lot of companies," Schlegel says, "But Radio Flyer is actually growing this year. Radio Flyer is developing a prototype of a wagon with digital controls and an MP3 player dock. "Music is such an important part of kids' and families' lives, we thought it would be great to have a speaker system built in the wagon," said Tom Schlegel, vice president of product development.
