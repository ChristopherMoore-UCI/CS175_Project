"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can tap into," said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that alert the watch when you've eaten too much. An Apple watch could leap frog the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform, not another accessory. Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely.
