As PIN numbers and passwords prove redundant in protecting data, tech companies are looking to convert bodily features into secure identity authenticators. A future filled with devices that automatically recognize who you are may seem a bit daunting, however, as hackers become more successful in accessing personal information, these smart devices look to save users a lot of hassle. This new world of smart devices and the "Internet of Things" is a far cry from the past where anti-virus applications were the only way to keep hackers out. Bionym, the Toronto-based biometrics technology company, have introduced The Nymi -- a wristband that measures heartbeats to authenticate identity. "You leave your fingerprints everywhere - you actually leave this impression which can be copied," said Karl Martin, CEO and founder of Bionym.
