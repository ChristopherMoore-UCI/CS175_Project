The announcement follows a comment by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that recent militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power, in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. Al-Maliki's statements about the need for air support came as American and Arab diplomats told CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the militant group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. -- Five Russian Sukhoi fighter jets have arrived in Iraq, the first of 25 warplanes expected to be delivered under a contract between Moscow and Baghdad, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said in a statement.
