The Thai government says the Hmong at the Huay Nam Khao Camp in Petchabun province in the north had left Laos not for fear of persecution but for financial reasons. Many Hmong sided with the United States during the Vietnam War when the conflict spread to Laos. -- Thailand deported about 450 Hmong refugees to Laos Monday and plans on evicting 3,900 more from a refugee camp, the government said. The U.S. State Department said Monday that the Thai government had determined that many of the Hmong were in need of protection, and that such returns would "imperil the well-being of many individuals." On Monday, the Thai army put 448 Hmong on buses that were headed for Laos.
