The work in Washington state communities shattered by a landslide in late March has turned its focus from searching for missing bodies to a rebuilding operation, a spokeswoman for the Snohomish County Sheriff's Department said Monday. Frank Hadaway told CNN affiliate KCPQ that he has peace even though his brother's body may never be found. "We are looking at recovery and rebuilding," Ireton said, referring to clearing and repairing roads damaged or covered by the slide. Two people remain missing, but "essentially the active search has ended," Shari Ireton told CNN. Search crews had been digging through deep mud and debris, which is 70 feet thick in some places, to search for the missing.
