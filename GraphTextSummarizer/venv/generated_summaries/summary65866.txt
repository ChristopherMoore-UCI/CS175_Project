Despite the cold shoulder from neighboring countries, Franco said he would reach out to explain the legality of Lugo's ouster and seek good relations with other countries. Lugo went from president to ousted leader in less than 48 hours. The next day, Lugo's defense team had two hours to defend Lugo from what it called vague charges of incompetence. Franco reiterated that the impeachment happened within the parameters of the constitution, and pointed to the large margins by which Lugo was voted out of office. That changed on June 15, when the police clashed with landless peasants in eastern Paraguay, resulting in 17 deaths.
