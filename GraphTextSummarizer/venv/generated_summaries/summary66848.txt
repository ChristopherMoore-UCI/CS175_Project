Verilli argued  that California law provided same sex couples registered as domestic partners all the legal incidents of marriage, but denied them the "designation of marriage." In February 2013, the administration filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of couples challenging California's ban on same sex marriage. Calling state bans on same-sex marriage "incompatible with the Constitution," the Obama administration Friday filed a brief at the U.S. Supreme Court  in support of couples who are making challenges in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. "The marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights, responsibilities and status of civil marriage," Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote. The brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide.
