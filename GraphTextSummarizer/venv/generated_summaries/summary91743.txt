At Salman's funeral, the many mourners included Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and our congressman, Gary Ackerman. At the time of his death, he was working as a lab analyst at Rockefeller University's Howard Hughes Medical Institute, on Manhattan's Upper East Side. After Zeshan and I had left, Salman would have pursued his usual routine, catching a bus and then the 7 train to Manhattan. Salman was determined to keep trying to get into medical school. When Zeshan and I left the house, at about 7:15, Salman was still sleeping.
