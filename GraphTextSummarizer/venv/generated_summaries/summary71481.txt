"I am very proud to be able to confirm that I am joining Caterham F1 Team next year and I'm looking forward to many seasons of successful racing cooperation," he said. Guttierrez finished third in the GP2 championship last season after winning three races, and will continue Sauber's recent tradition of having a Mexican driver with Sergio Perez having announced he will be joining McLaren at the end of the season. We are in no doubt we have a strong driver pairing in place for the 2013 season with Nico Hülkenberg and Esteban Gutiérrez." The 21-year-old, who has been the team's reserve driver over the past year, will team up with Nico Hülkenberg, who has joined from Force India. Caterham F1 Team has everything in place to help it move into a position to fight with a number of teams ahead.
