It now breaks down U.S. criminal legal requests by type, showing what percentage of the orders are subpoenas, wiretap orders, warrants, PEN register orders, or emergency disclosures. The tech company had more requests for user information in the first half of this year from the United States than any period before, according to the bi-annual Google transparency report released on Thursday. "We believe it's your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies," said Google legal director Richard Salgado in a blog post. India, Germany and France rounded out the top four, each making between 2,000 and 3,000 requests for user information. The total amount of requests from all governments has doubled since Google started tracking them in 2009.
