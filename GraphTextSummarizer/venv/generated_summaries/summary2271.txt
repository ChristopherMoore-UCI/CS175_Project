-- African Union forces in Somalia have successfully pushed the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab out of the capital Mogadishu, a commander told CNN Thursday. "We have managed to beat them off," said Maj. Gen. Fred Mugisha, force commander for AMISOM. The African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, is trying to consolidate power for Somalia's weak transitional federal government in Mogadishu, where Al-Shabaab had been especially active in its battle against that government. Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October after a rash of kidnappings Kenyan authorities blamed on Al-Shabaab. Kenyan forces are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the United Nations as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab.
