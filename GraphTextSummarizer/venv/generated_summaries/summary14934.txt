A major culprit is a medical system based on maximizing profits rather than fostering good health. CNN special report: "Escape Fire" The brutal fact is that we spend more on health care than any other country -- an estimated $9,348 per capita in 2013 -- and get shockingly little for our money. We have a disease-management system -- one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet, lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy. Here's the right question: How can we improve medical care so that it's worth extending it to more people? Drugs and surgeries have a secure place in the treatment of serious health conditions.
