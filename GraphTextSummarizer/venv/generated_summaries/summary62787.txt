Captain James Cook brought the Polynesian art form to the West after he and other explorers were influenced by the tattoos they saw in the Marquesas, a group of volcanic islands in French Polynesia and one of the five administrative divisions in the archipelago. After flying into Tahiti's main airport, there's a network of islands reachable by plane or boat. This mysterious set of islands remains mostly untouched by modern tourism, with raw beauty that influenced Herman Melville and Robert Louis Stevenson. Tikehau Tikehau, an oval-shaped island covered in pink sand and surrounded by rich waters, has the best beaches in French Polynesia. Today, Raiatea's vast harbor serves as the starting point for private boat tours of the surrounding islands or deep-sea fishing tours.
