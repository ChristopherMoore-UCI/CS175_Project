Penn will be presented with the 2012 Peace Summit Award next month during the annual meeting of Nobel Peace Prize laureates. In Haiti, actor Sean Penn brushed aside mockery in the media for his penchant for taking up causes. The laureates are honoring Penn's work in 2010, when he left Hollywood glamor behind and set up shop on the slopes of a private golf club in Port-au-Prince, where thousands of homeless Haitians sought shelter under makeshift tents. The Chicago summit in April will bring together Nobel laureates from 17 nations. Haiti was hardly Penn's first humanitarian endeavor, though it was arguably his most ambitious project to date.
