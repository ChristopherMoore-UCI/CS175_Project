The trio have been selected as wildcard picks by United States Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson for the biennial team clash with Europe that starts later in September. Medinah was Simpson's first Ryder Cup appearance, and he won two matches and lost two. He showed such a strong desire to be in the team and he has had the performance this year to be one of the picks." Watson's final pick -- Hunter Mahan -- is also out for redemption, but for the 2010 Ryder Cup, having missed the last transatlantic tussle. And it was those big victories that persuaded captain Watson to select him. The 2011 U.S. PGA Championship winner has had an up and down year but has recorded top 20 finishes in his last five events.
