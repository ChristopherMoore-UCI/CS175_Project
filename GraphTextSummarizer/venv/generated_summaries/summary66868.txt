Last week, a U.S. official told CNN that temporary steel spikes may be added to the tips of the White House perimeter fence to help deter jumpers. On March 4, two senior Secret Service agents who were reportedly intoxicated allegedly drove their car into a White House barrier. A 54-year-old man carrying a suspicious package scaled a White House fence Sunday night, but was quickly apprehended. The package was being examined and later deemed to be harmless, a Secret Service source told CNN.
