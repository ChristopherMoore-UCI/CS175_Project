" Michael Ingram, of Milford, Pennsylvania, says he's in good health and feels like he doesn't need health insurance. "After 22 years of fighting health insurance companies, me and my daughter have vindication," he told iReport. I'm just going to drop my insurance now, pay the $700 yearly fine, and then pickup insurance when I get sick since insurance companies can't deny me," he wrote on the Sound Off section of a CNN.com news story published after the bill passed. Under the bill, which President Obama is expected to sign Tuesday at the earliest, most Americans will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine. "I hope that everyone can give this [health care bill] a chance," wrote one CNN.com reader who identified herself as a 27-year-old recent college graduate who is working full time for a law firm and has health insurance through her job.
