"Children need to be aware of what is going on around the world and the emergencies that are happening," said Beckham of the disasters that millions of children face worldwide. Seven was the number emblazoned on the back of Beckham's shirt as he shot to stardom and he now hopes it will now bring hope to children who are at risk from numerous dangers, including those effected by the Ebola crisis. " Through "7," Beckham also hopes to fund counseling and support for children in El Salvador, a country which is battling the world's highest homicide rate. It's a charitable collaboration with UNICEF -- the world's leading organisation for children -- providing help to kids in danger zones across the globe. "Through 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund, we can act together to drive positive change for children."
