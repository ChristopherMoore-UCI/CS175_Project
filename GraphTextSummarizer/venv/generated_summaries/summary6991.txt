-- Former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky will appeal his convictions on numerous counts of child sexual abuse, a member of his defense team says. Sex abusers prey on kids' trust,experts say Beyond the appeals process, Sandusky could face more charges, perhaps tied to claims made by his adopted son or related to alleged sexual abuse that took place outside Centre County -- including in hotel rooms in Texas and Florida, where some accusers say they accompanied him to Penn State bowl games. Praise for victims, jurors after Sandusky verdict After being found guilty, Sandusky, 68, was taken immediately to the jail in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Painful chapter closes with Sandusky conviction The eight victims who testified, now young men, said that they were boys when Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts with him. Prosecutors said the two did not notify police after former graduate student and football assistant Mike McQueary told them he saw Sandusky sodomizing a boy in a Penn State shower in 2001.
