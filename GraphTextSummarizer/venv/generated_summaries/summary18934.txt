Link, a statistician, was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups. After a seal pup is born, Link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area, with hardly any interaction with other seals. Could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses? The photo was taken in October by USGS scientist William Link. The Weddell seal population is healthy and stable, and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics.
