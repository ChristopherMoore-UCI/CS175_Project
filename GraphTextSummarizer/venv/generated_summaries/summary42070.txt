The bail terms required Lohan to be fitted with a SCRAM alcohol-detection bracelet, Los Angeles County Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini said. He said on Friday that he was praying that defense lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley "does the right thing and advises her to go right into rehab now, and show the judge she's serious, because in 30 days when she goes back before the judge he can do whatever he wants. A judge granted Lohan bail Friday night, overturning a decision earlier in the day that sent the actress to jail until a probation revocation hearing four weeks away, a court spokesman said. Lohan's entry into rehab comes three days after a Los Angeles, California, judge ordered her to jail without bail in the wake of a failed drug test. The source did not reveal which rehab program Lohan had chosen.
