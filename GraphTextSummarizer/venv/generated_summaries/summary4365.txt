-- Flight attendants in coming months will get the same expedited screening at airport checkpoints available to airline pilots, the Transportation Security Administration said Monday. Authorities investigate needles in sandwiches Flight attendant representatives have long argued that flight attendants deserve the same treatment as pilots because they undergo identical background checks and are entrusted with access to the cockpit. Flight attendants -- there are 90,000 of them in the United States -- will be eligible if they work for U.S. airlines that participate in the program and are flying from U.S. airports. In a move intended to reduce checkpoint congestion while improving security, flight attendants will be allowed to display credentials instead of undergoing physical screening. The Known Crewmember program is "good news" for U.S. aviation, flight attendants and the traveling public, said Veda Shook, head of the Association of Flight Attendants.
