Eventually, I decided to leave politics out of my Facebook life -- although I occasionally slip -- and to try to make it more casual, about friends, leaving other social media, Twitter and LinkedIn, for more controversial matters. During my first few months on Facebook, I occasionally posted some of my articles on world politics, and Jim was quick to comment and debate. Friends posted poems and pictures' and urged Jim to "shake things up" in his new digs. On social media, we can share -- as Jim so often did -- big and small parts of our life, without worrying that others are too busy or simply not interested in hearing it. Friendship came much later, when we connected on Facebook, and Jim became an unlikely part of my everyday life.
