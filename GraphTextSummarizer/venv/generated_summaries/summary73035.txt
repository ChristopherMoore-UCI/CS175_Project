Watch slain teen's mother talk about her feelings Â» When school let out at 2:50 p.m. on September 24, Albert was nearly six blocks away -- on his way to a bus stop -- when two groups of students converged on the street, said Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for the Cook County prosecutor. Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis was among the Chicago officials who filed into the church as the the victim's mother, An-Janette Albert, wept in the arms of loved ones. President Obama, a longtime Chicago resident, is sending Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder next week to talk with officials from the school, the students and the community about school violence, the White House said. A funeral for Derrion Albert, a teen who was fatally beaten last month, was held Saturday on Chicago's South Side. Authorities say Derrion Albert, a 16-year-old honors student, was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a September 24 street fight between two factions of students from Christian Fenger Academy High School.
