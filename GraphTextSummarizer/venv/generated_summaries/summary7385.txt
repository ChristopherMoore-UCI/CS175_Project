As drug cartel violence continues unabated throughout Mexico, journalists find themselves walking a thin line between covering the story and becoming part of it. The drug violence "generates fear, even if you don't like to admit it," Pedro Torres, deputy editor of El Diario de Juarez told CNN. Agustin Lozano, editor-in-chief of El Bravo newspaper in Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, said excessive caution has become the norm for reporting crime. Sometimes, cartel members will call the newspaper to try to get reporters to not write about certain incidents; other times they push for certain stories to be included. Compounding the problem, Mills said, is either the inability or unwillingness of Mexican authorities to investigate violence against journalists.
