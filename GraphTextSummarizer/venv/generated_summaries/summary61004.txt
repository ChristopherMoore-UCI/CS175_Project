This rising tide of Mainland Chinese travelers means that global luxury brands need to take another look at their business strategies in order to take advantage, said Nick Debnam, KPMG China's Asia Pacific Chairman of Consumer Markets. -- More Mainland Chinese travelers are jet-setting to foreign shores and global luxury brands are cashing in, according to a new survey by KPMG, the global auditing firm. The report also revealed that rising Chinese incomes are fueling demand for luxury goods right at home in the domestic market. brands need to therefore align their branding and marketing strategies both in China, and for those rising number of travelling Chinese consumers," Debnam said in the report. Mainland Chinese are also recognizing more global brand names -- 59 in 2012 compared to 34 in 2006 -- and have attached specific sentiments to products based on their country of origin.
