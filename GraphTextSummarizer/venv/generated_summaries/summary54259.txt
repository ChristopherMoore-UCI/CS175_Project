Today's campaign plane has been cleaned up a lot -- from the candidates to the reporters -- and the most important reason is that there are now a fair number of women on the plane, as both advisers with real power and reporters with real power. Today there are middle-aged women with real power. But I suspect the presence of lot of powerful women in that business has reduced the overall level of debauchery. But when the culture in need of change is a macho culture where good old-fashioned debauchery and "boys being boys" is OK as long as no one gets caught -- the solution is pretty straightforward: Hire more women. Years ago the only women around were young women with no power.
