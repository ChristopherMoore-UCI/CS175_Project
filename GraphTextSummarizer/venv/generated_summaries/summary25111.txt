Third seed Novak Djokovic will play No. 2 Roger Federer in Saturday evening's second semifinal after handing American Andy Roddick his third successive defeat in Friday's closing match of the round-robin stage. In Friday's final Group A match, Djokovic needed to win only one set to earn a clash with Group B winner Federer. -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal set up a semifinal showdown with Andy Murray after winning his third successive match at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London on Friday. Nadal has never won an indoor hardcourt tournament, and failed to win a set at the O2 Arena last year. Nadal won their first two hardcourt meetings in 2007 but they went 2-2 last year.
