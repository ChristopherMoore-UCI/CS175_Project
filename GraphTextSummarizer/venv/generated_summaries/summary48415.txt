Three weeks after Malaysia Airlines Flights 370 set off from Kuala Lumpur, search aircraft set off Saturday from Australia -- hoping to, finally, find the Boeing 777 in the southern Indian Ocean where experts now believe it ended up. When those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean. This was not the first time it turned out suspected debris ended up being unrelated to the mystery plane: A Chinese aircraft reported spotting possible aircraft debris early in the search, but that sighting turned out to be nothing. "If you assume something and you end up with a final conclusion, you have to constantly review that." Vast, evolving search The shifting hunt for Flight 370 has spanned oceans and continents. Saturday's renewed search comes days after Japan and Thailand both said they'd sent new satellite images to Malaysia showing separate debris fields that could be related to the plane, which vanished with 239 people aboard.
