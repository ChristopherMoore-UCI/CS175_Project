The way Heath Ledger plays the Joker is different than how Jack Nicholson plays the character. Colorado teen Christina Perez says she painted her face like the Joker as a tribute to Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger is AWESOME as the Joker. However, Heath Ledger did an excellent job portraying the the Joker. Both have their unique styles -- Nicholson's Joker was more comical, but Ledger's was more dark (while trying to be funny).
