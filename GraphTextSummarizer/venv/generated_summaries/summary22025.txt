Somali pirates have defied foreign navies patrolling the waters and have collected large ransoms from shipping companies. Pirates seized a ship that was carrying wheat and used vehicles to Mogadishu, Somalia, on Saturday, according to NATO, which also patrols the area. Christophe Prazuck said, but a French helicopter intervened before the attackers had time to fire at the French navy ship. The Nivose seized three other suspected pirates Thursday morning, the French military spokesman said, but released them the next day for lack of evidence. Of that total, 27 have been released, and more than 70 taken to jail in France, handed to authorities in Somalia or taken to Kenya under an EU agreement with the government in Nairobi.
