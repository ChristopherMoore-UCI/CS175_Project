At the distillery, also a National Historic Landmark, visitors take a guided tour that explains the history of bourbon, the bottling process and how Woodford Reserve does something special with all five sources of bourbon flavor. Bourbon: Woodford Reserve Distillery, Kentucky Kentucky's oldest and smallest distillery, Woodford Reserve lovingly crafts its bourbon in small batches. It gets those last two from an aging process that involves Kentucky oak barrels that previously contained bourbon. Whisky: Glenfiddich Distillery, Dufftown, Scotland Glenfiddich is the world's most awarded single-malt Scotch whisky, having claimed more big-time international medals since 2000 than any other single-malt Scotch. Visitors sample a cool Stella in the cozy Den Thuis bar before being guided to the Stella Artois shop, where they can stock up on chalices.
