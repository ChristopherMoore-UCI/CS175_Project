Unions claimed guest workers undermined U.S. workers. This is a real possibility, and, if it happens, we can expect fireworks: Gutierrez has never been shy about blasting Emanuel over immigration reform. In fact, as tempting as it is to blame Emanuel for taking immigration reform off the president's agenda, it might not be totally fair. We can start with those Chicagoans who support immigration reform and believe that both Congress and the Obama administration should be ashamed for putting off a tough debate for the sake of politics. The issue divided two loyal Democratic constituencies: Latinos, who wanted reform, and organized labor, which didn't want reform if it meant supporting demands from the business community for guest workers.
