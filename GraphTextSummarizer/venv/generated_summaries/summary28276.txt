* * Derek Jeter, baseball player, is not nearly as big a deal as a lot of New Yorkers think he is. They've done everything in NYC except stage a new Broadway version of "Damn Yankees" in which Washington's team loses because a young Derek Jeter wants to be a Yankee so much, he sells his soul to the devil. In most of the United States of America, baseball fans seem to consider Derek Jeter a great player. In the largest city in the United States of America, baseball fans seem to consider Derek Jeter a visitor from the planet Krypton. smartphones and carrier pigeons based in New York City are treating this, Jeter's last week of playing Major League Baseball, as slightly less monumental than the discovery of America in 1492.
