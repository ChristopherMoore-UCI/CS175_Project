House GOP leaders cave on abortion bill But as centrists in the party look to move away from the abortion issue, they'll run up against fierce opposition from social conservatives, who were calling for revenge against Ellmers and other lawmakers who led the effort to drop the bill. After that election, an RNC post-mortem report diagnosing the party's problems suggested the GOP "must in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming" on social issues. The GOP has long faced significant issues in wooing single female voters and young voters, which contributed to its unexpected loss of the White House in 2012. Other centrist Republicans expressed concerns on Thursday that the party should be focusing on less controversial issues with broader appeal. "The first vote we take, or the second vote, or the fifth vote, shouldn't be on an issue where we know that millennialsâ€”social issues just aren't as important [to them]," she told National Journal last week.
