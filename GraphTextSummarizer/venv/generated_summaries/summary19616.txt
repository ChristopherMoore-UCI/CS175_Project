In some of his broadest remarks on racism yet, President Barack Obama said Friday that he believes while there are "some hidden biases that we all carry around," people are "basically good" and want to fix those problems, if given solutions. And people are basically good and have good intentions," Obama said during his year-end press conference Friday. And Obama created a task force to examine police tactics and propose what he called Friday "concrete practical things...to rebuild trust between communities of color and the police department." Obama referenced Eric Garner, the unarmed African-American man who died after he was put in a chokehold by a white police officer, saying that "this isn't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying." "I think that troubles everybody," Obama said. But he argued, "if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems."
