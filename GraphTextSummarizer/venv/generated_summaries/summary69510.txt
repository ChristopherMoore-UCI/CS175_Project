The reasons for his makeover become apparent when his character, Joe, comes face to face with his older self, played by Bruce Willis: higher forehead, same nose, same scowl. But his readiness to make us stretch should not blind us to the fact that "Looper" is full of holes: time holes, holes for corpse disposal, and enough plot holes to fill a leaky bucket. And Old Joe gets away, which is a problem, because if Young Joe doesn't rectify the situation and fulfill his contract, he won't qualify for the 30-year retirement plan that's allowed Old Joe such a long and fruitful life. Time travel has not been invented, but in another 30 years, it will be -- that is, in 2070 -- and the Mob has taken to sending their marked men back in time to be dispatched by loopers and disposed of in Joe's less-regimented present. It's fun being flummoxed, and Johnson has a knack for pulling off short, snappy scenes that keep the drama percolating (the excellent supporting cast, including Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels and Noah Segan, also helps).
