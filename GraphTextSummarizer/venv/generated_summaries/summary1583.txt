" More barbaric ISIS videos expected after Kassig's death, analyst says The 16-minute production includes a lengthy segment on the group's history and shows in graphic detail beheadings of several men described as Syrian military pilots. The video released over the weekend depicts the slayings of several men described by ISIS as Syrian soldiers and appears to show the aftermath of the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. On Monday, the U.S. military said coalition warplanes conducted 31 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq between Friday and Monday, hitting fighting positions, staging areas and units in the field, among other targets. France's interior minister said Monday that based on intelligence analysis, "a strong presumption exists" that a French citizen named Maxime Hauchard participated in the "despicable crimes" shown on the latest video from ISIS. Several men without masks, presumably ISIS fighters, are shown in that segment killing the men.
