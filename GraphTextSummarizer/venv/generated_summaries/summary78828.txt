Although Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin ruled Brown was again in violation of probation, he cited a new report from his probation officer that concluded Brown "is doing well in the program and making great strides" in rehab. Brown, who has been on probation since pleading guilty to assaulting girlfriend Rihanna five years ago, is becoming more violent, with his outbursts "increasing in severity and intensity," Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Mary Murray argued Monday. -- Chris Brown will stay in rehab a few more weeks despite a prosecutor's request he be thrown in jail. The latest probation report praises Brown's new improved attitude in complying with probation rules. "There's no reason to put him into custody at this point," Brown attorney Mark Geragos said after the hearing.
