Photos that allegedly show the Syrian regime committing mass torture are "fake," Syria's Justice Ministry said Wednesday. That assertion is being made by a team of internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts, who analyzed thousands of digital photos taken and provided by a Syrian defector codenamed "Caesar," who, along with his family, is now living outside Syria in an undisclosed location. It then said any expert "could easily find out that these pictures are fake and that they have no relation to prisoners or detainees in Syrian prisons." " Aside from the photos of "foreign terrorists," other individuals shown are "civilians and military personnel who were killed as a result of torture by armed terrorist groups because they were accused of being pro-state," it claims. In a statement on the state news agency SANA, the Justice Ministry categorically denied allegations published in a new report accusing the regime of torturing and killing thousands of detainees in government custody.
