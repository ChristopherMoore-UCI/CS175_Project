Those efforts and his stewardship of the Buffalo franchise -- including overseeing its run of four straight Super Bowl appearances and keeping it in western New York -- helped earn Wilson entry in 2009 in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon forming the Bills in 1959, Wilson became one of the co-founders of the American Football League. Andre Reed, a standout wide receiver on those Super Bowl teams who was recently picked for the Hall of Fame, tweeted that Wilson was a "#GreatOwner #Fatherfigure. Wilson remained a presence in Buffalo for many years, including lending his name to the Bills' home stadium. After returning to the United States, he got into pro football first by buying a minority share in the Detroit Lions and then staking his claim to the Bills franchise.
