South Korean vehicles and freight trucks waited in traffic as they prepared to cross through customs and immigration into the North Korean city of Kaesong, where the industrial park sits. North Korean workers there earn an average of $134 per month, 45% of which are taken by North Korean authorities for various taxes. With South Korean workers and supplies barred from entering the region, the last remaining workers left Kaesong in May. " After several offers from Seoul to end the impasse, the two Koreas finally agreed to reopen Kaesong last week with an agreement that the industrial zone's operations would no longer be "affected by political situations under any circumstances. All 123 companies operating in the zone experienced heavy losses after Kaesong's closure, and in Choi's case, the figure amounted to US$3 million.
