The report, issued Tuesday, blasted the culture of the company that allowed the losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for companies, as well as the tight control of former company Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa. Resignations and changes to company management would likely come after a shareholder's meeting sometime in February. Olympus has lost half its share value in the wake of the October 14 firing of former CEO Michael Woodford, the first foreigner to lead the company, after Woodford questioned the company's accounting. Company officials said in a statement that the report "includes both new revelations and recommendations on the future management of Olympus (and) will be taken into serious consideration by the company." Company officials have repeatedly said they will turn in the required documents before next week's deadline.
