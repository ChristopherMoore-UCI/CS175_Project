Vegetarians and vegans have to be willing to explore new foods and Anding said she would discourage such lifestyles for children who like only a handful of foods, including meat. Vitamin B12, found in animal protein, can become a concern if dairy or eggs leave the diet, Anding said. Anding, who for decades has worked with children and teens with eating disorders, said parents also need to make sure their children are eating. Vegetarianism is more than just not eating meat, said Roberta Anding, a registered dietitian at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital and a spokesperson for the dietetic association. Vitamin B12 deficiencies manifest over time.
