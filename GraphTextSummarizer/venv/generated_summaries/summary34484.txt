Before, cruise ships could hold the muster, also known as the safety drill, up until 24 hours after sailing (though to be honest, most did do musters before the ship left port). Post-Concordia, I've been to 14 muster drills -- on a variety of ships and cruise lines -- and have noticed that people take them much, much more seriously now. The primary change, and the most important change, that we've seen in the wake of the tragic capsizing of Costa Concordia is a renewed commitment to safety on a global level. Since the disaster, safety policies have been reviewed and changes made to make cruise travel safer. Francesco Schettino may be indicted in the next few weeks on charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship before his passengers, and other Concordia executives and crewmembers may also face trial.
