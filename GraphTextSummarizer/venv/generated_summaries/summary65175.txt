It has picked the United States for its GTL facility because the country has abundant shale gas, released through the controversial drilling process of hydraulic fracturing -- or fracking Due to the rise in fracking, estimates suggest that the U.S. has more than 100 years' supply of natural gas. "In that technology we take natural gas and we actually break the molecule down and then reform that molecule into other high-value products like diesel," says Mike Thomas, Sasol's vice president of U.S. operations, explaining the company's proprietary technology. Sasol, a Johannesburg-based energy giant, announced late last year its intention to spend up to $14 billion on building the first U.S.-based commercial plant to perform the alchemy of turning natural gas into liquid fuels -- hailed as one of the biggest investments from a non-U.S. company in American history. Sasol, which has been producing synthetic fuels for decades, says it will not be fracking directly to source natural gas feedstock for its facilities, instead tapping into the U.S. natural gas market through the existing infrastructure. Yet experts say the current price difference between natural gas and oil, courtesy of the recent shale gas boom, coupled with the long-term global transport trends favoring low-emissions fuels, have helped turn GTL into a particularly appealing proposition in places like North America -- as it means less reliance on oil from the Middle East.
