The National Weather Service said there was a possibility of severe storms in central Oklahoma on Tuesday night that could bring large hail, damaging wind and localized flooding. Searchers found the body of an 8-year-old girl Monday afternoon, Oklahoma City Deputy Fire Chief Marc Woodard said. Other deaths came in wake of storm In eastern Oklahoma County, a 65-year-old man on his way to work was killed early Saturday when he drove off a washed out bridge and drowned in a creek. But it was Oklahoma City and its surrounding areas that sustained most of the damage. Eight to 11 inches of rain hosed Oklahoma City, stranding motorists and hitting apartments in low-lying areas of town hard.
