-- The Supreme Court sided with Congress on Thursday in the high-stakes power struggle over presidential recess appointments, in which officials are placed in top government jobs temporarily without Senate approval. "Since President Obama took office, Senate Republicans have done everything possible to deny qualified nominees from receiving a fair up-or-down vote," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. Senate officials weigh in "I welcome the Supreme Court's important decision today," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said just after the ruling. But the court said the executive could use his power to make recess appointments even when the vacancy occurred before the Senate goes on break. "President Obama did the right thing when he made these appointments on behalf of American workers." While agreeing with the outcome of the narrow question presented, four more conservative justices worried that the ruling would allow the President to retain a good deal of the "powerful weapon" of making recess appointments.
