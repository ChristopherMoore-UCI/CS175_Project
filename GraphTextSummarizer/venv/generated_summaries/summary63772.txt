Central America has been hammered by torrential rain since last week, when Hurricane Jova struck Mexico as a Category 2 storm late Tuesday. "We've been able to respond to all the requests for help we've received -- many by land because we haven't been able to fly over the areas," said President Alvaro Colom, AGN reported. It weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it moved over western Mexico. In Guatemala, the death toll has risen to 28 and close to 110,000 people have been affected so far, the state-run AGN news agency reported. CNN's Claudia Dominguez and journalist Merlin del Cid contributed to this report.
