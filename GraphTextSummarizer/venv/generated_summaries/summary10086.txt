France, Germany and several other European countries have shunned the environmental risks of developing shale gas and nuclear power. Already, Russian oil producers simply burn off huge amounts of gas they can't sell in Europe. Unless the West can impose significant costs on Russia for its aggressive policies, reduce Europe's vulnerability to a natural gas embargo and curtail Moscow's financial resources, it can count on Russia asserting military power when its leaders perceive threats to Russian interests in neighboring states. Eliminating dependence on Russian gas might not end Russia's paranoia -- in fact it could feed it -- but it would at least deprive Moscow of its ability to threaten Europeans with embargoes and neighboring states with military actions. Russians could try to sell more natural gas in Asia, but those prospects are limited.
