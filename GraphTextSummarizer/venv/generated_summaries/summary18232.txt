Green Day, Nine Inch Nails, N.W.A. among Rock Hall nominees "As we mark 30 years of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductions, we're proud to honor these artists," Rock and Roll Hall of Fame foundation president Joel Peresman said in a statement. "The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has always held something for me because my heroes were in there," Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong told Rolling Stone. That means Green Day, which dropped its EP "1,000 Hours" in April 1989, has the distinction of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the band's first year of eligibility. Green Day; Bill Withers; Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble; Lou Reed; Joan Jett and the Blackhearts; and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band will all be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next spring.
