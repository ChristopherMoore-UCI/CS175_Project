The son of the owner of Slick's Go Go Bar in Irvington -- identified as Pierre Clervoyant, 34, a resident of Elizabeth, New Jersey -- and nightclub employee Woodley Daniel, 32, of Irvington, died after the shooting, authorities said. -- Three men were killed and two others wounded early Christmas morning in a shooting outside a New Jersey bar, according to the Essex County prosecutor's office. It appears the gunman was trying to enter the bar armed and was stopped by the bouncer," said Anthony Ambrose of the Essex County prosecutor's office in a statement. Two other men -- a 27-year-old from Irvington and a 34-year-old from East Orange, New Jersey -- were shot and wounded. The Essex County Sheriff's Crimestoppers program is offering a reward of up to $10,000 to anyone with information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction.
