Valdez's family at the Memorial Â» Enrique Valdez joins 58,260 other names listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and his is the only name added this year under 1969, for combat deaths that year or later deaths resulting  from injuries sustained in combat that year. Comrades and others told the family that he could be added to "The Wall "as long as we could show that his death was a result of his [war] injuries," said daughter Tina Valdez. Valdez was a Marine gunnery sergeant wounded by shrapnel in August 1969, combat that left him a quadriplegic. When notification came weeks ago from the Defense Department that Valdez's name would be added to the Wall, there was no explanation with it. Rick Valdez was 7 when his father was deployed to Vietnam.
