-- A magazine publisher, a photographer and a regional newspaper are under investigation in France for invasion of privacy over the publication of vacation pictures of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, authorities said Thursday. Mondadori France, publisher of the French edition of Closer magazine, was placed under investigation on April 4, and La Provence, a regional daily newspaper, was placed under investigation Monday. The grainy topless pictures, shot from a distance, were taken while Catherine was sunbathing in private during a vacation at a chateau owned by William's uncle in Provence, southern France. An unnamed female photographer was placed under investigation on April 2, according to Caroline Chassain, spokeswoman for the Nanterre prosecutor. Topless photos of Catherine, wife of Britain's Prince William, appeared in the French edition of Closer.
