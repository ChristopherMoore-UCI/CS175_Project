-- The judge in James Holmes' murder trial on Tuesday accepted his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Before the shooting, Fenton, who works at the University of Colorado's medical campus, warned campus police that Holmes was dangerous. The suspect in last summer's shooting spree that killed 12 people and wounded dozens at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater will be taken to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo for evaluation. Samour also ruled Tuesday that a package Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist before the shooting can be processed as evidence. Written on it: "James Holmes, Of Life," according to court documents.
