Kerri Kasem told reporters that Jean Kasem had kept them away for the previous three months and that she was worried about her father's health. The judge also gave Kerri Kasem authority to take him to a doctor. Family feud The public battle over Casey Kasem -- which has always been emotional and sometimes bizarre -- began in October 2013, when daughters Julie and Kerri led a protest outside Kasem's Los Angeles mansion, holding signs demanding that their stepmother let them see their ailing father. Over the weekend, infusions were stopped, but they were reinstated Monday after a request by Jean Kasem and under the order of Judge Daniel Murphy -- the same judge who reversed himself and restored the authority to Kerri Kasem on Wednesday. Jean Kasem again faced off with her stepchildren in a Kitsap County court on May 30, a hearing that ended with Kerri Kasem getting a judge's approval to visit her father for an hour.
