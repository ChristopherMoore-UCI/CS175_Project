In the case of Yousafzai -- the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, at 17 -- it was for girls' right to an education, a quest that nearly cost her her life when Taliban fighters called her out and shot her in the head two years ago. To thunderous and sustained applause, Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai and India's Kailash Satyarthi received the Nobel Peace Prize on Wednesday, an award that a Nobel official said he hopes encourages others to fight for young people's rights. Man arrested after interrupting ceremony "We need people like Satyarthi and Yousafzai to show that it helps to fight," said Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. Wednesday's ceremony in Oslo, Norway -- attended by royalty, international officials, even some of Yousafzai's classmates from Pakistan -- made it official. Next up was Yousafzai, from northwestern Pakistan's Swat Valley.
