It marks the date "the Hindu god Lord Parasurama (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) came to earth in the form of a human being," the astrologer said, invoking a Hindu concept that has been widely appropriated in the Internet age -- the avatar.

Vummidi said that was part of a supply-and-demand effect on sales and prices around Akshaya.
