In an unprecedented move, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will travel to New Delhi to attend the oath-taking ceremony Monday for India's new leader, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Saturday. As well as attending the ceremony, Sharif will have a bilateral meeting with Modi on Tuesday and will also meet with Indian President Shri Pranab Mukherjee, according to a statement from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry. India's external affairs ministry said Wednesday that invitations had been extended to the heads of all eight countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which includes Sharif. Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry is expected to accompany Sharif, according to the statement. The attendance of Sharif at the ceremony may boost hopes of improved relations between the neighboring countries.
