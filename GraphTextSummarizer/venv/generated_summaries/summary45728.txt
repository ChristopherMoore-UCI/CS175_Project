England won the first Test in Cardiff by an innings and 114 runs before a draw in the second Test at Lord's, and Sangakkara -- who made 119 -- told reporters his side were ultimately made to pay for collapsing to 82 all out inside 25 overs in that first Test match. " England captain Andrew Strauss added: "We got ourselves in a position to go on and win the game but fair play to Sangakkara, the Sri Lankans blunted our attack -- we didn't make the inroads we needed to make." "I think we got ourselves into good positions in all three Test matches and in a way that two-hour session in Cardiff was good enough to get us one result. A century from Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara, the 25th of his career, ensured the tourists escaped defeat in a match that saw 155 overs lost due to bad weather in its first three days. This meant Sri Lanka had a lead of 141, in reply to England's first innings total of 377 for eight declared. -- England and Sri Lanka drew their third and final Test at the Rose Bowl on Monday, a result that saw hosts England take a 1-0 series victory.
