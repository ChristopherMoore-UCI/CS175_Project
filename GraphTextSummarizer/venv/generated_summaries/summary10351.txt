In September, Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party to endorse Putin for president once again -- and Putin, for his part, suggested Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister. "He's an extremely charismatic person," said Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Putin faced four other presidential contenders, including Russia's third-richest man, New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. When Yeltsin resigned in 1999, Putin -- then acting prime minister -- was appointed acting president. Putin, the married father of two daughters, rose from humble beginnings to become one of Russia's most powerful men.
