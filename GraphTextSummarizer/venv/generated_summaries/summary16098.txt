What's working so well for Gervais had the opposite effect on controversial Oscar hosts David Letterman and Chris Rock, whose bits didn't sit well with critics, Ellwood said. "His Sheen joke was comedy gold for me," Ellwood said referencing Gervais' quip about the former "Two and a Half Men" star's typical breakfast of partying and heavy drinking. " Though he's already been criticized for offending a slew of big-name celebrities and members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which runs the awards show, Gervais shouldn't -- and wouldn't -- consider toning down his act, said Gregory Ellwood, the editor-in-chief of HitFix.com. But Ellwood said Gervais is certainly something of the sort. "It's not as easy to be outrageous and biting and funny at the same time as it might seem," Ellwood said, noting that Gervais has pulled it off twice already.
