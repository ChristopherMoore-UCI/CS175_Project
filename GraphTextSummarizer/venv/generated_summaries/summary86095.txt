Because by and large when talking about race in America, whites have conversations with other whites and blacks have conversations with other blacks. Most whites don't know because most whites don't have interracial conversations about race. It's just that we know what other blacks are thinking because, well, we talk to other blacks about race. "This Week" allowed many whites to hear what a black man is thinking about race. When a black person says this is about race, many whites say we're playing the race card.
