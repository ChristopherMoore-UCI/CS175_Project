Businesses also said that amid global economic uncertainty the euro will also result in lower production costs, as weakening economic activity limits inflation. "In relation to the financial crisis, euro adoption may bring a positive impact in terms of softer inflation pressures, and thus, indirectly, savings in material or wage costs." "First of all, the euro means price stability, both in relations with our clients in the euro zone and our business relations with suppliers localized in the euro zone countries," Jean Mouro, CEO of PSA Peugeot Citroen in Slovakia told Reuters.com. "In general, it will reduce costs related to swift changes of the euro-crown exchange rate, especially in the last few years when the crown had been appreciating rapidly," said Mouro. After Sony postponed a planned investment in a TV production plant in Slovakia earlier this month, other firms in the country welcomed entry into the eurozone as a move that will end uncertainty after years of coping with a volatile currency.
