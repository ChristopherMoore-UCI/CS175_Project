You cannot carry out a mining operation at the cost of miners' lives." Allende -- the daughter of former Chilean President Salvador Allende -- said government regulators, who temporarily closed the mine in 2008, should have been more vigilant. "This accident could have been avoided and we could have avoided seeing the anguish of 33 families waiting for their loved ones to come home," said Sen. Isabel Allende, who represents the Atacama region where the San Jose mine is located. " "He would see that even when the price of copper is high, that does not translate into better salaries, better working conditions or better safety," she said. Friday's development was bright news indeed for the miners, who will enjoy a feast and celebrate Chilean independence day Saturday. Representatives of the San Esteban Mining Co. have said previously they will collaborate fully with Chilean authorities and the Chilean Congress in their inquiries about what went wrong at the mine.
