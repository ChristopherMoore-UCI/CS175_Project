Widgets Until now, Apple has kept strict controls on how apps -- other than its own -- appear on the iPhone and iPad. Users will be able to do things like answer phone calls on their laptop, receive texts on a desktop computer and move a document in progress from an iPhone to an iPad to a computer with a single swipe. Family Sharing Apple wants you to have one big happy iPhone and iPad-using family. You can't get a new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus until Friday, but iOS 8, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, went live on Wednesday. Keyboard changes Apple says iOS 8 brings the biggest changes to the system's keyboard since the iPhone was introduced.
