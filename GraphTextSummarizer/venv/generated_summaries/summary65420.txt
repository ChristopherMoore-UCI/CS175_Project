The tweet included a link to a clip from director Alfonso Cuaron's big screen adaptation of the novel "A Little Princess," which includes this famous line: "I am a princess. Emma Watson took to Twitter on Sunday to quell rumors that she and Prince Harry are dating, reminding the world that marrying a prince is "not a prerequisite for being a Princess." All girls are; even if they live in tiny old attics, even if they dress in rags, even if they aren't pretty or smart or young, they're still princesses." She came back later in the day with a retort to tabloid fodder suggesting that Watson was angling to become the next princess, saying that "marrying a Prince (is) not a prerequisite for being a Princess." The speculation stemmed from a report last week in an Australian tabloid that the pair "are having secret dates" and "getting to know each other quite well."
