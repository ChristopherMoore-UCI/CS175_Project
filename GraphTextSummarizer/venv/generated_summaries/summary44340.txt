The excitement that demographers feel about this once-a-decade population snapshot is likely overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of political analysts, who are busy discovering what state-level population shifts mean for state reapportionment and redistricting within states. If we regard simple population change as an indicator of political power, the buildup in red states is indeed significant. Attention is focused on 12 seats in the House of Representatives that will be leaving slow-growth states in the Northeast and Midwest and moving to the South and Southwest as populations there continued to grow quickly. That number will show shifts of the population that official estimates have pointed to all along: The diversifying of the population is more extensive in areas of fast population growth. But as we can see by looking more carefully at the data, there is more to population shifts than a simple rearranging of the map based on total counts.
