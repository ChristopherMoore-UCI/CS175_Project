Obama: U.S. will keep deploying drones -- when they are only option He renewed his push to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also sought to calm criticism around his administration's investigation of national security leaks. -- President Barack Obama recast the U.S. fight against terrorism as no longer a "boundless global war" but a targeted effort to dismantle specific extremist networks. "When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America -- and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens; and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot -- his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team," Obama said. He said ordering strikes is a heavy burden, but added that "to do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties." Obama said he is asking his administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond reporting to Congress. He called on Congress to "lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO," appointed a special envoy to "achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries," and lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, where 56 of Gitmo's 86 detainees are from.
