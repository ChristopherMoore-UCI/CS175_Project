-- As Occupy Wall Street demonstrations spread to cities across the U.S., protesters, bystanders and interested people almost everywhere are using mobile devices to share and follow events on the ground. The tools we had were great for mobile communication among protesters and organizers, or for uploading media to places like Flickr, where you hoped people might see it. So Frietas helped create the Guardian Project, which makes easy-to-use apps and other mobile software as well as customized mobile phones "that can be used and deployed around the world, by any person looking to protect their communications and personal data from unjust intrusion and monitoring. Our goal was to organize people using their phones; social media is more about spreading news and opinion. " Freitas noted that other mobile communication apps are emerging that are "peer to peer" or "mesh networks," meaning mobile devices communicate directly with each other, not via the internet.
