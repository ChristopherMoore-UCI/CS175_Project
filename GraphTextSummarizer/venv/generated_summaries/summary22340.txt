An underwater volcano dubbed Tamu Massif was found some 1,000 miles east of Japan, says William Sager, a professor at the University of Houston, who led a team of scientists in the discovery. The volcano was partly named in honor of Texas A&M University, where Sager worked for 29 years before moving to the University of Houston. "Its shape is different from any other sub-marine volcano found on Earth, and it's very possible it can give us some clues about how massive volcanoes can form," Sager says. In comparison, the largest active volcano on land, Hawaii's Mauna Loa, is about 2,000 square miles, Sager says. The volcano is about the size of the state of New Mexico and is among the largest in the solar system, Sager says.
