The Equal Justice Initiative of Alabama has just issued a report, "Illegal Racial Discrimination Jury Selection: A Continuing Legacy," that details racial discrimination in jury selection in eight Southern states. Jury selection is actually a process of elimination: Potential jurors are called for jury duty and are questioned and either seated, excused for a cause or excused by a peremptory challenge from either side. He is about to be tried for the sixth time for the same crime in a case marred by racial discrimination in jury selection. If you try to broach the subject during jury selection, asking all the racists to please raise their hands is not an option. Systematic exclusion of a race from jury selection sends an ugly message -- African Americans and Hispanics need not apply.
