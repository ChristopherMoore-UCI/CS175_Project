Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani says the controversy surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, does not exemplify a larger national problem. " Giuliani went on to explain that he and other New York City mayors have worked hard to make New York Police Department "as proportionate" as possible to reflect the racial makeup of the city. " Giuliani says the chaos signifies that the nation is focusing on racial disparity when it should be setting its attention on the way the police force is arranged in respect to high crime rates. The former New York mayor, who has been credited with greatly reducing crime in the Big Apple among poorer areas, insisted that the focus of the nation should pivot towards reducing crime among the black community. Why aren't you protesting that?" In a heated exchange Sunday with academic and radio host Michael Eric Dyson, Giuliani suggested that the white police officer who fatally shot Brown in mid-August shouldn't be the focus of the nation's attention.
