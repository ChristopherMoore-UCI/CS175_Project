Jesse Matthew, the man named as a suspect in her disappearance, was taken into custody this week in Texas, 1,300 miles away from the town where Graham was last seen. It was late on a Friday night and a freckled, blue-eyed University of Virginia student named Hannah Graham was partying in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia. "There's a long road ahead of us, and that long road includes finding Hannah Graham," Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said. The search may have to be extended to the 1,300 miles between the place where Graham was last seen and Texas, where Matthew was arrested. Matthew is accused of abduction with the intent to defile in the Graham case.
