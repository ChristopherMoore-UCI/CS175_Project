Speaking on the BBC, Brown said the devices will be put into place gradually, as will checks of carry-on luggage for traces of explosives for passengers boarding flights at British airports. The move follows the British government's approval of electronic bodyscanners, which Prime Minister Gordon Brown said was necessary to combat "a new type of threat." Bodyscanners are currently in use at 19 U.S. airports, but U.S. officials said Thursday that 150 new ones are set to be placed in airports across the country. A 23-year-old British-educated Nigerian, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, has been arrested after U.S. authorities said he attempted to set off explosives that had been concealed in his underwear. "We've recognized there are new forms of weapons that are being used by al Qaeda, so we've got to respond accordingly," Brown said.
