Watch Van Halen show off his new axe Â» After years of wearing down metal frets and having pieces of his guitar rip off or malfunction during shows, Van Halen says he's built a guitar that even he can't destroy. The red, white and black-striped motif of his signature Van Halen guitar is painted on the walkway. Van Halen and the other members of the band had just announced a big reunion tour with original singer David Lee Roth at a splashy news conference in Beverly Hills, and I had inadvertently discovered where they were prepping for their journey. Months later, I would catch Van Halen, the band, during their triumphant hometown concert in Los Angeles. It's where the album "1984" was recorded, along with every subsequent Van Halen record.
