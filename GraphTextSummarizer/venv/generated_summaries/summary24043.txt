"Offshore processing centers may lower the number of asylum seekers in Australia, but it is not a viable solution to fairly deal with asylum seekers and it will not put a stop to people coming to this country by boat," he told CNN. Since the resurrection of the so-called  "Pacific Solution," under which asylum seekers making their way to Australia by boat are processed offshore, 7,929 people have arrived in Australian waters on 134 boats, according to the Immigration Department. The decision to process the overload of asylum seekers on the Australian mainland comes as Amnesty International inspectors this week described conditions at the Nauru detention center, where 387 asylum seekers are currently held, as "appalling." By its own admission, the Australian government's policy on asylum seekers has been overwhelmed, just three months after the passing of new laws aimed at stemming the flow of those seeking refuge in Australia. But for Ramesh Fernandez, the CEO and founder of RISE, a not for profit support group for refugees and asylum seekers, Australia's mandatory detention laws are little more than an illegal form of "house arrest.
