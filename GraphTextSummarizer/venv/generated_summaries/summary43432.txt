Federal funding for research and development has barely been keeping up with inflation in recent years if you look at the numbers from the National Science Foundation. Let's hope that today's politicians follow Reagan's advice and invest in science, research and development. The United States has dominated the world of basic science for years, even decades. Since big entitlements such as Social Security are mandatory spending programs, it is discretionary spending, such as science, that often bears the brunt of the budget ax. As scientist Neal Lane points out, China is on course to surpass the United States in the percentage of its gross domestic product it spends on research and development in just a few years.
