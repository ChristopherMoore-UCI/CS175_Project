Political themes have been popular at the Academy Awards in the past, but this year's list of best picture contenders was rife with them. -- One of the most surprising moments of this year's Oscars came at the very end, when first lady Michelle Obama showed up on video to help announce the best picture winner. We know Hollywood's version of politics well -- which celebrity said what, when, and to whom -- but it seems this awards season shifted our focus somewhat to grander themes. Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Abraham Lincoln won him the best actor Oscar, and Day-Lewis was sure to thank the man who inspired his role. Regardless of its lack of statues, Kathryn Bigelow's project remains one of the most talked-about movies of 2012 thanks to its plot centered on the hunt for Osama bin Laden.
