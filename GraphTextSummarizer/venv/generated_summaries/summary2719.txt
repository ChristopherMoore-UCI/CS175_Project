Likewise, a Pew Research Center poll conducted before the 2008 primary found that 55% of New Hampshire Republican primary voters believed that abortion should be always or mostly legal, while just 13% of New Hampshire GOP primary voters said abortion should be always illegal -- posing a problem for fundamentalists like Rick Santorum who support a constitutional ban on abortion. If Huntsman and Paul continue to gain support with New Hampshire independent voters, they will eat into Romney's lead, helping Rick Santorum close the gap with Romney. Romney holds the distinction of being the only statewide elected official from Massachusetts who failed to win the New Hampshire primary. Decades ago the Granite State was considered rock-ribbed Republican, but as the national Republican Party moved further right, especially on social issues, New Hampshire -- like much of the Northeast -- started to declare its independence. Jon Huntsman has been camped out in New Hampshire for the past six months, trying to rally Granite Staters around his center-right campaign, promising fiscal conservatism alongside a healthy critique of absolutism on social issues.
