" Thus TTP violence cannot be divorced from the violence carried out by the state and state agencies in Pakistan against civilians in countless military operations, through police brutality, curfews, drone strikes and extrajudicial "disappearances." Following these operations, the TTP have been widely predicted to fall: military jets had successfully bombed TTP hideouts, doctrinal splits over "non-Islamic practices" seemed to paralyze them, in September parts of the TTP had announced a ceasefire and renounced violence, and a high turnover of leadership positions (the current spokesperson only being in place for a few weeks) leading to uncertainty among TTP foot soldiers and rumors of desertion. As is typical of splintering militant groups and of those facing increased external pressure, the frequency, scale, and scope, of TTP violence has increased as the new leadership seeks to assert its authority and demonstrate strength to external audiences. This year, the Pakistani state relied more on airstrikes than in previous years, leading to claims of higher than ever civilian casualty rates, but also greater the usual number of TTP combatant deaths. Some have criticised Pakistan for not addressing the TTP and other militant groups sooner, or not taking the threat they pose seriously enough.
