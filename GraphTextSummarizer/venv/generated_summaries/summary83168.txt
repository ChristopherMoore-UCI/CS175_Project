I was still of elementary school age when, early one morning, the clock radio snapped to life and before I could open my eyes a new song sounded in the darkness: "Bye Bye Love," two voices blending in a way I'd never heard before, and it was electric, it was that kind of unanticipated jolt. Having spent time with the Everly Brothers on the rock-and-roll road over the years, I had long noticed something: Whenever they were performing, Phil fastened his eyes right on Don's. Paul McCartney said that he and John Lennon used to pretend they were the Everly Brothers: "When John and I first started to write songs, I was Phil and he was Don. Phil was talking about his older brother, Don. Paul Simon: "Phil and Don were the most beautiful sounding duo I ever heard."
