-- A sensational strike from Poland captain Jakub Blaszczykowski kept alive the co-hosts' hopes of reaching the quarter finals of Euro 2012 as they held Russia to a 1-1 draw. First, Petr Jiracek took advantage of an incisive pass from Joroslav Plasil to fire past Greece goalkeeper Kostas Chalkias. The victory means Bilak's Czech side now have three points from two Group A games, but leaves Greece knowing that only a win against Russia in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages. Either way, as it had been in their first game against Poland, Greece's first-half luck was completely out. Having fought back from a goal down and with only 10 men in their first game against Poland, Greece looked set to stage another second-half revival.
