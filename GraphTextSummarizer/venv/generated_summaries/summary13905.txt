Susan Pietsch-Escueta, executive director of the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Los Angeles, says more people with epilepsy need to come forward. "I truly do believe we will never end epilepsy if people with epilepsy remain in the shadows and in hiding, in a sense." Ramirez takes precautions but says he is not going to let epilepsy manage his life. Ramirez and Jones, project coordinator at the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Los Angeles, soon became fast friends, sharing stories over coffee and lunch. Ramirez, of Pasadena, California, found out he had epilepsy when he was 22. It featured people living with epilepsy who talked about the impact the disorder had on their lives.
