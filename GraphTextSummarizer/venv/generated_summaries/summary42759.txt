" Pandurevic actually opened a corridor on July 16 to allow a column of Bosnian Muslims to move to an area held by Bosnian Muslim forces, contrary to orders he had received, the court said. The court found the attack began with an order from former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to the army's Drina Corps to create "an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica and Zepa," the court found. He was present at a number of sites where captured Bosnian Muslims were detained or executed between July 13 and 23, 1995, the court said. "The scale and nature of the murder operation, with the staggering number of killings, the systematic and organized manner in which it was carried out, the targeting and relentless pursuit of the victims, and the plain intention -- apparent from the evidence -- to eliminate every Bosnian Muslim male who was captured or surrendered proves beyond reasonable doubt that this was genocide," the trial chamber found. More than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995 when ethnic Serb troops overran a United Nations safe area.
