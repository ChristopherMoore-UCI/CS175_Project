Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which he shepherded and signed into law, insurance companies are no longer allowed to deny insurance to individuals because of pre-existing conditions. President Obama said during the 2008 campaign that we should be able to disagree without being disagreeable. President Obama also expanded Pell Grants, which help low income students pay for college. I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions. We must not forget the mess that President Obama walked into.
