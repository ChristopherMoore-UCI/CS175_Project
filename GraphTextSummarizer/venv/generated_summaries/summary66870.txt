A lengthy report on wait times at VA health care facilities in Phoenix found that 28 veterans had "clinically significant delays" in care, and six of them died, but investigators couldn't conclusively link their deaths to the delays. Read more about what Foote said In June, a VA scheduling clerk in Phoenix, Pauline DeWenter, told CNN that records of deceased veterans were changed or physically altered to hide how many people died while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA hospital. "While the case reviews in this report document poor quality of care, we are unable to conclusively assert that the absence of the quality of timely quality care caused the death of these victims," the executive summary of the report states. VA response Earlier Tuesday, the VA leaked Secretary Robert McDonald's response to the report, highlighting the fact that there were no deaths directly linked to delays in care, but that statement lacked the context of the report's negative findings. CNN's in-depth reporting CNN has long reported about delays in getting care and scheduling problems at VA facilities nationwide.
