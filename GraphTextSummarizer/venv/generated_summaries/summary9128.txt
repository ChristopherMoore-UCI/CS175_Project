"We got the alarm at 9.59 p.m. on September 6 that a moose was stuck in a tree," said Anders Gardhagen, spokesman at the Gothenburg Fire and Rescue Services. Johansson's son, Gustav, who is about to turn 11, made sure to take lots of pictures of the ordeal. -- It was a dark, windy and rainy night when Per Johansson returned from work to his home in Saro just south of Gothenburg, Sweden. "He is saving up to buy a PlayStation so he thought he would take pictures that he could sell," Johansson said. Gardhagen told CNN.
