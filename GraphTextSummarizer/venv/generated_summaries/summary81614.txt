Despite its walleyed positioning, Philae transmitted data and black-and-white photos back to Earth and ESA scientists. Led by ESA with a consortium of partners including NASA, scientists on the Rosetta comet-chasing mission hoped to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind: high energy particles blasted into space by the sun. That's likely not enough to juice up Philae's rechargeable secondary battery, ESA said. Elated scientists show off latest pics from historic comet mission Ten year voyage Rosetta took off from Earth 10 years ago, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, and traveled 6.4 billion miles before rendezvousing with the comet in August. The German space agency, which operates Philae for ESA, has taken a light-hearted approach to the battery's impending doom, putting out witty messages on a confirmed Twitter account in Philae's name.
