"Much of what has been said about Mr. Elkins has been unkind, and much of that discussion has been based on false assumptions and misinformation," he said. Public defender Kevin Gough, who represents De'Marquise "Marky" Elkins, said media reports have focused on "evidence selectively disclosed by the police. Elkins and another teenager, Dominique Lang, have been charged with murder in the March 21 killing of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago. He said defense theories are evolving as the evidence develops, and he predicted further developments in the coming weeks. The defense attorney for one of two teenagers charged with fatally shooting a Georgia baby in the face spoke Wednesday about evidence in the case, saying speculation about the crime and evidence is complicating preparations for next month's trial.
