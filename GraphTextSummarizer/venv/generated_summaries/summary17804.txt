Along with getting its name mentioned frequently in the Oscars broadcasts and coverage leading up to the show, Dolby will use the theater as a "world class showcase for Dolby innovation," said Ramzi Haidamus, Dolby's sales and marketing executive vice president. The company is "working feverishly" to produce Dolby Theatre marquee signage, which should be up within weeks, he said. The former Kodak Theatre is now the Dolby Theatre, thanks to a 20-year naming rights contract with Dolby Laboratories, a company known for its movie sound systems. Dolby's contract is "very directly tied to the Oscars being held in this theatre," meaning the company could get out of the deal if the Academy moved its awards show before 2033, Haidamus said. There had been speculation that the Oscars could move to the newer Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles.
