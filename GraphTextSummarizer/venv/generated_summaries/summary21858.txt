Apple leverages success in retail Apple Stores were conceived as a way for Apple to promote its entire smorgasbord of products and to control their presentation. 'Apple is not typical' As buzz grew about work on a Grand Central Apple Store, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the station, spurned many interview requests -- even months after the store was unveiled at a public meeting in July. Interviews with nearly two dozen people involved in the development of upcoming and recently opened U.S. Apple Stores, including the one in Grand Central, provide a look at Apple's unusually furtive way of doing business. "Apple has enormous momentum, and nowhere is that more evident than in our retail stores," Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the first few minutes of an October news conference to unveil the iPhone 4S. MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan cited Apple's corporate policy, which says it will not cut revenue-sharing agreements for stores.
