In severe conditions, rain water entering the driver's side window can enter the master power window switch, Honda said in a statement Saturday. Because a switch failure and fire could happen even if the car is off, "owners are advised to park outside until the recall repair has been performed," the NHTSA said. Honda is asking affected CR-V owners to go to an authorized dealer to have their master power window switch inspected and repaired or replaced. -- Honda is recalling about 268,000 CR-V vehicles due to concerns about the power window master switch, which could start a fire. Four switch fires -- but no crashes or injuries -- have been reported, Honda said.
