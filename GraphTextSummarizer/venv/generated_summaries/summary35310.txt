It features passenger comforts such as bigger windows, larger overhead bins and better ventilation. United says the 787 -- the airline has ordered 50 -- will "revolutionize the flying experience for our customers and crew while delivering unprecedented operating efficiency, comfort and lower emissions." United says its Dreamliners will include 36 first-class seats, 70 premium-economy seats and 113 economy seats. After years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns, the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes its North American debut Sunday morning, toting more than 200 eager United Airlines passengers from Houston to Chicago. It was put through the paces in October before earning Federal Aviation Administration certification.
