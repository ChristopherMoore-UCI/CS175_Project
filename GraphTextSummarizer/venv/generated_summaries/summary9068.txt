"The recovery in international tourism is good news, especially for those developing countries that rely on the sector for much-needed revenue and jobs," said Taleb Rifai, UNWTO secretary-general. All regions had increased tourist arrivals in 2010 after the 4 percent global decline in tourism in 2009, but Europe and Africa grew more slowly, the Madrid-based UNWTO said in a statement. In 2009, it was only region in the world not to have a decline in international tourism, the UNWTO said. Europe, the world's top destination for international tourism, with 471 million arrivals, grew just 3 percent in 2010, in part due to air traffic disruptions caused by ash from a volcanic eruption in Iceland and "the economic uncertainty affecting the euro zone," the UNWTO said. The slower growth predicted in 2011 is due in part to "persistent high unemployment " in parts of the world, and recent moves by various governments to introduce or increase "taxation on travel as a means of balancing public accounts," the UNWTO said.
