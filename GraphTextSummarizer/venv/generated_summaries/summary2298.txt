And when football is over, he'll try out for the basketball team he's been playing on for three years," Dean Dompierre told CNN Thursday. They were pushing to give the teen, who was held back in kindergarten because of his disability and turned 19 in January, a way around rules that banned students from participating in high school athletics if they turned 19 before September 1. In May, after the Dompierre family's lobbying, the athletic association created a new waiver process, allowing student athletes who turn 19 before September to play sports under "narrowly defined" circumstances. The age restriction is intended to prevent the possibility of injury or competitive advantage from an older, more developed athlete playing against younger students.
