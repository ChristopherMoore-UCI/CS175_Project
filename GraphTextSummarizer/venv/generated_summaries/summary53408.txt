Here are three basic things to know about blimps: -- Blimps belong to a family of aircraft called "airships," defined as aircraft that don't use wings to fly. In addition to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Goodyear's three airships are set to hover over Florida's Orange Bowl, California's Rose Bowl, Arizona's Fiesta Bowl, Louisiana's Sugar Bowl and the National Championship January 6 in Pasadena, California. In 1917, when the U.S. Navy needed airships that included rubberized fabrics and coatings, Goodyear came calling. Beginning in 2014, Goodyear plans to start phasing out its blimps to make room for a new generation of airships: the Zeppelin NTs. So, technically, these new Goodyear airships won't be blimps.
