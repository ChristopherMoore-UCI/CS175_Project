They're considering some legislation that would give the FDA stronger authority and stiffen the rules around counterfeit drugs, and make it easier for us to really track drugs in the system, and enable us to quickly pull inadequate drugs. We also need stronger systems in place, to work with other countries and the international community to trace drugs as they move through the system. Right now 40% of finished drugs Americans take come from other countries, and 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients taken here come from other countries. After the president made an announcement about the importance of drug shortages, and issued an executive order basically asking FDA to call on companies to voluntarily expand their reporting when they think they might have a shortage or a disruption in the drug supply, we've seen an increase of about six times as many reports. As drugs are in shortage, it creates the possibility of new gray markets or illegal markets to fill in those gaps.
