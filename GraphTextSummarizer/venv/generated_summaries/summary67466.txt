Southern right whales are a common sight in Cape Town waters during the breeding season from June to November, drawing whale watchers to the region. Paloma Werner, 50, of the Cape Town Sailing Academy, and her partner Ralph Mothes had been watching the whale from a distance in Table Bay, near Cape Town harbor, when it moved toward their 10-meter vessel and breached 20 meters away. " In future, the couple would make sure they had the engine on while sailing during whale season, she added. "The whale slipped back into the water but we just saw the mast with all its rigging and everything flying towards us, and that was scary, actually." Werner said Mothes ducked behind the steering wheel which bore the impact of the mast. "I looked around and I saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat," Werner told CNN.
