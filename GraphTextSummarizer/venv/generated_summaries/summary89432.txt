At a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty. Barker's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga Fox of "CSI" and "The West Wing," who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals, and taking them off the road. A recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities, and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas, have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals. They beat it, with clubs, fists, black jacks, ax handles, golf clubs. -- Bob Barker, the former host of "The Price Is Right," made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment: the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses.
