In all the hardest-hit areas of Syria -- in Aleppo, in Homs and in Deir Ezzor -- we are doing all we can to reach the hardest to reach children and families with therapeutic foods, water purification supplies, warm clothing, school supplies and textbooks, and other critical assistance as winter descends. In recent months, United Nations convoys, including those led by UNICEF, have been able to cross conflict lines, bringing with them critical supplies to help children suffering from a lack of nutrition and to increase the availability of safe water and improved sanitation. Not even close to enough, when there are up to 2 million people in the troubled city of Aleppo alone -- including 250,000 children and families in eastern Aleppo who are cut off from regular humanitarian assistance. -- Children living in the Syrian city of Aleppo watch the sky. The reality is that an entire generation of Syrian children is at risk, not only from violence itself, but also for want of education, protection and emotional support to help them overcome the trauma they have been suffering for nearly four brutal years.
