Argentinian political leaders and Kirchner family members were on their way Wednesday afternoon to El Calafate to join Cristina Fernandez. TV images showed Kirchner's sister, government minister Alicia Kirchner de Mercado, boarding a small jet airplane in Buenos Aires, the nation's capital. Kirchner, 60, was president from 2003-2007 and was the husband of current President Cristina Fernandez. Supporters say that Argentina's economic growth since then proved that Kirchner's strategy was the right one. Kirchner demonstrated Argentina's independence by forming close ties with presidents with anti-American views, such as Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales.
