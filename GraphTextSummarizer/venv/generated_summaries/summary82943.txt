GirlUp -- United Nations Foundation is a campaign inspiring American girls to take action for girls in countries such as Ethiopia, Guatemala and Liberia who face a lack of access to education and are susceptible to child marriage, high maternal death rates and HIV infection. Yasmin, the girl in Egypt in "Girl Rising," was part of a Plan International USA program helping to keep street girls safe. There are many ways to help girls, like those kidnapped in Nigeria, who face persecution, violence, poverty and other barriers to education. Plan International USA tries to give girls around the world access to food, water, education, financial security and protection from sexual violence and exploitation. "CNN's Girl Rising" was the centerpiece of 10x10, a global campaign to educate and empower girls.
