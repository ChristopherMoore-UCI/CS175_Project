Country kitty turned metropolitan cat, Willow was discovered by a pedestrian on East 20th Street in Manhattan over the weekend and brought to Animal Care and Control of NYC, according to Julie Bank, the animal shelter's executive director. Willow tested positive for a microchip, and her Colorado owners, Chris and Jamie Squires, were later contacted, according to Bank. As for Willow, plans are being made for her to reunite with the Squires, Bank said. "Someone maybe picked her up in Colorado and brought her here; sometimes animals get here oddly, like on the back of a truck," Bank said. "Clearly she has been taken care of or enjoying the New York City food."
