Many showers come annually, in October, December, January and April, said NASA meteor observer Bill Cooke. In August, for example, we will see the return of the spectacular Perseid meteor shower. "Next year, it will tug the debris field away from the Earth, and we won't see a meteor shower, so this is kind of a one-shot deal," Cooke said. Surprise package Cooke said from the start that the Camelopardalids could be a star-studded gala or a dud. "It was a great excuse to spend the night out in a remote area with some good friends and enjoy the night and the first fireflies of the season, which sometimes we would think for a fraction of a second were meteors," he said.
