At least 126 people in Joplin had died due to the storm as of Thursday night, said Newton County Coroner Mark Bridges. Lantz Hare was among those on the list, released Thursday by the Missouri Department of Public Safety, of 232 people from the southwest Missouri city for whom missing persons reports have been filled out. The Hares were among many around Joplin, still desparately searching for missing loved ones and clinging to hope. Writer's family received conflicting reports on the Alzheimer's patient's possible fate, said Leah Mitchell, whose husband is Writer's nephew. They, too, have contacted many hospitals and nursing homes within 200 miles.
