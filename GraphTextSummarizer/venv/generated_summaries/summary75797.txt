"The government is wrong to undermine cultural institutions, which are the backbone of Uganda's heritage," said Mzamiru Balidha, a resident of Kampala. Government officials and the Buganda kingdom have been at odds for years, sparring over land, sovereignty and political power. Though the mood on the streets in the capital city was calm Monday, tensions between Museveni and the Buganda kingdom -- headed by King Ronald Mutebi II, the ruler of the Baganda tribe -- have intensified in recent years. Journalist Samson Ntale in Kampala, Uganda, contributed to this report. Streets in the capital were strewn with debris over the weekend, including torched cars and burned tires.
