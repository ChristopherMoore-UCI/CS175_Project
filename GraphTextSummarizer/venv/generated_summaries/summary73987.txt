Williams junior will start her bid for an 18th grand slam title against world no. 114 Anna Tatishvili -- a Georgian-born player now representing the U.S. Berdych's reward is a second round match with Australia's Bernard Tomic who beat Evgeny Donskoy of Russia 6-4 6-3 6-2. The Spaniard, who lost to Murray in an epic five-set quarterfinal on Center Court 12 months ago, was dumped out in four sets (6-4 4-6 6-4 6-2) on court no. 8 by the Bosnian-born Matosevic. Italy's Fabio Fognini prevailed in a marathon match against America's Alex Kuznetzov out on court no. 18. The big Czech, who reached the 2010 Wimbledon final, lost the opening set on the tiebreak on Court No. 2 before coming back to win in four sets 6-7 (7/5) 6-1 6-4 6-3.
