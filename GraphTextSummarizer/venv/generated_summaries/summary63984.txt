He was released Wednesday and is now in Kabul, Afghanistan, for medical examination and rest, according to a U.S. official not authorized to speak for attribution. "Diyat," a part of Islamic law that is enshrined in Pakistan's penal code, allows victims to pardon a murderer with or without being paid "blood money," said Saeed U Zaman Saddiqi, the former chief justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court. The killings sparked an outcry in the Asian nation, a key U.S. ally in the war against al Qaeda and Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. They also led to tensions between the two nations, with Congress warning Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in U.S. aid were in jeopardy unless he was released. Haider's legal heirs got a  total of $ 1,161,349  in "blood money," records said.
