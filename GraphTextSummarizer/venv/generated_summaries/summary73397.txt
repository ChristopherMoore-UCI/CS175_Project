"Our concept proposes repurposing underutilized infrastructure to provide quick links between existing tube stations and key London landmarks and destinations," said Ian Mulcahey, managing director of Gensler London, the architecture and design firm behind the idea. And TFL recently granted permission for two new sections of "cycle superhighways" which reserve long stretches of London road for cyclists only. " Downes said she would rather see "Dutch style" infrastructure put in place on existing road networks to separate cyclists and heavy traffic. Even if the London Underline idea doesn't take off, he thinks it could be applied to other cities with large underground networks. London Underline -- which won the award for best conceptual project at the London Planning Awards last week -- proposes transforming disused tube tunnels into a network of underground pathways that will reduce the pressure on the city's bustling streets.
