Pamela and Matthew Menz, along with their adult children Justin and Jennifer, were traveling northbound along Interstate 75 early Wednesday morning, when their 2001 Toyota Sienna plowed into the back of the semi. Matthew Menz, who is a truck driver himself, told the 911 dispatcher the truck was in the middle of the road, "going about 2 miles an hour," without flashing hazard lights. Justin Menz, 26, flew forward in his seat when the van hit the semi, causing minor injuries. A shattered windshield, along with near-whiteout snow conditions, prevented Pamela and Matthew Menz from giving the dispatcher a clear description of the semi or their location. "The truck driver had no idea they were back there," Roscommon County Undersheriff Ed Stern said.
