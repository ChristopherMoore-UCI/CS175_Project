-- GLAAD has declared Thursday, October 16, to be #SpiritDay and is asking everyone to wear purple to protest bullying and to show support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth. Fans of the show use the hashtag #Clonesbians in support of its LGBT characters: main character Sarah's foster brother, lesbian clone Cosima and transgender clone Tony. "Observed annually since 2010, individuals, schools, organizations, corporations, and public figures wear purple, which symbolizes 'spirit' on the rainbow flag," GLAAD's site explains. Instead of wearing pink like the Plastics, you can wear purple to support LGBT youth. Several celebrities, including "Orange is the New Black" actress Laverne Cox, have stepped up for #SpiritDay, donning purple clothing or tinting their profile photos purple for the cause.
