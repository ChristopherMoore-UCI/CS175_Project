I don't know if she would have said anything that would have changed that," assistant state attorney Jeff Ashton said on HLN's "Dr. Drew." Casey Anthony's lawyer, meanwhile, said that her acquittal signified justice for little Caylee Anthony, 2, who prosecutors unsuccessfully argued died at the hands of her mother. Defense attorneys maintained the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool on June 16, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. "Caylee would never have wanted her mother to suffer this way," defense attorney Jose Baez told Barbara Walters of ABC News. -- A prosecutor in the Casey Anthony trial said Wednesday that jurors might have acquitted her even if she had opened herself up to a tough cross-examination by taking the stand. Ashton told InSession that Casey Anthony showed premeditation by "her leaving with Caylee and her never being seen again."
