"It is time that our society's traditional thinking that disconnects old age and sex be revisited," says Ruth S. Jacobowitz, author of "150 Most-Asked Questions About Midlife Sex, Love, and Intimacy." • Competitive and recreational sports programs, such as Sports for Active Seniors in Madison, Wisconsin, and the West Virginia Senior Sports Classic, target active older adults. But there are many ways for older Americans to meet and get to know one another, many geared specifically to their cohort: • Online dating and social networking sites, like BOOMj.com, SeniorFriendFinder.com, Match.com and eHarmony.com help seniors find like-minded people with whom they can connect. Just as older Americans aren't letting the years stop them from dating, they're not letting it end their sex lives, either. The NIA doesn't break down transmission rates among this demographic -- for example, through drug use, heterosexual or homosexual contact -- but the institute does point out that older adults in general tend to know less than younger Americans about how HIV/AIDS is transmitted and the necessity of using condoms.
