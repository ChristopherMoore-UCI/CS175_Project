In a statement Sunday, De Boer laid out the three layers of action on which he would like governments to agree during the summit: immediate action on climate change, ambitious commitments to cut and limit emissions, and "a long-term shared vision on a low-emissions future for all. "There appears to be an emerging consensus that a core element of the Copenhagen accord should be to mobilize $10 billion a year by 2012 to support adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, particularly the most vulnerable and least developed countries that could be destabilized by the impacts of climate change," it said. "Within two weeks from Monday, governments must give their adequate response to the urgent challenge of climate change," said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Climate Change Conference. -- The United States and China have not offered to go far enough to combat climate change, a top European Union official said as a major international summit on the subject opened Monday. Jonathan Pershing, U.S. deputy special envoy for climate change, defended Obama's late attendance, saying the country's goals extended beyond the summit.
