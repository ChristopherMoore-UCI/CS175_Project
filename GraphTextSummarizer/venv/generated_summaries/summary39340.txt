"I want to thank the pioneering women who years ago opened the doors of politics in Costa Rica," Laura Chinchilla said Sunday to flag-waving supporters in the capital, San Jose. The legacy of outgoing President Oscar Arias -- a Nobel laureate who leaves office a popular, if polarizing, leader -- has in many ways shaped the presidential race. In addition to voting for president, Costa Ricans cast ballots for two vice presidents, 57 Congress members and 495 council members. -- Costa Rica elected its first female president, as the ruling National Liberation Party claimed a historic victory. The festivities included election sites where children could vote in a mock presidential vote.
