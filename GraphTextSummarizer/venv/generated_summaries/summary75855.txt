There were videocameras in the area that the FBI is reviewing, El Paso FBI spokeswoman Andrea Simmons said. "This shooting across the border appears to have been a grossly disproportionate response and flies in the face of international standards which compel police to use firearms only as a last resort, in response to an immediate, deadly threat that cannot be contained through lesser means," said Susan Lee, Americas director at Amnesty International, in a statement Wednesday on the organization's website. The shooting comes less than two weeks after the May 31 death of a Mexican illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in California. Border Patrol agents responded to a call of a possible immigrant smuggling taking place on the border, the FBI said. Simmons said the FBI will decline further comment until the investigation is complete.
