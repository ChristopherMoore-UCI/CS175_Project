"Considering the incapacity of the regime in effectively fighting against terrorism and restoring dignity to the Malian people, using its constitutional rights, the armed forces of Mali, along with other security forces, have decided to take on their responsibilities to put an end to this incompetent regime of President Amadou Toumani Toure," said Konare. Konare, the spokesman for the soldiers who claim they've taken control, said Mali security forces have formed the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDRE) to work as a transitional government. The latest uprising began to take root late last year but gained momentum in January, when the rebels began attacking towns in northern Mali. The U.N. spokesman predicted that the coup would only worsen the security situation in northern Mali, and further empower the rebels. Yet the next day, Lynn Pascoe, the United Nation's Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, stated that "clearly a coup d'eta has been carried out" -- a development that drew sharp criticism from other nations like the United States and France, Mali's former colonial ruler.
