North Korea also threatened to fire on sites in South Korea where activists and politicians have released balloons carrying propaganda leaflets and DVDs showing anti-government protests across the Middle East and northern Africa. North Korea shelled Yeongpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians, last November. The North often issues such warnings before military drills, but tensions are higher after November's shelling and the March sinking of the South Korean warship, Cheonan, which the South blames on the North. North Korea's military said Sunday it would retaliate with "an all-out offensive to put an end to the U.S. imperialists' military occupation of South Korea." -- U.S.-South Korean joint military drills kick off Monday, one day after North Korea threatened to engulf Seoul in a "sea of flames."
