"It's just kind of shocking to have somebody that seemed so full of life and invincible taken so suddenly," said Creighton medical student Justin McCarthy, KETV reported. Roger Brumback was a professor in the pathology and neurology departments at Creighton University. After 12 years at Creighton, where he had served as chairman of the Department of Pathology, Brumback had recently announced he would retire next month and move to West Virginia. "When I heard the news last night, I was literally shaken," Laura Neece-Baltaro, a friend of the Brumback family, told CNN affiliate KETV. All four victims had ties to the pathology department at Creighton University Medical School.
