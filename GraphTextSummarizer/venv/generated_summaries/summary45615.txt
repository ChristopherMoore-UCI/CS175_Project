-- These are tumultuous times for Tunisian tennis player Malek Jaziri. Professionally Jaziri has never looked back since the Tunisian revolution, which sparked the region's Arab Spring and toppled the regime of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.. "During the war Roland Garros crashed his plane in Bizerte, the town where I play," said Jaziri, referring to the renowned French pilot, who was a keen tennis player and whom the stadium that hosts the French Open was named after. At the start of the revolution Jaziri was ranked 342nd; by the end of 2011 he was up to 150th; and now, following this week's release of the latest rankings, the Tunisian has climbed to 67th after recording his first win at Wimbledon. "I decided to come back from living in Barcelona to practise," Jaziri told CNN, as he recalled the events that led to Ben Ali's fall.
