-- A day after a New York guest house was pummeled online for its policy of fining wedding parties for negative online reviews, its owner has apologized. Union Street Guest House owner Chris Wagoner admitted the fine was a company policy, but it isn't anymore. Hundreds of people took to Yelp.com on Monday to complain about the Union Street Guest House's policy of fining wedding parties $500 for any negative online reviews posted by members of their groups. Guests who mention the Facebook apology letter will get a 10% discount on stays at the guest house within the next three months, Wagoner wrote. " It was intended as a joke, "never something I told employees to enforce," Wagoner wrote on the hotel's Facebook page.
