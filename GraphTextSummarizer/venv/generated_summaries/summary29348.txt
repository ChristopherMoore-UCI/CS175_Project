Inter Milan has been hit with a $58,600 by UEFA after being found guilty of "improper conduct" following allegations its fans racially abused Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor. " Inter has already been punished in domestic competition after the Italian football authorities found its fans guilty of racially abusing former players Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari, who now play for fierce rival AC Milan. Lazio was punished with a $52,000 fine in February on the back of the $230,000 it was forced to pay for racist abuse and other offenses during two group stage games against Tottenham and Slovenian side Maribor. The Togolese striker, who scored a precious away goal to take Tottenham through to the next round during last month's Europa League tie, appeared to be subjected to monkey chants, while a fan was also seen with an inflatable banana. The club was fined $65,500 for the incident which took place in March, while it was also forced to pay out $22,700 after fans sang racist chants about Balotelli during a Serie A game against Chievo.
