Today she was back doing royal duties for her charity Action on Addiction at Hope House in Clapham, South London. Kate has her detractors -- many Internet trolls label her work shy -- but I am surprised someone of Mantel's stature has joined in this pastime, attacking Kate for no apparent reason. Perhaps all that time writing about Tudor princesses has led her to lose her head -- like so many Tudor heroines. The venomous attack on the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge by author Hilary Mantel calling her bland and "machine made" is a cheap publicity stunt. For somebody who is relatively new to royal engagements, Kate has performed with aplomb.
