Bain was convicted in 1974 of taking a 9-year-old Lake Wales, Florida, boy from his bed and raping him. Of the 245 people in the United States who have been exonerated by DNA testing, none has spent more time behind bars than Bain, according to the Innocence Project, a national organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted people through DNA testing. Bain's mother said that while her son was in prison he "turned away from God, because he thought God abandoned him." -- After more than three decades in prison, a man in Florida was set free Thursday after a DNA test showed he did not kidnap and rape a 9-year-old boy in 1974.
