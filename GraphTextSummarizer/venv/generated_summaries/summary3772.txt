-- Kanye West called Taylor Swift with a "very sincere" apology Tuesday for interrupting her acceptance speech at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, Swift said. " West's appearance on the prime-time premiere of "The Jay Leno Show" capped a 24-hour period that began Sunday evening with him strolling down the red carpet at New York's Radio City Music Hall while gulping from a bottle of cognac. When Grant told Leno "I did a bad thing," it gave Leno's "Tonight Show" a viewership bump that has been credited with solidifying his lead over rival David Letterman in the late-night ratings war. Kanye West called Taylor Swift to apologize for hijacking her speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The timing of West's antics came at a good time for Leno, who embarked on a new era of his career Monday.
