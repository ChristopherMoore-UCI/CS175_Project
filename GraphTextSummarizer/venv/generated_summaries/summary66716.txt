The other two quarterfinals pit hosts New Zealand against Argentina, while reigning world champions South Africa come up against Australia. -- England wing Delon Armitage and French center Fabrice Estebanez have been suspended ahead of their two sides' Rugby World Cup quarterfinal clash in New Zealand next Saturday. On Estebanez, a statement on the four-yearly competition's official website read: "Estebanez was suspended by Independent Judicial Officer Christopher Quinlan QC (England) in accordance with the Rugby World Cup 2011 Disciplinary process. Armitage, 27, received a one-week ban for a challenge on fullback Chris Paterson during England's 16-12 defeat of Scotland on Saturday. Armitage, who is yet to register a try in this year's tournament, is the second England player to receive a ban, after lock Courtney Lawes received a two-match suspension for recklessly striking an opponent during a clash with Argentina.
