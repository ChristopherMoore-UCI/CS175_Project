According to a paper in the scientific journal Nature, a team led by Stanford electrical engineer Shanhui Fan has come up with a material that can radiate heat away from buildings and send it directly into space. "This team has shown how to passively cool structures by simply radiating heat into the cold darkness of space," Nobel Prize-winning physicist Burton Richter, a Stanford professor emeritus, told the Stanford Report. The Stanford team calls it "photonic radiative cooling," and if the material is applied to surfaces such as rooftops, it could help lower the need for air conditioning. "Think about it like having a window into space," Fan told the Stanford Report. Radiating our heat directly into space could help solve a number of problems on Earth, Fan told the Stanford Report.
