" CBS News President Richard Salant met with Cronkite, who initially resisted, then agreed to change his sign-off, Socolow said. Sanford "Sandy" Socolow, who worked at CBS News for 32 years, more than four of them as Cronkite's producer, said Cronkite ran into trouble soon after he took over for Douglas Edwards in the "CBS Evening News" anchor chair. " Though the two men were cordial, and it was Murrow who had brought Cronkite to CBS, "they were never drinking buddies," Socolow said. "The suits -- as we used to call them -- went crazy," Socolow told CNN, referring to CBS executives. Throughout his career as a television anchorman, Walter Cronkite had a few memorable run-ins with other powerful figures at CBS News, one of his producers told CNN.
