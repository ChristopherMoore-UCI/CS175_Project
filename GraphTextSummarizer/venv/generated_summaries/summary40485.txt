Smith has opened restaurants in New York and Washington, D.C., authored cookbooks and released a line of home goods. The 65-year-old, who has Alzheimer's disease, was last seen taking a jitney from New York to the Hamptons on Tuesday, reports CNN affliate WABC. By Wednesday afternoon, Smith was found by her daughter at a restaurant in New York City, not far from a former residence, WABC reports. It appears that Smith got off the jitney at the wrong stop, and then returned to New York. The groundbreaking talent, who in 1976 became one of the first African-American women to land the cover of Mademoiselle magazine, opened up to CBS' "Sunday Morning" in June about being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
