Approximately 60 percent of stalking victims don't report to the police, according to the Justice Department study. So trying to solve stalking cases through legal means is like trying to clear a roach problem without getting rid of the food lying around. A new study published this month by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated based on a survey that 3.4 million Americans per year are victims of stalking. It is becoming an epidemic -- 1.4 million Americans were stalked a decade ago, according to a similar Justice Department study, and new technology is partly responsible for the increase. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be stalked, and two thirds of female victims are stalked by males.
