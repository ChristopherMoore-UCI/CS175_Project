Russian President Vladimir Putin recently presented a seven-point road map to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, though that plan was quickly dismissed by Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a rescue plan for pro-Moscow rebels. "What counts is what is actually happening on the ground," said Rasmussen, who accused Russia of having thousands of troops inside Ukraine who have fired on Ukrainian military positions. But they say they haven't sent Russian troops into the war-torn region in eastern Ukraine -- a claim that Poroshenko, Rasmussen and their allies aren't buying. Many more Russian troops control the border with Ukraine for thousands of miles -- from Rostov to Donetsk, the U.S. officials say. " Rebels: Open to ceasefire with 'a political settlement' Rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions said in a joint statement Thursday that they would be prepared to order a ceasefire as of 3 p.m. Friday "if agreements are achieved and Ukrainian officials sign a plan for a political settlement of the conflict."
