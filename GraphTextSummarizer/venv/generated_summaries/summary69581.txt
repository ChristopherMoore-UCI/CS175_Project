In other games, Napoli and Juventus booked Europa League places. Bryan Ruiz and Miroslav Stoch scored the Twente goals to clinch the championship and a Champions League place. In the Netherlands, FC Twente sealed the Dutch title with a 2-0 win over NAC Breda to leave them one point ahead of Ajax, who beat NEC Nijmegen 4-0. It is a remarkable triumph for a side managed by former England boss Steve McClaren who could not match the spending power of their Amsterdam rivals. Earlier, Sampdoria and Palermo both won to stay locked in the battle for the fourth and final Champions League qualifying place.
