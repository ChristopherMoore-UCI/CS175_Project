Malek Jandali says his parents -- Dr. Mamoun Jandali, 73, and Linah Droubi 66 -- have been among such family members targeted. Jandali, an American citizen living in Atlanta, says he believes security forces targeted his family because of his pro-opposition performances. Citing reports of wounded demonstrators seized by security forces, Jandali said he has been asked to treat people in their homes because they are afraid to go to the hospitals. The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Friday that "prominent human rights defenders, inside and outside the country" and "families and sympathizers of the protesters" are reported to have been targeted by security forces. A recent Human Rights Watch report has accounts of security force hospital raids.
