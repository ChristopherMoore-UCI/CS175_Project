The 30-year-old, whose star has fallen since being named the planet's best player in 2004 and 2005 while with Spanish club Barcelona, has left Italian league leaders AC Milan with six months left to run on his contract. Tottenham's English rivals unveiled Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko on Tuesday, having completed his reported $42 million move from German club Wolfsburg last Friday. The main Brazilian league kicks off again in May, with 2009 champions Flamengo seeking to bounce back after a disappointing 14th-place finish last year. "We are pleased to announce the hiring of Ronaldinho for the next four years," Flamengo president Patricia Amorim told the club's official website. AC Milan have allowed United States defender Oguchi Onyewu to join Dutch champions Twente until the end of this season.
