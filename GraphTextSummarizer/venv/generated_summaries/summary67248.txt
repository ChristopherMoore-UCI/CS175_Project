The ashes haven't reached Mexico City International Airport, airport officials said in Twitter posts. Popocatepetl volcano has let out nearly 100 bursts of steam, gas and ash in the past 24 hours, the National Center of Disaster Prevention said. At the nearby Toluca International Airport outside Mexico City, Spirit Airlines canceled flights to and from Ft. Lauderdale and Dallas. -- Rumblings from Mexico's most well known volcano forced several U.S. airlines to cancel flights in the country's capital on Thursday. In April, authorities barred people from getting close to the volcano after a series of explosion and expulsions of ash and gas.
