Burberry became a must-have fashion accessory of British football hooligans, but in recent years has re-branded itself and profits have flowed. But with respect to Federer and Sharapova, they still have some way to go before matching the sartorial successes of the legendary Fred Perry, and Rene Lacoste, one of the famous "Four Musketeers" from France. Beware the 'Burberry disease' But both Fred Perry and Lacoste have suffered from what branding expert Jez Frampton called the "Burberry disease" -- namely being solely associated with a certain group of people, who were not highly regarded. Frampton, the Global CEO of Interbrand Group, believes the continued success of Fred Perry and Lacoste owes much to their legendary status in the game but also to their brand positioning. Like Sharapova, his endorsement of other brands such as Diadora trainers and Fila sportswear massively boosted their profits and helped establish the companies as major industry players.
