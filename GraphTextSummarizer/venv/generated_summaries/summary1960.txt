The divisions between smartphones, home automation, cars, smart glasses and watches and fitness trackers will fall away, and our gadgets and data will work together for a seamless experience. This is Google's first major foray into connected homes, and news of the deal ignited a flurry of speculation about what the Silicon Valley giant really wants from Nest, as well as some privacy concerns. Google has cultivated a diverse and seemingly random set of interests since starting out as a search engine and advertising company. Google has access to a person's data through the Chrome browser, Gmail accounts, Google search terms and the many advanced sensors on an Android smartphone. "It's amazing to see how they have taken important but unloved devices and made them beautifully simple and useful," said Google CEO Larry Page in a brief post announcing the deal.
