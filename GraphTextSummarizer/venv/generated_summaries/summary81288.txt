Several friends in the UK got fed up with the government's stingy approach to data distribution (Ordnance Survey has crafted ultra-detailed maps of the UK with public funds, but that data must be licensed for private use), and decided to do something about it. Where available, baseline map data was imported from open datasets, like the US government's TIGER data from the Census Bureau. " CloudMade hopes to profit by offering free access to its platform in exchange for a cut of ad revenue from free applications (devs can also pay upfront if they want). But location services were exploding, and all were premised on mapping data. A street-level map of the world might sound audacious, but OpenStreetMap has exploded in popularity-after starting with a few friends, more than 250,000 have now contributed mapping data to the project.
