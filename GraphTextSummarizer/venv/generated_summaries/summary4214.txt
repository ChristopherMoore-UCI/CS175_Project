The queen was accompanied to the service by her husband, Prince Philip, as well as her son Prince Charles and her grandchildren, among them Princes William and Harry. -- Members of the royal family, UK government and dignitaries gathered Tuesday in Westminster Abbey for a service to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. After the service, the queen and Philip stepped out into brilliant sunshine amid the tolling of bells, climbing into a glass-topped limousine for the return journey to Buckingham Palace. There have been 38 coronations at Westminster Abbey since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in his reading paid tribute to the queen's "60 years of commitment" and service since she was crowned.
