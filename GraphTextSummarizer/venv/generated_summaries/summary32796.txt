-- Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah is in the lead with four-fifths of the votes counted in Afghanistan's landmark presidential elections, the country's Independent Election Commission said Thursday. With 82.6% of the votes counted, Abdullah, a former foreign minister, has 43.8% of the vote, Independent Election Commission chief Mohammad Yousuf Nooristani said at a news conference Thursday. About 7 million Afghans voted on April 5 to choose a successor to outgoing President Hamid Karzai, in what will be the country's first democratic transfer of presidential power. Karzai, who is constitutionally required to step down, has refused to sign an agreement to keep international forces in Afghanistan, also known as the Status of Forces Agreement. Ashraf Ghani, with 32.9% of the vote, is in second place, he said, while Zalmai Rasoul is in third place with 11.1% of the vote.
