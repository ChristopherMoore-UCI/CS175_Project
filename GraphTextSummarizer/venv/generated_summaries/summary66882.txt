Ward is the founder of Have Justice Will Travel, a group that works to end the generational cycle of abuse by giving free legal representation and support services to isolated -- and often desperate -- low-income people and their children. "But instead, I learned that I could be more helpful working in family law, where women and children really needed the help and where I could be there for them on a daily basis." Ward became a volunteer victim's advocate and worked with her family members to convict her brother for abusing the child in her family. Driving herself into the most remote areas of Vermont, Ward said she's been able to reach victims who otherwise wouldn't have access to support services. "For domestic violence victims in rural areas, it can be very devastating," Ward said. Ward works closely with victims' advocacy groups to help provide a "complete package," including shelters, hot line information, housing, clothing and legal support.
