Iraqi legal advisers have informed the government of their "unambiguous opinions" regarding the law and executing the three men without approval of the presidency council "would violate Iraqi law and, arguably, international law binding upon individual Iraqi officials," the official said. The three were to be executed in October, 30 days after their appeals were exhausted, but the three members of Iraq's presidency council have not signed the execution orders, as Iraqi law requires. Iraqi law requires the three members of Iraq's presidency council sign the execution warrants, but the law doesn't explain what happens if leaders don't sign the warrants. The U.S. military said Tuesday it had killed a high-ranking al Qaeda in Iraq operative who had been an adviser to the group's leader, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, and to its former leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in a U.S.-led coalition raid last year. A Western official close to the case said last month that Iraqi courts have not addressed whether the council's inaction constitutes a de facto pardon or a stay of execution, but al-Maliki has said the ruling was upheld by an appellate court and should be carried out regardless of the signatures.
