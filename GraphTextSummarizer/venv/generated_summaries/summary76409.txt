This new twist on the old rip-off scheme of land speculation started when cons took advantage of a Utah land rush and bought up property that was parched and desolate. I'll also warn you about common pitfalls, including burglar alarm monitoring and home warranties and other things that are way out there, like electronic mortgage fraud. Before you buy: Short sales and deeds in lieu are the new foreclosures Whether you're a buyer or a seller, a short sale or a deed in lieu of foreclosure may present a way to get out from underneath an upside-down house or get a great deal on distressed real estate. While short sales were once considered more favorable than foreclosures, now both harm your credit to the same degree, lowering your score by roughly 140 to 150 points. In today's market, deeds in lieu offer what I believe is a better alternative to short sales for sellers.
