-- A Taliban attack in southern Afghanistan killed eight officers and completely destroyed a police post, a provincial spokesman said Wednesday. "It is now clear that a policeman from the post had contacts with the Taliban who invited the Taliban to conduct the attack," the spokesman said. At least three more officers were injured in the Tuesday night attack near Lashkar Gah in Helmand province, according to Daud Ahmadi, the spokesman. He said the policeman fled with the Taliban. On Tuesday morning, it targeted a bakery, killing two civilians and injuring 26 others, including officers collecting bread.
