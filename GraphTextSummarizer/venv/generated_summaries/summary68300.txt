People who take pain or sleeping pills and drink a couple glasses of wine are playing Russian roulette. In the United States, we now prescribe enough pain pills to give every man, woman and child one every four hours, around the clock, for three weeks. In fact, the person who really brought the issue to my attention was former President Bill Clinton. Throughout my career, I have traveled the world and seen problems so intransigent that I thought solutions would never come. And even though they are no longer providing much pain relief, they can still diminish the body's drive to breathe.
