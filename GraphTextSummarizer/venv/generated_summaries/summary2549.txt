SpaceX and United Space Alliance, the two likely U.S. companies -- operate regular launches at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Antares rocket and Cygnus cargo spacecraft had been set to carry roughly 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments to the International Space Station. Last week, a company spokesman said the unmanned rocket, which exploded in a fireball at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, was deliberately destroyed after it became apparent there was a problem. Despite what Thompson described as a "setback," the company plans to stay on track with its $1.9 billion NASA contract delivering cargo to the space station, he said. "Current evidence strongly suggest that one of the two AJ26 main engines that powered Antares' first stage failed about 15 seconds after ignition," Thompson said in a conference call with investors.
