-- A cruise ship attendant claimed in a federal lawsuit that John Travolta sexually assaulted him during a Caribbean cruise in 2009, according to court documents filed last week. " Another lawsuit, filed by two male massage therapists in April, accused Travolta of sexual assault at hotels in Los Angeles and Atlanta. Gloria Allred sued over Travolta accusers Singer called those charges "ridiculous" and denied media reports the actor had considered paying to settle the lawsuit. Travolta's lawyer said the actor is confident he will "prevail on the merits and that he will be completely vindicated in court. "Travolta proceeded to forcefully embrace plaintiff," it said, "causing plaintiff to continue to experience pain, shock, embarrassment, distress and fear."
