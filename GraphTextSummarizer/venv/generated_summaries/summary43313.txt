And he's become a more outspoken critic of President Barack Obama on immigration in recent months, framing his own experience governing a border state as a competent alternative to Obama's handling of the nation's immigration problems. " "It is bad public policy, and the American people are not for it," Perry added, calling on Congress to send various immigration reform measures to Obama's desk to put him on record explaining his opposition to any such reforms. -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in an interview released Wednesday that he was "a bit arrogant" when he launched his ultimately failed bid for president in 2011, but that after spending nearly two years "in preparation" for another, he feels "substantially more prepared to run." Perry told The Washington Post that he may have drawn undue confidence because of his experience as governor of an expansive and economically influential state. Those preparations have included multiple trips abroad and chats with policy experts, including former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. The governor said that experience would be part of his main pitch as he runs again, something he said Americans won't find in "another relatively young, inexperienced United States senator or a congressman for that matter." Perry, if he does run, will likely face a wide array of challengers for the GOP nomination, many of them members of the U.S. House or Senate.
