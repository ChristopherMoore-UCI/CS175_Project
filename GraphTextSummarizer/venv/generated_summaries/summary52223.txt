Some counterterrorism experts believe that Droukdel suspected Belmoktar of a role in the Benghazi attack and was anxious that such a high-profile operation would promote a severe backlash from the United States, setting back AQIM's efforts to establish a foothold in Mali and Libya. That source told CNN that the call  was made specifically to Moktar Belmoktar, leader of an al Qaeda faction based in northern Mali. Pentagon releases official timeline of Benghazi attack One of the sources says the phone call was discovered when a Western intelligence service trawled through intercepts of communications made in the wake of the attack. According to the sources, he met a Libyan veteran of jihad in Afghanistan who had set up camps near Sabha in southern Libya providing training for jihadists from Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and Mali as well as Libyans and ethnic Tuaregs. Soon after the Benghazi attack, Belmoktar was relieved of his position as emir of the Sahel and a deputy leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
