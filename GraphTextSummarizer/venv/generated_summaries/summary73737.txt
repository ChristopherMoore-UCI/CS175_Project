Among them are "bucket list" (popularized by the eponymous movie), "gassed" (a slang word meaning drained of energy), and Oprah Winfrey's signature phrase, "aha moment" (a moment of sudden realization, inspiration, insight, recognition, or comprehension). Here are the other added words: -- copernicium -- energy drink -- game changer -- gastropub -- mash-up "Some of the new words this year provide colorful images," said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster editor-at-large. The freshly added vocabulary also reflects a defining event of our time -- the global financial crisis: "Systemic risk" (the risk that the failure of one financial institution could cause other interconnected institutions to fail and harm the economy as a whole). And "sexting" (the sending of sexually explicit messages or images by cell phone).
