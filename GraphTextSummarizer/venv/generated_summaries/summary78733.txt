As Scott sank the winning putt on the 10th at Augusta he banished the pain and heartache that had haunted him following his humiliating collapse at Royal Lytham in July. But this time, Scott got the job done, and the Adelaide-born player was quick to praise the man who had come so close at Augusta in years gone by. Scott, the first Australian to ever wear the famous green jacket, defeated Argentina's Angel Cabrera on the second hole of the playoff after both men finished at nine-under on an enthralling day at Augusta. But with the eyes of the sporting world upon him, Scott showed nerves of steel to hole his putt and finally end Australia's Augusta curse. Norman lost out to Augusta native Larry Mize in a playoff in 1987, just a year after his bogey at the 18th allowed Jack Nicklaus to win his 18th and final major.
