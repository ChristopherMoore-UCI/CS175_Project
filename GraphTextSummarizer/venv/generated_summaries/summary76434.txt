Military personnel can reserve post facilities for private events such as weddings or other ceremonies, Human Rights Campaign spokesman Charles Joughin said. " Rep. Todd Akin, a Missouri Republican whose office said has been working "to protect traditional marriage on military bases," said the ceremony was "clearly in contravention of state law and also violates the Defense Department policies issued last fall. The "private religious ceremony" took place at Fort Polk in Louisiana in May, post spokesman Scott Stearns said, but he would confirm few other details. Fleming and Akin both called for the passage of legislation that prevents military facilities from being used for same-sex marriages or marriage-like ceremonies. " "It is very concerning that a same-sex ceremony would occur on a military base in a state where the definition of marriage has been clearly defined as between one man and one woman," Akin said.
