"For example, we didn't have a place where we could buy strings, so we used bicycle cable for the strings. " Diangienda says that when the orchestra started out they didn't have enough instruments to go around, so musicians often had to pool money together to buy used ones. " Ultimately, Diangienda says his biggest dream is to create a music school that will enable local musicians to export the country's rich culture through classical music. In the heart of Kinshasa, the frenzied capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, classical music has found an unlikely band of heroes. Passionate about the likes of Beethoven and Handel, the Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste is a musical ensemble of some 200 enthusiastic men and women, eager to make their voices heard and follow their dream of making classical music.
