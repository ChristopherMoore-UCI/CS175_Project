"There are many children who have succeeded; there is a story of one child whose job was to steal -- he was caught and put into prison but now he's an artist, a singer; there is another one who now is taking care of other street children -- he has an education center; there is another one who is now in Canada; another one is in South Africa. "That's why I do my best to protect them so that they don't end up in prison or in armed groups -- they go because they are without hope." Giving children a voice Ntahe, 58, has been an outspoken advocate for Burundi's children for several decades now. "Street children do not get enough to eat, they can spend two days without eating," says Ntahe. After realizing how conflict was pushing children into violent crime, she decided to give them a voice by creating a show about young people and possibly convince them of a better life. During the war, when thousands of people were displaced to refugee camps in neighboring countries, Ntahe used her radio program "Parlons Avec Les Enfants" -- or "Speaking With Children" -- to comfort those fleeing to Rwanda, Tanzania and DR Congo.
