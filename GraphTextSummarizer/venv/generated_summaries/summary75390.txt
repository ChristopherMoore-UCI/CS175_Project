Morocco is slated to host the African Cup of Nations, organized by the Confederation of African Football [CAF],  in January next year. South Africa and Ghana have already said they are not prepared to host the African Cup of Nations in January. The 16 team competition has run since 1957 and the north African country has spent millions of dollars upgrading its stadiums for the event as well as December's FIFA Club World Cup. The Moroccan government has urged African soccer's governing body to delay its flagship bi-annual continental competition over fears that it could help to spread Ebola. But the outbreak of ebola in west Africa, which has claimed at least 5,000 lives, has raised fears in Morocco that traveling fans and players could help to spread the disease further.
