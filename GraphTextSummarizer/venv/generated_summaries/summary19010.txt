"He was carrying a lighter and pouring himself with petrol," said Inspector Bill Munnee with the West Australian Police. Police had received a report that the man and some others were sniffing glue, Munnee said. -- A man, who doused himself with gasoline and charged at an officer, burst into flames when he was hit with a Taser, police in Australia said Tuesday. When he ignored the officer's command to stop, the officer fired his Taser stun gun -- and the man "caught alight," Munnee said. While the officer tried to put out the fire, a woman from inside the house threw rocks at him, Munnee said.
