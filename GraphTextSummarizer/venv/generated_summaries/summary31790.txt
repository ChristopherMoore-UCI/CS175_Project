"If our economy is controlled by outsiders, similarly the politics will be controlled by outsiders," added Mugabe, who has been at loggerheads with the West after it imposed targeted sanctions on him and senior officials of his Zanu PF party in 2002, following reports of human rights abuses and rigged elections. -- President Robert Mugabe said Thursday that Zimbabwe will go ahead with the takeover of foreign-owned companies, a scheme that has rattled investors, and warned Western countries to stop interfering in his country's affairs. The two-year-old coalition government of the resource-rich state published regulations in March giving mining companies 45 days to set out their plans for transferring ownership stakes to "indigenous" Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe's indigenization law, described as ruinous by Mugabe's partners in the country's fragile coalition, compels foreign firms to cede at least 51 percent of shareholding to black locals. The policy has been opposed by his coalition partner and political foe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change.
