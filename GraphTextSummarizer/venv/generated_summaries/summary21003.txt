Pew reports that the number of black grandparents serving as primary caregivers fell 12% between 2000 and 2008, but the number of white grandparents spiked 19%. The number of Hispanic grandparents becoming caregivers rose 14% during that eight-year period. About 5% of black children are raised by a grandparent, a figure the Census Bureau says has remained constant since 1991. If more young people are weighing their life options -- with fewer "babies having babies" -- fewer grandparents are raising their grandchildren, right? According to Pew, 53% of grandparent caregivers are white, 24% are black, 18% are Hispanic and 3% are Asian.
