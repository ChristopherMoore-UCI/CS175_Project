In cancer drug battle, both sides appeal to ethics But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as they did to Josh Hardy. Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not "in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources." The company would have to dish out $50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn't usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. But currently doctors don't really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don't help get the drug to market. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug.
