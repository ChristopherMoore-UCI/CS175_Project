"We're hoping these winning proposals find their way to the marketplace soon, and will provide relief to millions of American consumers harassed by these calls," said Charles Harwood, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Serdar Danis and Aaron Foss will each receive $25,000 for their "real breakthrough solutions" which focus on "intercepting and filtering out illegal prerecorded calls," according to the FTC. "Even if someone is not on the Do-Not-Call Registry, it's still illegal to place calls without expressed written authorization." This second line would identify and hang up on illegal robocalls before they could ring through to the user,"  explained Harwood. It is a "cloud-based solution that would use 'simultaneous ringing,' which allows incoming calls to be routed to a second telephone line.
