I decided to test that claim because I grew up in the West Baltimore community where "The Wire" is set. Some of "The Wire" is real, but not in the ways you might expect. "The Wire" did, however, nail one childhood memory for me. The most realistic moment in "The Wire" for me didn't take place during any violent showdown. When I was asked in high school to join an academic team that would compete on television against elite, white high schools in Baltimore, I said no.
