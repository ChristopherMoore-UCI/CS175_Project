The roster could be stronger if Republican stars like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker jump in. If Perry couldn't handle competitors like Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and other candidates in what was considered a weak Republican field last time out, would he fare any better in 2016? If Perry runs again, his first big test with Republican voters would be in Iowa, where the caucuses traditionally kick off the presidential nominating calendar for voters. Advisers hint at future as Perry exits as governor CNN National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta asked Perry after the event about his plans for time off. And a successful Perry presidential campaign would certainly be that," added Strawn.
