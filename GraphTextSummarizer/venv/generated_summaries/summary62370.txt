Sandra Bullock, who probably did not play a lot of football in school, won an Oscar for 2009's "The Blind Side," in which she demonstrates to future NFL star Michael Oher how to throw a block. It looks back on a November 23, 1968, football game unforgettable to everybody involved in it, including a Harvard lineman you might have seen in another movie or two, Tommy Lee Jones. Football gets talked about a lot, but a football movie, it is not. The movie itself had nothing to do with football. Oher later wondered "why the director chose to show me as someone who had to be taught the game of football."
