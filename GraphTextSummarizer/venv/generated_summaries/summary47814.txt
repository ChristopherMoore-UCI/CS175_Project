-- Boxing great Joe Frazier was laid to rest Monday in Philadelphia, one week after dying of liver cancer and four decades after capturing the world's attention in an epic showdown with Muhammad Ali. Ali was among those at Frazier's private funeral at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church, along with other boxing luminaries such as promoter Don King and current World Boxing Council champion Bernard Hopkins, video from CNN affiliate CSN Philly showed. Nutter earlier called Frazier the "quintessential Philadelphia boxer." "You could hear him coming, snorting and grunting and puffing, like a steam engine climbing a steep grade," Bill Lyon wrote in a Philadelphia Inquirer column about Frazier, who was nicknamed "Smokin' Joe." Over his career, the former two-time heavyweight champion became a legend in his own right and personified the gritty working-class style of his hard-knuckled adopted hometown, Philadelphia -- the setting for the "Rocky" film series, starring Sylvester Stallone as hardscrabble boxer Rocky Balboa. Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter were also in attendance.
