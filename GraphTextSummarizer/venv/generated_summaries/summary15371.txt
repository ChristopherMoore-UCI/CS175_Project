Opinion: Women gain wider access to power And with their votes in Tuesday's election, women sent important messages to President Obama and to leaders of both parties. A Washington Post Tracking Poll seemed to confirm this: 26% of women nationally -- more than men, at 18% -- reported that Obama's handling of the hurricane response would be a major factor in determining their vote for president. Politicians take note: Women are often motivated by different things than men. Women, more than men, worry that cutbacks will go too far; they are concerned with preserving America's social safety net for those in needâ€”programs such as Medicaid, school lunches and child nutrition programs, and Supplemental Security Income for elderly and disabled individuals. Men, more than women, have long said they favor dramatic cutbacks in the size of government.
