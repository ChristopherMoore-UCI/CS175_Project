This drag on the housing market is one of the reasons why housing prices continue to fall and new housing construction is stalled. But that doesn't mean we can't learn from past mistakes or take advantage of the current market context to make a major dent in family housing costs by using idle housing and human resources. Some past efforts at promoting homeownership failed when bad mortgages supported housing costs far higher than monthly rents on the expectation of home price appreciation. It might even be enough to invigorate new housing construction. Just as important, by taking depressed units out of the housing market, the outlook for future housing prices will improve.
