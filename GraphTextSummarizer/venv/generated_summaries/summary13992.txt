Clay met with Allen on Park Avenue -- a location seen and cited in "Blue Jasmine" as the most desirable of New York addresses, one that means wealth, class and elegance to the titular and very status-conscious character Jasmine (played by Blanchett). Up until now, Clay had a spotty film career, the highlights being a cameo as Jon Cryer's friendly bouncer in 1986's "Pretty in Pink," a part as Lea Thompson's macho suitor in the 1988 raunchy comedy "Casual Sex?" and a starring role in 1990's "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane." But "Ford Fairlane" was a critical and commercial bomb, and Clay's movie career never quite recovered. To help his character's antagonism toward his sister-in-law, Jasmine, she of the ill advice that caused him to lose his money and his marriage, Clay drew upon his relationships with his former Beverly Hills neighbors. Among the familiar faces in Woody Allen's new film "Blue Jasmine" is one less familiar these days, someone who hasn't been seen on the big screen in 12 years: Andrew Dice Clay.
