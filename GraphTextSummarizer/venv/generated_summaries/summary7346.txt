"The lowest point came in Euro 2000 -- that was German football's nadir: very poor performances, a very poor team and very poor management," German football expert Rafael Honigstein told CNN. "Bayern, under former president Uli Hoeness, always kept the greater good of the national team at the back of their minds and that's an important factor for the success of German football," explained Honigstein. Normal time had made way for extra time and -- with every energy-sapping minute played -- the Russian roulette of a penalty shootout edged ever closer. Maybe the German writer will be proved right, maybe there will always be a place in the heart of football fans for the poetry the Brazil of Pele, Zico and Rivelino invoked. It was a goal of sublime skill that epitomized all that has been good with Low's side in Brazil -- in one moment Gotze's goal ensured German dream had also come true.
