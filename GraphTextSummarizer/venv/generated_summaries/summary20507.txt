When you have to give your pet away Texas is the most recent state to pass a bill that will punish family violence perpetrators under protective orders who torture pets. Every day, thousands of pets and humans are at risk in abusive relationships, according to Phil Arkow, coordinator of the National Link Coalition, which seeks to prevent violence toward people and animals. In the past few years, state representatives have been debating bills that would include pets in domestic violence protective orders. But that is changing as 21 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted laws to include pets in domestic violence protection orders. Ahimsa House -- which stands for "nonviolence" in Sanskrit -- is the only animal shelter in Georgia that specifically cares for pets from homes of domestic violence.
