The Spanish giants, who ended a long wait for their tenth European Champions League crown last season with victory over city rivals Atletico, have bolstered their 'galatico' ranks in typical fashion. The focus was largely on its new recruits, Colombia's World Cup poster boy James Rodriguez, and Toni Kroos, who lifted the trophy in Brazil with Germany. And European champions Real Madrid wasted little time in underlining its emboldened firepower en route to a 2-0 victory over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup final. Bale, roared on by the Welsh fans inside the stadium, drew a save from Beto after prodding a Rodriguez cross towards goal before Iker Casillas was forced to save a shot from Sevilla midfielder Vitolo. The second was the result of another fine move, as Ronaldo was released by France striker Karim Benzema, before slamming the ball into the top corner.
