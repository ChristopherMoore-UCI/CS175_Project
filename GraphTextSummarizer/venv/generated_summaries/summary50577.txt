Other former members of Congress and high-level aides say the good old days may have been nicer, sociability won't lead to bipartisanship. Lott said he still considers Democrat and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle a good friend, and that he has spent weekends away with former Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, both Republicans, and their wives. The truth is not that simple, according to former leaders of the Senate and House. " "Congress is becoming a commuter Congress," said former Democratic Sen. Bryon Dorgan from North Dakota. Lott's most enduring relationship from Congress seems to be with Phil Gramm, a Democrat who switched parties in the House and then became a Republican senator from Florida.
