" As the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson and his brothers "became a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists," said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of black popular culture at Duke University's Department of African and African American Studies. Black popular culture professor Neal said Jackson's physical changes did not reflect his life on the whole. Showcasing a black artist paved the way for the popular show, "Yo! MTV Raps," and other black artists, Neal said. His work was always in conversation with black culture both in the United States and more globally," said Neal. Looking back on that era, a 1991 Los Angeles Times article quoted MTV founder and then-CEO Robert Pittman as saying the channel's format didn't lend itself to other musical styles, including R&B and country.
