"We have located two dead people in the avalanche, and one has been dug out alive," Astrid Nilsen with the Troms Police District told CNN. Police, civilians and helicopters were involved in the search in the mountains of Djupvik in the community of Kafjord in Troms. "We have also located three more avalanche pagers that we are working on digging out, but we are not sure that there will be anyone with them in case they lost their pagers in the avalanche." Skiers carry pagers to help authorities locate them in such situations. "According to the initial reports, (there) are six persons from France who were out skiing and got caught in the avalanche," Skogvang told CNN. -- An avalanche in northern Norway swept six French skiers down a mountain, killing at least two of them, police said Monday.
