When Carl DeMaio, a Republican House candidate in southern California, made a sympathetic remark about Cruz during a speech to the Downtown San Diego Lions Club last week, operatives from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington quickly packaged the clip and circulated it to local reporters under the slug: "Carl DeMaio's model legislator: Ted Cruz." The website depicts Cruz telling an anguished Boehner, "I got it from here, bud." "Ted Cruz is a powerful tool for Democrats for the same reasons he's so popular among the Republican base: he's perfectly emblematic of where today's Republican Party is and where it's headed," said Chris Harris, a spokesman for American Bridge. Cruz promises Republican victory in shutdown fight After the government lurched toward shutdown last week, Democrats were handed a well-timed gift: Cruz had been previously booked to deliver the keynote address at a conservative gala in Richmond where, as it happened, Cuccinelli was also scheduled to speak. And over the past two weeks, strategists working for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee have been carpet-bombing local reporters in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and West Virginia with statements accusing GOP Senate candidates in those states of supporting "the Ted Cruz strategy" of political brinksmanship. Nowhere has this theory been put to the test more than in the Virginia governor's race, where Cruz chewed up more than a week's worth of campaign oxygen in the closely watched contest between Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe.
