Police arrested a handful of protesters at the time, but the failure of Egyptian authorities to take action sooner has been widely questioned, as has Morsy's delayed condemnation of the attacks on American diplomatic missions. But as it has since Tuesday, unrest continued outside the American embassy as riot police clashed sporadically with protesters. The running battle between Egyptian police and protesters outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo continued for a fourth straight day Friday, leading to scores more arrests and at least one death, according to state authorities. More than 250 people have been injured and 40 arrested this week as riot police faced off against protesters, state media said. Obama's comments were widely seen as a warning to Egypt, which was considered a staunch U.S. ally under Mubarak and remains a major recipient of American foreign aid.
