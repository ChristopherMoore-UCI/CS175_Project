Whether at reunions, picnics, or the mall, families and friends make it a point to apprise sons, nephews or grandsons of what Knox calls "the rules of engagement" for young black men when they encounter police or other figures of authorities. Perry blamed a broad trend for the way young black men are treated. A case study Perry recalled how he, too, was racially profiled by police. As challenging as parenting is, black families in particular are assuming more burdens: At kitchen tables and in living rooms, they hold honest talks with their boys about how life can be different for them and what they ought -- and ought not -- to do in public, especially near police. "It helps to have parents or family to give you an education on how to deal with that stuff," Joseph Knox said.
