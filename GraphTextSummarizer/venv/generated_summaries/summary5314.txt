Clinton aides said the secretary of state wanted to visit Cairo early after Morsy's swearing-in to show that the Obama administration wants to help the new government improve Egypt's economy. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo said it was "in close touch with Egyptian authorities, who are doing everything they can to bring about safe release of the American tourists." Clinton's meeting with Morsy kicks off what is expected to be a steady stream of high-level U.S. officials to visit Cairo in coming months, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta within the next few weeks and culminating with a possible meeting with President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September. " After her meeting with President Mohamed Morsy -- the first such visit by a U.S. Cabinet official --- Clinton stressed that it was up to Egypt's people to shape the country's political future. Clinton's visit came as Egypt is in the throes of domestic political chaos, with Morsy in a tug of war with the military leadership in Cairo. On the same day of Clinton's visit,  Egyptian state media reported that security services in North Sinai were intensifying efforts to get a kidnapped American couple and their tour guide released.
