Reprising their Mutt-and-Jeff routine, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play undercover narcs Schmidt and Jenko, who are assigned to go back to school and pose as students to sniff out a drug ring. I did â€” especially during the film's inspired end-credits tease of future Jump Street installments. Adding some supporting-cast spice are comedians Kenny and Keith Lucas as a pair of narcoleptically chill identical twins who live across the hall and Jillian Bell as a sarcastic grump who spews acid insults about how old Schmidt and Jenko look. The merry-prankster duo have a real knack for cheeky pop culture mischief and placing clever new spins on shopworn properties. But just because the writers repeatedly elbow the audience in the ribs about how cynical sequels are doesn't make their approach any less cynical.
