Previtera said that Burden was moved to administrative confinement after the attack and that Moon was not seriously hurt. Moon, 64, was no match for Douglas Burden, 24, in custody on various drug charges. -- Hillsborough County, Florida, Deputy Kenneth Moon was alone at his station at a county jail facility near Tampa when an inmate attacked him with no warning. The inmates held Burden down until other guards arrived as one of them extended a hand to help Moon up, according to the video. But the other inmates joined the fight on the guard's side, pulling Burden away from Moon and punching him in the head.
