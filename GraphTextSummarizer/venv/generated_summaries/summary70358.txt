A mother's greatest fear Ortega has been recovering since then at Weill Cornell Medical Center under police watch, and was still there as of Tuesday, according to hospital spokeswoman Linda Kamateh. Yoselyn Ortega, 50, was arrested earlier this month and charged with the murders of Lucia Krim, 6, and her brother Leo, 2. Krim left two of her children with the nanny to take her 3-year-old child, Nessie, to a swim lesson at a nearby YMCA, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said last month. Police say on October 25, the children's mother, Marina Krim, returned to the family's Upper West Side apartment, found Lucia and Leo dead in the bathroom and saw the nanny stab herself with a kitchen knife. Friends had introduced the family to Ortega, and she had worked for them since Leo's birth two years ago, police said.
