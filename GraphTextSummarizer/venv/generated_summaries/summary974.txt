Catherine is expected to give birth in the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London -- the same place where both Prince William and Prince Harry were born. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton is also likely to be on hand at the hospital, in case William is unable to make it to London on time for any reason. Prince William serves as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and is based at RAF Valley on Anglesey in North Wales, about four and a half hours' drive from London. Will Prince William be there for the birth? In keeping with tradition, as she leaves St Mary's Hospital, Catherine is expected to appear on the steps of the building with her newborn, as Princess Diana did with Princes William and Harry.
