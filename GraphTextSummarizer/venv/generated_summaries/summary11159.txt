Solomon believes these kinds of play experiences help prepare kids for environments where not everything is controlled. He consulted with play experts and conducted focus groups watching kids use prototypes of the foam. Rockwell likes to visit the playground to see what new ideas kids have developed for his foam pieces. Susan Solomon, one of the play experts who worked with Rockwell on Imagination Playground, would like to see more playgrounds like it. But building more playgrounds like this one won't be cheap: Rockwell donated his time and design expertise and helped raise money for the project.
