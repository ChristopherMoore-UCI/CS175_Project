A host of golfers eyed victory on a tight leader board going into the final round, but the likes of Matt Kuchar and Rickie Fowler were unable to threaten Watson and the American pair finished tied for fifth on two-under, a shot ahead of England's Lee Westwood. Pre-tournament favorite Rory McIlroy finished strongly with a three-under 69 for level par, but his hopes were ended by a poor second round. -- Bubba Watson turned on the style to win his second U.S. Masters title in three years after a final round 69 gave him a three-shot victory in the opening major of the 2014 season. Watson has been in fine form on the PGA Tour leading into the Masters, claiming the Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles in February -- his fifth career win and first since his initial triumph at Augusta. "I don't remember the last few I holes, I just remember hanging on to make pars," he said before donning the Green Jacket for the second time in the traditional ceremony.
