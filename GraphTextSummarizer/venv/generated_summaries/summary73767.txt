When Mayweather and Pacquiao clash at center ring on Saturday night, the good angels of human nature will yearn to turn away -- and to lean in. A fight puts the darkest stuff in human nature on display: the bared fangs, the blood, the frenetic drive to do harm. How else are we to explain our yen for carnage in rough sports, films, gory video games and literature? There's a great literature on boxing, with contributions from writers such as Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer and Joyce Carol Oates. While it may seem like a stretch, I think we are drawn to prizefights less to revel in what's dark and nasty in human nature than to honor what's good and noble.
