With 80% of votes counted, electoral officials declared Hernandez the winner with more than 35% of the vote, placing him six percentage points ahead of Castro. The strong allegations of fraud by Xiomara Castro, the wife of ousted former President Manuel Zelaya, raise the possibility of political unrest in the Central American country. The leftist candidate says her political party has uncovered evidence of fraud and vows to challenge the triumph of ruling party candidate Juan Orlando Hernandez. "We support the ongoing work of (electoral officials) and the political parties to finalize the results and resolve inconsistencies in a transparent manner and urge the Honduran people to continue to demonstrate their respect for rule of law and peaceful, democratic processes," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Castro had been mostly quiet since election night.
