His lawyers say Lindh never fought against American forces and received a harsher sentence because sentencing occurred after the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York, Washington and rural Pennsylvania. His parents repeated their contention that Lindh went abroad to study Islam, found himself in Afghanistan in a civil war and joined the Taliban with no intent to support terrorism or fight against his homeland. "All of these events occurred while President Bush was in office," Frank Lindh said. At a news conference Wednesday in San Francisco, California, Lindh's parents called on President Bush to show mercy for their son. John Walker Lindh is hoping that President Bush will commute the rest of his 20-year sentence.
