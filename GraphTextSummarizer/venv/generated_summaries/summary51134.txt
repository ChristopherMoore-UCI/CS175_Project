His Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers was less than impressed by Chelsea's stifling tactics Earlier Sunday, Sunderland, whose shock victory last week at Chelsea so dented the title hopes of Mourinho's men, carried on that superb form with a 4-0 thrashing of fellow strugglers Cardiff. -- Goals at the end of each half from Demba Ba and Willian threw an enthralling EPL title race wide open as Chelsea secured a 2-0 win at leaders Liverpool Sunday. They went ahead just before halftime as Senegal star Ba continued his recent run of crucial goals after a slip by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. Desperately pushing forward at the end, Chelsea were caught by a sucker punch as substitute Fernando Torres broke clear and unselfishly played in Willian for the clinching second in injury time. Chelsea have closed to within two points but it is Manchester City who have emerged as the most likely challengers after a 2-0 win at Crystal Palace in the late game Sunday.
