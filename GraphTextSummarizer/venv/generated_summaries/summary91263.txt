The habitat for critically endangered Sumatran tigers has dwindled so much and poaching is such a large threat that there are more Sumatran tigers in captivity than live in the wild. Keeping Sumatran tigers, orangutans and elephants in captivity is not an ideal situation. Without some kind of action to stop poaching and habitat loss, the critically endangered Sumatran elephants, orangutans and tigers will slowly and quietly decline. These are animals with diseases or defects like tigers that were rescued from poacher's snares. Some of us are killing the tigers to sell their skins and some of us are taking care of disabled baby tigers in captivity to make sure the species doesn't go extinct.
