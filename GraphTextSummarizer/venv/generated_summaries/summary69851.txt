Demolition of the house lasted for about three hours on Sunday and was expected to continue on Monday morning, Hillsborough County Administrator Mike Merrill told reporters. "We just have not been able to locate Mr. Bush, and so for that reason, the rescue effort is being discontinued," Merrill told reporters Saturday evening. Some snapped photos with cell phone cameras, said John Gauntt, a reporter for CNN affiliate Bay News 9. After officials called off the search for his brother's body Saturday, Jeremy Bush told Bay News 9 the family was devastated. The demolition crew worked for only a few hours on Sunday to give the family time to sift through their belongings, Merrill said.
