-- A U.S. Navy minesweeper remained stuck in a reef teeming with endangered marine life off the Philippines on Sunday, prompting an American commander to apologize and promise stepped-up efforts to prevent further damage. Three Philippine naval ships were in the area, along with a number of U.S. ships, according to Sunday's PNA report. The focus is "preventing any further environmental damage to the reef and surrounding marine environment," according to the Navy report. "As a protector of the sea and a sailor myself, I greatly regret any damage this incident has caused the Tubbataha Reef," said Vice Adm. Scott Swift, the U.S. 7th Fleet commander, in a report posted Sunday on a Navy website. Initial efforts to free the ship failed and its crew was transferred by small boats to other U.S. ships.
