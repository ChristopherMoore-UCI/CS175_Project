Others honored by the organization, which runs programs focused on security, cooperation, economics, the environment and which centers on the Middle East, Africa and Asia, were Unilever CEO Paul Polman and violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. He singled out their work with veterans through Help for Heroes, Walking with the Wounded and other such programs. Harry was among the guests of honor at the event marking the 50th anniversary of the Atlantic Council, which describes itself as a "nonpartisan institution devoted to promoting transatlantic cooperation and international security." -- A Washington think tank celebrated Prince Harry on Monday night for his humanitarian efforts, with the British royal deflecting the praise by offering his own salute to wounded war veterans. Less than two hours later, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell took the stage to formally present Prince Harry with the council's Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award, an honor most recently bestowed on U2 frontman and activist Bono.
