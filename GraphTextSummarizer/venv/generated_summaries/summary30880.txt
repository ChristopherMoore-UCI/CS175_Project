Panetta said there were intelligence reports of Pakistani helicopters passing over the bin Laden compound. But after the interview aired, Pentagon press secretary George Little said Panetta "has seen no evidence that bin Laden was supported by the Pakistani government or that senior Pakistani officials knew he was hiding in the Abbotabad compound. That claim has been denied by Pakistani officials. The killing of bin Laden enraged the Pakistani public and deeply embarrassed its military. Pakistan has not yet decided whether to try a Pakistani doctor for high treason for assisting the United States in gathering intelligence ahead of the raid, a senior Pakistani government official said late last month.
