President Barack Obama on Monday reminisced of better times with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, his onetime hug-buddy turned Republican antagonist as the governor has turned his focus to an expected presidential bid. He admitted: "It was hard." "And then Christie beat me at football toss, which really aggravated me," Obama said, remembering that Christie "bragged" about his win afterwards. Christie has previously complimented Obama and drew criticism from Republicans after he was photographed in a sideways embrace with the president when he visited the state to survey the damage done by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. On Monday, however, Obama touted the U.S. offensive against ISIS, declaring it has "blunted their momentum and put them on the defensive."
