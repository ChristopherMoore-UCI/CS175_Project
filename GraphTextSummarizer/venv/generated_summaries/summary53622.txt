Qualified individuals include members of national assemblies, governments, international courts, heads of universities and academics and previous Nobel laureates. Unlike the other Nobel prizes, which are awarded in Stockholm, the peace prize ceremony and laureate's lecture takes place in Oslo in December. The decision-making process starts in September, more than a year before the winner of the prize is announced, when the committee sends out letters to qualified individuals inviting them to nominate contenders -- either individuals, joint individuals or organizations -- for the peace prize. Expert advisers are then recruited to provide additional information about the remaining candidates and evaluate their merits. The winner of the prize is decided by a majority vote of committee members at the start of October.
