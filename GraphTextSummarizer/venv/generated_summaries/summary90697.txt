Kardashian's newborn daughter is the third grandchild of Kris Jenner -- the former wife of the late Robert Kardashian, best known as a lawyer for O.J. Simpson. Kardashian's sister, Kourtney Kardashian, has two children -- Mason and Penelope -- with her longtime boyfriend, Scott Disick. Jenner is currently married to Olympic legend Bruce Jenner. The couple started dating last year, shortly after Kardashian filed for divorce from NBA player Kris Humphries after 72 days of marriage. The report did not give a name for the newborn, but did say she came into the world at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
