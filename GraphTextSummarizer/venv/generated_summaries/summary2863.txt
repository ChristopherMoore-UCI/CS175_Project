"I have spent my life in service to others -- encouraging urban high school students to apply, attend and graduate college, and convening a number of activities helping minorities and people of color get involved in civic life," Greenidge says. He says he's looking toward the CNN Fit Nation challenge to help him set and achieve those goals, and overcome a family history of high blood pressure. Eugene says he wants them both to get in better shape, so they can be good role models for their 3-year-old daughter, Mara. " When she and Eugene met, they were both in much better shape, but life got in the way. "I look to learn so many things about myself in the process -- my strengths and challenges and how I can approach them going forward in life."
