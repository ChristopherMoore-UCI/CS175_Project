Lancaster took over the coaching role from Martin Johnson, who was unable to emulate his 2003 World Cup success as a player when the England team traveled Down Under last year. However, such a meeting will not happen before the knockout stages of the tournament after hosts England came out of the hat with Australia and Six Nations champions Wales and two qualifiers in Group A on Monday. Present coach Stuart Lancaster hopes his young England team can continue to develop and peak in time to survive in the toughest group of the 2015 World Cup -- only two teams go through from each pool. The fly-half has bounced back from the disappointment of missing most of the 2011 World Cup due to injury by inspiring the All Blacks to a perfect record of six wins in the inaugural Rugby Championship -- which featured the Tri-Nations teams plus Argentina -- and victory in the Bledisloe Cup series against Australia for the 10th year in a row. Following that upset result, 2003 World Cup-winning coach Clive Woodward said his country would be the team that all others hoped to avoid at Monday's draw in London.
