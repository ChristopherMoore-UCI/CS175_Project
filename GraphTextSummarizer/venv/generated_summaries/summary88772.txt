China said Monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits. Traditionally, serving in the military has not been a sought-after career in China and a U.S. report on China's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge. Many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education, while country's one-child policy, which has created the "little emperor" phenomenon of spoiled children, produces recruits who "may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline," the report added. " "China has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft, but it must make sure there can be sufficient, well-trained pilots to fly them," Wang Ya'nan, deputy editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine told The China Daily last month. On completing the three-year program, students will take a pilot selection test, and those who pass will join a PLA flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes.
