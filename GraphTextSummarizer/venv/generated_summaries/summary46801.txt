Israel has recently announced plans to add on to West Bank settlements, drawing angry responses from Palestinians and criticism from Israel's Western allies. This came as Kerry visited the Middle East this week and came up with a formula for reanimating peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian territories, a source close to the talks said. Israel has said it wants to be assured of the safety of its citizens from attacks by Palestinian militants in any peace agreement. " In the Palestinian territory of Gaza, however, Hamas dismissed the renewed effort for peace talks. One of the reports Kerry might have been referencing was a Reuters report quoting an Israeli official who said the Jewish state agreed to a plan for peace talks based on pre-1967 borders and land swaps.
