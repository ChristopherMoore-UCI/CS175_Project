Mullah Abdul Salam was arrested last week, according to Afghan government officials, Taliban sources and a U.S. official. At least one Afghan Taliban leader has been seized in neighboring Pakistan by security forces, sources told CNN Thursday. Taliban sources and Omar said several other suspected members of the Afghan Taliban were arrested with Salam, but their identities are not clear. He was directing Taliban military operations in the province, including ordering terrorist actions, mine planting and suicide attacks, said Abdul Razaq Yaqubi, the chief of police in Kunduz. The Nad-e Ali district is "broadly secure," he said, but there is still Taliban resistance in Marjah.
