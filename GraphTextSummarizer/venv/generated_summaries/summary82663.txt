-- Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the man allegedly behind the inflammatory film "Innocence of Muslims," has been granted supervised release from a federal prison, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Nakoula came to the world's attention after his movie, a trailer of which had been posted to YouTube, was highlighted last September by Egyptian media. Bureau of Prisons records show the 56-year-old Nakoula is at an undisclosed halfway house in Southern California. Filmmaker denies violating probation Nakoula is due to be formally freed next month, according to records. He technically remains in federal custody, but the tentative release means he can leave the facility for a few hours a day.
