World No.1 Nadal dispatched his old adversary Roger Federer in straight sets 7-5 6-3 to book only his second appearance in the season-ending tournament final while Djokovic dismissed Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3 6-3. Defending champion Novak Djokovic will play Rafael Nadal in the final of the ATP World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena after both men comfortably overcame their Swiss opponents in Sunday's semifinals. Wawrinka then lost his opening service game in the second as Djokovic once again quietly dominated with a trademark blend of defense and attack. Djokovic, meanwhile, coasted to victory over Wawrinka who was competing in his first ATP World Tour Finals. But Djokovic won their most recent encounter at the China Open in straight sets and is unbeaten in 21 matches since losing to the Spaniard at the U.S. Open.
