According to testimony, FBI analysis of the computer showed online searches conducted under Valle's account included topics such as "What to look for in human meat," "How to tie up a girl," "Eat her for dinner cannibalism," and "How do you give chloroform to girls." -- Graphic violent sexual photographs and evidence of web searches on how to kidnap and cook women were found in the computer account belonging to a New York City police officer accused of conspiring to abduct women in a cannibalism plot, according to testimony in federal court Monday. Prosecutors have argued that Valle was "deadly serious" about online plans allegedly to kidnap, rape, torture, cook and eat women. Screen shots used by prosecutors revealed conversations Valle had with others about kidnapping, torturing, raping, cooking and eating women. Photos found on Valle's account included images of women being tied up with duct tape, and two images that appeared to show a woman being roasted on a spit in a human barbecue pit.
