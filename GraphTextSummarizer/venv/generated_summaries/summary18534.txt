A lone CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officer was to board the ship upon its arrival Saturday in Los Angeles "to conduct a targeted environmental health assessment, and evaluate the outbreak and response activities," the CDC said. Two CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officers and an epidemiologist were to board the vessel in Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday to conduct an investigation. "We'll be working with both the medical teams as well as the crew on board the vessel and the cruise line with doing follow ups," Bernadette Burden, a CDC spokeswoman, told CNN affiliate WJZ. Royal Caribbean told WJZ that any would-be passengers feeling a little queasy about the prospect of leaving Saturday aboard the twice-stricken ship could reschedule. "We have so many people together in a closed environment, eating in the same place," Catherine Troisi, associate professor of management, policy and community health at the University of Texas School of Public Health, told WJZ.
