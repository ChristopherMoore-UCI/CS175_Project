"The thing about supreme athletes like Michael Watson and Michael Schumacher is that they have extraordinary physical reserves," Hamlyn said. "What tortures the public is the same thing that tortures the family --progress is slow, progress is uncertain," said Peter Hamlyn, a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport. "Michael has left the [hospital in] Grenoble to continue his long phase of rehabilitation," read the June 16 statement from Schumacher's long-time manager and the family's spokeswoman Sabine Kehm. "Even people in the paddock who should be quite close have the feeling that we don't know what's going on," Schumacher's biographer and respected F1 journalist Karin Sturm told CNN. Although the news on Schumacher's condition is scant, Hamlyn says the wording of the June statement is reason to be positive.
