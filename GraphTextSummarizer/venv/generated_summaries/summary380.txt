"Giving back" is just one of many pages, like "Help Brooklyn," "Sandy HELP," "Surviving Sandy" and "Sandybaggers," where people looking to help victims of the storm come together to share information. Where Twitter is often a vehicle for publicity, many people and businesses turned the tables, tweeting offers of help, including free legal advice, clothing drives and pet and child care. " Much of the appeal of "Helping Sandy" social media groups is their ability to specialize. "Help The Babies Affected By Hurricane Sandy" is collecting supplies for affected families in Long Island. Although nonprofits are frequently focused on the big picture, social media communities are able to respond in real time to calls for help, no matter the nature.
