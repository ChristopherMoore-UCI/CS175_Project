See: High-tech yacht aiming to smash speed record The brainchild of Swiss eco-adventurer Raphael Domjan, the high-tech boat was designed by New Zealand nautical architecture company LOMOcean Design, and built by German shipyard Knierim Yachtbau in 2010. Now London's historic River Thames has played host to a new generation of boat -- one which could revolutionize not just the future of nautical design, but scientific research on the high seas. " Eco expedition The $16 million vessel cut an impressive figure as it cruised beneath London's raised Tower Bridge, marking the end of an almost three-month scientific expedition along the Atlantic's warm Gulf Stream. "On a full battery we can run for 72 hours without sun," says captain Gerard d'Aboville, who is also the first man to row solo across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Sunny disposition Resembling more "Starship Enterprise" than a modern catamaran, the 35-meter vessel arrived in the British capital last week -- its last stop on a scientific expedition across the Atlantic.
