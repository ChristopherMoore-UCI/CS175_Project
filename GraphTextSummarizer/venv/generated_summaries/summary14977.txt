Many children whose families suffer food insecurity are part of the program's target audience, said Rocio Galarza, senior director for content and outreach at the Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. Food insecurity is defined as the lack of a consistent access to food for active, healthy lives, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The most significant increase took place between 2007 and 2009 -- during the recession -- when the number of households making use of food pantries rose from 3.9 million to 5.6 million, an increase of 44%, according to the USDA. Since 2001, the number of households receiving emergency food has grown steadily, according to the USDA. The Great Recession, which set off a wave of layoffs and plummeting home values, left many families without access to adequate food.
