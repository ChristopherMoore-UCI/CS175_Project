"Selma March 1965" brings together -- for the first time, anywhere -- pictures by three essential witnesses of the civil rights era: James Barker, Spider Martin and the man Kasher calls "the single greatest civil rights photographer" -- Charles Moore. Some of his photos are included in "Selma March 1965," a photography show taking place at New York's Steven Kasher Gallery from March 5 to April 18. The Birmingham pictures, wrote a reader from Indiana, were "superb and bone-chilling.") "The quality, the depth, the sense of reality that he brings to the work is unparalleled," Kasher said of Moore's civil rights shots. Whether he was chronicling the overt, graphic suppression of human rights or framing a profoundly human moment -- as in his unforgettable shot of bloodied poet Galway Kinnell in Selma -- Moore's photographs often feel as if he was shooting with Robert Capa's famous dictum ringing in his ears: "If your photographs aren't good enough, you're not close enough." " Charles Moore was an American photographer known for his images documenting the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
