The Central American side finished top of the group on goal difference from Canada, which conceded a late equalizer in Monday's 1-1 draw with Cuba and will now play the winner of the other pool on Saturday. The U.S. team got out to a quick lead in Nashville when forward Terrence Boyd scored a goal inside the first minute, but El Salvador stormed back scoring two goals in the 35th and 38th minutes through Lester Blanco and Andres Flores. To put in as much as they put in that game, the amount of heart they put in, to play the way they played in that second half to come from behind and score two goals, to be seconds away from getting the No. 1 seed, it's unimaginable," said head coach Caleb Porter. The United States men's Olympic soccer team had its hopes dashed Monday night after a dramatic late goal killed its chances of going to London. A victory would have put the U.S. for Saturday's semifinals as winner of Group A in the CONCACAF region tournament.
