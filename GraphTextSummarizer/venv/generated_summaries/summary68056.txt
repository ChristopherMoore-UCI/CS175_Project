People now work most of the year just to pay Uncle Sam (or, as we now call him, "Comrade Sam"). After all, if power corrupts, then the kind of absolute power gained by political parties (and feared by Washington) corrupts absolutely. (PS The International Atomic Energy Agency just revealed to you that Iran appears to be refitting their long-range missiles to carry nuclear payloads. After using that money to nationalize a bunch of banks, mortgage companies and insurance companies, they moved on to bigger things. It didn't take long before so many of our tax dollars were going toward interest payments that we couldn't fund even the most basic of government programs without massive tax increases on everyone.
