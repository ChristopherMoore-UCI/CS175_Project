Algeria had arrived in Sao Paulo buoyant from a 4-2 victory over South Korea -- the North African country's first World Cup win in 32 years. Hosts Brazil face a tricky Chile side for a place in the quarterfinals while Colombia take on Uruguay, now rendered rather toothless by the ban for biting striker Luis Suarez. Meanwhile, Russia will be hoping to find answers before hosting the next World Cup in 2018. Germany had consigned the U.S. to a 1-0 defeat in Thursday's earlier matches but Team USA escaped from a grueling Group G -- which also featured Ghana and Portugal -- on goal difference. Algeria made history in Brazil, reaching the knockout stages of the global tournament for the first time at the expense of Russia.
