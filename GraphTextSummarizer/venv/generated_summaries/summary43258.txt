But they also say the timing and location of the shootings add weight to a theory that they were revenge killings carried out by police. Police have stepped up their presence in Campinas, located about 50 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, to prevent further violence. Hooded men Fernando Grella Vieira, the secretary of public safety for Sao Paulo, said Tuesday that the civil and military police "will not rest" until they have found those responsible for all 13 deaths in Campinas. However, fans from around the world are expected to flock to nearby Sao Paulo, the country's financial and business hub. Grella said it was too early to comment on suspicions raised by witnesses of the alleged involvement of military officers in 12 of the killings.
