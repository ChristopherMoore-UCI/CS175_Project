But while several clubs have signaled their interest in offering convicted rapist Ched Evans a second chance, public opinion in Britain is proving an almost insurmountable stumbling block for the 26-year-old. After being spurned by former club Sheffield United, fourth tier Oldham Athletic is the latest to be thrust into an unwanted spotlight after contemplating hiring him. Maltese club Hibernians were another club to reportedly contemplate handing Evans a deal but that move was effectively ruled out when the UK's Ministry of Justice emphasized its laws on convicted sex offenders working abroad. "I believe it would be wrong for Ched Evans to return to playing football for Oldham Athletic or any other club, as he has been convicted of rape, a violent crime for which he has neither apologized or acknowledged," Abrahams said in a statement. Labour leader Miliband told the BBC: "I think that it is right Oldham are thinking again about whether Ched Evans should be hired by them because you are a role model, he's been convicted of a very serious crime.
