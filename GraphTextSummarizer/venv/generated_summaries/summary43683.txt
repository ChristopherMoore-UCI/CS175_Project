-- First lady Michelle Obama was expected to make headlines in Europe with her style and flair as she accompanied her husband to the Group of 20 summit, but it was a simple gesture that has set off a media frenzy. On the other hand, it may well be that this gesture of terrific friendship and affection for Michelle Obama was her way of saying, "Sorry, I should have given you something more personal." What is astounding is the picture of the queen with her arm around Michelle Obama and Michelle Obama's hand around the queen, too. One of the things one saw yesterday was the way [President] Obama and Michelle towered over the queen and indeed Prince Philip. "This was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between the queen and Michelle Obama," a palace spokeswoman said.
