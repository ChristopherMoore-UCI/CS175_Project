In response to these concerns, a group of former political leaders and leading figures have come together to create the report, "Deepening Democracy," which stresses the crucial importance of integrity in elections in advancing democracy, security and development. Elections are fundamental to the ethos and principles of democracy. When elections are credible, free and fair, they can help promote democracy, human rights and security. This means that for democracy to fulfill its potential as a means of peacefully resolving social and political conflict, the integrity of elections is crucial. Elections with integrity by themselves will not build citizen trust in democracy.
