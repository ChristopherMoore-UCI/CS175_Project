Independent voters tend to be closer to Republicans on economic issues and closer to Democrats on social issues. But a candidate who panders to the extremes and parades his own irresponsibility cannot assume that he'll win independent votes just because he slaps the independent label on a self-funded candidacy. Especially because a new Washington Post/ABC poll shows that 41% of American voters now identify as independents. They won votes from the vast vital center of the American electorate. But it will hurt both Trump and the GOP in the long run, while nuking any hope he had of appealing to independent voters.
