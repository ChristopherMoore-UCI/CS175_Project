The final semifinal was held up because of heavy rain at Wimbledon, and was eventually switched to Centre Court under the roof, where fourth seed Victoria Azarenka claimed a comfortable 6-3 6-1 victory over unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek. Cibulkova, seeded 24th, had stunned world number one Caroline Wozniakci in the last 16, but could not match that performance on Centre Court, as Russian Sharapova reached the semifinals at the All England Club for the first time since losing to Amelie Mauresmo in 2006. Ninth seed Bartoli came into the tournament on a high after winning the warm-up event at Eastbourne, and she maintained that momentum by putting out defending champion Serena Williams in the last 16. Both players had reached the last four of last year's tournament, losing to Serena Williams and Vera Zvonareva respectively, and it was eighth seed Kvitova who got there again -- going through 6-3 6-7 6-2. Fifth seed Sharapova, the 2004 champion and only grand slam winner left in the women's draw, proved in a different league to Slovakian Cibulkova, taking just under an hour to reach the last four 6-1 6-1.
