"Dubai" Today, the undisputed champion of royal vessels belongs to Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, whose $300 million mega-yacht is christened -- somewhat unimaginatively -- "Dubai." There have been and continue to be a fleet of imperial yachts used to transport royals, from Russian czars to princes of Monaco, in the opulent fashion to which they are accustomed. Still used today for state visits abroad, the classically shaped yacht is also employed as a base for the king when he competes in international yacht races. Now decommissioned and on display in Edinburgh, Scotland, the vast and lavishly designed "HMY Britannia" has sailed over one million miles during 44 years of service and in the course of 968 official royal visits. Built in 1937 by Camper and Nicholson, the oldest leisure marine company in the world, the boat was originally owned by British aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith -- who had given it over to the UK's Royal Navy to serve as a convoy escort vessel during World War II.
