To boost the supply to middle-income families, and in many ways calm discontent over lack of affordable property in cities like Beijing, the government has implemented measures it argues will help to curb house prices. Not only has it, and other measures, failed to stem rising property prices -- some have linked the scheme to corruption, with many arguing that only those with connections can obtain affordable homes at a fair price. Beijing also promised penalties for local governments that do not curb prices, saying officials "will be held accountable" in the event of failure. In the final months of 2013, home prices in major cities were running about 10% higher than the previous year. In December, home prices in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen increased by 16% to 20% over the previous year.
