Watterson and Pastis finally exchanged e-mails and Watterson suggested doing something together. He and Watterson first got in touch April 11, the day Pastis had a strip that falsely portrayed him as the author of "Calvin and Hobbes" in order to get a woman in bed. Indeed, a primary reason for Watterson's involvement was his activity with Team Cul de Sac, a charity co-founded by cartoonist Richard Thompson, who suffers from Parkinson's. And Watterson, Pastis learned, isn't the most tech-savvy artist. "I talked him out of that because I was so scared," says Pastis, noting that any Watterson drawings would be worth thousands.
