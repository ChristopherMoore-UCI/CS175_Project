The surreal photos were a hit on Reddit -- his link made it onto the site's front page -- and Goldman stayed up all night answering questions about where his ideas come from, how he remembers them, and his techniques for composing certain images. "I basically look at hundreds of photos every day from around the world and try to learn what I like." Goldman uses his blog to take the audience behind the scenes of his photos, deconstructing the image or explaining where the props came from. Goldman, who studied script writing at Tel Aviv University, learned about photography while on reserve duty for the Israeli army. It's the guiding concept that drives 32-year-old Goldman, a conceptual photographer in Tel Aviv, Israel, who has been recreating his dream fragments in a six-year series called The "Surrealistic Pillow" Project. This week Goldman posted a batch of his photos on Reddit, the social news site where members create and run their own forums on topics of their choice and user clicks determine the popularity of posts.
