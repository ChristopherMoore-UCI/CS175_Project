"President Zelaya should present himself before the tribunals of justice in our country where he has charges against him," Micheletti said in a Wednesday interview with CNN en Espa√±ol. Authorities had said they turned off power to the embassy and surrounding area to discourage looting, but Micheletti has said that pro-Zelaya protesters at the embassy short-circuited the power themselves. Earlier Thursday, Zelaya said in an interview with CNN's Rick Sanchez that he never lost the title of president though he was removed from power in the June 28 coup. Micheletti has maintained that Zelaya was not removed in a coup, but in a constitutional transfer of power. Micheletti told Sanchez his government is not in contact with Brazilian officials, but said Zelaya would not be removed from the embassy.
