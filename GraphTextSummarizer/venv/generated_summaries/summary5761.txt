Mohammed Al-Mishal, the Secretary General of Saudi Arabia's Olympic Committee said that Saudi Arabia was committed to sending female athletes to the next Olympics, but "they were not yet competitive enough for the Asian Games." "Technically, we weren't ready to introduce any ladies and the new president of our Olympic committee (Prince Abdullah bin Musaed bin Abdulaziz) rejected sending women to only participate, as he wanted them to compete," said Al-Mishal. Over the years there have been many statements by high-ranking officials in the local media in Saudi Arabia that supported integrating girl sports in public schools, opening private clubs, allowing female participation in neighborhood centers, and setting the stage for more Olympic participation. Public funds need to be allocated, as the private sector alone will not be able to nurture sports women to a level so they can compete against others from countries that have supported women sports for decades. The good news is that the government can rely on existing teams, athletes and initiatives that have been running for years on their own that will be the foundation for women sports in Saudi Arabia." In 2006 it evolved into a sports company that trains both girls and boys in team sports with the aim of promoting sports in the Kingdom and developing potential Olympic talents.
