The weather was warm, with temperatures of up to about 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon will travel to the stricken region Monday to assess the damage, the organization said. The most devastated cities -- Cagayan de Oro and Iligan -- became catch basins for water flowing from highlands with denuded forests. Floodwater from Bukidnon province poured down into Cagayan de Oro, while water from Lanao del Sur province gushed into Iligan. The national disaster council noted that about 377 passengers -- on four ships -- were stranded as of Sunday night, due to the storm. One woman in Cagayan de Oro collected murky brown floodwater in a bucket, just meters away from where a destroyed vehicle was submerged.
