And on the TV side, "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," which has suffered from middling ratings, may have gotten new life itself with its Globe wins as best TV series comedy or musical and for star Andy Samberg. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who earned praise for their hosting of last year's Golden Globes, started off this year's edition where they left off: rattling off zinger after zinger. Though the two popped up from time to time, after the opening segments they were primarily off stage (until Poehler won best actress in a TV comedy or musical series, anyway). The rest of the possibilities -- "Inside Llewyn Davis," "Captain Phillips," "Dallas Buyers Club," "Nebraska" -- may get nominated for best picture, but they're even longer shots for the big prize than they were before the Globes. And best actress will likely boil down to a face-off between Cate Blanchett ("Blue Jasmine"), who won best actress in a drama, and Amy Adams ("American Hustle") who took home the same prize for musical or comedy.
