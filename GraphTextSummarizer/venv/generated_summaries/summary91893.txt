" Solo's husband, former pro football player Jerramy Stevens, was charged with driving under the influence during the early morning hours Monday in Manhattan Beach, California, about 12 miles from Carson.

" Solo is perhaps the United States' best-known female soccer player, winning Olympic gold medals twice and playing on World Cup teams in 2007 and 2011. The suspension means Solo, a goalkeeper, will miss the U.S. team's matches in France and England in February. "During our current National Team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates," said U.S. Women's National Team head coach Jill Ellis said in a statement.
