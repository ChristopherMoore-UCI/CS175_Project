Friendship Pages are accessible from under the main photo on a friend's profile Page and via links from related wall posts or relationship stories. We think the Pages are an interesting alternative way to organize Facebook activity around friends, though it does add another layer of complexity to the site. Facebook is rolling out a new breed of Pages called Friendship Pages that pull together the public wall posts, comments, photos (based on tags) and events that two friends have in common. The Friendship Pages feature was cooked up by Facebook software engineer Wayne Kao and then brought to life in an internal hackathon event. The Pages are designed to the tell the story of two friends on Facebook through their shared activity.
