"We can show that wood structures are dollar for dollar or cheaper compared to other buildings. Liddell thinks that 15 stories is possible before having to use other materials like steel but says that building codes are one of the main reasons we haven't seen more tall wooden buildings, "and more recently the economic downturn," he adds. Wood buildings lock in carbon dioxide for the life cycle of a structure, while the manufacture of steel and concrete produces large amounts of CO2 -- the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimate that for every 10 kilos of cement created, six to nine kilos of CO2 are produced. "We stopped exploring wood around 100 years ago (with the advent of steel and concrete); now we're looking at a whole new system using mass timber products. Despite being made of wood any worries about towering infernos should be banished, says Green, as large timber performs well in fires with a layer of char insulating the structural wood beneath.
