Since President Obama voiced support for marriage equality and now the board of the NAACP has followed suit, the narrative is that the black community is trying to make room at the table for gay people. Allow me to correct this storyline: No one is making room for gay people, gay people have always been at the table, at the forefront. After all, a house divided against itself cannot stand, and gay people are, and always will be, living in this house. Blacks trying to separate the gay community from blacks? And despite the efforts of black religious conservatives to ignore that intersection, the truth is that intersection is a major part of black culture.
