" Arguably Heleno's crowning moment -- Brazil's crowning moment -- should have come at the 1950 World Cup. When Brazil was left heartbroken by a 2-1 defeat to Uruguay which destroyed its World Cup dreams, Heleno was playing in Colombia's lucrative illegal leagues. Maybe at the level of a Zico, Romario and Ronaldo." For Brazil, much like the tale of the 1950 World Cup final, Heleno's story is one of what might have been. And before the Maracana -- Brazil's iconic stadium in Rio de Janeiro -- was built, Heleno was the city's star attraction with a "Jekyll and Hyde" personality which saw him flit from outrageous charmer to disruptive egoist. "Because of World War II, Heleno missed out on the World Cups of 1942 and 1946," explained Neves.
