With more ways to share in public space, the people around us can not only help us make better places, they can help us become our best selves. So with help from old and new friends, I transformed the side of an abandoned house in my neighborhood in New Orleans into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a grid of the fill-in-the-blank sentence "Before I die I want to _______." Over the past few years I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space, using simple tools like stickers, stencils, and chalk. After receiving requests from passionate people around the world, my Civic Center colleagues and I created a toolkit and project site to help people make a wall with their community. Anyone walking by could pick up a piece of chalk, reflect on their lives, and share their personal aspirations in public space.
