Jason Young convicted of beating pregnant wife to death Michelle Young was discovered dead in 2006 in the bedroom of her Raleigh home. -- The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday it will look into alleged juror misconduct in the murder trial of Jason Young, a man convicted of beating his pregnant wife to death. If the allegations of juror misconduct prove true, they would also have to be shown to have had an impact on deliberations to affect the verdict, said Assistant District Attorney Howard Cummings. The defense had argued that intruders, and not the defendant, had killed Michelle Young. Judge Donald Stephens requested the investigation after receiving information from employees of a TV station concerning Facebook posts by people who purported to know that a juror might have improperly discussed the trial with members of the public.
