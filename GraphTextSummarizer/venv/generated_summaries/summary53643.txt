Al-Shabaab is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries as well. -- A former government official was among 10 people killed in a bombing Saturday in Somalia's capital, with Al-Shabaab -- the Islamist militant group that's long been tied to violence in the region -- claiming responsibility for the attack. In a statement, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for both Saturday attacks in the eastern African nation's capital. Al-Shabaab official Ali Mohamed Hussein accused Osman of working with "foreign spy agencies" based southwest of Mogadishu. Separately, there were no injuries after a device attached to the car of Somali lawmaker Abdullah Ahmed exploded outside a hotel near the port, close to the heavily fortified government district.
