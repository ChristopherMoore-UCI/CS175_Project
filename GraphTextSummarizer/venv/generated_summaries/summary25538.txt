READ MORE: Montana family disputes Singapore police probe into son's death Todd's parents, who flew to Singapore from their home in Montana, watched Lim's testimony in silence as pictures of their son's dead body were displayed. Singaporean lawyers hired by the Todd family have suggested Singapore's police work was sloppy and that an assumption of suicide led police to neglect other evidence. Singapore's medical examiner concluded that Todd committed suicide, but Todd's parents disagreed and hired a pathologist in the U.S. who -- based on Singapore's autopsy report and photographs of the body --suggested there was evidence that his death was a homicide. The lawyers for Singapore's Attorney General say they plan to show evidence that Todd had little experience in GaN work and "found it difficult to cope." Todd's mother, Mary, wept as she told reporters the police and Singapore's investigators had ignored evidence.
