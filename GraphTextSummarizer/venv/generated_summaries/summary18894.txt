-- Thousands of Greek public sector workers began a 48-hour strike Tuesday against planned cuts in government spending. Workers are demonstrating against tough planned austerity measures to meet European Union and International Monetary Fund conditions on a â‚¬110 billion ($146 billion) aid package In central Athens protesters threw plastic bottles and sticks at riot police, says CNN producer Erin Mclaughlin, who said that about 200 retired Greek workers also took to the streets Tuesday. The package includes a promise by Greece to cut its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, as required by European Union rules, by 2014, according to Papaconstantinou. The protests come ahead of a planned nationwide general strike on Wednesday when public and private sector workers, including teachers, lecturers, bank employees and doctors, will go on strike.
