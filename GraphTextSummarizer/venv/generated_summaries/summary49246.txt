-- Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gave voice Wednesday to the mistrust between his party and President Barack Obama after the President said he was "not going to just wait" on Republicans to pass comprehensive immigration reform. That choice should be to "give the new Congress a chance" on immigration reform, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is considered by many to be the linchpin of any comprehensive deal on immigration. "'At the end of the day the Republican Party would benefit from getting immigration reform off the table," Graham said Wednesday on CNN. The expected next Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday laying out their agenda for the next two years -- which includes repealing Obama's signature health care law. Obama made it clear that he was still planning to pursue executive action on immigration reform this year.
