-- Last year Kevin Hart sold out two consecutive nights at New York's famed Madison Square Garden, a venue that most standup comedians aspire to at some point in their career. Although largely a standup movie, "Let Me Explain" is framed with a fictional intro where Hart is inundated with a barrage of questions about his life and career -- all of which he determines to answer onstage at Madison Square Garden. Hart, clad in sunglasses to veil his exhaustion, recounted the process of creating "Let Me Explain," why he got so emotional onstage at Madison Square Garden and how he might be the busiest person alive. CNN: When you were filming your Let Me Explain comedy tour last year, was the intention always to make it into a feature film? For Hart, who took the arena's stage as part of his global Let Me Explain comedy tour, which also filled Los Angeles' Staples Center and London's O2 Arena, the occasion was so momentous that it deserved its own film.
