"This is really a profound tragedy for our embassy community and indeed for our government." "These are the worst days for anyone in law enforcement and we grieve Terry's loss," said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. Watson died after being stabbed in a taxi cab Thursday night after leaving a Bogota restaurant, a law enforcement official said. Special Agent James "Terry" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency. The official said taxi vehicle robberies are part of what are called "millionaire ride" thefts.
