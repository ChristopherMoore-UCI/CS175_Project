The Chinese government is ordering outspoken artist Ai Weiwei to pay 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) in back taxes, a move Ai calls "retaliation against a dissident." Ai said that two representatives from the Beijing tax bureau visited him Tuesday and presented him with documents from the tax authority, ordering the company FAKE Cultural Development Ltd. -- registered by Ai's wife Luqing -- to pay the taxes within 15 days. "If the government is not reasonable, no one can resist it." "China always uses tax issues to cover up political issues. Ai told CNN he was initially detained and imprisoned on charges of "subversion of state power," but upon his release the charge was changed to tax evasion. The artist was detained in April on grounds of tax evasion. Local authorities held a closed hearing in July on the tax evasion allegations despite demands for an open hearing from Ai and the company's lawyers.
