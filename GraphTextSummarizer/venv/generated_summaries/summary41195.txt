Former Foreign Minister Roza Otunbayeva declared herself the country's interim leader Thursday and said the opposition had taken over the reins of government and driven Bakiev from office. Normal flight operations resumed Friday afternoon, but by the evening, military passenger transport flights were temporarily diverted, said Maj. John Redfield, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. -- The chief of staff of the interim Kyrgyz government, which took over after President Kurmanbek Bakiev fled the capital, accused the president Friday of stealing the country's money when he left. "We have concerns about the situation on the ground," U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday. Opposition leaders had accused Bakiev of consolidating power by keeping key economic and security posts in the hands of relatives or close associates.
