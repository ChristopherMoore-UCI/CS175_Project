Riley and colleagues at Nottingham have producing 36 watts of electricity under laboratory conditions and recently started installing and testing stoves in Nepal and Bangladesh. The expansion and contraction of the air drives displacer pistons in the Stirling Engine, but in Score-Stove's thermo-acoustic set-up there are no moving parts, says Paul Riley, Score project director. In fact we are using loudspeakers (which act as a linear alternator) in some of the rigs turning the sound into electricity," Riley said. The stove heats a specially shaped pipe at one end while the other end is cooled, Riley explains, compressing air inside the pipe and causing it to vibrate and produce powerful sound waves. "We must adapt the lab version for each area, taking into account local biomass fuels, types of pots and pans used to cook, along with the everyday tasks the unit will be required for," Riley said.
