The U.S. and defending Olympic champion Argentina were playing for FIBA Americas bragging rights as both countries had already clinched berths in the basketball tournament for next summer's Beijing Games. America and Argentina join host nation China, Spain (world champion), Iran (Asia), Australia (Oceania), Angola (Africa) at the 2008 Olympic Games. Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Canada will get another chance to qualify at a 12-team 2008 FIBA Olympic qualifying tournament next July in which three more countries will punch their tickets to Beijing. Elias Ayuso scored 39 points and Carlos Arroyo had 30 and 10 assists as Puerto Rico beat Brazil 111-107 for the bronze medal earlier in the day. The U.S. were never seriously challenged at this zone qualifying tournament and heading into the final their 39.2 average margin of victory is one of the highest in tournament history. James and Chauncey Billups hoist the trophy after the U.S. won the FIBA Americas title to go with an Olympic berth.
