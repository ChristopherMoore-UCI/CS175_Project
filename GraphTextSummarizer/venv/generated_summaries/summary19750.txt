Beyond those two glaring death penalties, health insurance is another area of severe federal financial discrimination against gay couples. Because same-sex marriages aren't recognized on the federal level, gay and lesbian couples are not eligible for Social Security spousal benefits. I am so glad to see more employers extending health insurance benefits to same-sex partners. Beyond the social discrimination, the refusal of our federal government to legally recognize same-sex marriages imposes steep financial penalties on same-sex couples. Regardless of the size of their estates, every gay couple is discriminated against when it comes to Social Security benefits.
