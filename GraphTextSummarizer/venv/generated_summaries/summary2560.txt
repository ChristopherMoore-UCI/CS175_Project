" "The implementation of Geneva-1 is the goal of Geneva-2, and that is a transition government with full executive authority, which gives the Syrian people as a whole, everybody in Syria, the chance to have a new beginning where they choose their future leadership," Kerry told CNN last week. The alleged use of chemical weapons, which President Bashar al-Assad has denied, and the involvement of Hezbollah and Iran left the participants no choice "but to provide greater assistance of one kind or another, each nation making its own decision as to what it is comfortable doing, but all of them committing to do more to help the Syrian opposition," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters. But Syrian rebels said this week that they have received anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles from "brotherly nations that support the Syrian revolution." The CIA is training Syrian rebel forces at bases in Jordan, according to senior U.S. officials. Next week, Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman and Ambassador Robert Ford will meet with their Russian counterparts and Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N.and Arab League special envoy to Syria, to set a date for the meeting, Kerry said.
