Former cricket star Imran Khan, who heads the PTI party, blamed the leader of the rival MQM party for Hussain's death, accusing him of making inflammatory speeches threatening PTI workers and leaders. Amid the allegations, election officials held a revote Sunday for one National Assembly seat and two Provincial Assembly seats in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. Altaf Hussain sought political asylum in the United Kingdom "because of an attack on his life," according to a statement on the party's website. Anwar said Altaf Hussain, the MQM's London-based leader, was the first person to condemn the killing. Officials from the MQM, one of Pakistan's largest and most liberal parties, denied responsibility and sharply criticized Khan.
