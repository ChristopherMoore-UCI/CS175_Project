-- Chelsea romped into the English FA Cup semifinal with a 5-1 beating of London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in a controversial match at Wembley Sunday. Leading 1-0 from Didier Drogba's superb first-half strike, Chelsea went further ahead when Juan Mata's shot hit a cluster of bodies on the Tottenham line, with TV replays indicating it had not crossed the line. Florent Malouda scored the fifth as a dispirited Tottenham continued to make defensive errors, putting Chelsea into the final against Liverpool next month and boosting the team ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg against Barcelona . Chelsea responded with a superb third goal by Ramires before fellow midfielder Frank Lampard put the outcome beyond doubt with a long-range free-kick which wrong-footed Carlo Cudicini in the Tottenham goal. But referee Martin Atkinson awarded the goal to spark frantic protests from incensed Tottenham players.
