With all eyes on Brazil as it prepares to host the next FIFA World Cup in 2014, Ronaldo says his country faces challenges on two fronts. However Ronaldo also advised Neymar, who plays for Brazilian club Santos, to sign for a European club and help him join the level Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are playing at. "Brazilians and players were left with that bitter taste in our mouths," added Ronaldo. "Then came the World Cup of 2002 with big expectations and thank God we managed to make it to the final and beat Germany. Ronaldo inspired Brazil to their fifth victory in the competition, claiming the Golden Boot award with eight goals -- with two coming in the final against Germany. But not for former Brazil striker Ronaldo.
