"Champion spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has decided to retire from Test cricket," said a statement on Sri Lanka Cricket's official website on Tuesday. "Murali took a decision to retire from Test cricket during the West Indies series in November, but with an unscheduled Indian series coming up he has fast-tracked his retirement from Test cricket," Kushil Gunasekara told the Cricinfo website. The 38-year-old Sri Lanka spin bowler will bow out of the five-day game on home soil against the world's top-ranked team India in Galle from 18-22 July. Muralitharan, who has taken 792 wickets in 132 Test matches, will still be available for limited-overs internationals and may yet play at the 2011 World Cup which Sri Lanka will co-host along with India and Bangladesh. Cricinfo reported that Muralitharan would not be available for the one-day tri-series after the India matches, which also involves New Zealand.
