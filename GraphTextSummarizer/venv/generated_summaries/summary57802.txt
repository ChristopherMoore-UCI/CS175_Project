Teen says pink toy oven excludes boys from kitchen play On Monday, McKenna delivered boxes filled with petition signatures to Hasbro's headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. McKenna's petition generated national conversation about how packaging and marketing might enforce gender stereotypes and discourage children from playing with particular toys. She also asked Hasbro offer the product in different "non-gender-specific" colors that appeal to boys and girls. McKenna Pope's Change.org petition earned more than 40,000 signatures and the support of celebrity chefs who backed her request to change the Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven's girl-centric pink and purple packaging to include boys, too. Others, including the Toy Industry Association, said toys come in different colors based on feedback from consumers and retailers.
