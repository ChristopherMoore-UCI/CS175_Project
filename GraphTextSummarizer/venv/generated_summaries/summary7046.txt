"Ascot was set up by an act of parliament (Enclosure Act of 1813) and we will be reinvesting everything we can into the business in the form of better facilities as well as better prize money." QIPCO and Qatar's involvement in elite flat racing in Britain and Europe is a relatively new development, dating back to 2011. "It will be limited branding in Royal Ascot colors," Charles Barnett, chief executive of the race course, told CNN. As part of the deal, QIPCO has also agreed to sponsor the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, a race for leading middle-distance specialists, usually classic winners, held at Ascot in late July. "This most certainly does not extend to the names of races or the name of the event, which will be forever Royal Ascot," he said. Their sponsorship of the British Champions Series, culminating in Champions Day at Ascot in October, broke new ground, with both the Champions Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes now carrying seven-figure prize money.
