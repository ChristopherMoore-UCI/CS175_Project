This decision Thursday comes near the end of a summer in which allegations of racial profiling and racial tensions have been an undercurrent in cases and controversies across the county including in New York, where stop-and-frisk policies by police triggered intense political debate and a court case. Bloomberg vetoed that bill and another one dealing with racial profiling in July, claiming that current police practices -- including stop-and-frisk -- have contributed to a decreased crime rate in recent years. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly called Scheindlin's finding of racial profiling "disturbing and offensive. In a statement released after Thursday's vote overriding his veto, Bloomberg declared that the two measures will make it harder for police officers to do their job and could actually make crime worse in minority neighborhoods, where crime rates are already high. The NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy was targeting in a federal class-action lawsuit, and earlier this month U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that changes must be made to the policy because it unlawfully targets blacks and Hispanics.
