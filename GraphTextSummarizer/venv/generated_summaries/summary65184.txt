One hot spot for health care fraud is Los Angeles, California, where Russian, Armenian and Nigerian gangs have been caught by federal agents. "They are definitely well-organized, well-schooled on how to commit Medicare fraud." Agents questioned Burdi, a psychiatrist, about whether he had prescribed $800,000 worth of electric wheelchairs for Medicare patients. Two Nigerians, Christopher Iruke and his wife, Connie Ikpoh, were charged October 15 with bilking Medicare of $6 million dollars by fraudulently billing the government for electric wheelchairs and other expensive medical equipment. Impoverished residents of shelters there tell CNN they've accepted cash from recruiters -- known as "cappers" -- to go to bogus medical clinics where they share what they call their "red, white and blue" -- the tri-colored Medicare card that has a beneficiary number for billing the government.
