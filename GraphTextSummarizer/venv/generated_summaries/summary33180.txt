China's foreign ministry has lodged a diplomatic complaint to North Korea after Chinese local media reports said an army deserter killed four people near the China-North Korea border. A North Korean soldier fleeing the country shot four Chinese citizens after a robbery attempt in late December in Helong, a city near the Tumen River that divides the two countries, Chinese local media reported. " In most cases, intruding soldiers were after food, and do not have the intention to harm people, making it rare that such violent cases would occur, reported the Chinese state-run newspaper. However, China has a uniform policy for sending defectors back to North Korea, ruling them as "illegal economic migrants. There have been previous reports of runaway North Korean soldiers and citizens attempting robbery in search of food.
