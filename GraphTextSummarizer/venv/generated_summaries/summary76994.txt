The 38-year-old is attempting to rebuild his game ahead of the third major of the season -- next month's British Open -- after missing the Masters in April and this month's U.S. Open. Woods has won the British Open three times, and the last of those came in 2006 at the host course of this year's tournament -- Royal Liverpool Golf Club at Hoylake, where the action will tee off on July 17. He bogeyed his first two holes at Congressional and dropped to last place in the field on six over par before three birdies in five holes gave his scorecard a healthier look, though he was eight shots behind first-round leader Greg Chalmers of Australia. " The last of Woods' 14 major titles came at the 2008 U.S. Open, leaving him four behind Jack Nicklaus' overall record. "So I played a lot better than the score indicated, which is good." U.S. Open runner-up Erik Compton was tied for fourth in a group including Patrick Reed -- who won the WGC-Cadillac Championship where Woods last lined up.
