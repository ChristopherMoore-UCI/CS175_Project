-- The president of Sudan ordered the shutdown of an oil pipeline running from South Sudan, explaining that he didn't want his country's neighbor to use oil funds to arm "mercenaries, traitors and agents." When they separated, South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. South Sudan became independent from Sudan in July 2011, following a popular referendum and a war that left nearly 2 million people dead. In April 2012, Sudan and South Sudan slipped close to all-out war in a series of air and ground exchanges. The two African countries' leaders had agreed in September 2012 to resume oil exports, but failed to address other issues such as the fate of the disputed region of Abyei.
