" Officials: American fighting for ISIS killed in Syria Official: U.S. won't coordinate with al-Assad U.S. officials take pains to point out that they are going after ISIS already. "We believe here, though, that we need to keep supporting the moderate opposition in Syria." Officials: Non-military ways to defeat ISIS The key to defeating ISIS isn't necessarily as simple as military might, U.S. officials say. Harf said Tuesday, though, that U.S. officials won't be suddenly befriending or working with their counterparts in Syria. That includes continuing to strike the group, as U.S. forces have done for weeks, inside Iraq as well as taking the fight into Syria. "We're having a constant conversation inside the administration about what options could be necessary to go after ISIS whether it's in Syria, Iraq or wherever they train or operate," the spokeswoman said.
