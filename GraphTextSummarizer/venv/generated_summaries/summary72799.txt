"I think fans want to meet the cast and creators, and they want a bit of inside information," said Lisa Gregorian, chief marketing officer of Warner Bros. Television (which is owned by Time Warner, owner of CNN). Of course, there are shows that are already perennial favorites at the convention, such as "True Blood,"  which had ads plastered all over the convention center. "That moment at the end, I was like, 'what the heck was going on?' " said actor Ian Anthony Dale. One thing that can't miss at Comic-Con is free food, and Fox served up free burgers and soda on behalf of the upcoming animated series "Bob's Burgers." If so, they can look forward to a triumphant return like "Chuck" and "True Blood."
