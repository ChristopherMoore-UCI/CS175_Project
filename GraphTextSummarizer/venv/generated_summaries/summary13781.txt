The surviving members of The Doors don't have many kind words for the recent pardon of legendary singer Jim Morrison by Florida authorities. Despite being acquitted of lascivious behavior and drunkenness, Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity, and sentenced to six months in jail. Outgoing Florida Gov. Charlie Crist helped pave the way for the pardon earlier this month, clearing Morrison from a 40-year-old indecent exposure arrest and conviction. Morrison had been performing with the band at a typically raucous concert at Miami's Key Auditorium on March 1, 1969, when the incident took place. But Morrison's old bandmates, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore and Robby Krieger, said the gesture was too little too late.
