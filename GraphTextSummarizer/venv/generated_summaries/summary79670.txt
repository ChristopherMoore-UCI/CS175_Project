"We can expect between 30 and 40 millimeters (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches) of rain falling in many areas and up to 70 millimeters (2 3/4 inches) of rain in parts of northeast England, continuing the risk of further flooding and travel disruption," forecaster Eddy Carroll said in a news release. -- Days of heavy rain have led to flooding in southwestern England and parts of Wales and at least one fatality, British authorities said Sunday. Officials warned residents to use the daylight to prepare for more flooding Sunday and into the early hours of Monday. More than 225 areas stretching from Cornwall through the Midlands region to the northeastern coast were under flood warnings Sunday afternoon as the latest system moved through, the Environment Agency said. The UK Environment Agency posted a severe flood alert for the town of Helston, in the southwestern county of Cornwall, where the River Cober was rising over its banks, and warned towns across England and Wales to prepare for more high water.
