Despite the warnings, a handful of families frolicked in the surf Thursday in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. However, Thursday's rehearsal was closed to the public because of storms. Arthur is expected to bring storm surges of up to 7 feet, as well as large, damaging waves, high winds and dangerous rip currents that authorities warned could sweep even the strongest swimmers out to sea. Parts of Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia were under tropical storm warnings. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory told residents and tourists to stay inside while it was dark outside.
