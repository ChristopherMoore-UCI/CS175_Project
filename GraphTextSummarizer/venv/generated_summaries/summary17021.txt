Incoming Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday he expects to legally challenge President Barack Obama's new immigration action "in the next two weeks." Abbott, currently the attorney general in Texas, said he's reaching out to other governors and top state attorneys about joining the expected lawsuit. He said a 2012 Obama order deferring the deportation of "dreamers" -- undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, who would have gained legal status under a bill dubbed the "DREAM Act" that never became law -- led to "millions of dollars in costs to schools, to law enforcement, to health care" in Texas.

Abbott's charge against Obama's executive order limiting deportations has vaulted the Republican onto the national stage, giving him a lead role on a prominent issue just as he prepares to replace outgoing Gov. Rick Perry. He said the attorney general's office is currently conducting "research and analysis" on a legal challenge and is contacting other states with status updates.
