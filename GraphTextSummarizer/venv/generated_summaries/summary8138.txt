-- FIFA executive committee member Angel Villa Llona has defended football's world governing body against recent media allegations of corruption. But in a passionate speech, with Spain's prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and his Portuguese counterpart Jose Socrates in attendance at FIFA headquarters in Switzerland, Villa Llona denied that any of the now 22-strong committee were guilty of corruption. England's bid -- which some believe has been damaged by the revelations in the British press -- was bolstered by speeches from prime minister David Cameron, soccer superstar David Beckham and Prince William. "I love FIFA dearly but those I love the most are my colleagues in the ExCo," Villa Llona said. The Russian delegation were without their prime minister Vladimir Putin, who on Wednesday complained of an unfair bidding process at FIFA, but the bid was injected with a touch of glamour after the arrival of model Natalia Vodianova and Olympic pole-vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva.
