Also on Friday, Anonymous announced that it planned to release e-mails related to the 2005 deaths of 24 unarmed Iraqi civilians during a U.S. military raid in Haditha. A U.S. law enforcement source said the conversation was recorded after an e-mail that circulated Jan. 13 to the conference call participants was intercepted when one of those participants forwarded it to a personal e-mail account. In the recording, law enforcement officials can be heard discussing advances in investigations into hackers. The hackers say they have stolen 2.6 gigabytes of information from the firm including "detailed records, transcripts, testimony, trial evidence, and legal defense donation records," the online announcement said. The loose organization of hackers known as Anonymous released Friday a recording of a telephone call between the FBI and Scotland Yard that it said it recorded surreptitiously.
