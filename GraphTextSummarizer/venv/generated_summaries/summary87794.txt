A Twitter account was set up to monitor sightings. X-rays were ordered up as was a period of evaluation before the owl would be released back into the wild, City Wildlife, an animal rehabilitation center, said in a statement on Twitter. There were no obvious signs of physical injury, but blood found in bird's mouth could indicate head trauma, the zoo said. The bird, believed to be female, was apparently hit on Wednesday night and found by police in the early morning hours on a downtown street with injuries. The owl's twitter account was inundated with well-wishes Thursday from many followers who had been documenting its whereabouts around the capital.
