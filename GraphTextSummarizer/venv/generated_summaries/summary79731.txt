As part of CNN's Instant Startups series, CNNMoney correspondent Laurie Segall reached out to Meerkat's Ben Rubin with some questions. We heard more about Meerkat and Rubin's vision for the future; for example, he sees the app branching out to work with other platforms, like Facebook or Tumblr. Rubin is actually the co-founder and chief executive of Life On Air Inc., a livestreaming company with many tentacles. But recently Rubin decided to dedicate his entire team to work on Meerkat after the app's popularity exploded. If you haven't yet been asked by friends or co-workers to Meerkat, chances are you will soon.
