The suspension left him without a coach, and it was only when existing long-jump world record holder Ralph Boston agreed to coach him unofficially that he was able to resume normal training. Encouraged by a series of inspirational teachers he devoted himself increasingly to athletics -- "I got off the corner and into the community center," as he later put it -- and was soon setting city-wide, and then national records for long jump, culminating in his Olympic team selection in 1968. In terms of sheer sporting achievement, however, few if any feats can compare with the record-shattering leap that won American Bob Beamon the long jump gold medal in Mexico City in 1968. Before Beamon started his run-up the world record -- held jointly by Ralph Boston of the U.S. and the Soviet Union's Igor Ter-Ovanesyan -- stood at 27 feet 4 3/4 inches (8.35 meters). The modern Olympics have, in their 104-year history, seen the setting, and breaking, of numerous world records.
