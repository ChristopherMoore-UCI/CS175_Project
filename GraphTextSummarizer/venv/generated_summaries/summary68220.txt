Russian divers find huge suspected meteorite chunk Near passes daily Two behemoths in that size range will pass by planet Earth in the next three months at similar distances as 2013 TV135. Also, the chances that this one, which the Ukrainian astronomers who discovered it named 2013 TV135, will collide with Earth are extremely slim, NASA said in a statement it called "a reality check." That pales by compare to the closest shave the Earth got from an asteroid of considerable size in recorded history. "This is a relatively new discovery," said Don Yeomans, manager of NASA's NEO Program. But until then, it has the distinction of having a danger rating of 1 out of a possible 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, the system that gauges the danger of impact destruction by asteroids.
