-- A brush fire near Disney World prompted authorities to bar traffic in both directions along a major central Florida highway for several hours at the beginning of the busy Memorial Day weekend, a police spokeswoman said. "It was pretty smoky and irritating to breathe," said Charlton, who submitted photographs to CNN iReport from outside the hotel that showed Orange County fire vehicles directly across the street. It takes nothing for a small fire to become a big fire," Orange County Fire Rescue Battalion Chief David Sullivan told reporters. Joseph Sikon, a 21-year-old who attends medical school in Orlando, said he noticed the blaze after getting out of a movie theater Friday afternoon in Downtown Disney, part of the Walt Disney World Resort. Large plumes of white and gray smoke hovered over and around Interstate 4 for much of Friday afternoon, footage from CNN affiliate WKMG showed.
