As U.S. officials prepared for war they were shocked to find Iran ready to help. After George H.W. Bush's election in 1988, the U.S. reached out to Iran once again, saying in his inaugural address, "Goodwill begets goodwill". This led to the infamous "Mission to Tehran", where senior U.S. officials traveled to Tehran to trade weapons and spare parts in exchange for the release of American hostages held in Lebanon. Following the Gulf War, the U.S. sought to "contain" Iran and Iraq, even though Iran had disarmed itself following the Iran-Iraq War. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Iranian people -- much to the surprise of U.S. officials -- poured into the streets in solidarity with the American people.
