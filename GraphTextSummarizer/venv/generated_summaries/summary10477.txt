Rugby in Brazil is experiencing rapid growth and inclusion will generate further impetus and excitement while giving the Brazilian rugby family and sports fans across the nation something really special to look forward to at their home Olympics. The IRB are seeking to address that and last year injected $400,000 into rugby in Brazil in order to increase participation, while 9,000 children have been introduced to the sport via its Get Into Rugby Program. Rugby is thought to have been brought to Brazil by British immigrants in the late 19th Century, the first recorded match taking place in 1888 in Sao Paulo. Sevens is making its Olympic bow in Rio de Janeiro and increasingly teams in the Brazilian city are seen practicing on the iconic Copacabana Beach and elsewhere - overall in the country, rugby participation in Brazil has risen by 25% since 2011. "We are excited and honored for rugby sevens to be making its Olympic Games debut in Rio and believe that the Games will be great for rugby and rugby will be great for the Games."
