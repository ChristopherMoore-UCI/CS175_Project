Timeline of U.S. school violence Speaking in Washington, President Barack Obama said the nation should be ashamed of its inability to get tougher gun restrictions through Congress in the aftermath of mass shootings that he said have become commonplace in America. The 15-year-old Padgett arrived at school on a bus, carrying a guitar case and a duffel bag, Troutdale Police Chief Scott Anderson told reporters Wednesday. The number of active shooter events -- defined as one or more people whose primary motive is mass murder in a confined or populated area, not including gang and family-related shootings -- has risen somewhat in real numbers in recent years. A report by the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center found that the number of these types of mass shootings has increased from an average of about five a year prior to 2009 to 15 in 2013. Authorities have found no link between Padgett and his victim, 14-year-old freshman, Emilio Hoffman, and no known motive.
