Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan provided the video, which restates the militants' goals -- to sever Pakistan's alliance with the United States and to bring sharia law to Pakistan. The official said that NATO and the Afghan government have "badly failed" at stopping militants from entering Pakistan. The soldiers were on a routine patrol in the Upper Dir district of Pakistan, near the Afghan border, when more than 100 militants who crossed the border from Afghanistan attacked, the official said. Militants based in Afghanistan have killed more than 100 Pakistani soldiers in cross-border attacks since 2010, the official said. -- Seventeen Pakistani soldiers who were kidnapped last week are shown beheaded in a video released by the Taliban.
