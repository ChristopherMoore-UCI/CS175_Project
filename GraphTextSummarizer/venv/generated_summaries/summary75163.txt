Insane Clown Posse 'qualified' for new TV show Pellegrini, a three-year employee with Psychopathic Records, filed the suit in September 2013, alleging "wrongful termination, harassment, retaliation and infliction of emotional distress" against ICP (Joseph "Violent J" Bruce and Joseph "Shaggy 2 Dope" Utsler), Psychopathic Records and the group's manager, William Dale. Pictures The subpoena states that "Dirty Dan" Diamond, a former employee of ICP's label Psychopathic Records, gave the item to Kid Rock after a failed attempt at passing it along to Pellegrini. Attorneys for the group's former publicist, Andrea Pellegrini, have subpoenaed the rocker to produce the item as court evidence, Detroit Free Press reports. Kid Rock (real name Robert James Ritchie) has 14 days to produce the item in court; both the singer and his manager, Lee Trink, were unavailable for comment for the Free Press as of Tuesday evening. According to the Free Press, an attorney for ICP denied the allegations last year.
