U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry waded into the thicket of Mideast politics Friday, chiding the Turkish prime minister for a slam on Zionism while touting the ties the United States has with Turkey and Israel -- two once friendly nations now mired in antipathy. Kerry said the United States and Turkey share opposition to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Turkey has called for an apology for the incident, which resulted in the deaths of eight Turks and one American of Turkish origin.
