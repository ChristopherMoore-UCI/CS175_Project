A few years after her breakthrough, Furtado teamed up with superproducer Timbaland for her 2006 album "Loose," a collaboration that gained her scores of hip-hop and R&B fans as well, and spawned hits such as "Promiscuous" and "Say It Right." "Mi Plan" pairs her with a few Spanish-language music artists, including Alex Cuba, Juan Luis Guerra, Julieta Venegas and La Mala Rodriguez, as well as English-language artist Josh Groban. -- Singer Nelly Furtado is trying to cross over in a direction many artists don't ordinarily take. Then I started writing songs in Spanish and it started flowing, so this album has been like a medicine of sorts. With "Mi Plan," the Grammy Award-winning singer is taping into a brand new market and fan base, almost a decade after she came to fame in 2000 with the single "I'm Like a Bird." Four albums in, it's a tough job to try to attract new fans and I think that's what I am doing with this new music.
