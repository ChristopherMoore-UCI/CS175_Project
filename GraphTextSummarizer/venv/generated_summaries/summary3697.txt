Sudden celebrity deaths often draw early speculation about drug involvement in Hollywood, but in several recent cases the cause of death proved to be natural. -- Sylvester Stallone appealed Monday for an end to "speculation and questionable reporting" about his son's death, while police and the coroner investigate what killed Sage Stallone last week. Sage Stallone, 36, was found dead in his Los Angeles home Friday by his housekeeper, who was asked by Stallone's mother to check on him after his lawyer and friend, George Braunstein, was unable to reach him, Braunstein told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Monday. Sylvester Stallone, in a statement to CNN Monday, referred to celebrity news websites' speculation about his son using drugs. Similar speculation about drug use followed the December 2009 death of actress Brittany Murphy.
