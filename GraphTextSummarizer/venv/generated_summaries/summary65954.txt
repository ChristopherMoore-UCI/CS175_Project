-- Fourth seed Andy Murray has crashed out of the prestigious Indian Wells tournament in California, beaten in straight sets by Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in his opening match. The fourth-seeded Dane was joined in the next round by second seed Maria Sharapova and sixth seed Samantha Stosur, who also enjoyed straight sets wins. There were also wins for seventh seed Tomas Berdych and eighth seed Mardy Fish, but amongst those to also go out were Richard Gasquet, Kei Nishikori and Florian Mayer -- seeded 16th, 17th and 18th respectively. There were no such problems for world number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic, who beat Kazakh qualifier Andrey Golubev 6-3 6-2, the same player he defeated in his opening match in last year's tournament. The biggest surprise in the women's section saw 11th seed Sabine Lisicki go down 6-1 6-4 to Lourdes Dominguez of Spain.
