The narcotics were uncovered on January 16 inside hollowed-out books that had been shipped from Mexico City in a bag made to look like a diplomatic pouch, according to New York police spokesman Paul Browne. -- More than 35 pounds of cocaine was discovered in at least one bag that turned up at the United Nations headquarters in New York "The actual pouch is blue and has a U.N. symbol, a lock and seal, and words like "Diplomatic Mail," Browne said. U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said, "This was not connected to the United Nations, and that's why the host government, the city authorities, in the shape of the NYPD, were brought in to assist." It lacked a destination address and was without a return address, Browne added.
