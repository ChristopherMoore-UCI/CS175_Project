Francis is the fourth pope to travel to Turkey, following in the footsteps of Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. On Sunday, Pope Francis and the head of a major one vowed to heal one of the church's oldest splits. In an address given in Francis' presence, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan highlighted what he said was a disturbing trend of increased racism and Islamophobia in the West, while Islamist extremism wracks parts of the Middle East. On Friday, the first day of his visit, Francis called for religious tolerance and dialogue to counter extremism in the Middle East, as he met with Turkey's leaders. The world is morally obligated to help Turkey care for the great number of refugees it has taken in, Francis said.
