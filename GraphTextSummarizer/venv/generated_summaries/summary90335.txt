According to Diego Della Valle, owner of high end shoemaker, Tod's, the nation's biggest companies have a responsibility to maintain Italian monuments as they are all part of the same brand experience. The Colosseum in Rome is an Italian icon and a relic that dates back to the first century A.D. -- lions, gladiators, chariots and all. Elsewhere, Bulgari is putting $2 million into the Spanish Steps while fashion house Fendi has offered up nearly $3 million for the equally famous Trevi Fountain. These budgetary issues are complicated further by social and professional movements pressuring their representatives elected representatives on a number of issues such as pay and public services. "To me, this belongs to the entire mankind," Rome mayor Ignazio Marino told CNN as he looked out over the Italian capital from a balcony at City Hall.
