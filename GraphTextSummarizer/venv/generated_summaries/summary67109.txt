Marine lost in Persian Gulf might be first U.S. casualty in ISIS campaign Kurdish fighters Alan Minbic, a fighter with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, said ISIS maintained control Saturday of the southwest corner of Kobani, but YPG snipers held off an ISIS attempt to seize a strategic ridge overlooking Kobani. Recent airstrikes in the Kirkuk area have killed nine people and injured 16 more, but it wasn't immediately clear how many of them were ISIS fighters, Iraqi security forces said. Thousands of civilians have fled the predominantly Kurdish city in northern Syria in recent days as ISIS forces apparently are seeking to create a direct route to the Syria-Turkish border. But ISIS militants still controlled much of Hit, where there is no presence of the Iraqi army or local militias, and they also managed to control parts of Mohammadi, about seven mile southeast of Hit, without any resistance from the army or the security forces, according to accounts from witnesses and Iraqi officials. U.S.-led coalition airstrikes in northern Syria killed at least 35 ISIS extremists Saturday, including five in Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, said the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group that collects casualty information.
