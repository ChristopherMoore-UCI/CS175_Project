In an attempt to keep the devices relevant in the 21st century, New York City has been soliciting designs for potential phone boxes of the future. The Reinvent Payphones contest launched in December last year, encouraged design professionals, students and tech lovers to send in their futuristic visions of the phone booth. A host of cool, practical and artistic concepts have been devised, displayed and implemented in cities around the world in recent years. London has its unmistakeable red kiosks while the perspex glass boxes with sliding doors -- long favored as a changing room by Superman -- have been a familiar site in urban locations across the U.S. for decades. With the inexorable rise of cell phones however, the humble pay phone has become less of an important public utility and more an archaic inner-city remnant.
