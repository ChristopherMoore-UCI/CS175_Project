-- The New York Police Department has arrested a man in the shooting deaths of three New York City shopkeepers, according to Commissioner Raymond Kelly. Police said the .22-caliber rifle was used to kill Vahidipour Rahmatollah, 78, at his She-She boutique on November 16; Isaac Kadare, 59, at Amazing 99-Cent Deals on August 2; and Mohamed Gebeli, 65, on July 6 at Valentino Fashion in Brooklyn. Perrone was an independent seller of men's and women's clothing to boutiques in Brooklyn, said Kelly. Perrone is charged with three counts of murder and faces life in prison if convicted. "I think it's reasonable to assume that he was going to continue doing this and by arresting him, we have saved lives," said Kelly.
