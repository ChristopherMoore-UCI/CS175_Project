Its Web site says Hookers for Jesus "addresses the realities of human sex trafficking." Annie Lobért, who founded Hookers for Jesus, and musician Oz Fox of the Christian band Stryper said their "I do's" at the Church of South Las Vegas in front of an applauding crowd and an audience on the Internet. The Hookers for Jesus Web site describes the organization as "an international, faith-based organization that addresses the realities of human sex trafficking, sexual violence and exploitation linked to pornography and the sex industry." She often spends time at night on Las Vegas streets handing out Bibles to prostitutes and seeking to convince them there is a better way to make a living. The wedding had been widely touted on several Christian Web sites. She asked Jesus to help her and became what many jokingly call a "porn-again Christian." Lobért says her mission now is to save the souls of women who sell their bodies.
