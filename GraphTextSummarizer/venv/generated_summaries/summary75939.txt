The real Katz told "New Day's" Chris Cuomo he believes the Enquirer was misled but he was still stunned the publication ran with the story without cross-checking it with other sources -- and that other media outlets picked it up. Not only did the reporting inaccurately depict Hoffman as a man in a death spiral, playwright David Bar Katz said the press also was lax when it came to a National Enquirer story claiming he and Hoffman were lovers. "I know that it's lousy journalism." Katz sued the Enquirer over the story, reaching a settlement in which the tabloid agreed to fund an award for unpublished playwrights in Hoffman's memory. On Wednesday, the National Enquirer took out a full-page ad in The New York Times saying it "made a good faith error by publishing an interview with a person who falsely and convincingly claimed to be Mr. Katz." More broadly, Katz said the media had gotten the narrative wrong when it came to Hoffman's life and death, saying the well-respected actor was not in a destructive death spiral the night he died.
