Choosing the best-value islands As much as Paris doesn't represent France, Bora Bora, Tahiti and Moorea (the beloved islands of tour operators), don't sum up French Polynesia. Affordable accommodation Glossy brochures focus on ultra-swish resorts, but French Polynesia actually has a pretty wide range of accommodation options. Good news, too, for those who want to spend their holiday under canvas: French Polynesia has a smattering of camping options. Tip: skip the heavily-publicized islands, such as Bora Bora, which are very expensive, and consider lesser-known, off-the-radar islands, which offer greater value for money. Budget-friendly ways to get around Air Tahiti, the domestic airline, has six island-hopping air passes offering inclusive fares to a number of islands.
