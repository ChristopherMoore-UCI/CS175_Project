In addition to the United States and North Korea, the six-party talks involved China, Japan, Russia and South Korea. The United States and South Korea, however, have insisted on some tangible demonstration that North Korea is serious about denuclearization. It was the first direct meeting between North Korean and U.S. officials since North Korea pulled out of six-party talks in 2008. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said recently, for example, that the United States hoped to determine in its meetings with the North Korean foreign minister whether North Korea is ready to "take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization." The call follows a rare visit to the United States by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kae-Gwan, who met with senior U.S. officials last week.
