Israel's attorney general said Wednesday that Shin Bet, the country's internal security force, can search a foreign traveler's e-mail, but only in exceptional cases in which "relevant suspicious signs" are observed. Lila Margalit, an attorney for the Association for Civil Rights, said the practice is a violation of privacy rights: "A tourist who has just spent thousands of dollars to travel to Israel, only to be interrogated at the airport by Shin Bet agents and told to grant access to their e-mail account, is in no position to give free and informed consent," she said Wednesday. If you're a tourist arriving in Israel, you might be asked to give authorities a look at your personal e-mail, in addition to your travel documents. The association said the question was a reaction to media reports last year that several Palestinian-American travelers were asked to open their e-mail accounts and show airport security before being denied entry. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel received the information from the Attorney General's Office after it asked whether Israel's security forces could demand travelers' e-mail and social media passwords.
