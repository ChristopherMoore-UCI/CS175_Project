-- The trial for deposed Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, on Saturday was postponed until next month, state media reported. Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's removal from office, with the military battling Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters. Opinion: What Mubarak's release means Mubarak's successor, Mohamed Morsy, was ousted from power this year. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had said that he was physically unfit to stand trial. Mubarak was convicted on the charges last year and sentenced to life in prison, but appealed the ruling and was granted a retrial.
