"Since the 5.7 occurred, we've had another larger series of aftershocks occurring," said geophysicist Amy Vaughan of the USGS in Golden, Colorado. "We've had over 12,000 'felt reports' coming in from most of Southern California, parts of Arizona and parts of Baja California," Vaughan said. "Were this a 7.5 it would be a different story probably, but because it's a 5.7 occurring in this area and also not directly in a large metropolitan area, like it's not downtown LA or downtown San Diego, helps as well," Vaughan said. -- A moderate earthquake followed by dozens of smaller ones rattled Southern California Monday evening, just north of the Mexican border, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
