Indeed, Stewart said, many people still sniff roses hoping for an aroma; what they likely smell is a combination of chlorophyll and fillers used at flower shops. The book chronicles how a sustained effort to create sturdy flowers ended up inadvertently creating flowers without a scent. It also created a market where the majority of roses sold in the United States come from Colombia, so they're bred to be affordable and long-lasting, often at the expense of fragrance, Stewart said. The international flower market works on a massive scale and ships flowers thousands of miles around the world. When it comes to smelling the roses, most sold in U.S. supermarkets and flower shops have no scent, or at least none of their own.
