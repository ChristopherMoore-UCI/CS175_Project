Video captured by Splash News showed a smiling Sorrentino walking out of the Middletown, New Jersey, police station after posting a $500 bond Tuesday afternoon. Sorrentino, 31, was the only person charged in the fight, according to Police Lt. Stephen Dollinger. The Situation: I'm not the same person I was before Sorrentino, who appeared in six seasons of the MTV reality series "Jersey Shore," emerged from a stint in drug rehab two years ago declaring that he was a changed man. The Situation told the photographer that the fight happened because his brother "was not running the store correctly, so I had to go in there and clean house, in more ways than one." -- Former "Jersey Shore" star Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino was charged with simple assault after a fight in a tanning salon he co-owns with his brother.
