" OU's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter unraveled this week after video showed frat brothers singing about excluding black students and alluding to lynching. Mom B means a lot to me." James said he has reached to Mom B. after the Oklahoma Daily newspaper posted the clip, which was shot in 2013. The release of the Vine video, featuring the house mother of the campus' Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, couldn't come at a worse time -- just days after video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song. Suddenly, the words spew from her pink-painted lips: "Ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni*****!" " Black OU SAE alumnus: 'They are not my brothers' Jonathon Davis, the first African-American member of the campus' SAE chapter, also defended "Mom B." "I wouldn't even hesitate for a split second to say that Mom B. is undoubtedly not a racist," Davis said.
