The frenetic pace of the presidency is largely a reflection of America's role as the premier global power in the post-World War II era, Dalleck told CNN. Teddy Roosevelt would "just disappear as president for months at a time and people didn't know where he was," noted acclaimed Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley. Faced with a pressure for constant response, modern administrations face times "of great pressure and intense demand over a series of compelling issues," he said. Not really, according to Boston University presidential historian Robert Dalleck. Obama was able to "monitor the situation in real time," according to White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan.
