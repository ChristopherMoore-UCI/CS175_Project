" Basnet is one of several in Nepal who have started groups to get children out of prison. " Basnet decided to start a day care to get incarcerated children out from behind the prison walls. "Often, they think that they're useless because they're in prison," Basnet said. Ultimately, Basnet wants the families to reunite outside prison, and 60 of her children have been able to do just that. She runs a day care program for children under 6 and a residential home where mostly older children receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life.
