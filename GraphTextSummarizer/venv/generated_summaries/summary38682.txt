Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, is pictured in Afghanistan in November 2007. While Prince had used his connection to A. B. "Buzzy" Krongard, the former executive director of the CIA, to get his first black contract for security work, the agency had continued to renew Blackwater's work, even after Krongard left. Afghanistan was a big market for Blackwater, and Prince hoped he could expand his business on this trip. After his earlier work for the bureau investigating the embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, he had become Blackwater's regional director of training in Afghanistan in 2003 for the Drug Enforcement Agency and Afghan narcotics interdiction contracts, as well as the Afghan border police training programs. Once safely inside the airport's perimeter, Prince and his team made their way to the Blackwater plane sitting on the tarmac.
