After the talk, standing in the sun-splashed campus courtyard, I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people â€” as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with small-government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party. Paul favors traditional marriage, but has said states should determine their own marriage laws. He said he wasn't supportive of drug use, explaining that pot "is not that great," but said drug laws should be left up to states. "Rand Paul, Republican presidential hopeful, finds support in Berkeley, of all places," the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March. Last March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20-somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones.
