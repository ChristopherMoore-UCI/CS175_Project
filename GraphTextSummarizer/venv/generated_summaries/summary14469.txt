-- The video of four U.S. Marines urinating on three dead Taliban fighters has ricocheted around the world with viral speed, rightly provoking moral outrage abroad and shame at home. Desecration of bodies in war is nothing new nor is the public condemnation of it. The act is a violation of professional military conduct and the fundamental moral requirement in war of showing dignity and respect to the dead. And all this comes after Hector pleads to Achilles with his last breath: "I beg you, beg you by your life, your parents, don't let the dogs devour me... give my body to friends to carry home again" for "honor with fitting rites." It is that empathy that checks ugly revenge impulses in war.
