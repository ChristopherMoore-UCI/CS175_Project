-- The Pakistani Taliban have declared a cease-fire in South Waziristan, one of the seven semi-autonomous tribal areas in northwest Pakistan, three Taliban commanders told CNN Tuesday. The group has demanded an exchange of prisoners, the withdrawal of Pakistani troops from South Waziristan and compensation for the victims of army operations in the area, which borders Afghanistan, the Taliban commanders told CNN. "The Taliban have been trying to contact us; however, we will not engage in peace talks with them until they give up their arms," Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN. The Pakistan military dismissed the reports of ongoing peace talks as "concocted and baseless." Commander Asif Yasin Malik, a military spokesman, told reporters in Mingora, in Pakistan's northwestern Swat district: "We are not talking to the Taliban. South Waziristan is believed to be the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban leadership.
