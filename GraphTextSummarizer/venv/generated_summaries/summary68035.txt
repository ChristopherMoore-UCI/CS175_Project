Helium in Algeria is extracted during the liquefaction of natural gas, so when demand for LNG drops, as this year because of the economic crisis in Europe, helium production also drops. Now, the focus is again the US, which provided almost four-fifths of the 180m cubic metres of helium consumed around the world last year. Global production of helium -- used in industrial and medical applications, as well as balloons -- has sharply fallen this year in the US and Algeria, the two biggest exporters. In Algeria, too, supplies of helium have dropped alongside shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe. A global shortage of helium, the lighter-than-air gas, has put a stop to the sale of inflatable Mickey Mouse heads at Disneyland in Tokyo, threatened parades during the US Thanksgiving holiday and disrupted university research.
