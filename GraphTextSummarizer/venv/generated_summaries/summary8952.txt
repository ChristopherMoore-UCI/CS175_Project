Blog: Expect more shocks at the Africa Cup of Nations Senegal made six changes to the team who lost 2-1 to Equatorial Guinea in their second group match, dropping goalkeeper Khadim Ndiaye and misfiring strikers Souleymane Camara and Demba Ba, who came to the tournament with big reputations. Ihab El Busaifi scored twice for the surprise qualifiers to give them their first victory in the tournament, but they finished three points behind group winners Zambia and two adrift of runners-up Equatorial Guinea. Zambia defeated co-hosts Equatorial Guinea 1-0 Sunday to win the group on seven points. Zambia owed their victory over Equatorial Guinea at the Nuevo Estadio de Malabo to a goal from captain Christopher Katongo after 67 minutes. They will now face the runners-up from Group B in Bata, while Equatorial Guinea will take on the winners of Group B, most likely the Ivory Coast, in Malabo for a place in the last semifinals.
