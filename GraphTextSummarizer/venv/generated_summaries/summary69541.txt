His radical transformation into a ruthless drug baron has spawned a cult-like following (fans are even getting Walter White tattoos). Actor Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) custom ordered these awhile back and ever since Blue Sky doughnuts have been flying off the shelves. You'll also find red-and-green chili fudge and X-rated candy (aka chocolate in the shape of unmentionable body parts). After you're finished cooking, try the 40-minute Bathing Bad Body Scrub where your lucky limbs are exfoliated with all-natural ingredients and rehydrated with the cerulean Bathing Bad lotion. The wildly popular, Emmy-winning television series shot in Albuquerque tells the story of mild-mannered Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer early in the show.
