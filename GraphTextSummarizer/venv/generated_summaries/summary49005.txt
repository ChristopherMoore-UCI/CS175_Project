"I am old enough now to know that life throws different curveballs and it's about how you handle them," she told CNN's World Sport. -- She spent her teenage years ruling the tennis world, and now Monica Seles is hoping her world of tennis can rule today's teenagers. Five years of training at Nick Bollettieri's famous academy in Florida turned the slender young Seles into the 1990 French Open champion at the tender age of 16 years and six months, and at 17 she became the youngest No. 1. From becoming the youngest grand slam champion to having her career shattered by a traumatic stabbing attack, then battling related weight problems before losing her father and coach to cancer, the 39-year-old has plenty of life experience to draw on for her latest project. It soon emerged that the German assailant, one Gunter Parche, was a devoted fan of former world No. 1 Steffi Graf who carried out the attack in a bid to return his compatriot to the top of the rankings -- which did come to pass, but clearly for the very worst of reasons.
