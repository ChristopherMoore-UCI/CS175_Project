-- Even in death, peace seemed to elude little Myls Dobson. Herbert and Dobson demanded answers from child welfare authorities. Philip Lights, Dobson's lawyer, said the case was later dismissed after his client agreed to counseling and treatment under the supervision of child welfare authorities. The boy's mother, Ashlee Dobson, who faced abuse and neglect charges in both South Carolina and New York City before ultimately losing custody of Myls in 2011, plans a memorial service for her son in Harlem on Tuesday night. Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday.
