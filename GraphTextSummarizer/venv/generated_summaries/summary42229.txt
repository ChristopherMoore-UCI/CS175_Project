But AOL senior vice president, David Temkin, released a statement about Simon's situation, saying, "It was always our intention to facilitate entrepreneurialism in the Palo Alto office -- we just didn't expect it to work so well." Simons, now 20, admits that mooching and living round-the-clock at AOL's offices was "certainly a gray area" legally. He said that he spent a total of $30 over those weeks, splurging at Boston Market for his Thanksgiving feast but otherwise subsisting largely by "eating scraps." "I wasn't paying for rent, I wasn't paying for water, (and) most of my food was provided by other companies leaving leftovers," Simons recalled. Simons evaded security for two months -- not to mention having to pay for an apartment, gym membership and more. Thus the then-19-year-old put off college, left his Chicago home and headed west last year to work out of AOL's Palo Alto, California, office. But Eric Simons is not like most people.
