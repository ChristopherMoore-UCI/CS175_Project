We have introduced different classes of car, cut back the number of solar arrays that are allowed, and introduced other rules such as the driver having to sit upright in a normal driving position, and having to get in and out of the car unaided. "A normal petrol engine is about 25 percent efficient in terms of energy use," explains Tine Lavrysen. " ........................................ Could solar cars replace petrol vehicles? While the fruits of that creativity may not look especially car-like -- with their arrays of solar panels most of the entries resemble nothing so much as giant silicon chips on wheels -- they are nonetheless driving forward, quite literally, a quiet revolution in energy efficiency. Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, the Challenge is the world's premier long-distance race for solar-powered vehicles, with competitors traveling 3000 kms along the Stuart Highway from Darwin in the far north of Australia to Adelaide in the south in cars powered solely by sunlight.
