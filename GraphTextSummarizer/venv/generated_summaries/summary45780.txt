-- A third oil holding tank has gone up in flames at the Amuay oil refinery in northwestern Venezuela, Oil and Mining Minister Rafael Ramirez said Monday. The refinery -- one of the world's largest -- is part of the giant Paraguana complex in Falcon state. The organization said Venezuela's oil revenues represent some 94% of the country's export earnings, more than half of federal budget revenues and some 30% of gross domestic product. Among the dead were 18 members of the national guard and 15 civilians, according to Vice President Elias Jaua, state-run VTV reported. The early Saturday blast damaged refinery infrastructure and ripped through nearby houses.
