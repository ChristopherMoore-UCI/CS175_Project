Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer told reporters Monday that he was told not to discuss Karageorge's medical history. Franklin County Coroner Anahi Ortiz said Karageorge's brain will likely be tested for evidence of damage due to concussions. Body found while scavenging Karageorge had been missing since Wednesday after he missed an early morning football practice. Team physician Dr. Jim Borchers said Friday that the team was not able to discuss or comment on Karageorge's medical care. Students joined in, posting fliers with Karageorge's photo under windshield wipers and on telephone posts.
