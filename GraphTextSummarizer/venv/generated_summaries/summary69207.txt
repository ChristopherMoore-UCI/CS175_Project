-- Israeli police arrested Tuesday an immigrant from the former Yugoslavia who is suspected of participating in the 1995 massacre in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multi-ethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others -- into six countries during bloody and brutal conflicts in the early 1990s. That evidence exposes shocking details of the massacre of Muslims at Braniewo farm, the ministry said. "Hundreds of Bosnian civilians were bused to the farm handcuffed and blindfolded. The Israeli state prosecutor's office received an extradition request for him last August from the Bosnian government.
