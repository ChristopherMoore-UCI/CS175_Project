"Brain death isn't a different type of death, and patients who meet the criteria of brain death are legally dead." All criteria in the guidelines must be met before a person can be considered brain dead; however, the legal definition of brain death can vary from state to state. Doctors should be more transparent about the finality of brain death, said Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. But without brain function, the body eventually shuts down, unless there is medical intervention. "We are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care," said Allyson Scerri, founder of New Beginnings Community Center in Medford, New York.
