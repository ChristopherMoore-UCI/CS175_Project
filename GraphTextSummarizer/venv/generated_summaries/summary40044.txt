First built in the 9th century, Prague Castle has survived wars, fires and opposing political powers. -- Prague has not been nicknamed "Zlata Praha" or "Golden Prague" for no good reason. Old Town Square: Located in the heart of the Old Town, this square included Prague's gothic Church of Our Lady before Tyn, the main church of this part of the city since the 14th century. Its thick walls house the National Cemetery, where many of Prague's most illustrious citizens are buried, including Czech composer Anton√≠n Leopold Dvorak and writer Karel Capek. In 1969, Prague student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Wenceslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.
