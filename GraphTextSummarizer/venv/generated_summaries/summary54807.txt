In the women's marathon in Berlin, there was more Kenyan success as Florence Kiplagat took the tape ahead of Sharon Cherop. " Kipsang was born in Kenya's Keiyo District, an area popular for high altitude training, but it was on the fast streets of Berlin that he achieved his lifelong ambition. His marathon world record was the ninth set in the German capital and the eighth over the marathon course in the last 15 years. The Kenyan athlete smashed the record for the 26.2 mile slog by a huge 15 seconds on the streets of the German capital of Berlin. "This is a dream come true," said Kipsang, who won the bronze medal in the men's marathon at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
