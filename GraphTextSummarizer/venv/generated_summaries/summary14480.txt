" Dead giraffe fed to lions The decision by Copenhagen Zoo to shoot its male giraffe named Marius to prevent inbreeding sparked wide fury. "We are begging Jylland's Park Zoo to please begin a new trend by showing that there is a more compassionate alternative to surplus animals or animals deemed not fit to breed within your zoo," its author said. "Our giraffes are part of an international breeding program, which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes," he said. Staff at the zoo received death threats as debate raged online over the killing, which took place despite another petition signed by thousands of animal lovers. The zoo said Thursday it might also have to "euthanize" one of its male giraffes -- which coincidentally shares the name Marius with the giraffe that was killed -- if a female was brought in to breed.
