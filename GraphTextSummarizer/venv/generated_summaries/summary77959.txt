It was the late night host's first day back from a week-long hiatus that occurred at the same time news broke about a new succession plan for "The Tonight Show." O'Brien, who replaced Jay Leno as host of "Tonight" for seven months until he was pushed aside in 2010, chose to joke about Passover and the Pope instead of his former employer, or the comedian who's now about to lose his high-profile gig on NBC to Jimmy Fallon. NBC's Jay Leno plan has some insiders baffled "Tonight is the beginning of the 8-day Jewish holiday of Passover, when God freed the Jews from slavery in Egypt," according to an early transcript from O'Brien's monologue. This is real: I had dinner last night with a bunch of NBC executives. Jay Leno's Friday jokes: Knifed in the back by NBC NBC has yet to officially confirm multiple reports that say Fallon will succeed Leno no later than fall of 2014, and that "The Tonight Show" will be relocated to New York. Of course, what guy wants to buy a condom from a company called 'Microsoft.'" O'Brien's guests for the night were Magic Johnson, Thandie Newton and musical guest Langhorne Slim.
