-- Venus Williams' latest tennis outfit -- a revealing black-lace corset dress with bright red straps -- has caused controversy since she wore it for her first round match at the French Open. From Serena's denim skirt and boot combo to Venus's designer dresses, there isn't much that the sisters have not tried to wear on the court. Ever since the pair appeared on the WTA Tour in the 1990's -- complete with multi-colored braided hair -- they have been setting, and sometimes destroying,  trends with their extroverted dress sense. However, not all their outfits have been popular with the critics, least of all Venus's lace number and the skin-colored shorts that she wears underneath, which has caused quite a stir in Paris. But this is not the first time the wardrobe choices of Venus and her younger sister Serena have come under the spotlight.
