Chandhok, 27,  joined Team Lotus team as a reserve driver in March and has not taken part in a race since representing Hispania at the 2010 British Grand Prix. -- CNN-sponsored Team Lotus have drafted in Karun Chandhok to replace Jarno Trulli for Sunday's German Grand Prix. "I know there will be millions of Indian fans, and Team Lotus fans around the world, who will be behind me and the whole team, so I will do the best I can to give them something to cheer for." Chandhok also received the backing of one-time grand prix winner Trulli, who vowed to help his teammate in the build up to the Nurburgring event. When Chandhok lines up on the grid for the race he will be alongside his compatriot Narain Karthikeyan, who is in his first season with Hispania. Trulli, 37, is currently in his second season with Team Lotus, but the veteran Italian, who has also raced for Jordan and Renault during a 14-year career, has failed to score a point in 28 races with the marquee.
