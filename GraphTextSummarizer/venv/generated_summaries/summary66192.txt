It is unlikely that the suspects, accused of a crime that has shocked many in South Africa, will be granted bail, officials have said. -- Three of four minors accused of taking part in a brutal videotaped gang rape of a teenager will face full prosecution, a spokesman for a South African court said Wednesday. The shocking footage shows the girl pleading for her attackers to stop, and it has some activists saying it is an example of the country's problem with rape. A woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa, according to local aid groups. An eighth suspect -- a man who was found with the victim -- is scheduled to appear in court on May 4, court officials said.
