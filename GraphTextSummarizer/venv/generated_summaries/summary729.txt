No specifics were given on the extent or parameters of the loans, which would be the second round in the bailout aimed at keeping Greece solvent -- and preventing its economic crisis from worsening and spreading through Europe and beyond. -- Applauding budget-cutting measures taken and proposed by Greece's government in the face of intense public pressure, European finance ministers announced Monday that Athens is on track to receive fresh loans in mid-July. There are fears that efforts to restructure Greece's debt could send shock waves through Europe's banking sector and spark investor panic similar to that in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the U.S.-based global investment bank. Two days after his appointment as finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos attended talks Sunday on a second economic bailout package for his debt-strapped country as part of a two-day meeting on Europe's economic outlook in Luxembourg. They and the finance ministers will examine existing bailouts for Ireland and Portugal, as well as the economic progress in those countries.
