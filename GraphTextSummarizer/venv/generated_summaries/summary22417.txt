When the Obama team systematically goes after Romney for his business background, it makes sense as a political tactic, but it reveals deep insecurity about his case for re-election and it alienates the business community unnecessarily. News: Reid puts GOP in a bind over Romney's taxes Support his policies or oppose them, no one is for one minute suggesting that Mitt Romney did anything other than obey the tax laws of the United States. Romney is not being attacked for breaking the law (except by a few semanticists, who seem to be naÃ¯vely, yet deliberately, suggesting it was not possible for him to be chairman on paper but to be taking a leave of absence from daily operating responsibilities). Opinion: Why won't Romney release more tax returns? A new energy mix can free us of dependency on dangerous nations, create jobs and a cleaner environment at home.
