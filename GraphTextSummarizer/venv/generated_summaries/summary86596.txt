Obama and Boehner spoke Monday night as the clock ticked down on government shutdown and, according to a Boehner spokesman, "the call lasted nearly 10 minutes." In 1995 and 1996, disagreement over federal spending levels between the Republican-controlled Congress -- led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- and then-President Bill Clinton led the government to partially shut down twice. " But the economic impact of an extended government shutdown will be more than just lost wages by federal workers. Now that a government shutdown has happened again -- this time after the Senate, run by Democrats, and the GOP-controlled House couldn't come to an agreement on funding the government by midnight on Tuesday -- it would be easy to compare the two shutdowns. Government services were cut, federal workers were furloughed and hostility toward politicians grew.
