-- Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will be granted safe passage to the Dominican Republic as a guest, resolving a diplomatic impasse that kept him trapped in Honduras, Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez said Wednesday. A previous effort for Zelaya's exit, a petition from Mexico last month, was rejected by the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti because it did not give Zelaya the status of having been granted political asylum. The agreement will allow Zelaya, his family, and members of his inner circle to leave for the Dominican Republic as guests, rather than under political asylum, a fine point that derailed previous efforts at negotiating his exit. Granting Zelaya safe conduct out of Honduras, where he is wanted on charges of abuse of power, is the first step toward re-engaging Honduras with the international community that repudiated the coup, Lobo said at a news conference Thursday. After spending months in exile, Zelaya sneaked back into Honduras in September, and has not left the Brazilian embassy.
