Based on Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's bestselling book, Killing Lincoln chronicles the final days of President Lincoln (Billy Campbell) and the plot by his assassin John Wilkes Booth (Jesse Johnson). In addition to Hanks, Killing Lincoln is produced by Ridley and Tony Scott (the latter having joined the production before his death last year) and is directed by Adrian Moat (Gettysburg). "Killing Lincoln" spends time portraying both men as it builds toward, as narrator Tom Hanks puts it, "the most resonant crime in the history of the nation," and then chronicles the extensive manhunt to bring Booth to justice. Below, some previously released quotes from Johnson and Campbell about their performances: "The prevailing image of Booth is one of a two-dimensional, mustache-twirling villain," Johnson says. Adds Campbell: "Lincoln is so adored, so universally revered today that it's easy to forget he was a controversial president â€” one with many enemies â€” in fact he repeatedly dreamt of his own assassination.
