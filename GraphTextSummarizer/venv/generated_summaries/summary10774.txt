The question is whether the voter turnout will be high enough to bolster the government that took power after the military ousted former Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsy from the presidency last year. Hundreds died in clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsy supporters in the weeks that followed his ouster. -- The legitimacy of Egypt's military-backed government is being put to the test as the country voted on a new constitution after years of political turmoil and deadly violence. The referendum is the first national vote since the ouster of the democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy. Violations reported by rights groups monitoring the vote ranged between campaigning for "yes" votes inside or near polling stations and preventing Christian voters from reaching polling stations in parts of Upper Egypt, which has a history of sectarian strife and is known for the strong presence of Islamist groups.
