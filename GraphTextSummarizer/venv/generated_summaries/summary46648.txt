"Ms. Lohan, you've actually done well and done it not only on time but early," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said during a five-minute-long hearing Wednesday. Lohan was found in violation of her probation last month when she admitted that she failed to comply with Sautner's earlier order that she work at a women's shelter. "From what I see of you, you need a structure," Sautner told Lohan last month, instructing her to return to court each month to show she is complying with the schedule. Lohan worked 12 days at the county morgue and took part in five psychotherapy sessions over the past month as ordered, Sautner said. "This is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant's hands," Sautner told Lohan.
