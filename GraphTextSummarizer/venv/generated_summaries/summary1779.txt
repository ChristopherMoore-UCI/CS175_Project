He suggested not only cutting the number of time zones in Russia, but also abolishing the current switch to daylight saving time, which the country has been doing since 1981. "The less fractional division of the country will enable us to resolve a number of transport and communications issues, will increase its manageability and strengthen the position of Russia as an important chain in the world's global infrastructure,"  Medvedev said at a special Kremlin meeting devoted to the issues of time change. Throughout this year, government officials and scientists will closely examine the consequences of the time reform in the five Russian regions, and a further reduction of time zones in Russia might take place in future if the experiment proves positive, according to Medvedev. As part of the reform, five Russian regions -- two in European Russia and three in Siberia -- did not join the rest of the country in moving the clock one hour forward to daylight saving time, thus coming a little closer to Moscow. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has proposed time zone reforms that would further cut the time difference between the region and Moscow, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported.
