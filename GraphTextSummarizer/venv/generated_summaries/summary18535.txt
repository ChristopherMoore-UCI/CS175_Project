Prince Charles is expected to be known as King George VII when he ascends to the throne; King George VI was actually christened Albert; and his brother, Edward VIII, who became  Duke of Windsor after his 1936 abdication, was known as David by family and friends. But Joseph said William and Kate were always unlikely to go for more "trendy" options on the lists of popular names. Princess Anne, William's aunt, has two granddaughters by son Peter and Canadian daughter-in-law Autumn Phillips: Savannah (born in 2010) and Isla (born in 2012). "Royals have quite a lot of names," said Williams. But the peculiar British royal tradition of switching between names may complicate matters.
