While Americans expend fewer calories at work, they spend more time in cars -- almost twice as much as in the 1970s. Thus says Martijn Katan of the Institute of Health Sciences at VU University in Amsterdam, author of one of the many studies on the limits of dieting, quoted in U.S. News & World Report. -- Monday is the second day of the year, which means millions of Americans have started new diets. "(It's a) basic instinct, even stronger than the sexual instinct, to store calories to survive the next period of starvation. But if we are to succeed, we should understand: The campaign against obesity will have to look a lot less like the campaign against smoking (which involves just one decision, to smoke or not to smoke) and much more like the generation-long campaign against highway fatalities, which required the redesign of cars, the redesign of highways, and changes in personal behavior like seat-belt use and drunk driving.
