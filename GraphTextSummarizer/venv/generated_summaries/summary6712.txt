Tressel resigned after being fined $250,000 and suspended for lying to NCAA officials investigating allegations that his players had received special benefits from local businesses. Tressel became aware of the transactions, which violate NCAA rules, but did not report them on a form that all coaches are required to submit. "Of great concern to the committee was the fact that the former head coach became aware of these violations and decided not to report the violations to institutional officials, the Big Ten Conference or the NCAA," the NCAA Division 1 Committee on Infractions said in its report. " Ohio State had previously said it was vacating all 12 of its victories from the 2010 football season and placing itself on two years' probation after a scandal that cost coach Jim Tressel his job. "We are surprised and disappointed with the NCAA's decision," Gene Smith, Ohio State's athletics director and associate vice president, said in a statement.
