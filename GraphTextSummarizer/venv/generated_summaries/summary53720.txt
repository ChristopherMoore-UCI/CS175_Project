James Eric Fuller, 63, was involuntarily committed after he made threats against a Tea Party member at the Tucson event sponsored by ABC News, Ogan said. Fuller photographed Trent Humphries and said "You are dead" when Humphries began speaking at the event, according to Ogan. -- A man who was shot but survived last Saturday's massacre in Tucson, Arizona, was taken to a county mental services unit Saturday after making a threatening comment at a town hall event, Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jason Ogan said. ABC News reported that the shooting victim became agitated and mumbled something that prompted him to be detained by police. Humphries has not pressed charges against Fuller and said Saturday that he doesn't want to do anything to heighten tensions after the shooting.
