To our memory, the last Oval Office address that dramatically moved the public opinion needle over military conflict came in late 1983 when President Ronald Reagan spoke to the country about a bloody attack on marine barracks in Lebanon and U.S. intervention in the tiny island of Grenada. The Washington Post count shows that as many as a third of House Democrats may vote no. (Someday, in their memoirs, will White House insiders please tell us what they were thinking?) Now he is placing almost all his chips on the table by betting on his capacity to turn around public opinion. Professor George Edwards of Texas A&M University and a dean among political scientists concluded in his 2006 book, "On Deaf Ears: The Limits of the Bully Pulpit," that we have a highly inflated view of how much presidents have been able to change public minds through their speeches.
