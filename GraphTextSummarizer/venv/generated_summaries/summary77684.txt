Flashlight Limbo Two people, holding flashlights, face each other and make a steady beam of light for others to limbo under. -- If Superstorm Sandy is making her way through your town, hopefully you're well stocked with bottled water, canned foods, and candles. The museum guide looks over each museum piece with the flashlight and describes the piece of "art" in funny ways, but without touching it. Everyone else should spread out and strike a pose, as if they're pieces of art. Hide and Seek in the Dark Hide a stuffed animal and set the kids out on a search for their toy with flashlights.
