There are differences: Twitter was wide in scope, while Square is focused on building a community of small businesses. But he is surprisingly engaging when he is talking to small business owners and Square customers. He wants small businesses to have the same shot at success that big businesses have. Dorsey wants to talk to business owners about Square, but also connect these local companies to support and mentor each other. Dorsey has a real passion for building communities, and that's the common thread between his current venture, Square, and Twitter.
