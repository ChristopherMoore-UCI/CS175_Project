In the final Premier League game of the day, the champions Manchester City took on lowly Queens Park Rangers in west London amid torrential rain. Chelsea coach Jose Mourninho has seen his side dominate this season's Premier League whilst playing at a canter. Chelsea came from a goal down to beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield and open up a commanding lead at the top of the English Premier League Saturday. Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero leveled the score, despite being both offside and handling the ball in the build up, before a late Martin Demichelis own goal appeared to have handed QPR an unlikely victory. The Saints have been the Premier League's surprise package this season, going on an incredible run winning 25 out of an available 33 points under new coach Ronald Koeman.
