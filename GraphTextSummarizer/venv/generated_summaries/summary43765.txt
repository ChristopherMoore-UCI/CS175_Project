Once again, help comes via nonprofit Ethical Traveler, which this week released its annual list of the countries that are doing the most to promote human rights, preserve their environments and support social welfare -- all while fostering a lively, community-based tourism industry. Choosing the top 10 Ethical Traveler's research focuses on four categories: environmental protection, social welfare, human rights and animal welfare. " The full report, in PDF form, can be found on the Ethical Traveler website. "For each of these categories we look at information past and present so that we understand not only the current state of a country, but how it has changed over time," says Ethical Traveler. Each "best ethical destination" offers opportunities to check out incredible natural beauty, enjoy great outdoor activities and have interactions with local people and cultures in a meaningful, mutually enriching way, says Ethical Traveler.
