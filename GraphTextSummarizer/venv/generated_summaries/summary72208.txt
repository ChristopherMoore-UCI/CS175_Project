When R&B singer Seal and Heidi Klum met in a New York City hotel lobby, the supermodel told CNN's Piers Morgan, "it was kind of like two magnets." When Morgan asked if the couple was planning on having more children, Klum answered, "No, we have four children, and we're complete now. " With the ninth-season finale of "Project Runway" coming up, Klum told Morgan she never imagined the series would last so long. " Klum, who also host's "Germany's Next Top Model" in her native country, told Morgan that she counts getting "Project Runway" on the air among her most cherished business successes. She also called designing her real passion and said she continues to design: There's a Heidi Klum for New Balance line of apparel and sneakers, Wildlife by Heidi Klum is sold on QVC, Heidi Klum on AOL, Shine by Heidi Klum, a fragrance with Coty, and more.
