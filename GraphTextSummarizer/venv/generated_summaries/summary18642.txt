-- A U.S. federal air marshal may have violated Indian law after failing to properly secure his law enforcement equipment when inside the country, U.S. officials said Friday. Delhi police did not confirm that a U.S. air marshal was part of the investigation, but P.N. Aggarwal, the joint commissioner of Delhi police, said that "quite a few rounds (of ammunition) and two magazines" were discovered inside an air-conditioning duct in a hotel room. "The equipment included two pistol magazines and ammunition, which is consistent with duty equipment issued to Federal Air Marshals for duty carry. "TSA is investigating this incident and working with Indian government officials to ensure that the facts of this incident are thoroughly reviewed," federal officials said in a statement issued from the TSA by the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. Although Indian officialswould not confirm whether an air marshal was a suspect in the case, U.S. officials were more forthright.
