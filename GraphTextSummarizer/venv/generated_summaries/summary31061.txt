Suspects named in the indictment are Nihad Rosic,  Armin Harcevic, and married couple Ramiz and Sedina Hodzic, all from St. Louis, along with Illinois residents Mediha  Salkicevic and Jasminka Ramic. A federal indictment alleges they communicated via social media and conspired to send money and military equipment to terrorists in Syria and Iraq. The Bosnian immigrants, including a husband and a wife, were arrested this month in Illinois and St. Louis, according to court records released Friday. They face various charges, including conspiracy to kill, and sending money and weapons to terrorists, the indictment shows. Federal prosecutors indicted the six suspects this month in St. Louis County.
