The result proved so popular that Disney offered occasional re-releases of the film, not to mention that the fairy tale has spawned a near sub-genre of Cinderella-inspired movies. Disney has released its first look at next year's live-action re-telling of "Cinderella," which stars Lily James, of "Downton Abbey," as the unfairly treated princess-to-be. Instead of picking up with Cinderella already slaving away, we get to meet her parents, as played by Hayley Atwell and Ben Chaplin, and we learn that the moniker "Cinderella" is a cruel twist on her name, Ella. This version keeps all the memorable moments of Cinderella's story intact -- she's still left at the mercy of a vindictive stepmother, and still has to bail from that royal ball by the stroke of midnight -- but it also fills in some of the gaps in our understanding of how Cinderella came to be. This time around, Cinderella meets her Prince Charming (Richard Madden) in the woods before encountering him again at his royal soiree.
