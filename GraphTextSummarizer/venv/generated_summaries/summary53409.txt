Rising star Mohamed Salah scored a hat-trick as Egypt beat Zimbabwe 4-2 in Harare Sunday to all but book their place in the final stage of African qualifying for the 2014 World Cup Finals. In Group C, Ivory Coast stretched their lead to four points with two rounds left with a 3-0 win in the Gambia as Lacina Traore, Wilfried Bony and reigning African Footballer of the Year Yaya Toure were on target. Salah scored his second and Egypt's third with a superb effort on 76 minutes before Knowledge Billiat gave the home side brief hope. With Congo-Brazzaville and Tunisia drawing in Gabon and Sierra Leone respectively Saturday, Egypt were left as the only one of the 40 second-stage teams to have a perfect record. Salah has been impressing for both club and country, helping Basel to the semifinals of the Europa League this season and grabbing 15 goals in his last 21 games for Egypt.
