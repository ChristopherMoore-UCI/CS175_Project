On Friday, Universal Studios is opening its "Wizarding World of Harry Potter" attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida. -- The day Harry Potter fans have been waiting for is here. I've brought all the books they came out, I dressed up for Harry Potter spirit day at my school. Harry Potter has beaten out fellow Brit celluloid character James Bond as the top-grossing film series in history. I love the Harry Potter series."
