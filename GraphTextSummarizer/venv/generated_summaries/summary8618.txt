Stressing the burials will be temporary, cities have begun the process of placing bodies in mass graves to prevent disease outbreak. Ikuo Fujiwara stops in front of the wreckage of the Buddhist temple, brings his hands together and prays. Fujiwara needs heaven to speak to him, for he must preside over Kamaishi's first mass burials in memory. "I feel very sad about this," says Fujiwara, adding that the mass graves are only one component of the overwhelming pain felt throughout Kamaishi. However, city health leaders say they have no choice but to bury the dead in mass graves.
