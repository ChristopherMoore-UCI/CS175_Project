According to Yukawa's friend Nobuo Kimoto, Goto passed along insights on how to survive in Syria and introduced him to rebel fighters, who are distinct from ISIS though both are fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. On Saturday, the latest ISIS video showed the masked man blaming Japan's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in Iraq and Syria for Goto's apparent beheading. So Goto crossed the border into Syria and headed toward the Islamist extremist group's de facto capital of Raqaa, despite the advice of friend, Alaaeddin Al Zaim, who'd been with him previously in that nation. Japan's government insisted it did everything within reason that it could to bring Goto home safely. Days later, a new message was posted by known ISIS supporters featuring the voice of someone claiming to be Goto.
