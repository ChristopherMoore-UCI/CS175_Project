Jonesboro police said they prepared Carter's hands to be examined, but the crime lab has a policy that it doesn't test suicide or homicide victims. The lead investigator interviewed Carter's girlfriend Wednesday, police said, and she told him that Carter called her from the police car, said he loved her, that he was frightened and had a gun. The officer was the same height and build as Carter, police said. Chavis Carter, 21, died July 28 while in the back of a Jonesboro Police Department car from a close-range gunshot. One of the witnesses, who is in jail, said he texted Carter and requested he bring the gun to a drug deal that July night.
