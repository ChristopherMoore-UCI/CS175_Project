At the close of the Chinese Communist Party's Third Plenum on November 13, China's official news agency, Xinhua, failed even to list the environment among its key points, focusing instead on the promise of economic reform. The scandal revealed the fact that some high-ranking Party leaders like Bo -- China's Gatsby -- have decadent lifestyles filled with sex, money laundering, and even murder. During the slowdown that China went through until the middle of this year, the leadership was more restrained than previously in rolling out stimulus measures, emphasizing that reform is more important than short-term stimulus. In spite of the arrival of new people at the top, the politics of reform in China's consensus-driven policymaking process has not changed. They were led by Xi Jinping, who took over from Hu Jintao as head of the Chinese Communist Party, which has ruled China for more than 60 years.
