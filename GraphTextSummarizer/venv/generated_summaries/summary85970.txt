No matter what decision the U.S. Supreme Court reaches on the legislation, he says, expect to see more ads on health care in the future. -- Political groups and campaigns hoping to sway voters on the health care issue have spent about $70 million on health-themed TV ads since January 2011, according to a CNN analysis of ad spending data. The provision that would matter most to people, he says, won't kick in until 2014 -- when 30 million people would be able to get health care without being denied insurance due to pre-existing conditions. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce bought the second highest number of spots, spending more than $8.3 million to run ads against the legislation more than 13,000 times. Drew Westen, an Emory University psychology professor who wrote "The Political Brain," said the ad debate is about much more than health care.
