Religion passively crosses borders and spreads to neighboring civilizations, but active missionary work can only occur in friendly cities and city-states. The new "Civilization V: Gods and Kings" expansion pack offers players two revamped elements to the iconic real-time strategy game -- faith and spies. Spies play a big role here and help players keep an eye on their rivals. You will also get additional bonuses to your civilization as a whole, and specific additions to city abilities. I only recruited one spy in normal game play in turn 187 and that happened spontaneously.
