"Mr. Fuller has not been hired, nor performed any duties, on the U.S. version of "The X Factor," the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday. The U.S. versions of "Idol" and "X-Factor" are both based on British shows. -- "American Idol" creator Simon Fuller filed a lawsuit Wednesday claiming he should be paid for the U.S. version of "The X Factor." "Mr. Fuller has prudently attempted to settle this matter privately but the other parties have refused to honor the original contract, leaving him no other choice but to pursue legal action," his publicist said in a statement Wednesday. Fuller claims a 2005 contract gives him executive producer credit and fees for the show, which was created by former "Idol" judge Simon Cowell.
