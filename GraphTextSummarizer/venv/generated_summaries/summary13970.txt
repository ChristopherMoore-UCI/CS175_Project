One day at the hospital, Zuch noticed there was a play area for young cancer patients where Morgan was able to play with another child. Nancy Zuch learned this firsthand after her daughter, Morgan, was diagnosed with cancer at age 2. Zuch was so concerned with Morgan's isolation and lack of social development that she hired a play therapist to teach Morgan some of the things that most kids take for granted, like playing, sharing and taking turns. "I thought, 'Well, this is OK because this child also has a minimal world of exposures, also cannot be around other children due to a suppressed immune system,' " Zuch said. The Morgan Center was created especially for children who are undergoing treatment for cancer and have a suppressed immune system.
