Most relevant to the burn pit concerns, Shinseki said the VA will "work with the DoD to obtain all relevant exposure data with the goal of establishing potential correlations with health problems among affected veterans." "Our scientists will also review data gathered from DoD's Post Deployment Health Assessment surveys, which ask about exposures to smoke from burn pits, subsequent symptoms, and a variety of other health related questions," Shinseki wrote. "VA will evaluate the feasibility of monitoring toxic substances in veterans, although most toxic materials from burn pits may be eliminated from the bodies of exposed veterans in a matter of days or weeks. The department recognizes that it needs to start now to investigate long-term affects for burn pit exposure as well as potential exposures that might lead to illness down the road. In the letter responding to the congressmen's inquiry on the subject, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said he shared "concerns that some veterans could have health problems from such exposures." Disabled American Veterans has started collecting information on veterans concerned with exposure.
