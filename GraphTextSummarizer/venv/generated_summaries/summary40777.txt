Family harmony Mayweather learnt his boxing skills from his father, a former fighter who was stopped by Sugar Ray Leonard in 10 rounds in 1978, until Floyd Sr. was given a five-and-a-half-year jail term for drug trafficking when his son was 16. Mayweather Sr. had last taken charge of Floyd's corner in 2000 prior to being booted out of his son's house, and life, shortly after. He has frequently recounted how he was shot in the leg by Tony Sinclair -- the later brother of Floyd Jr.'s mother -- in 1978 "I got shot early in my career with a 20 gauge shotgun," Floyd Sr. has said. " Floyd Sr. was holding his son during the shooting incident to ensure he was not hit in the face or upper body - a move that he believes saved his life. "I wasn't going to put that baby down," Floyd Sr. told the Los Angeles Times in 2012.
