-- A father and mother showed heroism when a gunman opened fired inside their California home before dawn Saturday, but two members of the family couldn't overcome their wounds, Inglewood police said. The incident occurred about 4 a.m. Saturday when police received a report of 10 gunshots at the property. "What would motivate an individual to do this is inexplicable," Inglewood Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said. The mother ran from the house carrying her youngest child, though she was shot in both legs, in an "extraordinary rescue attempt," police said. Both were in critical but stable condition, police said.
