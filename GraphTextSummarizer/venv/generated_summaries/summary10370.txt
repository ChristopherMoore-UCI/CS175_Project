Plastic Jesus -- the artist prefers not to go by his real name -- showcased a life-size Oscar-inspired statue snorting what is intended to look like cocaine on Hollywood Boulevard, just blocks from where the Academy Awards will take place Sunday. "We only hear about (drug abuse) when high-profile people in Hollywood have a meltdown, check into rehab, or die," Plastic Jesus tells CNN. It was said to be inspired by Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had died in New York weeks prior from acute mixed drug intoxication (both heroin and cocaine were contributing factors in his death). "The Oscars is a very glitzy, high-profile event, so I wanted to bring attention to cocaine use in Hollywood," the artist told CNN. Last year, Plastic Jesus came up with a similar stunt to address "the covering up of drug use in Hollywood."
