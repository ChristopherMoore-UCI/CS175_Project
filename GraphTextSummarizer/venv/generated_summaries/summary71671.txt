Snapchat will add new privacy features after a hack last week that exposed millions of phone numbers and user names from the popular photo- and video-sharing app. On Tuesday, hackers posted user names and phone numbers, with the final two numbers redacted, to a website called SnapchatDB.info. The site had been suspended by its Web host but, by Friday, appeared to be back online with phone numbers and user names both partially disguised. The company said in a blog post it will be updating the app to allow users to opt out of a "Find Friends" feature that uses their mobile phone number. Security matters as much as user experience does."
