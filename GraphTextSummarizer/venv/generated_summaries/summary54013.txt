Embryonic stem cells were the essential key to discovering how to reprogram adult skin cells, and the ultimate therapeutic success of these new reprogrammed cells absolutely will require additional embryonic stem cell research. Single studies could now evaluate more embryonic stem cells and use different types of stem cells -- not only embryonic, but the newer induced pluripotent stem, or iPS, cells. The position of embryonic stem cell and reprogrammed stem cell research now is similar to where we were in the mid-1970s with bone marrow transplantation. In issuing an injunction against President Obama's order, Judge Lamberth cited the potential harm to federal funding of adult stem cell research from the federal support of embryonic stem cell research. I cannot think that any scientist or patient would view blood stem cell research as "in competition" with embryonic stem cell research.
