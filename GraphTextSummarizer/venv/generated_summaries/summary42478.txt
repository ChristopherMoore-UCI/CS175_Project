Partying If it's a New Year burnout you're after, they don't come any bigger than Giant Maximus, which claims to be the biggest end of year party in the world aimed at over-21s (the age limit for drinking alcohol in the U.S., obviously). It may not seem the obvious way to celebrate America's emancipation from British colonial rule, but the annual Independence Day competition on Venice Beach is definitely a spectacle, and a unique slice of Americana to boot. Don't miss the Mr and Mrs Muscle Beach competition on Venice Beach The only jazz festival in Southern California, the Long Beach event is beautifully located on a grassy knoll overlooking a long sweep of lagoon. Now in its 75th year, the event features bikini-clad women contestants as well as a plethora of Arnie Schwarzenegger wannabes all hoping to be crowned the golden couple of muscle.
