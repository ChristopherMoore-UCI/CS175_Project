That includes the Monument Fire in southern Arizona, which U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell has deemed the nation's No. 1 priority. -- Nearly two weeks after the biggest wildfire in Arizona history swept through their community and obliterated dozens of homes, barns, sheds and one truck, residents of the tiny town of Greer are back in their homes. The lifting of the evacuation order comes as firefighters increasingly gain the upper hand on the blaze, which has torched more than a half-million acres in eastern Arizona. The agency website reports 3.1 million acres in the United States had been ignited by wildfires as of May 31, compared with 3.2 million burned acres cited in the organization's year-end report in November 2010. Meanwhile, weather conditions are expected to improve with calmer winds and higher humidity levels Tuesday, making it easier for crews to battle other active wildfires burning across the state.
