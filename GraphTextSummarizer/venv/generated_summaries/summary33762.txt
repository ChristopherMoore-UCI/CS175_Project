Inter last won the scudetto in 2010 and failed to qualify for this season's UEFA Champions League, though the team is in the second-tier Europa League If Thohir comes armed with ideas to overhaul Inter, he also issues a blunt warning for Serie A, which in recent years has arguably become European football's ugly duckling. Comparing Serie A with the English Premier League is like chalk and cheese, admits Inter's chief executive officer Michael Bolingbroke, who previously worked for Manchester United and entertainment company Cirque de Soleil before he was appointed by Thohir in July. " With the NBA now playing games in Asia, the NFL coming to Europe and baseball matches taking place in Australia, Thohir is also open to the idea of Serie A matches being played outside of Italy. "The English Premier League has become bigger and bigger, but Serie A can become the second league in the world," said Thohir. "Serie A has be to more aggressive," the 44-year-old Thohir told CNN in an exclusive interview, as he laid out his vision to revive his underachieving club.
