"We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them," said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary. "We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved," Blais said. Â» "Typically, when elephants are in captivity, they're under a lot of stress," Blais said. It's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity. In their 14-year history, Blais and Buckley say, they've been able to raise enough funds to keep expanding the sanctuary and its facilities.
