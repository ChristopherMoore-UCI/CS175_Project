"Information is the new currency and that currency is gushing through the streets of San Francisco," said Alan Collenette, regional managing director of real estate firm Colliers International. "Now in 2015, 60% of all leases done in San Francisco are for technology companies," Collenette said. Last year, commercial real estate in San Francisco was snapped up in large parcels. According to Collenette, firms like Twitter are relocating to the City by the Bay because it offers a more attractive lifestyle to talented employees. Where there's a lot of interesting cultural stuff to do," Collenette said.
