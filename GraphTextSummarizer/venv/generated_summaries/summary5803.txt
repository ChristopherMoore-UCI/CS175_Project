CNN: What do you think we've learned about airport security from the failed bombing in Detroit? Isaac Yeffet, the former head of security for El Al and now an aviation security consultant in New York, said El Al has prevented terrorism in the air by making sure every passenger is interviewed by a well-trained agent before check-in. Yeffet: For sure El Al spends more money on security than the American air carriers. But some airline security experts say the real answer to greater security is to follow the approach used by Israel's airline, El Al. In the wake of the failed Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Flight 253, authorities are ramping up air passenger screening, particularly for those flying from 14 nations that the U.S. describes as "state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest."
