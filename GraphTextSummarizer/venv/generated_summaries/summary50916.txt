Safety groups have criticized car companies and technology makers for putting touch-screen devices that surf the Internet in cars. The company has not formally announced technology to let drivers post tweets verbally from behind the wheel, but such an announcement likely will come in the next 12 to 18 months, Doug VanDagens, Ford's global director of connected services, told CNN in an interview after the company's keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show here. A company representative would not comment on whether the technology will increase the price of Ford cars. -- The debate over distracted drivers ramped up a notch on Thursday as Ford Motor Co. announced technology to let computers read their Twitter feeds to them while behind the wheel. Ford's system, which will be installed in some cars later this year, does not let drivers surf the Internet visually while driving.
