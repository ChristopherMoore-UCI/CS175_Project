-- The YouTube and Carnegie Hall generations collided Wednesday night in New York City as a nearly sold-out audience looked on in amazement. The YouTube Symphony Orchestra bore a new era of classical performance at Carnegie Hall, and according to a YouTube employee, that's exactly what they wanted to do. The symphony orchestra played to a Carnegie Hall audience that was almost 90 percent of capacity. The symphony orchestra's members participated in the three-day Classical Music Summit at Julliard and their Carnegie Hall debut served as the finale. "Carnegie Hall is still sort of the unofficial pinnacle of achievement of the classical music world," he said.
