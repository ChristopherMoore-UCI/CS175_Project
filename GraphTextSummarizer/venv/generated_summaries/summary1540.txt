Cristiano Ronaldo's attempts to get Madrid back in level terms were thwarted by Andres Palop in Sevilla's goal before the break and Jose Mourinho's double substitution at halftime -- new signing Luka Modric and Karim Benzema replacing Angel Di Maria and Mesut Ozil -- made little impact. The first came from the penalty spot in the 74th minute -- after Pedro had been brought down by defender Juan Valera -- before he side-footed a second goal four minutes later. In Saturday's other fixtures, Malaga are up to second after beating Levante 3-1 while Valencia recorded their first win of the season with a 2-1 win against Celta Vigo. German international Piotr Trochowski scored the only goal of the game in the second minute to lift Sevilla to third in the table with eight points and leave Madrid languishing in 10th with four -- their worst start to a season since 2001-02. -- Real Madrid's dismal start to the La Liga season continued on Saturday as the reigning champions slumped to a 1-0 against Sevilla at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan.
