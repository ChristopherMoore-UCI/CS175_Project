The '80s band (whose members aren't entirely sold on that description) recently powered through a set at Sirus XM Radio's New York headquarters as part of the company's "Artist Confidential" series. But ultimately, you don't identify yourselves as an '80s band, do you? Is it easier or more enjoyable than it was in the '80s? CNN: Why do you think people are still so fascinated with the '80s? Because during the '80s, we were sort of horrified by the '80s!
