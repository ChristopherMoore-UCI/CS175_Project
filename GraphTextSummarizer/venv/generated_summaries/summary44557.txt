Many schools have honor codes, with students mandated to live and learn by certain standards. The BYU code include requirements for "modest, neat and clean" dress and grooming; abstinence from alcohol, tobacco or illegal substances; any physical intimacy that exhibits homosexual feelings; prohibiting members of the opposite sex from going in one's bedroom areas; and regularly participation in church services, be they in the Mormon or another religious faith. But Holmoe said that he hopes Davies, who remains a student at BYU, returns to the court next season. Officials did not specify why, exactly, Davies was being suspended during a press conference Thursday. But the Salt Lake Tribune, citing "multiple sources," said that the sophomore violated the honor code provision prohibiting premarital sex among students.
