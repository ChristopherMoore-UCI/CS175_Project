Having not played a singles match since his shock defeat to Lukas Rosol in the second round of Wimbledon last year due to a left knee injury, a little rustiness was perhaps to be expected. -- Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal was back in singles action for the first time in seven months Wednesday, making a winning return on the clay courts he has dominated so emphatically in recent years. Nadal partnered up with Argentina's Juan Monaco to beat the Czech pairing of Frantisek Cermak and Lukas Dlouhy. The defending champion and second seed was shocked 7-6 6-4 by the 93rd ranked Guillaume Rufin of France, who recorded just his second career win over a top 20 player. The Mallorca native has ruled the Roland Garros event in recent years, winning seven of the last eight events.
