CNN revamped its schedule launching 10 new European prime time programs; opened its fourth international production center in Abu Dhabi; brought in-house the production of its award-winning documentary strand "World's Untold Stories"; relaunched its international and domestic Web sites and introduced new graphics, music, studios, and a tagline: "Go Beyond Borders." CNN has continued to invest beyond breaking news in intelligent and compelling newsgathering, sports, feature and documentary programming across all digital platforms, putting audience connectivity at the heart of its output through initiatives such as iReport. CNN International Executive Vice President and Managing Director Tony Maddox said: "This award comes as CNN marks 30 years of journalistic enterprise. -- CNN has been awarded one of the highest honors in international journalism -- a Golden Nymph -- for its coverage of the earthquake in Haiti in the 24-hour news program category. Once on the scene, CNN quickly established itself as a vital missing link -- helping worried relatives reach their loved ones in Haiti, while helping Haitians communicate word of their survival, their needs, and their despair.
