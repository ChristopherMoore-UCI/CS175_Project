"It is simply not age appropriate to have a program in place for such young children, not to mention not having parents of such young children involved," Patrick said in a statement. It allows nurses to give condoms to students they think are sexually active after counseling and education without informing their parents. -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick urged a school district to revise its policy allowing students as young as in elementary schools to get condoms if they are believed to be sexually active. "This policy is stripping children of their innocence and making them more vulnerable to sexual predators," said Sherri Smitt, whose daughter graduated from Provincetown High School. The superintendent urged parents to discuss sex issues with their children, including letting them know that abstinence is the only safeguard.
