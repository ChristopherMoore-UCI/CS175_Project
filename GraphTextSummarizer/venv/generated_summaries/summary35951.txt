The hotel regularly inspects their water supply with a series of tests; the health district only gets involved when there are cases of illness or elevated levels of bacteria reported, said Sizemore. The health district said the bacteria is found most usually in water, such as hot and cold water taps, hot water tanks and water from air-conditioning systems. Water tests at that time indicated high levels of the bacteria in several guest rooms. Guests before the reported window of June 21 to July 4 are past the incubation period of the bacteria, so any symptoms they would've shown are past, said Sizemore. "We're working to replace fear and anxiety with facts and information," said Gordon Absher, vice president of public affairs for MGM Resorts International, which runs the Aria resort.
