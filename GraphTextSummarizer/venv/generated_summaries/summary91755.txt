One federal prosecutor agreed, saying in an appellate court argument that "there is a possibility that Mrs. Demiraj will be persecuted" if she returns to Albania. The only official comment to CNN from Justice is this: "The department is not aware of any promises of physical protection ever made to Mr. Demiraj or his family. Edmond Demiraj says he will never let his wife and son return to Albania. Within a few weeks back in his native Albania, Demiraj says, Bedini attacked him and tried to kill him. Still, she added, "She (Mrs. Demiraj) hasn't met her legal burden when it comes to asylum."
