A 71-year-old man died Wednesday night in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, as he was bailing water out of the basement of his home and the walls of the structure caved in, said Chief Patrick O'Rourke of Derry Township Police. Plymouth Township resident Francis Federici was forced to leave his home, which sat in 5-foot floodwaters. High water blocked dozens of roads in Baltimore County, according to CNN affiliate WMAR-TV. In Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, CNN iReporter Nick Bohacz said flooded roads prevented him from getting to work. A motorist became stranded in high water and was outside the vehicle when struck by another vehicle, which then left the scene.
