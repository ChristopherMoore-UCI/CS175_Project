"This move comes as a result of more people carrying more items through the checkpoint to avoid airline bag fees," said Bradley D. Penrod, executive director and CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority. She said she believes Pittsburgh International is the first U.S. airport to try this particular concept, though other airports have versions of express lanes, including one dedicated for expert travelers, frequent fliers and so on. Traveler reaction so far has been positive, said JoAnn Jenny, a spokeswoman for the Allegheny County Airport Authority. "The program at Pittsburgh International Airport is one example of TSA partnering with airports to improve the passenger experience while providing world-class security." Passengers traveling with one carry-on item now have the option of going through an express security lane at Pittsburgh International Airport.
