According to the Pakistani military, Indian troops crossed the Line of Control -- the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region -- and attacked a military post. "Pakistan Army troops effectively responded and repulsed the attack successfully," but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, the military said. A third conflict between India and Pakistan erupted in 1999 after Pakistani-backed forces infiltrated Indian-controlled Kashmir in the Kargil area. The Indian Defense Ministry, however, said Pakistani troops opened fire unprovoked on Indian posts in the north Uri sector of Indian-administered Kashmir. The territory under dispute lies in India's Kashmir Valley, separated from Pakistan by the 450-mile Line of Control.
