Ismail Amat, an ethnic Uyghur who headed China's Xinjiang regional government, was quoted by the Xinhua news agency as calling Kadeer "scum." A Uyghur student cries as Turks pray on Friday in Ankara, Turkey, for people who died in protests in Urumqi, China. Turkey's prime minister continued his outspoken criticism of China's crackdown on ethnic Uyghurs on Saturday. Uyghur religious leaders have condemned the violence, saying it is against the spirit of the Muslim faith and Uyghur tradition. However, Kadeer was "not entitled to represent the Uyghur people," a former Xinjiang official said, according to China's state-run media.
