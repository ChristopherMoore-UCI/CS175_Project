Local favorite Andy Murray was a man under pressure but it seldom showed as he kept his ATP World Tour Finals bid alive on Tuesday. " Murray may well find that he doesn't receive all the support at the O2 Arena given the sizable Swiss contingent that greeted their favorite's 6-3 6-2 victory over Nishikori earlier on Tuesday. Federer tops the group with a 100% record, while both Murray and Nishikori have won one and lost one. Nishikori, who lacked the poise he showed when beating Murray on Sunday, showered praise on the evergreen Federer afterwards. After losing his opening match to Japan's Kei Nishikori on Sunday, Murray raised his game as he won 6-3 7-5 while Raonic, who suffered his second straight defeat, hit 33 unforced errors.
