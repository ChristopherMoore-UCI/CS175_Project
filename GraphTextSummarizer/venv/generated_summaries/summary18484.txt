-- La Liga leaders Barcelona needed a late goal from David Villa on Saturday to rescue a 1-1 draw away at Sporting Gijon. The Spanish World Cup winner saw Sporting goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar off his line and executed a delicate chip from 20 yards out which sailed into the goal. Barcelona trailed until the 80th minute, when Argentina's Lionel Messi released striker Villa. The reigning Spanish champions fell behind on 15 minutes thanks to a superb solo-strike from Sporting's David Barral. Veteran Dutch midfield Clarence Seedorf opened the scoring after eight minutes, and the Rossoneri were firmly in control when January-signing Antonio Cassano doubled their lead nine minutes later.
