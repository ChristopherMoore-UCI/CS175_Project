Today, Ryan's group assists more than 3,600 families per year, offering all sorts of free services to help them pull themselves out of poverty and end a cycle that can repeat itself from generation to generation. Since 1989, the nonprofit has provided prenatal care to thousands of homeless women in San Francisco. "I said, 'How could that be?' " recalled Ryan, who was volunteering at a San Francisco shelter at the time while pursuing her master's degree in public health. Ryan said her costs average less than $5,000 per family per year. The city of San Francisco, on the other hand, reports spending an average of $6,647 a year on medical care alone for every person who is consistently homeless.
