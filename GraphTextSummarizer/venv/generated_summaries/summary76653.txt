Despite scandal, Penn State draws $208.7 million in donations The internal review is separate from criminal investigations that have resulted in Sandusky's conviction, and charges of perjury and failing to report abuse against former athletic director Tim Curley and former Penn State vice president Gary Schultz. Paterno and former Penn State President Graham Spanier were fired after the Sandusky scandal broke in November. -- Former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno wrote a letter before his death saying the sex abuse scandal involving his assistant coach was "not a football scandal." Former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted last month for sexually abusing young boys over a 15-year period. Anticipation builds ahead of Sandusky report Family spokeswoman Mara Vandlik said the letter was intended to be published as a guest editorial, but that never happened, and it was probably released by one of the former players who had received a copy.
