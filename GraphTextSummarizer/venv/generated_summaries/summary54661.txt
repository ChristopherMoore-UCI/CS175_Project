During the foreign aid review, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton argued for more control over development policy and control over the U.S. Agency for International Development, arguing that diplomacy and development go hand-in-hand. While USAID will continue to be the premier agency for delivering development aid, the official said, the new strategy offers a "whole-of-government approach," integrating development aid currently handled by about two dozen federal agencies and departments. -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced the creation of a comprehensive administration initiative devoted to spurring development efforts around the globe. Countries selected for U.S. development attention also will get assistance with technical innovation and trade. The policy was unveiled after a year-long review ordered by Obama in an effort to examine how U.S. aid dollars can be more effectively targeted after the world recession, a senior administration official said.
