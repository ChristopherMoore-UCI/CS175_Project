Israeli officials Sunday called on the Palestinian Authority to calm the territories, where there have been large protests in recent days over the conditions of Palestinian prisoners. Arafat Jaradat died Saturday, inciting Palestinian officials to once again decry conditions in Israeli prisons. Palestinians in Israeli prisons -- about 4,500 people -- took part in a hunger strike Sunday, and crowds protested in the streets of the West Bank as Palestinian officials called for an international investigation into an inmate's death. Israeli officials have said that prisoners include members of extremist groups who have "blood on their hands." Palestinian officials told CNN that Jaradat is the 203rd Palestinian to die in Israeli prisons since 1967.
