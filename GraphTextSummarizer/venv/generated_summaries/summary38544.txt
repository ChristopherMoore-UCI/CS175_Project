The study found that 22% of dog owners and 15% of cat owners characterized their pets as normal weight when the animals were actually overweight or obese. The Association for Pet Obesity Prevention report shows not only that more pets are overweight, but also that those with the problem "are getting fatter,"  said Ernie Ward, the group's founder. "In simplest terms, we've made fat pets the new normal," said Ward. When I see dogs who are overweight, I see a child that's at risk for excess weight, because nobody's exercising. The majority of adult dogs and cats in U.S. homes are overweight or obese, and the problem has gotten worse over the past year, according to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention.
