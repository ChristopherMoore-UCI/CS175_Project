Asked by a defense attorney whether he had ordered a blood test for Holmes, Appel said he had not. On July 7, Holmes used an online ticketing service to buy a ticket for the midnight showing of the movie, according to Detective Craig Appel, the lead investigator in the case. Before wrapping up, prosecutors asked Fyles to display other photos taken from Holmes' phone, including shots of improvised explosives under construction in his kitchen on July 16 and disturbing images of the suspect, his red hair curling out from beneath the black watch cap prosecutors say he wore to the theater. At least some of the preparations were well under way by July 16, based on a photograph from Holmes' phone shown by prosecutors. The photographs were recovered from Holmes' cell phone and go along with months of sales records and descriptions of meticulously prepared booby traps at his home.
