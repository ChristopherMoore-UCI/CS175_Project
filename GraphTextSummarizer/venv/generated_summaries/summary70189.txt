"It is our objective to have the safe release of the persons that are in the apartment with him, and then to have the safe surrender of Mr. Hood," Keenan told reporters earlier. When Howard stopped that SUV near Sycamore Drive and Atlanta Highway, the man believed to be Hood got out and began shooting, police said. Hood is wanted in connection to Tuesday's slaying of Senior Police Officer Elmer "Buddy" Christian, 34, and the wounding of Senior Police Officer Tony Howard, 43. The barricaded suspect in the slaying of an Athens, Georgia, police officer released four of eight hostages Friday night, said Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. According to police, Hood is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs about 175 pounds.
