Those attacks include: phishing, or e-mails designed to look legitimate but which take respondents to fraudulent sites; adware, or ads that appear through pop-ups or banners on Web pages; and spyware, which secretly monitors computer users. If the exploitation and corruption of political information on the Internet grows as Friedrichs predicts, he said he fears the public could become wary of Internet fundraising and even become suspicious of political information available on the Web. These domain names have been used to establish Web sites on which to sell advertising or make political points. "Web sites are being attacked on a daily basis by individuals, non-state actors, organized criminals and state actors," he said. "Web sites are seen now as the perfect storm because you can attack the users that use them to access the information and visitors who use those sites, who trust those sites."
