Instead, Arjen Robben, the man who had tormented Mexico for large periods of the second half, was brought down inside the penalty area by Rafael Marquez. "He dived three times, he should have cautioned him the first time," Miguel Herrera, the Mexico coach, told reporters of Robben after the game. As those in green danced with joy and celebrated the apparent end of Mexico's World Cup curse, those in orange were already planning their flights home. While the Mexican players protested following Robben's spectacular fall, their anger fell on deaf ears. Mexico, which defeated Cameroon and Croatia either side of a draw with Brazil, started positively and felt it should have been given a penalty when Ron Vlaar fouled Hector Herrera.
