At least 75 people have been killed in clashes in the Somali capital of Mogadishu since fighting broke out earlier this week between government forces and Al-Shabaab rebels, medical sources and a witness said Saturday. Another five died of their wounds while hospitalized, according to Duniyo Ali Mohamed, medical director of Mogadishu's Medina Hospital. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country. Mohamed said at least 170 people, including 21 children, were admitted to the hospital with injuries from the fighting between government forces and the rebels. A spokesman with the Mogadishu ambulance service told CNN that the service has picked up 148 wounded people since Wednesday, when the fighting began.
