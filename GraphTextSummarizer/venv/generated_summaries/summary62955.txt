While Republicans statistically care less about climate change than Democrats -- and are more likely to be skeptical of climate science -- some do advocate for climate action. We need a new way of talking about climate change -- one that includes all voices while acknowledging the fact that 97% of climate scientists say the climate is warming and it's because of us. Focus on community, not science Lots of placards I saw in New York focused on the science of climate change -- how the nation should listen to its science teachers, etc. The crowd was chanting for world leaders to act on climate change, carrying signs that read "No Planet B" and "To Change Everything, We Need Everyone," and generally causing a ruckus. It's tempting for those of us who want to see urgent action on climate change to write off everyone who doesn't see it that way.
