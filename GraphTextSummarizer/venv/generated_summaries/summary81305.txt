But the band -- who were created by world-ranked 44 Crane -- will not be disappointed if they fail to top the billboard charts because the quartet of PGA Tour players are singing and dancing for charity. In fact, three-times PGA Tour winner Crane, who was the driving force behind Golf Boys, has built a cult social media following over the last 12 months after uploading a host of comedy clips of himself. While Crane's collective are clearly the first PGA Tour boy band, Golf Boys aren't the first professional golfers to try their hands at music. Awkward dance moves, dubious costumes and with voices as thin as a sheet of paper; the foursome of Ben Crane, Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan are hardly The Beatles. The video opens with the foursome in staged boy band pose, before the camera pans in on each of their faces in slow motion.
