Mambu, now 28 and a goalkeeper for Sierra Leone's amputee football (soccer) team, was one of thousands of victims who felt huge relief Thursday after an international tribunal convicted former Liberian President Charles Taylor on 11 counts of aiding and abetting the rebels to carry out war crimes. President Taylor never ... went to fight in Sierra Leone. "We expect that our war crimes court, the court of Liberia, will come here, too, to try people from Sierra Leone." In the diamond-mining region of Kono, where much of the atrocities took place, almost everyone has a story to tell about the rebels, who the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded were supported militarily by Taylor. In Sierra Leone, said aid worker Jennifer Harold, there are bullet holes in all the buildings.
