"While we're busy working on software for the Wii U, we have production lines that are working on ideas for what the next system might be." 'Mario,' 'Zelda' creator says give the Wii U time One of the most iconic names in video gaming, Nintendo dominated the market with its Wii console, which sold more than 100 million units after its release in 2006. The company lost more than $15 million in the final nine months of 2013, largely due to disappointing sales numbers for the Wii U. A sales forecast of 9 million Wii U units in 2013, the console's first full year, was slashed to a mere 2.8 million. "For the time being, our focus is on the Wii U hardware, but Nintendo as a whole has groups working on ideas for new hardware systems," he said, via a translator, in an interview with The Associated Press. Things got so bad that there was speculation Nintendo would abandon hardware entirely, instead focusing on developing popular franchises such as Mario and Zelda for other consoles. This year has seen a slight uptick in sales, with the release of popular titles such as "Mario Kart 8" and "Bayonetta 2."
