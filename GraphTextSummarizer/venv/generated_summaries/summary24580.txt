Seven years after the attacks of September 11, just 30 percent of Americans said they think an attack on American soil is likely over the next several weeks, down 11 points since this time last year and down 30 points since the first anniversary of September 11. "The good news for John McCain is that most Americans think he would be better at handling terrorism than [Barack] Obama," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Two-thirds want the next president to remove most U.S. troops from Iraq within a few months of taking office, numbers that appear to put Republican presidential candidate John McCain on the opposite side of most voters on that issue. -- Concerns about an impending terrorist strike are at the lowest point on record since the attacks of September 11, 2001, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. And Americans do appear to be more confident that Osama bin Laden will eventually be captured or killed: Just about half say the U.S. will ultimately find the September 11 mastermind, up 7 points from this time last year.
