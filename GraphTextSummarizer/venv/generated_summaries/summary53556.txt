-- An inquest jury considering the death of Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police sparked widespread riots in England two years ago, said Wednesday he was lawfully killed. The 29-year-old father of four was shot by police officers who stopped the taxi in which he was traveling in the northern London neighborhood of Tottenham in August 2011. His death sparked protests that exploded into riots and looting in London and spread to other cities in the worst disturbances in the country in decades. "No officer sets out at the start of the day to run an operation that results in someone dying," Assistant Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said outside the court. The jury at the Royal Courts of Justice in London concluded that the killing was lawful in an 8-to-2 decision, even though Duggan did not have a gun in his hand at the moment he was shot.
