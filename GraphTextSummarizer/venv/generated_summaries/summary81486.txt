-- A man was accused Tuesday in a UK court of planning either an indiscriminate "Mumbai-style" attack or an attack against a prominent person -- possibly former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Incedal is accused of possessing documents that refer to bomb making which, according to the prosecution, were found on an SD card hidden between an iPhone and its protective case. His iPhone had been used to carry out Internet searches for "ISIS" and "Sham," the court heard, the latter being a reference to Syria. Police also found a piece of paper tucked inside a glasses case with an address tied to Blair, the prosecution said. Incedal and Bouhadjar communicated via email and Skype using code words and aliases to refer to the words "Kalashnikov" and "Mumbai style," the prosecution said.
