Dion's Las Vegas residency shows and plans to tour Asia in the fall have been taken off her schedule, according to a statement posted on her website and social media accounts. Dion is suffering from "an illness that has caused inflammation in her throat muscles, and has not been able to perform any of her scheduled shows in Las Vegas since her last show on July 29th," the statement said. Dion's shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace have been one of the hottest tickets in Las Vegas since she returned to the Strip three years ago. The couple, along with their three sons, live in Las Vegas, where Dion has been performing for three years. Her residency, which has included about 70 shows a year, is on hold "until further notice," the statement said.
