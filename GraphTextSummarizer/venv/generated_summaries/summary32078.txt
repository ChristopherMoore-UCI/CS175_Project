Henri de Castries told CNN "a Greek exit won't solve everything," adding the problems in Europe are "more complex than that." De Castries, a fan of Greek mythology, believes a Greek exit would be akin to opening a Pandora's box. De Castries said the company's investment portfolio is being kept diverse: "We have approximately 80% of our assets in bonds, of which half or a little less are in sovereign bonds. The other half is in corporate bonds and 20% are in other asset classes such as equities and real estate," he added. " AXA, the second-biggest insurer in Europe, has been offloading its investments in Greek debt -- at a 78% write-down -- and no longer buys Italian and Spanish debt, as it seeks to distance itself from the deepening crisis. De Castries points to the Spanish banking crisis as one which must be resolved so Europe can allay concerns about the strength of its firewalls.
