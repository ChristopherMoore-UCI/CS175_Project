Next weekend should be exciting in the box office race: We're the Millers and Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters both open on Wednesday, while Elysuim and Planes hit theaters on Friday. The lauded high school-set, coming-of-age drama starring Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley has garnered significant buzz since opening at the Sundance Film Festival in February and could be another gigantic hit for new film distributor A24 (Spring Breakers, The Bling Ring). After five weeks in theaters, the animated juggernaut is the second-highest-performing movie of the year, behind only Iron Man 3. -- It's bizarre to think that 2 Guns and The Smurfs 2 are competitors in any regard, but the pics happened to open in theaters on the same weekend. Unlike most of the movies on the slate, The Conjuring actually added theaters to its count, helping to account for a modest 38.5 percent drop from the previous weekend.
