His trip -- just months from the end of Perry's 12-year tenure in the governor's office -- drew criticism from Texas Democrats who called his absence while Dallas health care workers are treated for Ebola poor leadership. -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry is cutting short an economic development trip through Europe to return home as officials in his state work to stop the spread of Ebola. He also said he speaks daily with Dr. Brett Giroir, who heads an infectious disease task force that Perry formed earlier this month, and Dr. David Lakey, the commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. His decision to cut short an economic development-focused trip through England, Germany, Poland and Ukraine comes after President Barack Obama called off plans for a fundraising trip to New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday when a second Dallas health care worker was diagnosed with Ebola. He'd originally been scheduled to return Sunday, but Perry spokesman Felix Browne told CNN the three-term Republican governor will now fly back on Thursday.
