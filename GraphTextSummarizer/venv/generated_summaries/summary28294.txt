Based on the intelligence agency's analysis, Jang's aides in certain government agencies involved in business projects, including coal and trade, overstepped their authority, creating conflicts with other agencies, the lawmaker said. North Korea state media made some references to business wrongdoing by Jang in their expansive recounting of his alleged crimes. But agents at South Korea's National Intelligence Service, which broke news of Jang's initial fall from power before North Korea announced it, are nonetheless trying to get to the bottom of the situation. Some suggested there may have been a struggle for power between Kim and Jang. The agency believes Kim may have stepped and demanded that the disputes be resolved -- an order Jang apparently declined to carry out, Jeong said.
