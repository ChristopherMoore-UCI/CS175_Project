Both used legal-looking documents with bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of the Orlando-area state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry, plus the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. -- Two convicted murderers who allegedly used forged documents to walk out of prison were booked Tuesday in Orange County, Florida -- the place where both men hail from and where the murders they are responsible for took place. By 2:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, they were back in the Orange County jail, according to county corrections spokesman Allen Moore. On Tuesday, Bailey's agency announced that a reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the forgeries or inmates' escapes. After days on the lam, Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins were recaptured on Saturday night at Panama City's Coconut Grove Motor Inn, some 360 miles northwest of the Orlando area.
