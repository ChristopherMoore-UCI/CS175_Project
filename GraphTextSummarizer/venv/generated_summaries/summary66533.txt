"There are issues that come up when you're prosecuting cases against police officers, because police officers by the very nature of their jobs can use deadly force," Hostin said. Police officers have the same rights civilians have to self defense, Cevallos said, and they also have the right to make arrests. "To do that," he said, "they can use deadly force to prevent an escape." After a fatal shooting, a range of charges are typically on the table, said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos, a criminal defense attorney. "They think, even if he made a mistake, he's got the hardest job in the world, so they often want to cut police officers some slack." Authorities also weigh different factors when deciding to prosecute police. If Brown was trying to get away from the officer, Cevallos said, the Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Garner allows the use of deadly force when an alleged felon is trying to flee if "the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others."
