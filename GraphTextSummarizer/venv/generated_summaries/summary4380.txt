Those are terms used to describe House Speaker John Boehner and his plan to sue President Barack Obama. "John Boehner and the House Republicans may lack the testicular fortitude to fight President Obama," Erickson wrote. In his op-ed, he points to the use of executive action, says the President is "ignoring" 40 bills the House passed focused on job creation and insists Obama ignores "laws written." In a memo to House Republicans, Boehner indicated the areas of concern pertains to issues of foreign policy, health care, energy and education -- a wide swath of issues. The lawyers Boehner consulted on the issue wrote that the House must "demonstrate a concrete, particularized injury, caused by the defendant, which can be remedied by a court." Perhaps providing more insight in a column, the lawyers, David Rivkin Jr. and Elizabeth Price Foley, were more specific about areas of concern than Boehner.
