In a job where I'm seeking innovations that allow more families to have better access to fresh fruits and vegetables, I'm struck that advocates seem mostly interested in mapping and remapping the same neighborhoods to establish conclusive proof that food deserts exist. What we need is the recognition that food represents heritage, love, faith, healing and family pride. Thanks to foundation grants, families using SNAP benefits get $2 worth of food for every $1 spent. The movement to eradicate food deserts would benefit from, of all things, banishment of the term food desert. Unlocking the demand requires understanding that food access is about relationships, not transactions.
