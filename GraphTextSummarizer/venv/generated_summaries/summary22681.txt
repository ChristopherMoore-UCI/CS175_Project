His cause of death was not listed in his obituary on a Fremont County, Wyoming, news website. Winfield was working at a Wyoming ranch in 1968 when Leo Burnett/Philip Morris Advertising came looking for real cowboys to feature in the campaign, according to his local obituary. Best known as the rugged cowboy who starred in the Marlboro Man cigarette advertisements, Darrell Winfield died Monday at home in Wyoming at age 85. The Marlboro Man's run ended when the tobacco companies and state attorneys general reached a settlement in 1998 that banned the use of humans and cartoons in U.S. tobacco advertising. Other Marlboro Men became disillusioned with the campaign, eventually starring in anti-smoking campaigns.
