"The whole U.S. government has no impact whatsoever on regional relations." Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen over Iran's nuclear program, which Iran insists is intended for civilian use but the United States believes is intended for developing weapons. His comments came during a two-day visit to Damascus that follows efforts by the United States to weaken ties between Iran and Syria. "The whole world should know that Iran will stand behind the Syrian nation to the end," Ahmadinejad said in remarks aired on Iran's state-run Press TV. But Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has tempered the thawing of relations by saying that Washington remains concerned with Syria's close ties to Iran. Assad voiced strong support for Iran and brushed off U.S. sentiment.
