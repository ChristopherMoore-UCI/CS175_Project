Shortly after the concert ended, the woman "found herself inside of a Cadillac Limousine with Joseph Cartagena and other male subjects all with the destination of a hotel located on Madison's west side," the police report said. Cartagena's lawyer said the woman was a "pretender groupie" who was attempting to "shake down" the rapper for money.
