Serious cold snaps happen several times a year, though in different regions of the world and with different severities. The rush of cold air it's  sending southward is the biggest visitor from the North Pole since Santa Claus. On occasion, this vortex can become distorted and dip much farther south than you would normally find it, allowing cold air to spill southward. So, the jet stream has been "stuck" in a position that is allowing cold Arctic air to spill into much of the United States and Canada. But when faced with significant cold temperatures, you should stay inside whenever possible, layer clothing if you must be outside, winterize your home and car, etc.
