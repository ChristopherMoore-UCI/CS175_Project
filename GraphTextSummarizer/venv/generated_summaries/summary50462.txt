It was scheduled to call to Labadee, Haiti; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas; and Philipsburg, St. Maarten. That is why, after discussions with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our medical team, we decided the most prudent course for the health of our guests and crew was to bring the cruise home on Wednesday, two days earlier than planned." In total, 595 of the 3,050 passengers and 50 of 1,165 crew members have become ill, according to Bernadette Burden, a spokeswoman with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "The number of reported new cases of gastrointestinal illness has dropped sharply after a spike in the first days of the cruise, and most guests who fell ill are up and about," the cruise line said in a Monday statement. It missed her port calls in Haiti and St. Maarten.
