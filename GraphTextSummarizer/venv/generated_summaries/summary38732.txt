Keep an eye peeled for new security programs  Fifty airports (including Boston, Chicago, and Seattle) have security lines split among Expert, Casual, and Family travelers. Airport security is a traveler's rite of passage: the long lines, the ID check, the shuffling of personal items. Laptops are also among the most-forgotten items at security, so label yours with a business card or ID tag. To move through security quickly, wear slip-on shoes, minimal jewelry and no belt. Dress for success  Slip-on shoes (preferably with socks; think of the dirty feet that have been on that linoleum), minimal jewelry and no belt is the standard uniform for moving through security fast.
