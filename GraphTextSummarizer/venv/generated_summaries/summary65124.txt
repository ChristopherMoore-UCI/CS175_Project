Gary Lamont Sumner faces a murder charge for his alleged role in the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings on Thursday, Escambia County, Florida, Sheriff David Morgan said. Two of the people in the photo are Sumner and the younger Gonzalez, but authorities want to know who the other man is, Morgan said. "It seems as though each phase we complete, while we answer a set of questions, it opens up an additional set of questions." Earlier, he said the complete story, when revealed, is "going to be a humdinger." Asked whether the suspects entered the home planning to kill the couple, Morgan said authorities do not know. Morgan said the crime's complexity is frustrating for investigators, comparing it to a complicated mathematics or word problem that lacks complete information. Sumner was pulled over in a traffic stop in Okaloosa County Sunday and arrested after authorities found he matched a description put out by Escambia authorities.
