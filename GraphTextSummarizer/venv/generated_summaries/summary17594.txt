Presumably, the Iraqi president was referring to U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, commander of multinational forces in Iraq. The "letter of resentment" was dated Thursday and addressed to Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and Gen. John Petraeus. The U.S. military said the detainee is a member of an elite Iranian unit that has been accused of training and equipping insurgents in Iraq, but Talabani said he is a civil servant who was on an official trade mission in Iraq's Kurdistan region. "I call for his release immediately in the interest of the Iraq Kurdistan region and the Iranian-Iraqi relations." Intelligence reports also indicate he was involved in the infiltration and training of foreign terrorists in Iraq." He is one of several Iranians in U.S. custody in Iraq.
