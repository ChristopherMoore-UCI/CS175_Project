Spieth and Watson share the lead at 5-under-par 211, a shot better than Jonas Blixt and Matt Kuchar and two better than Jimenez and Rickie Fowler. Kuchar would have joined Watson and Spieth atop the leaderboard had he not bogeyed the last hole and Bjorn will be ruing three bogeys in his last six holes, although he trails the leaders by merely three shots. Sentimental favorite Thomas Bjorn -- he of the collapse at the British Open more than 10 years ago -- remains in contention and Matt Kuchar, like the other three, wants to bag a maiden major. "I was pumped up, my shots were going further than I was expecting them to, and the greens got firmer, harder and made it difficult," Watson told Sky Sports. "This is where I wanted to be," Spieth told Sky Sports.
