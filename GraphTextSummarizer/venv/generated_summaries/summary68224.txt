"I shall be a president for everyone in Chile," Bachelet said during a congratulatory phone call from President Sebastian Pinera. With more than 93% of votes counted, she won 62.3% of votes, election officials said. Chilean voters first cast ballots last month, but no candidate secured enough votes then to declare victory. Evelyn Matthei of the conservative Independent Democratic Union party garnered 37.7% of votes and conceded the election. In 2010, she was tapped to head U.N. Women, a United Nations agency created to promote gender equality around the world.
