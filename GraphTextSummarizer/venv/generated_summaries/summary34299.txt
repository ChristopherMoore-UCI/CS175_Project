-- Paul Kitterman, a Denver Broncos fan who disappeared during a game five days ago, has been found and is safe, the Denver Police Department tweeted Tuesday night. He had been a passenger along with Tonneson and Bakke, whose boyfriend drove to the game from Kremmling, Colorado, which is northwest of Denver. Kitterman, 53, vanished while waiting outside a bathroom at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Thursday, where the Broncos were playing the San Diego Chargers. Kitterman was located some 112 miles away in Pueblo, Colorado. According to CNN affiliate KUSA-TV, Kitterman didn't care for credit cards and was carrying about $50 in cash.
