Perez, McLaren stablemate of 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson Button, has yet to record a podium finish this season and is 12th in the standings on 35 points -- 312 behind leader Sebastien Vettel, of Red Bull. McLaren has struggled to keep pace with Red Bull, Sebastian Vettel securing his fourth straight drivers' championship crown at the Indian Grand Prix last month. "Checo has made many friends during his time at McLaren -- and, together, as a team, we intend to do our utmost to help him finish his year with us with two good results, especially here in Austin, where he has so many fans. McLaren's official Twitter account linked to a story in which team principal Martin Whitmarsh was quoted as saying: "First of all, we would like to thank Checo for his kind and gracious statement, and for being a fine team member during the 2013 Formula 1 season. I have met a lot of new people at McLaren and I have made many good friends as well.
