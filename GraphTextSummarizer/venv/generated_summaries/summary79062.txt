The Noble fire in Cleveland County, south of Oklahoma City, affected about 7,800 acres and had destroyed 25 structures -- including homes and outbuildings -- as of Saturday, officials said. A cold front in northwestern Oklahoma brought increased wind speeds to an area enduring sweltering temperatures. David Richardson, spokesman for the Midwest City Fire Department in suburban Oklahoma City, said many crews are using lighter-weight and specialty gear in the wildfires. Resident Joe Love told CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KOCO that he stayed in his residence as long as he could. Oklahoma, like much of the nation, has been locked in an extreme drought, making fire conditions critical.
