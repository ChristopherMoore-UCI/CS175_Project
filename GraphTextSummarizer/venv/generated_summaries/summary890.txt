-- More than 300 relatives and friends of missing Flight MH370 passengers marched to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing Tuesday to express their anger and frustration with Malaysian authorities. The protesters left the embassy on buses on Tuesday afternoon after a Malaysian official accepted a petition letter from the families. "No amount of compensation or consolation will make up for any loss of life," Malaysia Airlines Chairman Mohamad Nor Yusof said Tuesday. The airline's CEO, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said Tuesday that text messages were used to ensure the nearly 1,000 family members "heard the tragic news before the world did." China has asked Malaysia to share any evidence that led it to conclude the airliner crashed in the Indian Ocean with no survivors. Visa fees will be waived for the families of MH370 passengers and crew flying in to Australia, the country's defense minister David Johnston said Tuesday.
