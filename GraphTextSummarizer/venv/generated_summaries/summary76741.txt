The neighborhood's estimated 250-300 residents were prohibited from returning until Saturday, because authorities needed to clear debris, Deeds said. Of the 110 houses that stood in Rancho Brazos on Wednesday afternoon, 58 were damaged or destroyed, said Mario Flores, director of disaster-response field operations for Habitat for Humanity, which built 61 homes there. With no water or electric service in the neighborhood, and generally unsafe conditions, no one is allowed yet to resume living there, even in undamaged buildings, Deeds said. "This is going to be a traumatic day for the residents," Deeds said. " ... "We've got people on scene that are going to help them box things up and get some valuables out of there that they need today," Deeds said.
