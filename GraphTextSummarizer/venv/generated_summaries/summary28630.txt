However, Mitalipov said the embryos created in his study, from skin cells and eggs, would not grow babies. Mitalipov acknowledged that the commenter made some valid points but told Nature.com, "The results are real, the cell lines are real, everything is real." Emilie Marcus, editor-in-chief of Cell, posted a statement on the study in the comments on the Cell website: "Based on our own initial in-house assessment of issues raised and in initial discussions with the authors, it seems that there were some minor errors made by the authors when preparing the figures for initial submission. -- Researchers managed to create embryonic stem cells through cloning, a breakthrough in the field that was announced May 15 in the journal Cell. Then, within several days, embryos genetically identical to the baby were created, from which stem cells were derived. Based on OHSU's own initial reviews and the original assessments by Cell, OHSU agrees that there were some minor errors made when preparing the figures for initial submission.
