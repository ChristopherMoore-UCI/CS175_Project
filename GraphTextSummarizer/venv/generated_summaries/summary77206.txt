"Although Zimbabwe is not facing armed conflict, humanitarian threats such as food shortages and outbreak of diseases such as cholera pose a significant challenge," said Agostinho Zacarias, U.N. Development Programme representative in the country. " Cholera  thrives in areas without clean water and proper sanitation, and the United Nations has said 6 million people in Zimbabwe -- more than half the population -- have limited or no access to safe water and sanitation in rural and urban areas. "Zimbabwe is no longer a country in crisis but a country in recovery." Although the cholera epidemic was declared under control last month, a renewed outbreak is likely, international health officials have said. A U.N. appeal launched earlier this year has so far raised only 44 percent of its goal of $718 million for humanitarian assistance.
