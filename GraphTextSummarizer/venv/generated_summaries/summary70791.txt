A woman who was in prison with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani told lawyer Javid Houtan Kian that his client had been lashed over a newspaper photograph that, Iranian authorities thought, showed her without a headscarf. -- Contradictory reports swirled around the case of an Iranian woman sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery, with one Iranian lawyer saying Monday that she had been whipped 99 times for another alleged offense but another casting doubt on it. He said Monday that he sent the photo to the newspaper, "but I did underline that this photo was not necessarily a photo of Sakineh; it was not confirmed." Mostafei spoke at a press conference alongside French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, who said France "will do everything in its power to make this case known and support Sakineh." "Really this is a national case for us and the president said that France must defend Sakineh," Kouchner said. Another lawyer associated with Ashtiani said Monday that he doubted reports about her lashing sentence. The newspaper also accused Iranian authorities of punishing her "to make her suffer for an international campaign to save her that that exposed so much iniquity.
