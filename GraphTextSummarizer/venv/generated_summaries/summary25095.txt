Other countries operate pre-season transfer windows to fit the calendar of their own football seasons. Although players can't be bought outside the transfer window it doesn't stop clubs negotiating transfers before the window opens, with players signing on the dotted line once it does. Madrid have also been linked with Bayern Munich's French winger Frank Ribery, Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso and Valencia winger David Silva There are two transfer windows per year, one pre-season, and one mid- season, which is open throughout January. At the other end of the spectrum Spanish club Valencia are in all kinds of financial difficulty and may be forced to sell their biggest assets, with David Silva and striker David Villa the most prized of all.
