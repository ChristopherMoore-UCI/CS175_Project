Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said in August that if local police agencies want to qualify for federal funding, their officers should be required to wear body cameras, and Obama said he would ask for $263 million that would, in part, provide police departments with the recording devices. CNN and CNNMoney ran numerous stories under headlines such as: -- "Can cell phones stop police brutality?" -- "No dashcams in Ferguson: One less tool in Michael Brown shooting investigation" -- "Post-Ferguson, more police uniforms include cameras" -- "Can technology prevent another Ferguson?" Yet all this clamoring to put cameras on officers' lapels ignores that police use of force has remained relatively static despite the increasing popularity of camera phones over the years. At the same time, there are instances in which police departments did not stand by their officers when cameras captured what appears to be excessive force. The facts, along with these incidents -- and the disparity in how the cases were handled -- don't appear to provide a solid answer on whether body cameras are the answer to curbing excessive uses of force by police in America.
