The reigning champions also made it seven wins out of seven in La Liga on Saturday with a 2-0 triumph over lowly Almeria but the victory was overshadowed by an injury to Lionel Messi. The game's only goal came in the 11th minute when Costa gathered in Koke's inch-perfect through ball before executing a crisp side-foot finish past keeper Diego Lopez. Koke came the closest of anyone to scoring in the 81st minute, hitting the woodwork with a glorious looping left-foot before Real pushed for an equalizer in the dying minutes of the game.
