"When you work as a local journalist, it's more frequent that you (are) facing more risks," he said in an interview at California State University, Northridge, where he spoke to students about cartel violence and where his photos are on display this month. That figure is considered exorbitant, especially when compared with the 209 homicides in New York City last year, even though that U.S. city's population is six times greater than Juarez's. That's because the violence by Mexican cartels and other criminals who control swaths of the borderlands have secured a reputation for ferocious violence and carnage, including to those who dare to chronicle the death toll. Juarez also is known for its high "femicide" rate, the unsolved murders of hundreds of girls and women. "During my childhood, Juarez was a very calm place, very secure place," Cardona told CNN.
