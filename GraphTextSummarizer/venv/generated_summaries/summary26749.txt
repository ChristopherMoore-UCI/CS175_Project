Regime forces killed at least 46 people Tuesday, including at least 18 people in towns in the northern province of Idlib, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. -- Both the Syrian government and opposition forces are violating a cease-fire, and the regime continues to deploy heavy weapons in cities, the chief U.N. peacekeeper said Tuesday. Clashes between regime forces and military defectors Tuesday left 12 Syrian soldiers dead, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Sky News, a British broadcaster, said Syrian officials confiscated a television camera after a crew filmed an impromptu protest in Damascus, the capital, on Tuesday. It also calls for government forces to withdraw from city centers.
