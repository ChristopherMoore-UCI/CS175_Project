The increases in death risk might therefore be due to underlying health conditions rather than the supplements themselves, says Susan Fisher, Ph.D., a professor of community and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in Rochester, N.Y. "People [often] go to the vitamin store because they feel something isn't right -- their memory is slipping, they don't have as much energy," says Fisher, who was not involved in the new study. Older women have a slightly increased risk of dying at an earlier age if they take multivitamins or certain other dietary supplements, according to a new study published today in the Archives of Internal Medicine. The study participants were white and tended to live in rural areas, so the findings can't necessarily be generalized to other races and geographic areas. Some supplements, including beta-carotene, vitamins A and C, and selenium, didn't appear to affect death risk either way. However, the increases in death risk (or decrease, in the case of calcium) were extremely small and may not be clinically meaningful, says Mary L. Chavez, a professor of pharmacy practice at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Kingsville.
