Mandy Stahre, the state epidemiologist who's investigating the cluster of birth defects, says it might be upsetting for mothers to get a call with such questions. The state's rigorous search of the women's medical records, along with birth and death certificates, found nothing linking the families who had babies with birth defects. That finding doesn't surprise Dr. Beate Ritz, who's done several studies on birth defects. But Barron, the nurse who found the original cases of birth defects, isn't so sure. Even the state Department of Health admits that medical records are limited, writing in a press release: "Medical record reviews might not have captured all information, preventing a cause from being identified."
