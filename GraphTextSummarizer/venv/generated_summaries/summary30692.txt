Matthew Warren, 27, committed suicide "in a momentary wave of despair" at the end of a lifetime struggle "with mental illness, dark holes of depression and even suicidal thoughts," the pastor wrote to the staff of his Southern California megachurch. Worship services continued as scheduled Saturday and Sunday with Warren's brother-in-law Tom Holladay -- an assistant pastor for the Orange County, California, congregation -- filling in for Warren. As a pioneer of the megachurch movement, Rick Warren looked to translate traditional evangelical messages to a wider audience. The weekend's sermon at Saddleback Church was "Surviving Tough Times," a theme Pastor Rick Warren planned before his youngest son killed himself with a gun Friday. He was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Mission Viejo, California, late Friday afternoon, the Orange County Coroner said.
