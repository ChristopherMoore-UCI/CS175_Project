Beyond the strategic challenges posed by the Arab Spring lies an urgent threat -- Iran's determination to achieve nuclear weapons capability. Our partners in Europe, Asia and the Middle East can and should do more to amplify the effect of U.S. sanctions if they are serious about stopping Iran's nuclear proliferation. While the U.S. left Iran's market years ago, we can still exert great pressure through financial sanctions, and President Barack Obama should do so. Iran's leaders must feel dramatic pressure that imperils their very hold on power until their abandonment of nuclear program can be verified. Without recourse to war, these steps represent the best hope of confronting the challenges posed by Iran's nuclear proliferation and patronage of terrorism.
