The Ventura County blaze prompted the evacuation of homes in Newbury Park, fire authorities said. The blaze damaged 15 homes and caused the evacuation of other homes and the campus of California State University Channel Islands, fire officials said. "It could be a very long, hot summer with a lot of potential for fires if they get started and if we continue to have the hot, dry weather," said Hutchinson, the Cal Fire battalion chief. Winds reaching 25 mph aided the Springs Fire in Ventura County, and weather conditions grounded fixed-wing air tankers, allowing only helicopters to drop water, fire officials said. The spread of the blaze seemed to slow early Thursday morning, and crews gained greater containment, now pegged at 40% with no growth in acreage, according to the state agency Cal Fire.
