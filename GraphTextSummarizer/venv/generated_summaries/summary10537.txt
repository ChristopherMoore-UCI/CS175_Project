The Portuguese coach, who is expected to rejoin English club Chelsea, was booed by large sections of home fans before the match -- though others held banners thanking him -- and he was surrounded by photographers every time he ventured from the dugout. Malaga manager Manuel Pellegrini is also on the move, being widely expected to join English club Manchester City. Despite Mourinho's apparent dressing room rift with former captain Iker Casillas and other key Spanish players, Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa said the 50-year-old deserved respect. Guardiola helped Barcelona become the first Spanish club to win a hat-trick of titles in 2011, but was unable to follow that up last season before standing down. The Chilean announced last month that he is leaving the Spanish club, which ended the season in sixth place and reached the Champions League quarterfinals.
