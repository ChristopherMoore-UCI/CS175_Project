Reports of new products also would probably look good to Apple investors. Such occasional Apple rumor stories keep the iPhone in the minds of smartphone buyers and could influence their decisions about what phone to buy next. Apple may also feel pressure to release a new iPhone soon to compete with archrival Samsung, whose popular Samsung Galaxy S line has emerged as a credible competitor. The company has released a new iPhone model every year since the device debuted in 2007, and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall. These periodic crumbs of leaked information about Apple launches may help the company, which presents itself as extremely secretive about future products.
