According to the International Ecotourism Society, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, more than 66 percent of American travelers believe that hotels have an obligation to protect the environment and support local communities. Ask whether your tour company or hotel has a practice of contributing to local causes. Booking advice: â€¢ Smaller tour groups and hotels (think 20 versus 100 people, and boutique hotels versus megaresorts) have a lower ecological impact. Check out the many philanthropic programs offered by hotels (both high-end and chain brands) and travel companies, including opportunities for guests to volunteer. Unlike hotels, travel companies have no universal third-party eco-certification.
