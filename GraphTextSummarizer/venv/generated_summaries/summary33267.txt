So before people brandish their right to ridicule and belittle entire ethnic groups, before such frivolous freedoms help stoke anti-immigrant fervor, let's pause and reflect. The Pew Research Center recently reported that 55 percent of adults say "there are 'very strong' or 'strong' conflicts between immigrants and people born in the United States" while "39 percent believe there are serious conflicts between blacks and whites." According to the Pew survey, blacks, Latinos and women are significantly more likely than whites and men to say major conflicts exist between groups. Gaps also exist between Latinos and whites on whether conflict exists between immigrants and native-born Americans: 68 percent of Latinos said "yes" compared with 53 percent of whites. The Pew report concludes that: "Disagreements between immigrants and native-born Americans emerge as the most prevalent and serious type of social conflict."
