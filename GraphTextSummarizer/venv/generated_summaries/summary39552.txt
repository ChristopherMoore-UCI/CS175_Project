About 400 personnel were in Herriman, Utah, to battle the Machine Gun fire, as the blaze has been dubbed, said fire spokesman Marshall Thompson. Authorities expressed optimism about firefighting efforts Monday, but warned that weather conditions could cause a resurgence of fire activity. Thompson said the blaze has burned 4,346 acres, significantly less than the 10,000 acres the fire's footprint was estimated to be on Monday. The fire has destroyed three homes, and it caused significant damage to a fourth, said Nicole Martin, spokeswoman for Herriman city. The fire was sparked Sunday by ammunition fired by Utah National Guardsmen at nearby Camp Williams.
