Many people now believe that holding animals captive is distasteful and the zoo industry has sought to reinvent itself in recent years to suggest that its work is founded in conservation and education, but animals born in zoos are rarely released to the wild and the vast majority will spend their entire lives in captivity. The traditional argument put forward by zoos that people need to see animals in order to support conservation is, therefore, not borne out by the evidence. Zoos manage animals in confined spaces. Education may be a laudable aim for zoos to pursue, but the suggestion that animals should be incarcerated for their entire lives in order that we fulfil our desire to learn about them is morally questionable, at best. With the exception of those used in aquariums, few animals are now taken from their natural habitat to populate zoos and so the genetic diversity of the captive population is finite, as is the space available to house them.
