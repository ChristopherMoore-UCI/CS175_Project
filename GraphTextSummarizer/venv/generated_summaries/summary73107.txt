Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel, who is from the Manisa region, which includes Soma, filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents. Then video taken on the same day in Soma showed Erdogan telling a man "don't be nasty," according to the footage aired Friday by DHA. As Erdogan took a stroll through Soma, onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of "Resign, Prime Minister!" The protesters, dressed mostly in black, chanted "Don't sleep, Soma, remember your dead!" as they passed through city streets a few miles from the disaster site trying to reach a statue honoring miners. Istanbul Technical University said it had dropped Gurman and a fellow Soma Holding manager, Ismet Kasapoglu, from an advisory panel in its mining faculty, following protests and an occupation by students at the university, CNN Turk reported.
