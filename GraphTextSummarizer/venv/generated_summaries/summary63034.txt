On nine occasions, New York City child welfare caseworkers visited the home of 4-year-old Myls Dobson without even realizing that the boy's father was in jail, according to a review of the case. Caseworkers, however, never consulted the parole officer and never learned that Wade was jailed in connection with a fraud case during their visits to the Brooklyn apartment where he was staying with his son, a review of the case ordered by Mayor Bill de Blasio found. " Myls' mother, Ashlee Dobson, faced abuse and neglect charges in South Carolina and New York City before ultimately losing custody of the boy. The woman, Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday. "We were told that the father was working, and was working very long hours, 16 hours a day, and that's why he wasn't available," Gladys Carrion, the head of ACS, said at the news conference with de Blasio on Friday.
