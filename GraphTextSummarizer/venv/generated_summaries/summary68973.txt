" Ken Mehlman, former adviser to President George W. Bush and former chair of the Republican National Committee, announced that he is gay in 2010 after he stepped out of the political spotlight and into the private sector. Despite being a member and former spokesman for a party that doesn't support what he so badly desires -- to marry his same sex partner -- Richardson is committed to the GOP and committed to changing the party's views on the issue. That's unjust, and it's uniquely painful," he wrote in the Post. Richardson once worked for the more moderate Republican Jon Huntsman, who has embraced same-sex marriage. He wants to work "from within" to change minds and the law about same sex marriage, he said. But he also worked for candidates adamantly against same sex marriage, including former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour's short-lived presidential exploratory campaign.
