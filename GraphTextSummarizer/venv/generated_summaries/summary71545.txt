Bonus: A good way to figure out a healthy pace for your first marathon is to run a 10K at least a month in advance. Of course, my problems all started with not training properly, and if you're serious about running, your first marathon training is key. This sounds like common sense, but you don't know how many runners I've talked to who get a brilliant idea to try something completely different on the day of a marathon -- be it new shoes, socks, drinks or energy gels. In fact, my first marathon was almost my last. Of course, you can't do yoga during a race, but try to fit in one to two hours a week during training.
