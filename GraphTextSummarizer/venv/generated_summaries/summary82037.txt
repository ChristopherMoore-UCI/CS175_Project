I think it is true that police officers, in general, are more likely to be suspicious of black people than white people in specific circumstances, and I know the phenomenon of "driving while black" happens. In the worst-case scenario, Watts' reaction re-entrenches prejudices held by some that black suspects contribute disproportionately to the contentious relationship between cops and the black community. It's the kind of action that gives black people reason to be distrustful of cops. What happened to Belk is the kind of incident that can help white people understand how racial bias impacts other people's lives. White people, like it or not, receive the benefit of racial bias, although it's hardly ever very apparent when it happens.
