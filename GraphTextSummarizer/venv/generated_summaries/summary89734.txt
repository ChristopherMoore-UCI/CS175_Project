Comanche -- owned by Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his wife, Australian model Kristy Hinze-Clark -- had to settle for second behind history maker Wild Oats XI in the 70th running of the 'Bluewater Classic.' Comanche had been closing the gap in the 628-nautical mile race but ultimately was 49 minutes slower than Wild Oats XI, which is owned by wine magnate Robert Oatley. "To rewrite a bit of sailing history doesn't come along every day," Wild Oats XI's skipper, Mark Richards, was quoted as saying by the race's official website. Wild Oats XI became the first boat to achieve eight line honors, surpassing the seven line honors of Morna -- later called Kurrewa IV -- in the 1950s and 60s when it crossed the finish line in two days, two hours, three minutes and 26 seconds Sunday. "We were about a quarter of the way into Bass Strait and expecting a westerly breeze, and all of a sudden Stan (navigator Stan Honey) came up from down below and said, 'I just got a new weather file, this is not looking good,'" Comanche skipper Ken Read was quoted as saying by the race's official website. They had 12 hours where they had Wild Oats' weather, but that's racing."
