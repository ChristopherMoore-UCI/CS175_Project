-- A day after world No. 1 Serena Williams suffered one of the worst losses of her career at the WTA Finals, second-ranked Maria Sharapova wasn't that much better. Sharapova's hopes of reaching the semifinals in Singapore -- not to mention overtaking Williams as the year-end No. 1 -- are hanging by a thread following a 6-3 6-2 defeat to Petra Kvitova on Thursday. If Ana Ivanovic doesn't beat Halep -- who has already qualified for the semifinals -- in straight sets Friday, Williams and Halep progress to the last four. Sharapova -- who won her lone year-end title 10 years ago -- must now beat the 1-1 Radwanska on Friday to have any chance of advancing. For Sharapova to become the year-end No. 1, she now has to win the tournament and hope Williams doesn't make the final.
