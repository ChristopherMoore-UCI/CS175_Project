Airplane ergonomics should also be improved, it said, "to provide guidance to crews to help them recognize and manage unusual situations." A series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash of Air France Flight 447, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said Thursday in its final report on the disaster. The report makes 25 new safety recommendations, on top of a number made in an initial report last year. The recorders revealed the pilots had failed to discuss repeated stall warnings and "had received no high altitude training" to deal with the situation, the bureau said. Last year's report from the bureau said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when "the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled."
