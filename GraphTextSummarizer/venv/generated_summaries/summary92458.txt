"There was a sense that actors who did animated work weren't at the top of their game career-wise," said Total Film editor Aubrey Day. "The success of that movie made film execs think, 'We've hit on something -- if we get celebrity actors in these roles, it will generate box office.' Inevitably, there's still the sneaking suspicion that actors regard voice work as a cushy number. Far from being a cushy job, Cartwright says voice work is a performance -- and one that requires actors to find the physicality of the character, just as they would in a live-action film. "That's the key about animation -- it's about correct casting, not stunt casting."
