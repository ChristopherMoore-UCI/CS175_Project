Where last month, the president, through his spokesman, seemed to perceive homosexuality as an illness, now Museveni seemed to be following the lead of a government committee that declared Friday that homosexuality is "not a disease but merely an abnormal behavior which may be learned through experiences in life. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. -- Uganda's president Saturday vowed to sign sweeping anti-gay legislation, citing what he said were scientific, not political, considerations for a controversial measure in a country that already criminalizes homosexuality. Museveni appears to be balancing the desire to please a conservative constituency vehemently opposed to homosexuality with hopes of not alienating Western aid donors to the east African country. " In a statement, the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights said the bill would "place the lives of countless Ugandans at risk" and "had already intensified the climate of hatred and persecution" against gay people in Uganda.
