Read the opinion of ICRC Director-General, Yves Daccord Louis Lillywhite, former surgeon general of the British armed forces, said in World War II a British hospital on the front lines was able to function even with fighting on the premises. "They die because the ambulance does not get there in time, because health-care personnel are prevented from doing their work, because hospitals are themselves targets of attacks or simply because the environment is too dangerous for effective health care to be delivered. The Red Cross report said that millions of lives could be saved if the delivery of health care were more respected. It's a matter of life and death," said Yves Daccord, the director-general of the organization. "The human cost is staggering: civilians and fighters often die from their injuries simply because they are prevented from receiving timely medical assistance," Daccord said.
