Al-Hashimi vetoed the Iraqi parliament's first election law last week, arguing it failed to provide enough seats for Iraqi refugees, many of whom are Sunnis. I believe we have enough flexibility we'll be able to mitigate it and we'll be able to go on and have successful elections," said Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. Iraq's constitution calls for elections by January 31. The upcoming parliamentary elections and a law setting down rules for elections are seen as important barometers of Iraqi progress toward stability. Iraq's top electoral commission -- saying it needs 60 days to prepare for voting -- announced last week that a January vote is unlikely.
