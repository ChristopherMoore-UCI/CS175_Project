-- Rap star Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson visited Kenya and famine-hit Somalia this week to raise awareness on hunger and poverty issues. The singer teamed up with the World Food Programme for the Wednesday and Thursday visits that included a stop in a slum in neighboring Kenya. The rap star has sold millions of albums and produced major hits including "Candy Shop" and "In Da Club." "What I am seeing is devastating -- these women and children have risked everything to come to this Somalia camp, just to get food," Jackson said. "They need our help." Somalia has battled famine conditions in some regions and an Islamist insurgency that has disrupted aid to people in danger of starvation.
