"The only thing I can confirm is that American Airlines Flight 4 from Los Angeles (LAX) to New York (JFK) last Thursday evening diverted to Kansas City (MCI) because of a disruptive passenger," American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told CNN. The flight was diverted to Kansas City's airport on Thursday after the woman became disruptive, according to CNN affiliate KMBC in Kansas City. Kansas City Aviation Department officials told KMBC that the woman failed to cooperate with a federal air marshal. "The passenger was detained, not arrested, and then released pending further investigation by the TSA (Transportation Safety Administration) and federal air marshals," said Tom McKenna, a Kansas City International Airport spokesman. KMBC reports that the woman told authorities her behavior was a result of her diabetes.
