City flooded The first floor of the capital's city hall was covered in an inch of flood water, after heavy rains poured down across Oklahoma City, said city spokeswoman Kristy Yager. Two of the victims in Oklahoma died within twenty miles of Moore, said medical examiner spokeswoman Amy Elliot. A handful of fresh storms killed at least five people Friday, authorities said, less than two weeks after a monstrous cyclone waylaid the town of Moore, a suburb of Oklahoma City. Though the state's transportation authorities strongly advised citizens not to drive, some interstate highways in Oklahoma were jammed with stalled traffic, as heavy rains drenched roadways and flooded low-lying areas. Though the tornadoes were not as strong as the EF-5 twister that killed 24 on May 20, fear drove some people into their cars to flee them, some of whom got caught in heavy rains and flash flooding.
