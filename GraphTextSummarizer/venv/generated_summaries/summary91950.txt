-- A jury of five men and seven women, along with four alternates, was chosen Wednesday in the trial of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach charged with child rape. As jury selection in the case began Tuesday, Penn State released a statement, saying, "The acts that Jerry Sandusky is accused of committing are horrible and if proven true, deserve punishment." Some were football players, or Second Mile participants, or other young people he tried to encourage to be better students. The case has shaken the university, raised questions about its response to the allegations and drawn criticism from those who claim Penn State put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims. The prospective jurors were quizzed Tuesday and Wednesday about their relationships with Penn State, local law enforcement and Second Mile, and whether they had contributed to any of those entities.
