-- England footballer Rio Ferdinand accused European football's governing body of not taking racism seriously enough after the Serbian FA was fined US$105,000 following an Under-21 match where opposing England players said they were racially abused. The English FA, which banned Terry for four matches in September following his racial abuse of QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in a match last year, backed the elder Ferdinand's viewpoint, agreeing that the punishment should have been tougher. Ferdinand -- whose brother was at the center of a racism row involving Chelsea defender John Terry -- suggested that UEFA should contact the current generation of footballers to discuss ways to eradicate racism within European football. In chaotic scenes at the end of the match in the Serb city Krusevac, England defender Danny Rose was sent off for kicking the ball away in response to what he said was racist and physical abuse -- while fans, coaches and other players also clashed. Horne added that the FA is set to appeal the two-year and one-year bans handed out to Steven Caulker and Thomas Ince respectively, with both players set to miss the opening matches of next year's European Under-21 Championship.
