Shaw-Doran serves as director of equipment development for Turtle Ridge, and Miller has called on friends and associates from across the sporting world to create and adapt equipment to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports. " Back home after an emotional Olympics in Sochi, where Miller cried during a live interview with NBC's Christin Cooper when asked about the recent death of his brother, Miller is focusing on another project: his Turtle Ridge Foundation. The experience motivated Miller to find ways to help get disabled and injured athletes more involved in sports. A major annual event for Turtle Ridge is Bodefest, an all-day ski and barbecue extravaganza on Miller's home turf of Cannon Mountain, New Hampshire, complete with autographs, an auction and a chance for children to race their idol. The sentiment seems to fit with Miller's general philosophy of focusing on how the sport makes you feel, rather than the end game, a feeling he believes everyone is entitled to, regardless of ability.
