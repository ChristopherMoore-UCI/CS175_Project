Patel was licensed to practice medicine in New York state in 1980 and was fined and put on probation for "gross negligence and incompetence" in 1984, according to Australia's extradition complaint. Prosecutors argued that Patel was criminally negligent in operating on the three men at Australia's Bundaberg Base Hospital, where he was director of surgery between 2003 and 2005. The verdict culminated 15 weeks of trial during which prosecutors told the jury about how Patel was an egotistical man who caused deaths and injuries by performing wrong operations, AAP said. Indian-born Dr. Jayant Patel, 60, was found guilty of three counts of manslaughter and one count of grievous bodily harm in a Queensland Supreme Court, the Australian Associated Press said. The controversy over Patel in Australia mounted when concerns about his competency were voiced in Queensland's state legislature.
