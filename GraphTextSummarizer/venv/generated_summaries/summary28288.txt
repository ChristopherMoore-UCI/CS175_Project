The grand jury had alleged that Patsy Ramsey, who died from ovarian cancer in 2006, and John Ramsey "did ... permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health which resulted in the death of JonBenet Ramsey." " Ramsey attorney wants full review On Friday, an attorney for John Ramsey and his family urged Garnett to publicly open "the entire grand jury record and not just four pages from an 18-month investigation that produced volumes of testimony and exhibits." Previously sealed court documents released Friday show that a Colorado grand jury voted in 1999 to indict John and Patsy Ramsey, JonBenet's parents, on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime. The grand jury also had alleged that each parent "did ... render assistance to a person, with intent to hinder, delay and prevent the discovery, detention, apprehension, prosecution, conviction and punishment of such person for the commission of a crime, knowing the person being assisted has committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death." That year, another district attorney, Mary Lacy, wrote a letter to John Ramsey, saying that new DNA evidence tests had cleared him, his late wife and their son.
