Pragmatically, hanging the paintings edge-to-edge was not as easy as you might think Hankins said because the canvas frames have warped over time. The February 1979 issue of New York Magazine quotes Warhol saying, "Someone asked me if I though they were art and I said no. "These galleries are just curved enough to give you flow, or push our visitors through the space," said Associate Curator Evelyn Hankins. Then one of two styles of "peaks" was silk screened onto the backgrounds, creating a repetitive pattern when the canvases are hung side-by-side. -- One hundred and two canvases all with similar composition but different colors hung edge-to-edge make up the totality of Andy Warhol's painting called "Shadows" currently on display at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington.
