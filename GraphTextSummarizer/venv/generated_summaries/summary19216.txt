Karzai was referring to a comment made last week during his meeting in Washington with U.S. President Barack Obama, who told him that the continued presence of any U.S. troops in Afghanistan after the planned withdrawal of NATO forces in 2014 would depend on their being granted immunity from prosecution by Afghan courts. -- Afghan elders will decide whether any U.S. military who stay in the country after 2014 will be granted immunity from prosecution, President Hamid Karzai told reporters Monday in his palace. "The United States will continue to have the use of facilities in Afghanistan and, in order to run those facilities well for the purposes of continuing to fight al Qaeda and train and equip Afghan forces, the United States will need to have a limited number of forces in Afghanistan. "The issue of granting immunity to American soldiers is not a decision that could be made by Afghan government. Karzai also said that Afghanistan has turned the corner in terms of battling the Taliban.
