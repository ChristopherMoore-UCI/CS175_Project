Improvements in the design of German trains and a review of maintenance operations in China have also prevented repeats of previous train accidents in those countries. Modern train control equipment is designed to brake trains automatically when they travel too quickly or come too close to another train. -- This week's devastating crash of a high-speed train in Spain, which left nearly 80 dead, has drawn renewed attention to rail safety at a time when the Obama administration has prioritized the construction of fast new rail links. But such fast trains are still largely unknown to Americans thanks to decades of minimal government support for track improvement. So far, the Obama administration, thanks to support from congressional Democrats, has distributed more than $10 billion to begin investing in faster train service.
