As a social worker in Minneapolis, Cathy Heying repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients' health, their jobs, even their homes. I want to talk about feelings and people, and they want to talk about cars. And when I really thought about it, going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage, who are living with a broken-down car in subzero weather. I did not grow up working on cars. I did not have a father that wrenched on cars.
