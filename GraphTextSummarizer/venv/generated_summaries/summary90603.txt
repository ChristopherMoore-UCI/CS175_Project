-- The leader of one of the labs linked to an accidental anthrax exposure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been reassigned, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner says. "CDC believes that other CDC staff, family members, and the general public are not at risk of exposure and do not need to take any protective action." The FBI is aware of the incident and coordinating with officials at the CDC as they investigate, said FBI spokesman Christopher Allen. Believing the samples were inactivated, workers in those labs did not don adequate protective equipment, the CDC said. The CDC said disciplinary action, as necessary, will be taken.
