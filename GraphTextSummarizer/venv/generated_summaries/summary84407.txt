The latest confrontation rattled a country on edge after at least 44 people died in Homs and other cities Friday when Syrian security personnel fired at demonstrators, according to the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. The deaths occurred after demonstrations broke out after Friday prayers in Syrian cities, as they have for weeks. The relatives and friends of these people said they fled to Lebanon because they were afraid Syrian forces would arrest or shoot them. The U.N. refugee agency on Friday said it is helping serve the thousands of Syrians who "escaped to the border areas of Wadi Khaled and Tall Bire in northern Lebanon. But it criticized Lebanon's security forces for detaining Syrian refugees in some instances.
