The weekly Jeune Afrique quoted Kagame as saying in an interview that both France and Belgium had played a "direct role ... in the political preparation of genocide and participation in its execution." France said Monday that its ambassador to Rwanda had been barred from attending the events marking the anniversary. Last month, a Paris court sentenced former Rwandan spy chief Pascal Simbikangwa to 25 years in jail for his role in the genocide, the first such conviction in France. -- Rwanda held solemn commemorations Monday to mark the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, with many survivors overcome with emotion as they relived the trauma of the killings that left 800,000 people dead. The French Foreign Ministry said that France was "surprised by the recent accusations made by the Rwandan president" and that Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, who had been due to travel to Kigali on Monday, would no longer attend the commemoration.
