"He works hard and has great initiative, but more importantly, he brings such great energy -- and that sets the tone for everyone," said Dr. Greg Pearl, president of the California chapter of Volunteer Optometric Services to Humanity. Since 2011, Gupta has donated 9,500 pairs of glasses, worth nearly $500,000, to young people in Haiti, Honduras, India and Mexico. For Gupta, who has worn glasses since he was 5 years old, the idea of repurposing old eyewear made sense. " In the past three years, Gupta has gone on numerous trips to India and Mexico, where he not only provides glasses but also assists the doctors and volunteers at eye clinics. " Gupta, a senior in high school, helps fund his work by tutoring younger students after school, and he spends about 20 hours a week collecting and shipping the glasses.
