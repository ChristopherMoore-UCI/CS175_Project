It's the first time the previously star-studded concert series is headed west, and the announcement that the rapper planned a press conference with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti led to speculation that there would be a joint tour with Jay Z's superstar wife, Beyonce. City officials admitted that holding such a festival in downtown Los Angeles will be a logistical challenge. Jay Z's Budweiser "Made in America" festival will occur simultaneously in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia over the Labor Day weekend, it was announced on Wednesday. Last year's performers included Nine Inch Nails, Rick Ross and Skrillex. There's no word yet on the lineup, though Jay Z hinted that several genres will be represented.
