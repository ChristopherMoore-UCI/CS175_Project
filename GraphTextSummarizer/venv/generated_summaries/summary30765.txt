Back home, my parents decided against going to the nearby Sifal Chaur football field where families were sleeping on plastic mattresses under rudimentary tents. The journey towards my family home in Sifal was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots. People gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads, on traffic islands and around metal pulpits, which looked out of range of falling buildings. Meanwhile, the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of Jhocchen, Indra Chowk, New Road, and nearby neighborhoods.
