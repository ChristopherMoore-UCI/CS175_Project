Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell visited this week and told hundreds of people gathered for the Asian Leadership Conference that North Korea knew well an attack on South Korea, much less the United States, would mean a "regime ending" retaliation. Opinion: Why North Korea regime is scary North Korea has an array of artillery and other conventional arms that make its military a credible threat, especially to South Korean. Nowhere is there the slightest inkling that anyone in this second largest metropolitan area in the world -- is fearful or even anxious about the stream of threats emanating from North Korea. But Seoul isn't all of South Korea.
