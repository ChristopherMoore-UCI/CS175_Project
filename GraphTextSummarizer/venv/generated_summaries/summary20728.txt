Warning: Take a deep breath before reading aloud: • AARP; • AFL-CIO; • American Medical Association; • American Bar Association; • American Jewish Committee; • Anti-Defamation League; • B`nai B`rith; • Children`s Defense Fund; • Environmental Action Foundation; • Episcopal Church; • Lauder Foundation; • League of Women Voters of the United States; • National Association of Police Organizations; • National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; • National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; • National Council of La Raza; • National Urban League; • National Spinal Cord Injury Association; • Southern Christian Leadership Conference; • U.S. Catholic Conference; • United Methodist Church; • United Church of Christ; • U.S. Conference of Mayors; • and the YWCA of the USA. Reasonable advocates of Second Amendment rights are being ill-served by the organization's recalcitrant radicalism -- reflected in the fact that 74% of NRA members say they support universal background checks. And adding the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and National Spinal Cord Injury Association to the list of anti-gun enemies is either clueless or callous -- or both. In the case of the NRA, this is reflected in its reversal on policies it supported in the past, such as gun-free school zones and universal background checks. The NRA enemies list will backfire badly.
