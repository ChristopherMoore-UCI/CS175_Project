"Attacks such as these not only harm individual victims, they also threaten entire communities in New York City," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement Tuesday. -- Hate crime and robbery indictments were brought Tuesday in two separate incidents in which suspects allegedly targeted gay men for violence at Manhattan gay bars. Two men were accused of attacking a man in the bathroom of the Stonewall Inn, an iconic gay bar in downtown Manhattan, on October 3, according to a release from the New York district attorney's office. Frederick Giunta, 25, of Queens, New York, has been charged with attempted robbery and assault as a hate crime. An additional indictment Tuesday came in a separate, similar incident a little more than a week later.
