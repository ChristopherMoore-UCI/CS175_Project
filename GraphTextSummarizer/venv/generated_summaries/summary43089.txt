The testimony Wednesday painted a picture of a troubled family history, and a Brian David Mitchell who alienated his parents as a boy and shunned his own children as an adult. In his opening statement, defense attorney Parker Douglas described his client's life as mirroring his father's in many ways, including unusual and fervent religious beliefs, but he noted that Shirl Mitchell was never formally diagnosed with a mental illness. Mitchell eventually put the children from his first marriage, Travis and Angela, up for adoption, while preventing his own family members from adopting or having contact with them, according to testimony Wednesday. During his testimony Wednesday, the elder Mitchell said his son had been troubled since "in the womb," and was conceived under "unfortunate psychological circumstances for me and my wife." Irene Mitchell, the defendant's mother, testified only  briefly Wednesday afternoon.
