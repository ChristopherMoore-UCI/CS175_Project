Cuban President Raul Castro said Sunday that he would step down from power in 2018, when his second term as president is set to end. Last year, Castro said that Cuban officials, including the president, should be limited to two terms in office. Castro asked, referring to the cost overruns and inefficiency endemic to Cuban government construction projects. Also Sunday, lawmakers elevated Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, 52, to the position of first vice president, putting him next in line to succeed Castro. Castro took over from his ailing, older brother, Fidel Castro, whom he quoted liberally on Sunday.
