A keyboard donated by musician Steve Wonder has helped Joseph regain the strength in his fingers. He hopes to have a makeshift structure up within two weeks so children can begin attending the dual purpose music and academic school by mid-April. His friends were able to remove him from the rubble of the New Victorian School, and he was airlifted out of Port-au-Prince by the American Embassy to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. "So that's why I did what I did." Joseph hopes to return playing professionally by October, when he would like to have a debut concert with Wonder. The violin wasn't the only instrument helping Joseph repair his shattered hand during the 18 hours of physical therapy he received each week.
