Wernbloom, making his debut for the club following his recent transfer from Dutch club AZ Alkmaar, was on hand to fire home from close range in the third minute of injury time, after Alexei Berezutsky's cross from the left had caused uncertainty in the Real Madrid defense. And, with time nearly up, Wernbloom pounced to deny Madrid victory -- although the nine-times champions are still the heavy favorites to progress to the quarterfinals following the second leg in two weeks' time. -- A last-gasp goal from Swedish international midfielder Pontus Wernbloom saw CSKA Moscow earn a 1-1 Champions League last 16 home draw with Real Madrid on a freezing cold night in the Russian capital. Real came into the match in sparkling domestic form, holding a 10-point lead over rivals Barcelona in the Spanish La Liga title race. And they began well in front of a partisan 63,000 crowd, with home keeper Sergei Chepchugov pulling off a great double save from Gonzalo Higuain and Sami Khedira.
