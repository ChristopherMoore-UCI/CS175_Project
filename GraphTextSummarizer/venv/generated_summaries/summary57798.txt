For now, the Uber-like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of Kampala, where a click on the SafeBoda app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a Safeboda bike, complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket, helmet and fully trained in road safety. The main need for safe driving is in the congested streets of downtown Kampala where the company plans to expand into next. Driver training is provided in partnership with the Ugandan Red Cross and takes place for up to three weeks to cover road safety and bike maintenance -- and it seems to be working. "It's a market-based approach to road safety," says Sussock, an economist, who believes that as word spreads about the skills of his drivers, the income -- and safety -- of his drivers will rise and reflect this. Safety has long been a concern for those riding boda bodas as the bikes are a leading cause of death and head injury in Kampala.
