It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not from the same family. It puts into question how well the CIA and other intelligence agencies can penetrate al Qaeda. Other Taliban and intelligence sources, however, said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft.
