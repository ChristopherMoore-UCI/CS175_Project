Failure could cause NATO members to be skittish about these new "out-of-area" missions, which will more and more mean confronting the enemy on its own turf. As NATO seeks to combat threats beyond its borders, the hope is that Russian concerns about a missile defense shield could be eased within this new framework of "shared security" against countries like Iran and North Korea. The U.S. has argued that a failure by NATO to provide enough troops for the mission in Afghanistan would call into question the alliance's ability to tackle post-Cold War security challenges. Although the original tenets of NATO's mission -- defending member nations, strengthening trans-Atlantic ties, and fostering European integration -- still apply, Clinton said, shared threats such as terrorism and proliferation could foster even greater cooperation with Russia. The group heard from some pretty heavy hitters: U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, all of whom aptly acknowledged the alliance is facing a new strategic landscape with new enemies, ideologies and battle tactics that threaten its collective security.
