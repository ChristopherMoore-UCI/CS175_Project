Jointly developed by the NBPA, the scheme follows a similar program, run for several years by Kellogg and several other schools, which teach business skills to NFL stars (covered previously on Executive Education). " Rogers now hopes to devise similar programs for other pro sports players in hockey, auto racing and other fields. Illinois-based Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management has just hosted its first intake of basketball stars for a four-day executive education program covering topics including business leadership, negotiations, brand building and investing. "We realize that business education is helpful in preparing a person for a career move, especially for professional athletes," said Steve Rogers, professor of entrepreneurship at the school, who devised the syllabus, adding that the course does not "dumb anything down" for the sports stars. But now one business school hopes to help at least some of the current crop of NBA stars become as business savvy as they are athletic.
