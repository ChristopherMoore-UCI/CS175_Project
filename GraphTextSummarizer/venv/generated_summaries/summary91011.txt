Even though the White House insists that they will continue to work hard on their domestic agenda, historically, presidents who become involved in protracted ground wars find that their presidencies are defined by their military conflicts. There are modern presidents who have balanced their agendas and preserved domestic policy as an integral part of their political identity even after having sent troops to war. There have been several modern presidents who started their term with an ambitious domestic vision and who ended up with their presidencies totally consumed by war. But war sucks the political oxygen out of almost any presidency. To make matters even worse, unlike Johnson, Obama has had more trouble pushing much of his domestic agenda through Congress.
