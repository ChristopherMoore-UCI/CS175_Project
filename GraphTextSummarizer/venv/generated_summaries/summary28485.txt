Kathmandu is a city with few good stories right now, but Tanka Maya Sitoula has one of them. In the wake of the disaster, which has left at least 4,500 people dead across Nepal, Sitoula endured 36 long hours trapped in a room on the ground floor, before she was freed by an Indian rescue team. " Sitoula's husband Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. He described the rescue efforts as physically draining work -- "cutting, pushing and pulling" -- but extremely rewarding in the case of Sitoula. The prognosis is equally dire in Kathmandu's Gangabhu neighborhood, where search teams are focusing their efforts on a cluster of collapsed six-story guesthouses.
