Journalists, medical sources and other witnesses told CNN that these soldiers defected two months ago along with Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who withdrew his support from President Ali Abdullah Saleh in late March. The clashes occurred in the cities of Sanaa and Taiz on Wednesday, said Ibrahim Mothana, an activist who said he spoke to doctors. Witnesses said Yemeni security forces used live ammunition fired on protesters in Sanaa and Taiz on Wednesday. "The attack took place while we were chanting, 'One more week left for you, Saleh,'" said Sabir Ali, a protester in Taiz. Earlier, a senior security official denied that forces fired on protesters in Taiz.
