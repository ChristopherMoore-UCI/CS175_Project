It was a glass half-full, glass half-empty kind of weekend at the box office for "Funny People," writer-director Judd Apatow's comedic meditation on fame, humor, life, and death. Thanks to its debut on IMAX (and the premium ticket prices that come with it), "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" came in second with $17.7 million, a soft 40 percent drop from last weekend for $255.5 million total. Of course, "Funny People" was billed more as a thoughtful dramedy than a balls-out Sandler laugh-fest, and when matched against the opening frames for Sandler's serious efforts "Reign Over Me," "Spanglish," and "Punch-Drunk Love," Funny People is far and away the winner -- and the glass is half full again. Box office on a whole was down a massive 22 percent from last year, when The "Dark Knight" and "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor" both took in over $40 million, but the specialty market showed some vibrant signs of life. Bone fide indie hit "(500) Days of Summer" expanded to 266 theaters for $2.7 million, a $10,338 per theater average.
