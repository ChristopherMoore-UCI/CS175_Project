-- Japan's governing body of sumo wrestling announced it has fired star sumo wrestler ozeki Kotomitsuki in the wake of a gambling scandal that has enveloped the sport, according to news reports. He was found to have gambled on professional baseball, with money allegedly a source of funding for mobsters. The Japan Sumo Association on Sunday stopped short, however, of expelling them, the most severe sentence which would bar them from receiving retirement allowances, according to Kyodo News. Kotomitsuki becomes the first active "ozeki," the champion rank to which he was promoted in 2007, to be fired, Kyodo News reported. The allegations have shaken sumo wrestling, with 63 percent of people responding to a poll saying the summer tournament should be postponed, according to the national Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
