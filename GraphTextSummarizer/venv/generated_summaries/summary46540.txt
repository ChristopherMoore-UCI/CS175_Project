Brooks, her husband, Charlie Brooks, and a former personal assistant also face a separate set of charges of conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking. Former editors at the now-defunct UK tabloid News of the World, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 "to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority." The hacking scandal prompted British Prime Minister David Cameron to set up an independent inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians. The 18 names include Kate Middleton -- now Duchess of Cambridge -- royal aide Jamie Lowther Pinkteron, celebrity public relations representative Max Clifford, and actress Angelina Jolie's former stunt double, Eunice Huthart. As well as being accused of conspiring to intercept communications, Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Mulcaire face an additional charge of intercepting the voice mail messages of British schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who went missing and was later found dead in 2002.
