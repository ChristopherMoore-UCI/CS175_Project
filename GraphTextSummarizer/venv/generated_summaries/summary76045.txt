-- Inter Milan sacked coach Andrea Stramaccioni Friday and replaced him immediately with Walter Mazzarri. Stramaccioni was the latest to attempt to turn it around at the San Siro, but despite the poor results club president Massimo Moratti had kind words. "I've chosen Mazzarri, I'm sorry for Stramaccioni," he was quoted on the official Inter website. Mourinho guided Inter to the Champions League crown before joining Real Madrid but his old charges have been in decline since that triumph. He recently announced he would be leaving at the end of the season and was immediately linked with Inter, who will be appointing their sixth coach since the departure of Jose Mourinho three years ago.
