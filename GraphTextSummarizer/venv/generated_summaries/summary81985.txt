-- Two bombs hit a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in the war-torn South Kordofan region of Sudan on Monday, destroying the emergency room, pharmacy and hospital kitchen. "Our targets are not civilians," Col. Al-Sawarmi Khalid Saad, a spokesman for Sudan's armed forces, told CNN. Sudan's government has been fighting rebels in the Kordofan region. "We also had previously communicated the hospital's position to the authorities in Khartoum," he said, referring to Sudan's capital. The hospital is in the village of Farandella, where the aerial bombing injured six people, including one hospital worker, Doctors Without Borders said.
