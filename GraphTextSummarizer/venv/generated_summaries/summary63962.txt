Sutton told HLN's "Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell" Wednesday night that her purpose for filing the suit "is to be able to obtain more information about what really happened to Mitrice on that night," saying authorities have not been forthcoming with information because of the possibility of a lawsuit. At the restaurant, witnesses said Richardson was exhibiting strange behavior including "sitting down with strangers and speaking in gibberish," according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by Richardson's mother, Latice Sutton. Sutton argues in the lawsuit that the sheriff's department failure to administer psychiatric or medical evaluations and the fact that Richardson was released "alone in an unfamiliar area without money, a cellular phone or means of transportation amounts to negligence." -- The mother of a missing California woman is suing the county of Los Angeles and several sheriff's officials for wrongful death and negligence in her daughter's 2009 disappearance, court documents say. Mitrice Richardson, a 24-year-old former beauty pageant contestant, was last seen leaving a Malibu, California, sheriff's station in the early morning hours of September 17.
