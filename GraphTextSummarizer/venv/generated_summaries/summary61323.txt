Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told the committee there was a "steady flow" of girls trying to travel to Syria, perhaps one or two a month. "However, the parents were already aware from the Deputy Head that Girl 1 had been reported missing, all the teenagers were all being co-operative, they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to Syria." She has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to Syria to marry jihadis, as she did. A deputy principal at the girls' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls, on the advice of police, and told them that the girls' friend, referred to only as "Girl 1," had been reported missing. Relatives also had harsh words for police, who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to Syria in December.
