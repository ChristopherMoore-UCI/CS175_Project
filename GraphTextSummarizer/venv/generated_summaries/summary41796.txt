Echoes of the traumas that shaped contemporary America are inescapable, from a shot in opening credits that looks like Manhattan before the attacks of September 11, 2001, to questions about curtailing civil liberties in wartime. The show's legions of fans may be in mourning, but executive producer David Eick finds the looming finale bittersweet. "To the show's good fortune, the audience was in need of a vehicle for its angst and its paranoia," said Eick, who said that as a viewer, he "was much more seduced" by darker stories that "felt like a reflection of reality." "We often hear that what audiences want in troubled times is escapism and comfort food. To the extent that religion and spiritual beliefs were chief motivations for the antagonists, that had resonance with al Qaeda," Eick said.
