Michael Macagnone, whose term as editor-in-chief of The Pitt News ended Sunday, said the paper received an anonymous e-mail Friday claiming that the bomb threats plaguing the school since February 13 would end if university officials revoked a $50,000 reward for anyone who came forward with information that led to an arrest. The paper received a second e-mail Saturday, after university officials revoked the reward, saying there would be no more threats, Macagnone said. The server was operated by the European Counter Network, a provider that runs an anonymous remailer service, allowing people to send e-mails completely anonymously, according to the statement released by May First/People Link Director Jamie McClelland. -- After months of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh, an anonymous group that calls itself the Threateners has claimed responsibility for the most recent e-mail threats and announced to the school's student-run newspaper that it will stop sending them. According to a letter posted on the university's website by Senior Vice Chancellor Patricia Beeson, any buildings that receive bomb threats will be checked for explosives but evacuated only if law enforcement officials deem it necessary.
