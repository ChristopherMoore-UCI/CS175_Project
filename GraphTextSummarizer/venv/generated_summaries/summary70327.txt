Watch Armitage explain why he leaked Plame's name Â» Blitzer asked Armitage if he "simply assumed that she was not a clandestine officer of the CIA." "Well, even Mr. Novak has said that he used the word 'operative' and misused it," Armitage said. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview broadcast Sunday that he did not realize Plame was a covert agent when he discussed her with syndicated columnist Robert Novak. Wilson and Plame have accused Rove and other Bush officials of leaking her identity as a CIA officer in retaliation for her husband's emergence as an administration critic. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was a source of the CIA leak to columnist Robert Novak. Novak, a former CNN contributor, wrote the July 2003 column in which Plame was named as a CIA employee.
