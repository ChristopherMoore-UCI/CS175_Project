After he started the fitness challenge, he added healthy food to his diet, such as fruits, vegetables, fish and chicken, and he eliminated fatty foods and red meats. Before the challenge started, Smith had high blood pressure, high sugar glucose levels and did not eat well-balanced meals. Smith said everyone needs to find their own way to a healthy lifestyle and says his best advice is to "just do it," find something you like and don't procrastinate or "wait for tomorrow" like he once did. The 63-year-old epidemiologist from Jackson, Mississippi, recently dropped 58 pounds in a 12-week fitness challenge involving 200 people from the Mississippi governor's office, state legislature workers and civilians. "I look forward to spending many healthy years into the future with my grandkids, and am glad I am taking the necessary steps to do it," he said.
