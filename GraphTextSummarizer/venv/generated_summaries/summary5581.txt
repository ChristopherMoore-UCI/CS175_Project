In one of the most recent episodes, a flight departing a city in southwestern China was canceled after irate passengers opened three emergency exits following a seven-hour delay. From hurling hot water at a flight attendant to fights over crying babies, outbursts by Chinese passengers have disrupted several flights in recent weeks --  both in China and further afield. After several highly publicized and embarrassing incidents of air rage, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said last week it is considering steps to blacklist offending passengers, according to state media. James Fallows, aviation expert, journalist, and author of "China Airborne", says the flurry of angry episodes reveals growing pains in China's airline industry. Fallows says Chinese culture also plays a role in the behavior of certain Chinese air travelers.
