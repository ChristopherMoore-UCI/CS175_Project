At least 2 million tweets with hashtags related to the Turkish protests were sent in just eight hours on May 31 when protests gathered steam, a study by New York University revealed -- around 90% of them from Turkey. "I don't know when it will end, but I already feel like a robot whose main role is to click the share button on Facebook," one activist, Istanbul resident Yelin Bilgin, told CNN after days of protests. And those in Turkey like to talk on the issues -- 57% of those using social network sites say they do so to share their political views -- a far higher percentage than in many European nations, according to the Pew Research Center. Istanbul writer Arsevi Zeynep Seyran was in the western coastal city of Izmir when protests began. People from all over Turkey and beyond poured out their feelings after what some say has been a heavy-handed police response to protests in Turkey.
