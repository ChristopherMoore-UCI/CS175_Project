Back at Aleppo University, Simon tells CNN that the bombings have changed him and other young people who might have demonstrated to bring change. "The United States is appalled by the Syrian regime's deadly attack yesterday near the University of Aleppo, which reportedly killed more than 80 people and injured more than 150 people," said U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland in a written statement issued Wednesday. "I was on campus when I heard a plane over head from a distance," Simon recalled to CNN. "Just 15 guys chanting for Assad," Simon said. Simon, an Aleppo University dental student, ran to help a young woman he saw walking zombie-like and clearly injured.
