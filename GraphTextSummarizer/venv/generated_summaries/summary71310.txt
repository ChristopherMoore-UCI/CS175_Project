Weekend estimates showed "Nightcrawler," from Open Road Films, barely edging last weekend's champ, the horror flick "Ouija," Whichever film winds up on top, it'll be the lowest-grossing No. 1 movie since "Guardians of the Galaxy" topped the chart with just $10.4 million in early September in its sixth weekend in release. This weekend's other new wide release, "Before I Go To Sleep," opened outside the top 10, as expected. Even a special Halloween re-release of the original "Saw," the 2004 movie that helped spark the current horror-as-torture-porn genre, couldn't lure many fans. -- Halloween weekend appears to have scared off the major movie studios: none of them released a new film, perhaps figuring folks were more interested in parties and trick-or-treating. Both of those low-grossing number ones occurred on the weekend after Labor Day, traditionally one of the poorest box office weekends of the year.
