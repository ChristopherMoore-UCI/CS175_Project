-- Juanita Castro Ruz, sister of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Cuban President Raul Castro, is undergoing radiation treatment in Miami, Florida, for lung cancer, her spokeswoman told CNN. Castro underwent surgery more than a month ago in a Miami hospital to remove a tumor in her lung, her biographer and spokesperson, journalist Maria Antonieta Collins, said. The notoriously private Castro decided to go public about her condition unlike her ailing brother Fidel Castro. Raul Castro formally took over as President in 2008. " Castro released an autobiography last year titled "My Brothers Fidel and Raul, the Secret History."
