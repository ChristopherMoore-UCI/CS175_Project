Kuti recently told a reporter for All Africa Global Media that the Shrine was a place of worship where people can honor "great black people, who fought for the emancipation of Africa through music." Kuti's nightclub in Lagos, the New Afrika Shrine, had become a Mecca for West African music and creative expression, until it was closed by the authorities earlier in the summer. -- Energetic, infectious and combative, the music of Nigerian musician Femi Kuti has moved audiences around the world. Kuti was signed to Motown Records in 1994 and his music blends Afrobeat with more current soul, R&B and jazz. Freeing the "Shrine" from being under lock and key is just one of his crusading missions, as with his band, The Positive Force, Kuti remains outspoken about Nigeria, corruption and the positive changes that Africa can achieve.
