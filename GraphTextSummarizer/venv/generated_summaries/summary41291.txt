The bomb was planted on a road near the village of Dara Bazar in the Bajaur Agency, one of the seven districts that make up Pakistan's tribal region, said Islam Zeb, a senior administrator in the district. Earlier, a bomb blast killed two people and wounded three in northwest Pakistan's tribal region, a senior Pakistani government official said. A car bomb outside the home of a former lawmaker killed 10 and wounded 30 in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said Nazir Kurt, a senior police official there. -- Explosions near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan killed a dozen people Friday, authorities said. The bomb was remotely detonated, Zeb said.
