At a news conference Sunday, Mexican Attorney General Jes√∫s Murillo Karam confirmed that Alexander Mora's remains had been found. In all, at least 80 people have been arrested in the disappearances and the deaths, and the governor of Guerrero has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent Latin American history. Alexander Mora Venancio, the youngest of eight siblings, was one of 43 students from a rural teacher's college in Mexico's Guerrero state who went missing on September 26. Families of the missing students have said for weeks that they don't accept the official version and demand proof of what happened. Federal authorities say they heard confessions from drug traffickers indicating that the college students were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor and then delivered to the drug gang to be murdered.
