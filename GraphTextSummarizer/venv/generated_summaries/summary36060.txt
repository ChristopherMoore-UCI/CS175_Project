A federal judge in the southernmost province of Tierra del Fuego, which under Argentine law claims jurisdiction over the Falkland Islands, recently ruled that the officers were responsible for crimes against humanity and human rights abuses. Argentine conscripts who fought against the British that year during the Falklands War. The case is the biggest, but not the first that has levied accusations of human rights abuses against conscripts who fought in the Falklands War. A contentious point of the national debate is whether to prosecute former military officers. Interesting, because it is a new look at the horrors that everyone knew Argentinean soldiers suffered, not at the hands of the British, but at the hands of their superiors.
