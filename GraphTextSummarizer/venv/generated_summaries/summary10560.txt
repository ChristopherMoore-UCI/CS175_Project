"We're hoping someone will see that footage and help us with a lead," said Key West Police spokeswoman Alyson Crean. The bar was recovered by treasure hunter Mel Fisher and his crew in 1980 from the shipwreck of the Santa Margarita, which sank 25 miles west of Key West. For 25 years, visitors to the museum in Key West, Florida, had the opportunity to lift the glittery piece of treasure in a special display case. -- It's been nearly a week since two modern-day pirates walked into the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida, and made off with a $550,000 gold bar. Key West Police and the FBI have been working around the clock to solve the mystery, Kendrick said Tuesday.
