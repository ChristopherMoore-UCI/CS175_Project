Joseph Naso, 77, was arrested Monday by Marin County, California, detectives following his release from the El Dorado County jail, also in California, where he had been in custody over the past year on unrelated charges, Marin County District Attorney Ed Berberian told reporters. Naso is charged in the 1977 murder of Roxene Roggash in Marin County; Pamela Parsons and Tracy Tofoya of Yuba County, California, whose bodies were found in 1993 and 1994, respectively; and the death of Carmen Colon in Contra Costa County, California, whose body was found in 1978, Berberian said. He said Marin County has agreed to prosecute Naso for all four murders. He was being held without bail in the Marin County Jail on Tuesday, Berberian said. Naso spent a year in the El Dorado County Jail for the violation and was arrested upon his departure Monday, KGO said.
