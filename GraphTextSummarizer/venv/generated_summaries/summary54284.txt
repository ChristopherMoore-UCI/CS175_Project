"If you look at the big races, there are not many horses who win them without good names," British racing commentator Cornelius Lysaght said. It's not a playground tongue twister, but a legitimate list of horse names, announced at speed by racing commentators adept at wrapping their lips around some of the most difficult -- and ridiculous -- titles on the planet. But that still hasn't stopped horse names having an effect on punters' betting habits. So why are many horse names downright weird? Silly horse names are as much a part of the racing experience as ladies in hats or laying a bet.
