-- The paparazzi pursuit of Justin Bieber along Los Angeles freeways is a "tragedy waiting to happen," a Los Angeles city councilman warned. Bieber, sounding frustrated, called 911 for help after he resumed his drive toward downtown Los Angeles, complaining that the same cars were chasing him again. When she asked him if he wanted a highway patrol unit to intervene and stop the cars from following him, he said, "I would love that." When a patrol car caught up with Bieber in downtown Los Angeles 15 minutes later, he filed a complaint which prompted a police investigation to see if any photographers will be charged with breaking California's paparazzi law, Harris said. "He was coming up behind me, making abrupt lane changes, not giving signals, cutting off cars." Four or five other cars followed close behind, apparently carrying photographers stalking Bieber, he said. "They're being very dangerous, swerving around other cars trying to get to me," Bieber told the dispatcher.
