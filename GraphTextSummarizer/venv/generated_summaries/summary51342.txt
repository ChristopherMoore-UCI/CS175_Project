-- Chris Meek put his motorcycle in storage in Wilmington, North Carolina, to protect it from Hurricane Earl as the Category 4 hurricane headed toward the North Carolina coast. About 175 miles away, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Sarah Baker was bracing Thursday for her first hurricane. But that's not stopping Jason Bays, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, from making a planned trip to visit friends in North Carolina. "Where we were going is actually a beach condo they own" in Jacksonville, North Carolina, said Bays, 38. "It's a scary thing." Rusty Mace of Beaufort, North Carolina, said all he saw at one point Thursday were "sprinkles," a dark gray sky, and tides perking up -- but not lightning and thunder.
