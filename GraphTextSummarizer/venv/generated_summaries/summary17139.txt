Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba "lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri." News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. Suspected Boko Haram gunmen shot dead and slit the throats of 68 people -- including children -- in an attack on a village in Nigeria's Borno state, according to survivors and vigilante sources. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group.
