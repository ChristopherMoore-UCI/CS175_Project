-- Liverpool won the first heavyweight clash of the English Premier League season as an Aaron Ramsey own goal and a late strike from substitute Luis Suarez gave Kenny Dalglish's men a 2-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium Saturday. The opener after 78 minutes owed much to good fortune as Uruguay international Suarez was attempting to flick the ball back and it cannoned off the young Welsh international Ramsey and into the net. Moments before, Arsenal had been reduced to 10 men as Emmanuel Frimpong was shown red for a second yellow card, the second dismissal of the campaign for Arsene Wenger's men with Gervinho going in the 0-0 draw at Newcastle last week. Swansea and Wigan were goalless in the first English Premier League game to be played in Wales. Liverpool striker Andy Carroll had a shot that glanced the woodwork, while Stewart Downing tested home keeper Wojciech Szczesny.
