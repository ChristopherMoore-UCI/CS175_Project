Hearses may be synonymous with funerals, but minivans and sport utility vehicles often transport bodies, too, said Jessica A. Koth, public relations manager for the National Funeral Directors Association. The police waived the towing fee, $185, to expedite the vehicle's release, said Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of public information for the police. Calls and e-mails Friday about the towing to funeral director Paul DeNigris yielded no response. "Shouldn't he or someone from the funeral home staff have stayed with the body?" Randy McCullough, deputy director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, said the state has no rule in place that requires signage to indicate a funeral van. The van, parked outside Redden's Funeral Home on West 14th Street, was to transport the body to Newark for a flight.
