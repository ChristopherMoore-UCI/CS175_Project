DFW, where American operates 85% of daily flights, used buses to help get passengers off planes because gates were full of aircraft that had not departed, spokesman David MagaÃ±a said. -- American Airlines grounded flights nationwide on Tuesday due to problems over several hours with its computerized reservation system. The decision also resulted its regional affiliate, American Eagle, holding flights at Dallas Ft. Worth, Chicago's O'Hare and New York LaGuardia -- all major airports for the carrier's domestic operations. The carrier said in a statement that it saw "no evidence" that the technical outage was in any way related to Monday's deadly bombing in Boston that is under investigation as an act of terrorism. The glitch caused big delays and flight cancellations for the company, which sought court approval on Monday to exit bankruptcy.
