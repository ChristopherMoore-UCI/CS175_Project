Officials familiar with the after-action review said Taliban fighters got within grenade-throwing distance of U.S. troops. Despite the heavy U.S. death toll, Myer was awarded the Silver Star for calling in aircraft to beat back the fighters, some of whom had breached the base walls, according to U.S. military officials in Afghanistan. Myer was informed this week of his punishment, according to U.S. military officials. -- A U.S. Army officer who was honored for valor after his combat outpost in Afghanistan was attacked has also received a letter of reprimand for failing to secure the base before the attack, according to Army officials. The attack, near the village of Wanat, is still the deadliest ground combat of the war involving U.S. troops.
