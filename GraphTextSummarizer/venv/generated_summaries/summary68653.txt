" Related: CIA feared for future of interrogation program, report shows Information on what was altered or obscured in the 499-page executive summary at the UK government's request wasn't immediately available. The British government asked the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee to redact small parts of the panel's report that criticized the CIA's harsh interrogation program, a representative for Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday. "None of these redactions related to allegations of UK involvement in detainee mistreatment. "The U.S. gave our agencies limited sight of some sections of the executive summary before its publication," Cameron's representative said about the report on the CIA program, which critics call torture. The comment came in response to a question from CNN about whether the UK government had seen the report on the CIA's enhanced interrogation program before it was released to the public this week, and whether London had asked for redactions or changes.
