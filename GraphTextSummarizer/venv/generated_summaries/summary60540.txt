"I went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion," Ginsburg said in the book "Stars of David: Prominent Jews talk About Being Jewish" by author Abigail Pogrebin. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg attended Red Masses in the past, but has said she grew tired of being lectured by Catholic officials. Sunday's attendees included Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood and White House Chief of Staff William Daley. -- A half dozen Supreme Court justices, hundreds of members of the legal profession and other dignitaries attended the annual Red Mass in Washington Sunday to hear a call for them to pay attention to their spiritual health. The purpose of the Red Mass -- so named because of the color of the garments worn by clergy -- is to "invoke God's blessings on those responsible for the administration of justice as well as on all public officials," according to the John Carroll Society, a lay Catholic group of prominent lawyers and professionals, which started the Mass in 1953.
