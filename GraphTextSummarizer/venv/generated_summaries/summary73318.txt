The mass arrests were part of a crackdown on a scam through which $28 million of public funds were paid out for Social Security benefits, according to the police statement. A total of 8,400 people were registered on Social Security rolls as part of the scam, and in 2,100 cases, they received some form of government payout. "Among those arrested are 30 managers of the fake companies who, without any real business activity, registered people for Social Security to illicitly obtain benefits, or to obtain residency or working permits for foreign citizens," the police statement said. The investigation uncovered 4,000 crimes of document and other fraud linked to the payments from public funds. The Labor Ministry press office said the 8,400 people falsely added to social security rolls were recorded as part of the government's employment statistics.
