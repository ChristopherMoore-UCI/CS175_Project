"The government of Pakistan believes drone strikes are against international law and the sovereignty of Pakistan," Chaudhry told CNN. More broadly, Amnesty warned that the American government may be setting a troubling standard in its use of drones that other countries could follow. Adding to the pressure, Human Rights Watch also released a report on U.S. drone attacks Tuesday -- this one focusing on Yemen. Letta Taylor, a senior counterterrorism researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the group found at least two clear cases of violations of international laws of war, but those did not reach war crimes status. "Amnesty International is seriously concerned that these and other strikes have resulted in unlawful killings that may constitute extrajudicial executions or war crimes," the report said.
