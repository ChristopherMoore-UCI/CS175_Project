Yeast cells, human cells, plant and animal cells have in common that they are "eukaryotes" -- cells with a nucleus wrapped in membrane. Although Boeke studies human genetics, too, he is not planning to design a set of synthetic human chromosomes. The kind of cell Boeke used? Scientists have built a designer chromosome and inserted it into a cell, geneticist Jef Boeke from New York University announced this week. It also reproduced, and subsequent cells carried the new chromosome forward.
