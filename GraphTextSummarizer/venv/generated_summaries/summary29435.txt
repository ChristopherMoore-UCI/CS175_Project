Read more: Child pornography ushers Internet censorship into Australia Halla Gunnarsdottir, an adviser to the interior minister, told the UK's Guardian newspaper that the government's goal is not censoring sex but restricting access to violent pornography. Research has shown that children in Iceland are on average 11 years old when they're first exposed to pornography, she said, with some traumatized by it and others later seeking to re-enact violent acts they have seen. The letter was coordinated and published online Thursday by the International Modern Media Institute, an Icelandic civil society think tank headed by lawmaker and ex-Wikileaks spokeswoman Birgitta Jonsdottir. The government's plans include tightening the current legal definition of pornography to differentiate between sex and violent or degrading material, she told the newspaper. It claims the proposal has "already jeopardized longstanding efforts to prevent or abolish censorship in totalitarian regimes and protect civil liberties and human rights worldwide."
