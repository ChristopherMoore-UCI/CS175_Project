Most guys want to have sex all the time. True, your ex probably said the same thing to his new girlfriend, but you might want to keep an eye on the man whose history includes a long string of relationships with women who are totally temperamental, out of their gourds, or recently released from the state mental hospital. This one never, ever ends well. Relationships are not like a Lego set: created to be dismantled and put back together again. "Breaks" are what guys who are too weak, scared, or lame suggest because they're too much of a you-know-what to go ahead and break up with you.
