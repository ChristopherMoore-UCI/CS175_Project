In Saturday's other English Premier League fixtures, Everton kept up their push for a Champions League place next season with a 2-0 over Queens Park Rangers. The win takes Arsenal above London rivals Chelsea -- who play Manchester City in the FA Cup semifinal at Wembley on Sunday -- and Tottenham Hotspur. Aston Villa remain in 16th place after 1-1 draw against Fulham, while mid-table West Ham United and Southampton also played out a 1-1 draw. The win leaves them three points behind fifth place Spurs (58 points) and five points clear of Merseyside rivals Liverpool who played out a goalless draw at Reading -- a result which helps neither side. -- Arsenal scored three late goals to beat Norwich City 3-1 at the Emirates on Saturday and move up to third in the English Premier League.
