Frolander faces a charge of sexual battery of a child and was in the Volusia County Jail late Friday. The father, who sounds collected but enraged during the 911 call, told Volusia County emergency dispatch that 18-year-old Raymond Frolander was close to the family and was in the apartment while the father was out. " When Daytona Beach police officers arrived, according to the charging affidavit, they saw Frolander "laying motionless on the living room floor with several knots on his face and bleeding from his mouth." The father says Frolander's pants fell down to his ankles "and nothing else needed to be said" when he saw exposed genitals. It also says Frolander told police, "I'm guilty." When the 911 dispatcher asked the father whether he used weapons to knock out Frolander, the father told the dispatcher, "my fist and my foot."
