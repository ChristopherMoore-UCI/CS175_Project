So said Hollywood star and U.N. special envoy for refugees Angelina Jolie, standing with foreign ministers from the G8 nations in London as they pledged action Thursday to end sexual violence in conflict. The agreement followed a meeting with the U.N. envoy on sexual violence in conflict, Zainab Bangura. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the plans would help end "the horrific use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war in conflicts around the globe." Under the declaration, the G8 nations agreed to draw up protocols on international standards for the investigation of rape and sexual violence and ensuring access to justice for survivors. Rape and serious sexual violence in conflict are grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, as well as being war crimes, Hague said.
