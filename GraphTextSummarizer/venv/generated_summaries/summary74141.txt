Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past. Harris was supposed to pick up the guns after meeting the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta. However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said Sunday he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that "a number of people" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns."
