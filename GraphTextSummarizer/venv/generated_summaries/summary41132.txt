-- Clashes intensified Wednesday in Egypt's North Sinai as Egyptian forces launched aerial strikes on militants in response to a series of attacks by masked gunmen on military checkpoints. The violence, which comes days after another attack in Sinai, is a foreign policy test for Egypt's new government and its president, Mohamed Morsy, a former longtime leader in the Muslim Brotherhood's political movement, over its relations with Israel. Egyptian army Apache helicopters fired rockets at armed militants, and there were numerous casualties, said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of North Sinai security. The paper said that, in light of the Sunday attack, Egypt should make improvements in its Sinai presence and realize that the United States sees Sinai "as an essential aspect of Egyptian-Israeli peace."
