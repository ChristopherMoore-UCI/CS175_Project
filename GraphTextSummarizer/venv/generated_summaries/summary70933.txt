Here's what to look forward to during Tuesday's matches at the World Cup: Hulk hurts Against Croatia, Brazilian midfielder Hulk was replaced in the second half by Bernard. That match was also the teams' second group match and it was also played in mid-June. After Brazil and Mexico scrap, Russia meets South Korea in the other Group H match. But Russia is missing injured captain Roman Shirokov and the weather will be much warmer than what their players -- all of whom play domestically -- are used to for game conditions. In 2012, a Belgian newspaper totaled the transfer fees and estimated Belgium's top 11 players were third in the world in such payments.
