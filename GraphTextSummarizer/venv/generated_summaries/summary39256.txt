As of 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, Katia was about 335 miles (540 kilometers) south-southwest of Bermuda, packing maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph), according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. -- Hurricane Katia weakened to a Category 2 storm Tuesday as it churned in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters said. We are becoming more confident of that," said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center. Some fluctuations in Katia's strength are expected through Wednesday, followed by gradual weakening, forecasters said. Besides the U.S. East Coast, the swells are expected to affect Bermuda and the Greater Antilles, along with eastern Bahamas beaches, the hurricane center said.
