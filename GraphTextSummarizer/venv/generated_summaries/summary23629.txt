After crossing the bridge, Kroell, London and the Clementis met with about 75 other supporters at Fort Tryon Park to tie purple ribbons -- a symbol for anti-gay bullying awareness -- around the trunk and branches of a tree in remembrance of Tyler and other victims of bullying who have committed suicide. Having been victims of bullying themselves, Kroell and London said they co-founded the Friend Movement to promote positive anti-bullying messages through art and media, in the wake of an increasing number of adolescent suicides committed because of bullying. The event was organized by Friend Movement co-founders Ronnie Kroell and Elliot London. They were inspired by Clementi's death and decided to spend 37 days walking from city to city, having conversations with communities and sharing stories about friendships and bullying, London said. Kroell, 30, and London, 32, worked with The Tyler Clementi Foundation on this Friend Movement project but without any intentions of having the Clementis participating, according to London.
