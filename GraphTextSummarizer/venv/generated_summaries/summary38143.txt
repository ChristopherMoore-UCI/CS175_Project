Now that the identity of "Jihadi John" is known to be Emwazi, it is vitally important that we ensure that we don't allow the brand to achieve its objective -- to instil fear within Western audiences, advancing ISIS propaganda, and dulling civil society's willingness to challenge extremism out of fear. Last week the focus was east London, where the three teenagers from Bethnal Green were tempted by ISIS, and west London now, as it emerged that Emwazi had lived in Ladbroke Grove. Since then, as a direct consequence of the copious media attention dedicated to Jihadi John, the image of the masked figure has become ubiquitous and inescapable, allowing for a potent propaganda tool for ISIS, also known as Islamic State. This characteristic isn't only shared by top-ranking officials within jihadist organizations, but is common amongst those leaving from the UK who seek to fulfil lesser roles within the new so-called "Islamic State." Following the brutal killing of James Foley in August 2014, the masked face of "Jihadi John" first gained prominence across our TV screens, newspapers, and social media feeds.
