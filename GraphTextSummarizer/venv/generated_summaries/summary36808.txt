"To track and see people moving from space is 100% unique," said UrtheCast president Scott Larson. -- A new window on your life may soon be opened from space -- in high quality video and in almost real-time. The issue of privacy may worry some -- knowing that they can be filmed from space -- but Larson argues that many of us are already closely monitored by CCTV and can be tracked by the signals from our cell phones. But he said those who choose to pay for a subscription will have access to higher quality raw imagery from which they can glean detailed information. The resolution might not be clear enough to pick out individual faces but if the simulation footage proves accurate then a video camera soon to be attached to the International Space Station (ISS) will be able to show high definition movies capable of detailing your car moving on the highway.
