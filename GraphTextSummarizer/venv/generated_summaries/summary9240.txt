"Today, we do not do a full-body pat down that goes into the sensitive parts of the body where that [Christmas Day bomb] was secreted," Rossides said. The acting head of the Transportation Security Administration gingerly answered questions Thursday about whether new full-body imaging machines will detect concealed explosives like that allegedly placed in the underwear of the Christmas Day bomber. Rossides testified that the full-body imagers -- which see through clothes, producing a ghostly image of a traveler's body -- will not reveal objects hidden in body cavities. The agency has spent years testing whole body imagers. Travelers who decline the scans are funneled to a location where they may be given a pat-down and subjected to other tests, such as swabs that can detect minute traces of explosives on hands or luggage.
