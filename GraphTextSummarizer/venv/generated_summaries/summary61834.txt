"With few exceptions, governments have failed to recognize that everything has changed," said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa. -- Unless governments in the Middle East stop offering "cosmetic changes" to calls for reform, they should brace themselves for another year of protests, Amnesty International warned Monday. Amnesty warned that some governments "remained grimly determined to cling onto power" at all costs, citing an example of Syria. The 80-page report is called "Year of Rebellion: State of Human Rights in the Middle East and North Africa." The uprisings continue in a series of other nations, including Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad is trying to cling to power amid monthslong protests.
