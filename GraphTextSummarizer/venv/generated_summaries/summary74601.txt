Suha Abu Khdeir, the late teenager's mother, noted that he would have graduated from high school next year. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the Jerusalem Post the teen had significant burn marks. Three people in a car came upon the 16-year-old as Abu Khdeir walked between his home and mosque around 4 a.m. Abu Khdeir hadn't fully made his mark on the world. The Palestinian state news agency WAFA blamed the kidnapping and killing on "settlers," saying Abu Khdeir's body "was charred and bore signs of violence."
