On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jim Yong Kim told CNN's Richard Quest that the situation was a "humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, and right now we are not responding effectively." "In Lebanon now a quarter of the population are refugees," said Kim. Kim said the response to the crisis had failed due to a lack of funds, but also due to a lack of leadership and concerted effort. (Lebanon is) going to lose $7.5 billion in terms of GDP growth. "People are now understanding that education is going to determine the competitive abilities of a country into the future, but still many finance ministers are looking at the short term. The UNHCR says more than 2 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, with most taking refuge in the neighboring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq.
