"The importance of the attorney-client privilege cannot be overstated," the judge said Pellicano represented himself in both trials, which included testimony from MGM mogul Kerkorian and comedian Garry Shandling, as well as 34 recordings Pellicano made with attorney Christensen. A threat to a reporter launched an investigation that brought down celebrity shamus Anthony Pellicano. Pellicano and high-profile entertainment lawyer Terry Christiansen also were convicted in August of conspiring to wiretap the private conversations of billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's former wife, Lisa Bonder Kerkorian. In court, Busch propped a crutch against the back row of courtroom seats and limped forward to tell the judge how Pellicano's actions had harmed her. The sentence for Anthony Pellicano was close to the 16 years sought by federal prosecutors.
