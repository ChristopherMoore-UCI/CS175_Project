But now, Google is bringing some good old fashioned handwriting back to modern communication, adding new handwriting input tools to Gmail and Google Docs. The input box will show the most likely matches for your word, so below your handwritten "cats" it might display this list of possible words: cats, rats, Cats, oats, and carts. Select the box that says "Enable input tools" and you'll get a list of every type of keyboard Google has to offer. Gmail users can get the new tool in more than 50 languages, Google Docs users in more than 20. "Handwriting input makes the internet easier to use by people worldwide and is also part of a larger effort to break the barrier between languages," said Google's Xiangye Xia in a blog post announcing the feature.
