The initiative is supported by both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. I don't think so, because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the West Bank," Kerry told the crowd, which included Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres. He has spent more time on this issue than any other, is in almost daily contact with Netanyahu and speaks with Abbas several times a week. -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined Sunday a $4 billion economic development plan for the West Bank that he hopes will help encourage peace in the region. Experts believe the plan could increase the Palestinian GDP by as much s 50% over three years and cut unemployment to 8% from 21%, Kerry said.
