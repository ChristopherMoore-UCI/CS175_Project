Maria Sharapova boosted her hopes of winning a first French Open title next month by beating last year's runner-up Samantha Stosur in the final of the Rome Masters on Sunday. " The 24-year-old has won three of the four grand slams, but this year could be her best chance to succeed at Roland Garros with the Williams sisters Serena and Venus not playing, Justine Henin retired and Kim Clijsters recovering from injury. It was the former world No. 1's first title since winning a minor event in Strasbourg a year ago, and her first in a top-level clay tournament. Sharapova, seeded seventh, followed up her semifinal win over current top-ranked woman Caroline Wozniacki as she beat the Australian for the eighth consecutive time in their first encounter on the red dirt. However, Stosur made a poor start against Sharapova as she won only one of the first 15 points and quickly found herself 4-0 down.
