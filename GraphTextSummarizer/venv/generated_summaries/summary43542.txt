So I'm a little concerned to see (via Techdirt) that a California judge just ruled using a mobile phone to fiddle with a mapping/GPS program qualifies as distracted driving (thus rendering it illegal per state law). And yet Michigan's own distracted driving laws stipulate the following: "Reading, typing, or sending text message on wireless 2-way communication device prohibited; use of hand-held mobile telephone prohibited; applicability of subsections (1) and (2); exceptions; violation as civil infraction; fine; local ordinances superseded. Really, most things we do in life count as distractions. Do we need OS-level standards in our mobile computing devices that help govern how we use them in moving vehicles (specifically while driving)? I'm not sure what the answer ought to be, but state legislatures need to tread very carefully and, to the extent this stuff does warrant legislation, propose laws rooted firmly in the actual research, not some legislator's unstudied opinions (like this amendment recently introduced by West Virginia to ban a product that's not even available yet).
