-- A woman described as a "struggling actress" filed a sex harassment lawsuit against actor David Boreanaz Thursday, claiming he made unwanted sexual advances while offering her a role on his TV series "Bones." Kristina Hagan's suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, said she was working as an extra in an episode of the crime drama in August 2009 when Boreanaz approached her and said he had "the ability to make things happen for her." The harassment also involved cell phone text messages from Boreanaz to Hagan, including one with a photo of the actor's genitals attached, the suit said. Allred said she also represents another woman who has filed a charge of sexual harassment in employment against Boreanaz. The lawsuit described several instances in which Hagan alleged Boreanaz tried to grope and kiss her. "She is informed and believes that he has used his 'star power' and position to entice women who have a desire to act on the show 'Bones' by promising or implying that he could get them work on the show and then using their vulnerability to obtain sexual favors from them," Hagan's suit said.
