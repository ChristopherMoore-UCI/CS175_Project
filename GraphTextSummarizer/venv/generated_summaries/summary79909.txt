The day after Benghazi suspect Ahmed Abu Khatallah appeared in United States federal court in Washington, top Republicans in Congress continue to question the strategy to try him in the U.S. court system. The President has resisted such calls and defends his decision, pointing to the prosecution of numerous other foreign terrorists that have been successfully tried and found guilty in U.S. courts. Rep. Peter King, member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on ABC's "This Week" that "Syria is our biggest threat right now." McCaul said ISIS is "the number one national security threat since 9/11." U.S. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, on CBS News' "Face the Nation," called ISIS the "richest, most powerful and most savage group of terrorists in the history of mankind. Controversy swirls over handling of Benghazi suspect Abu Khatallah Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that Abu Khatallah's prosecution in U.S. courts prevents authorities from getting necessary information about the Benghazi attack on a U.S. compound that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, in 2012.
