Limited government also means effective government. The facts are clear: Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25% for domestic government agencies, an 84% increase when you include the failed stimulus. They have to do with the importance of limited government and with the blessing of self-government. We believe, as our founders did, that the pursuit of happiness depends on individual liberty, and individual liberty requires limited government. We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper.
