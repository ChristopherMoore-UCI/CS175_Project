Parents who worry about their kids eating Halloween candy could try the Halloween Fairy method, also called the Switch Witch or Great Pumpkin. If your child has food allergies, be sure to read candy wrappers. "When kids come home after a night of trick or treating and dump their bag of candy, be sure that your pets are safely away in another room away from your kid's loot," DeHaven said. If you are counting calories as you snack, sugar candies tend to be lower in calories than chocolate. Mentally prepare them not to snack while they're walking, and don't be one of those parents who drives them from door to door.
