How foreign fighters are swelling ISIS ranks Allen is certainly familiar with the rocky terrain he is about to enter having been one of the top commanders in western Iraq during the "Sunni Awakening," a program that worked to turn Sunni tribes in Anbar province against the al Qaeda affiliate then operating in Iraq. The militant organization now swallowing portions of both Syria and Iraq that President Barack Obama has vowed to destroy is the successor to what was once that al Qaeda group. Before his command in Afghanistan, Allen was deputy commander at U.S. Central Command, which oversees all military operations in the Middle East. Obama tapped him in 2011 to take command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- the NATO-led coalition of military forces in that country -- after Obama nominated Gen. David Petraeus, then that coalition's commander, to become director of the CIA. Obama's strategy: Kill ISIS before they kill us Allen graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1976, and has racked up a long and distinguished list of accomplishments both on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq as well as an attempted role as peacemaker to one of the longest and most intractable conflicts in the Middle East.
