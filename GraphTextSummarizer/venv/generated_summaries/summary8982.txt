In the French capital of Paris, one mayoral candidate has raised the possibility of sprucing up a station that has lain idle since 1939 with elaborate swimming pools, nightclubs and art installations. In total, there are 16 disused metro stations beneath the streets of Paris with most closed between the 1930s and 1970s. Alongside the aquatic and artistic options, which have been created by the Paris-based firms Oxo architectes and LaisnÃ© Architecte, the mock-ups also include images of the station being converted into a theater and a restaurant.

This could mean that taking a dip at the Arsenal metro swimming pool or snaffling a bite to eat in its subterranean restaurant may be a while in coming.
