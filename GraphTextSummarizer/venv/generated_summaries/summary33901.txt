Last month, FARC admitted to capturing U.S. soldier Kevin Scott Sutay after he entered Colombia. The leftist FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has been at war with the government since the 1960s, making it the longest-running insurgency in Latin America. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to FARC, but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. The Colombian military lost 13 members Saturday to an attack by FARC rebels, the country's army said in a statement. Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon criticized the apparent kidnapping and called for his immediate release.
