In the summer, a football-themed "World Cup edition" celebrated this year's tournament in Brazil and collaborations with basketball trick shot specialists "The Legendary Shots" and pro golfer and model Blair O'Neal have widened their appeal. French golf professional, Romain Bechu's incredible ball-juggling skills has received over half-a-million views on YouTube and British trick shot specialist David Edwards has performed his routine at dozens of pro events including the Open Championship and the Ryder Cup. Both brothers are qualified professionals and started filming trick shots as a hobby earlier this year, but it has quickly grown into a mini-industry after racking up tens of thousands of clicks on their website and YouTube. From casually shooting hoops with a wedge to smashing shots from mid-air in the dark, the siblings are hoping to show off golf in a new light and attract a younger generation of players back to the sport. "We love golf, but most people think it's kind of boring," George Bryan told CNN.
