One of the lawmakers said Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, has been pushing the idea privately for several weeks. Speaking in New York, Sen. Hillary Clinton, congratulated Obama for his campaign, but she did not concede the race nor discuss the possibility of running as vice president. Clinton said she would meet with supporters and party leaders in the coming days to determine her next steps. In what he called a "defining moment for our nation," Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday became the first African-American to head the ticket of a major political party. Two New York lawmakers also told CNN on Tuesday that during a conference call Clinton expressed willingness to serve as Obama's running mate in November.
