Through its success, 31 Bits has been able to hire more women and launch programs for its Ugandan employees that include English lessons, health education, and business development programs. Together with the Knock Foundation, stone + cloth supports education programs, including tuition assistance, school meals, and school supplies -- the learning essentials. Programs provide participants the skills they need to support their families and communities, allowing the company "to empower women to be self-sufficient." More than 100 Ugandan women now participate in 31 Bits programs, and the company reports it has raised more than $500,000 for women it employs through product sales. From backpacks that provide an education to jewelry that empowers women to crocheted goods that help people rise out of poverty, here are three socially conscious companies that are trying to change the world with their products.
