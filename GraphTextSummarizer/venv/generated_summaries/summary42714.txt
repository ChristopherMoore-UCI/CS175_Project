Both parties in Congress agree on the need to slow the increase in health care costs while ensuring that all Americans can get health insurance, but they differ sharply on how to proceed. "This is a significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform, one that will make the difference in the lives of many older Americans," Obama said at the White House. The deal will be part of an $80 billion reduction in Medicare drug costs for senior citizens over the next 10 years, according to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Montana, who helped negotiate the agreement. -- President Obama on Monday strongly praised a decision by the nation's pharmaceutical industry to agree to a deal cutting drug costs for elderly Americans, calling it an example of the kind of compromise required for successful national health care reform. "I think that represents progress and important steps towards real reform." Overhauling health care is a top priority of Obama's administration, but the initial proposals to reach Congress last week received a rocky reception.
