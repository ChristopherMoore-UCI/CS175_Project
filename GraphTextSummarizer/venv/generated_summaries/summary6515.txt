And fittingly, given that 2013's event will be the 50th Paris Airshow, there will be some looking back: homegrown French plane manufacturer Dassault will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its Mystere 20 business jet -- the first of which will be on display at Le Bourget. Both companies have warned the planes will be too busy carrying out flight tests to attend -- but industry experts say there's an outside chance they may still be spotted in the skies above Paris. " With or without the C-Series and the A350, there will be plenty to look at, with flying displays, aerial acrobatics and all manner of military and commercial hardware ranged around the airfield for visitors to get up close to. "We're still waiting to find out whether the A350 will put in an appearance," said Murdo Morrison, editor of aerospace industry magazine Flight International. The A-listers of global aviation will be at Le Bourget from June 17 to 23 for the 50th Paris Airshow -- the biggest and most important event in the industry's calendar, where billion-dollar deals are done at the edge of the runway as stunt pilots swoop through the skies overhead.
