"We do mineral body wraps that take off inches and we guarantee people will lose 6 to 20 inches on the first wrap or the next one is free," says Julie Tracey, co-owner of Atlanta's Suddenly Slimmer salon. Aside from inches gone, body wraps claim to help with issues such as cellulite, skin tone and body shaping. The basic concept is simple: loss by bondage, or body wraps. Around for decades, body wraps were first made popular by Hollywood stars but have since become available to lesser-known mortals. Mineral body wraps are supposed to help you lose weight, but doctors are skeptical.
