The Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Arregui worked at various San Viator order schools in Spain from 1979 through 2007, and that in addition to physical education, he taught language. The suspect taught at various San Viator schools, including one in Madrid and another in the town of Basauri, in Spain's northern Basque region. Arregui, who is in his early 50s, was a physical education teacher in Spain and allegedly placed hidden cameras in gyms and bathrooms to film sexual abuse of the students, Jara told CNN+, a 24-hour Spanish language news channel based in Madrid. "The alleged events happened here, in Spain," a Spanish Civil Guard spokesman in Madrid told CNN. The Civil Guard spokesman said the small number of complaints from alleged victims had gone to police, not necessarily to church officials.
