Politicians and commentators routinely invoke the Great Depression and other historical events to describe today's economic crisis. That's the event that Scott Reynolds Nelson cites when asked to give an historical perspective on today's sputtering economy. " David George, a professor of economics at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, says the federal government better protects ordinary people from financial ruin today than during the first stages of the Great Depression. Now we're down to fiscal policy." Nelson, the historian who has studied the panic of 1873, says today's economy might even be worse than the American economy in 1873. His ultimate assessment of today's economy is blunt: "It looks grim."
