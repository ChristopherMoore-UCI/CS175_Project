None of the missing had been spotted by Thursday afternoon, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Levi Read told CNN. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 Hercules aircraft searched a 300-square-mile area near Isla San Luis Thursday. "With the warm weather conditions, we believe the missing family members may be able to survive for additional days at sea or on one of the many islands in the region," the lawmakers wrote in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Robert Papp. Han said relatives have urged U.S. authorities to play a greater role, and have been getting the word out about the situation online at findourfathers.blogspot.com. The search has been extended indefinitely, Mexican officials said Thursday.
