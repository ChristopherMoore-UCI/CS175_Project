The disturbing fact is that we've known how to deliver safe water and basic sanitation to people for more than 100 years. We saw a world in which basic needs went drastically unmet -- where a lack of safe water and sanitation robbed men, women and children of health, hope and even life. According to our internal analysis, we've empowered more than 1 million people to gain access to safe water or sanitation. Yet, more than 3.4 million people die each year from water, sanitation and hygiene-related causes. Safe water and toilets change everything.
