Take a Wall Street Journal story this year that depicted blogger conferences as opportunities for women to party away from their husbands and kids. It has to do with women connecting with other women in ways they can't connect with their friends. -- The introductions at BlogHer, the largest conference in the world for women in social media, tend to go something like this: "WellConnectdMom, so great to meet you," I said to a blogger whom I knew only by her Twitter handle. "The sheer power of women on the Web is so clear statistically, and yet there is some ongoing prevailing effort to belittle that leadership," Stone said, citing stats showing women are 41% more likely to use social media than men. The chance to meet online connections in person is part of the reason women from all over the world gather for the two-day event.
