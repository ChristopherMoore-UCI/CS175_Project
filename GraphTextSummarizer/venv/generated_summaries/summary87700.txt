Having grown accustomed to coming back from slow starts throughout this tournament Lithuania would not have been too concerned about falling behind early, trailing USA 23-12 at the end of the opening quarter. Any hopes that Lithuania had off staging another of their famous comebacks dimmed with the USA still well in control, 42-27 when the half-time buzzer sounded. The United States will face Turkey in the finals of the world basketball championships after defeating Lithuania 89-74 Saturday. After defeating world number one Argentina on Thursday, the Lithuanians looked as if they had already played their final, offering little resistance for an on-song American team. NBA star Durant set the tone for his team's semi-final win by pounding Lithuania with a 17-point scoring blitz in the first eight minutes.
