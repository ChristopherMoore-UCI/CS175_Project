Along with the fatalities, 69 people were injured in the first blast, said Dr. Saghir Ahmed, Sindh provincial health minister. Motorcycles were used in both assaults, police said, and they came during the Shiite observance of Arbaeen, which takes place 40 days after the anniversary of Iman Hussein's death, also known as Ashura. One blast targeted a bus filled with Shiite religious observers, killing scores. The second blast happened in front of the emergency room at Jinnah Hospital, where doctors treated people from the first attack and others on stretchers were waiting to be taken to the crowded facility. The last deadly blast in Karachi was in late December during Ashura, when more than 40 people were killed.
