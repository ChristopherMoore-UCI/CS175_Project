Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are urging the passage of a $700 billion bailout proposed by President Bush following the failure of financial institutions and frozen credit markets. He writes: "Remember our economy has got very strong long-term fundamentals, solid fundamentals. We can't lurch from one weekend to another with one failed institution after another watching our economy decline, stock market collapse and the price of oil rise. This was during the time of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout. They feel the government is spending $700 billion or more to reward bad behavior.
