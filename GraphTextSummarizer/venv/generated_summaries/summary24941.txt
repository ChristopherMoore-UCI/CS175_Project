Lea Michele on 'devastating' news of Monteith's death He was madly in love with her, Shankman said. Monteith, 31, was found dead Saturday in his room by staff members at Vancouver's Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel after he missed his checkout time. The disease that lies Monteith had been frank about his struggles with substance abuse, telling Parade magazine in 2011 that he began using drugs at 13 and by 19 went into rehab after his mother and friends intervened. Adam Shankman, who directed an episode for each of the past three seasons, told CNN's Poppy Harlow that he had talked to Monteith on Saturday morning. Offscreen, Monteith was dating co-star and on-screen love interest Lea Michele.
