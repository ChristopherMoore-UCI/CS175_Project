Teachers walked off the job September 10, objecting to a longer school day, evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings. One parent on the impact of the strike This contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school-age students, 10 more "instructional days" each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system, as opposed to the two schedules now in place, depending on the school. Darren Tuggle, who has taught high school English for 13 years, said the strike wasn't about money, rather it was about classroom conditions. "You need to know that our engagement was totally professional, and while it was extremely hard work, the work was done with purpose and with intent, I believe, the get our kids back to school," he said. Parents have juggled their families' schedules for more than a week to make sure their children are attended to while schools are closed.
