The world No. 1 was humbled by the Romanian 6-0 6-2 in the group stages of the tournament earlier in the week, but following Williams' semifinal victory over Caroline Wozniacki and Halep's over Agnieszka Radwanska, the pair are set to do battle once more. Williams had to come from a set down to beat Wozniacki in what proved to be a thrilling semifinal on Saturday. -- Serena Williams will get the chance to avenge her worst defeat in 16 years on Sunday when she goes head to head with Simona Halep in the WTA Finals finale in Singapore. Few would bet against Williams clinching a third successive title and her fifth overall at the season-ending finals, but Halep will be the fresher of the two women after dispatching her Polish opponent 6-2 6-2. Victory sees Halep reach the final in her first appearance at the WTA Finals, but the world No. 4 played the percentages when asked if she thought she was favorite to beat Williams again.
