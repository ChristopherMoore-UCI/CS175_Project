Sotomayor is a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, named to that post by President Bill Clinton when she was a U.S. District Court judge, nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1992. According to exit polling from the 2008 general election, Obama received 67 percent of the Hispanic vote and Republican Sen. John McCain received 31 percent -- down significantly from the number of Hispanics who voted for former President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic U.S. Supreme Court justice if confirmed. -- The Republican Party risks further alienating Hispanic voters if it challenges the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, who would become the first Hispanic, and the third woman, on the Supreme Court, political analysts say. But Republican strategist Leslie Sanchez, who is also a CNN contributor, said senators shouldn't feel obligated to vote for Sotomayor because of the potential for Hispanic outreach, but rather on her qualifications.
