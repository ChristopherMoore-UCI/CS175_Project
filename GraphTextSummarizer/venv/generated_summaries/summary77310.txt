Then-New Orleans area District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. claimed his office should not be held fully responsible after one of his staff attorneys violated long-standing, accepted procedures on handling evidence in criminal trials. Thompson's lawyers said the DA's office as a whole should be held liable for the poor training of prosecutors working under Connick. A landmark 1963 high court ruling -- Brady v. Maryland -- said prosecutor have a sworn duty to turn over evidence that may show a defendant is innocent. -- A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled against a former death row inmate who sought damages from the state after prosecutors hid crucial blood tests that would have earlier proven his innocence. Blood tests at the robbery showed the perpetrator had blood type B. Lawyers at the Orleans Parish DA's office offered conflicting stories about whether the prosecuting attorney ever received the blood test report, or whether Thompson himself was ever given a confirming blood test.
