Examples of programs in the new initiative include Pacific Gas and Electric's work with community colleges to develop courses and training for energy jobs, professional literacy courses provided by McDonald's for managers across the country, and a pilot job training program in seven cities by Gap Inc., the statement said. A White House statement said the initiative is based on the same concept as the Educate to Innovate campaign, in which corporations develop specific programs to boost the performance of U.S. students in math, science, technology and engineering. The money will come in the form of grants to groups of community colleges that come up with new ways to make the college experience more responsive to the needs of today's students, according to a statement on the foundation's website. Also announced was the creation of the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence, a $1 million award for community colleges that have outstanding academic and work force outcomes. The initiative will make available more than $2 billion in competitive funds to community colleges over the next four years, the White House said in a statement.
