-- Raspberry Pi, the tiny, ultra-cheap, Linux-based PC, went on sale Monday in the U.S. through retailer Allied Electronics, but it's already out of stock. Raspberry Pi A launched in Europe in February of last year to heavy demand, followed by a launch in Asia last week. Available only through Allied, the A is now completely out of stock for U.S. customers. Both the A and B are equipped with an ARM processor and are amazingly small â€” approximately the size of a credit card â€” making them suitable for a variety of applications in education and DIY systems. The $35 Raspberry Pi B is also out of stock at Allied, but it can be bought through Newark, another retailer, which only carries that particular model.
