Bahari reportedly said Iranian reporters can be tempted by offers of money from Western news organizations to report for them. -- A reporter for Newsweek magazine who was arrested in Tehran has confessed to doing the bidding of Western governments, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Wednesday. " Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui of Amnesty International rejected Bahari's alleged confession, calling it part of the Islamic Republic's effort to intimidate the opposition and blame Western powers for the post-election chaos. Bahari is not the only reporter said to have confessed, according to Reporters Without Borders, which last week condemned "a parade of Iranian demonstrators being shown on state-run TV confessing to having protested at the behest of foreign media. Indeed, Iran's state-run Press TV has broadcast interviews with people who said they were guilt-ridden protesters who wanted to unburden themselves by confessing that the Western media had made them act as they did.
