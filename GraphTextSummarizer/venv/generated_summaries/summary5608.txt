-- Representatives of Bangladesh's government, industry and workers issued a joint statement Saturday laying out an "action plan" to improve worker safety in the wake of a series of disasters that have beset the industry in the past six months. In their joint statement, the representatives of government, industry and labor called for international buyers and brands to "take increased responsibility for improving working conditions and safety and health." Among those caught up in the finger pointing after the disaster are Western retailers and clothing brands that Bangladeshi suppliers say put heavy pressure on prices, resulting in bad pay and conditions for workers. As of Saturday, 547 bodies had been recovered, 22 more than on Friday, the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha News Agency reported. Preliminary results of a government inquiry into last week's building collapse found that "heavy machinery and high-capacity generators" were "largely responsible," the news agency reported Friday.
