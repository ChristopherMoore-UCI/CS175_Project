Khalaf testified that Almaleki made no effort to stop before she and Noor Almaleki were struck, according to CNN Phoenix affiliate KTVK. Sentencing testimony begins Wednesday in the case of an Iraqi man who was convicted of running over his 20-year-old daughter because she allegedly had become "too Westernized." A Maricopa County, Arizona, jury convicted Faleh Hassan Almaleki, 50, on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the 2009 death of Noor Faleh Almaleki. Faleh Hassan Almaleki believed his daughter had become "too Westernized" and had abandoned "traditional" Iraqi values, Peoria police said. Noor Faleh Almaleki died in November 2009 at an Arizona hospital, nearly two weeks after being run over by a Jeep in a parking lot in the Phoenix suburb of Peoria, authorities said. Defense lawyers said Almaleki was trying to spit on Khalaf, but swerved and ended up running down both women, KTVK reported.
