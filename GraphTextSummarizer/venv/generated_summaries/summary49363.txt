Since last May, almost 1,000 civilians get killed each month and the insurgents, a mix of tribesmen and al Qaeda extremists, control neighborhoods of the provincial capital, Ramadi, and nearly all of the nearby city of Fallujah. Under his watch, al Qaeda factions -- or the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Greater Syria) known by its Arabic acronym, "Daish" -- has revived and found shelter among dissatisfied Sunnis. In a similar vein, the Sunni leadership has not come to terms with the new realities of post-Saddam Iraq and still entertains illusions about ruling Iraq. Not so in Iraq's case, a fragile country with deep sociological rifts, dysfunctional political system, and absence of a viable progressive non-sectarian alternative. Yet al-Maliki, who leads the mainly Shiite State of Law Coalition, is shamelessly running on a triumphant slogan presenting himself as a strong Shiite leader who can defeat al Qaeda.
