He says his handlers turned a blind eye, and he concluded even at that early stage, 10 years after violence broke out, that British government officials had calculated McGuinness was someone they wanted in a suit and tie at the table talking to them, and not on the streets waging war. But all along, McGuinness's every move, from IRA commander, to deputy first minister, seems to have been an ever-more calculated step. Queen arrives in Northern Ireland on jubilee visit Derry, as he would call his city, or Londonderry, as the province's mainly Protestant, pro-British Loyalists refer to it, was where McGuinness first tried his hand at politics. It's a transformation that has taken place over decades: From the shaggy-haired, scrawny commander of Irish Republican Army (IRA) gunmen in the early 1970s, to the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, where he represents Sinn Fein, the province's most popular, mainly Roman Catholic, Republican party opposed to British rule. He had been pulled out and relocated to mainland Britain when his cover was blown a long time ago, but he told me he warned his British government handlers that McGuinness's early ballot box victories were a fraud: Countless ballots cast in clear infringement of the law.
