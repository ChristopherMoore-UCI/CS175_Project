-- "For the workers at Ford and their families absorbing this difficult news today, we will make sure that you are not left behind." So tweeted the Australian premier Julia Gillard, as Ford Australia, the local subsidiary of the U.S. giant, this week confirmed the worst kept secret in Australian manufacturing. Ford Australia president and chief executive Bob Graziano said the company had failed to "make the numbers work" when it modeled a number of different scenarios in an attempt to maintain its Australian production base. According to the Minerals Council of Australia, last year the industry paid in excess of $20 billion in company tax and royalties combined -- a four-fold increase on the $4 billion to $5 billion paid at the start of the boom. However, the diversification of Australian exports had stagnated in the 90s, with growth in tourism, education and specialized manufacturing moving into reverse, he said. But the automaker's decision to close manufacturing completely by 2016 is likely to add to the growing concerns that Australia is too reliant on its mining industry and resource exports to China in particular, whilst its manufacturing base has been in steady decline over more than four decades.
