Iraqi security forces, including army and police officers, are to assume full responsibility after the withdrawal. -- A car bomber who penetrated Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone this week was targeting the Iraqi prime minister, authorities said Saturday. Initial inquiries revealed an attempt to kill Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, according to Major Gen. Qassim Atta, the Baghdad security operations manager. The attacker was in a black Dodge with 20 kg (44 lb) of explosives, and was driving toward parliament when security forces stopped him because he did not have a proper badge. Terrorists confessed that the car bomb was targeting the prime minister when he visits parliament in an upcoming session, according to Atta, who did not name the group behind the attacks.
