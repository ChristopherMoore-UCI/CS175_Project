The ICC statement blamed the group for instigating war in Congo as part of its efforts to topple the government in neighboring Rwanda. Two Rwandan rebel leaders went on trial in Germany on Wednesday on charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and being members of a foreign terrorist group, a court statement said. A third alleged rebel leader, Callixte Mbarushimana, has been transferred to the International Criminal Court to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Mbarushimana was arrested in Paris in October under an ICC warrant involving allegations of mass rape and other crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. "This trial will be the first in Germany under its Code of Crimes Against International Law, adopted in June 2002, which integrates the crimes of the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) into German criminal law and allows German courts to investigate and prosecute them wherever they are committed in the world, because of their sheer gravity," Human Rights Watch said.
