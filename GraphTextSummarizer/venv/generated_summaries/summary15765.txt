"Today, the Crown retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but the queen only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries," it says. " The majestic white birds are a fairly common sight on the River Thames, which flows past Windsor and on to London. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne reported from Windsor, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. Each year, a census is carried out of the swans on stretches of the Thames in the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, it says. The remains of a swan have been found barbecued near Queen Elizabeth II's castle in Windsor, police said.
