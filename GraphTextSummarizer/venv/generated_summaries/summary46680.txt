Or they will have bench seats on the airplanes, measure people as they board, and seat them accordingly. The world is not built for fat people, and airplanes are not the place to look for gentle treatment. By the time you get on the plane, you are like a refugee -- the tired, the poor, the huddled masses in middle seats. If a fat person has to pay extra to fly -- Smith usually buys two seats on Southwest because they don't have first class -- then this could be a precedent for more suffering in the world away from the tarmac. I cringe for the person who has to sheepishly ask for the seat belt extender because the one in the narrow little seat doesn't make it around his body.
