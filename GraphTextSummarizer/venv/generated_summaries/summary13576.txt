"The Lewiston Police Department would like to thank Jason Warnock for his quick and decisive actions in helping Mr. Sitko and preventing the situation from worsening," said Roger Lanier, the interim police chief. What Warnock did next, captured in a dramatic photo by Lewiston Tribune photographer Barry Kough, made headlines around the world. " Thanks to Warnock, Sitko went to the hospital with just minor injuries. Warnock then reached in and pulled Sitko out to safety -- a moment recorded by Kough's camera. Warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the Yukon and its driver, 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, who appeared to be in shock.
