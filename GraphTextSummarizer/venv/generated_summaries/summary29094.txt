In an Interpol document obtained by CNN Wednesday, American authorities ask Peruvian police to arrest van der Sloot and begin a process of extradition to the United States. According to the document, around March 29, van der Sloot contacted a representative of Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. -- Joran van der Sloot, who authorities say has confessed to the murder of a Peruvian woman, faces criminal charges in Alabama because he tried to extort $250,000 from Natalee Holloway's mother, according to an Interpol document. In exchange, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where supposedly Holloway's remains were, according to the document. U.S. authorities last week announced an arrest warrant for van der Sloot on charges of extortion and wire fraud, but they did not name the victim.
