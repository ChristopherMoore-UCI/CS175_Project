Gaga's site also will emphasize sharing and creating photos and videos, as well as letting other users promote content from others that they like (something similar to sites like Reddit and Digg). "We think we can really change the world." When other sites are launched, Backplane allows user to switch back and forth among as many as they want. At The Frisky, another CNN content partner, Tiffanie Drayton imagines chat on the site this way: Little Monster 1: "Lady Gaga sure knows how to rock a bad-ass meat dress." "Backplane is about bringing together communities and Gaga's community just so happens to be the community we're using to learn about proper functionality," CEO Matt Michelsen said to Mashable, a CNN content partner. Even with Gaga's massive social-media presence (she was the first artist to hit 1 billion YouTube video views), it remains an open question whether a social site devoted almost exclusively to her fans will have a big enough user base to fly.
