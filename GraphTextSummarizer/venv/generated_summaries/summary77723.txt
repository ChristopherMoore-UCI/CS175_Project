UVA shut down Greek social life on November 21, two days after the publication of a now-discredited Rolling Stone magazine article about an alleged gang rape in a fraternity house on the Charlottesville campus. And security officers must be hired to monitor the entrance at parties where there are fewer fraternity members than nonmembers. Reinstatement comes with a stipulation that each Greek organization agree by January 16 to new rules -- devised by UVA's Greek leadership councils -- for university social events. "I believe the new safety measures recommended by the student leaders in the Greek community will help provide a safer environment for their members and guests," UVA President Teresa Sullivan said in a press release. Two of Jackie's friends told CNN that numerous details of the alleged attack as related by Rolling Stone were entirely different from what Jackie told them that night.
