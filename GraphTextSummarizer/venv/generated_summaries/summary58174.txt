The analysis of hydrogen atoms Curiosity found in rock have led NASA scientists to conclude that much of Mars' former oceans disappeared very early -- before the rocks were formed. Either way, the samples of organic matter in the atmosphere and in rock show that Mars may at least have once had conditions favorable to hosting life, NASA said in a statement. "This first confirmation of organic carbon in a rock on Mars holds much promise," said scientist Roger Summons, who works on the rover team. The Curiosity rover's tapping into organics in rock is the first find ever of life's building blocks on Mars' surface. A NASA rover has found the building blocks of life on Mars.
