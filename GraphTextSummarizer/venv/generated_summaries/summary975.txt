Until we make marine parks obsolete, dolphins and other sea mammals will continue to be senselessly captured and slaughtered. During his time as a trainer, O'Barry learned dolphins had true feelings -- they would get depressed, stressed out, even suicidal. -- Before I started working on the documentary "The Cove," I assumed like many others that dolphins and orcas enjoyed living at Sea World and other marine parks. When Cathy died in his arms some years later, O'Barry realized the whole process of capturing and training dolphins was wrong. These dolphins escaped the fate of many of their pod mates, who are brutally slaughtered with primitive harpoons -- turning the cove into a scene straight from Melville's "Moby Dick."
