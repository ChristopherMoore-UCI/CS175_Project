A federal judge ruled Monday that the latest White House jumper is incompetent to stand trial, and ordered 23-year-old Dominic Adesanya held for more psychiatric testing and treatment. Judge John Facciola ordered 45 days of psychiatric testing and treatment, and set another court date for Dec. 22. He had not been restrained by handcuffs or leg irons for his appearance in court, despite previous resistance at an earlier court proceeding. At the end of the proceeding, Adesanya stood and yelled "stop, you're not gonna do this to me!" and began to struggle with U.S Marshals as they tried to lead him away. Several other court security workers rushed toward the man and hustled him out a courtroom door used for those in custody.
