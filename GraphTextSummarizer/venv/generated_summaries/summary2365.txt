-- Civil rights activist Evelyn Gibson Lowery, who with her husband, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, participated in the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march in Alabama, died Thursday morning at her Atlanta home, a family spokeswoman said. She suffered a stroke last week, and on Wednesday returned home from a hospital after medical personnel decided "there was nothing more medically that they could do," the Lowery family said in a statement released Thursday. Joseph Lowery -- sometimes referred to as the "dean of the civil rights movement" -- was a founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights group formed in 1957. The purpose of the group, according to a bio on her group's website, is to "champion the rights of women, children, families, and responding to the problems of the disenfranchised regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, or religion. "My beloved Evelyn was a special woman, whose life was committed to service, especially around the issues of empowering women," Joseph Lowery said.
