The central part of the story is the fall of Sam from Heidi's life and into the depths of horrors that dogs can sometimes experience in our world -- everything from being shot at, to research labs, to the worst dog shelters amongst the world of otherwise nice dog shelters, and he comes for revenge upon Cassius [a rival]. His affection and concern for dogs form the heart of "Flawed Dogs: The Shocking Raid on Westminster" (Philomel Books), Breathed's new illustrated novel, whose hero is a resilient dachshund with a soup ladle for a leg. It's the most moving picture of a dog I've ever seen, having gone through an impossible transition and fallen back to where dogs naturally go, which is just loving people. The pit bull is one of a number of dogs that Breathed and his wife, Jody, have rescued over the years. Breathed invited CNN to his mountainside home for a rare interview, which touched on topics ranging from his book to Michael Vick, Charles Schulz and his famous pen pal, Harper Lee.
