But activists and indigenous groups said Monday that the government was too swift in denying that dozens of Yanomami Indians died in an attack that reportedly occurred in July, and that was the subject of a call for action last week by a Yanomami organization and other groups. Indians told members of a neighboring Yanomami community that they saw burned bodies and bones in the area where the attack allegedly occurred, according to Survival International, which had contacted local representatives but had not spoken directly with any witnesses of the alleged attack. But a group of organizations representing indigenous people and communities in the Amazon said the investigators hadn't visited the area where the attack is reported to have taken place. Allegations of the massacre trickled out of a remote region along the Brazil-Venezuela border, where unauthorized Brazilian gold miners have long clashed with indigenous groups. "It's far too early for the Venezuelan government to be denying this massacre took place," said Chloe Corbin, a spokeswoman for London-based Survival International.
