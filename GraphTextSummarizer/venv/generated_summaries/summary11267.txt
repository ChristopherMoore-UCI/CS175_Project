"What they say is that virus particles can be airborne, but it's premature to conclude that MERS is transmitted through aerosols," said Dr. Mark Denison, a professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. "We know that MERS is found in nasal secretion of camels, so virus particles being spread out in a barn is not a surprise," he said. But in order to fully understand whether airborne transmission plays a role in MERS, further research is needed, Denison and Olival conclude. Several reports in the past have shown MERS infection of those in close contact with infected patients. There have been 836 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS infection since its first appearance in 2012, according to the latest numbers provided by the World Health Organization.
