"Chikungunya will go through a region quite rapidly and create a level of population immunity which helps mitigate large outbreaks of the disease," Staples said. The warm climate of the region offers potential for Chikungunya levels to be maintained for years to come, just like Dengue fever. Unlike Dengue, infection with Chikungunya results in lifelong immunity. "It wasn't until 2013 that unfortunately a traveler resulted in local transmission of Chikungunya," said Erin Staples of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), referring to the people infected in Saint Martin. "Given the level of Dengue in the region, we knew there could be the same levels of Chikungunya," Staples said.
