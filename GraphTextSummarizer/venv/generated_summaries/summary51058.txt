"Poulter is a fascinating character, who's developed his brand in a very interesting and idiosyncratic way," said Gary Firkins, managing director of golf PR firm Landmark Media. It is on the internet that Poulter is concentrating much of his marketing effort -- with the launch of a web site home for the "pro golfer, fashion designer and personality," and a Twitter account with 1.1 million followers. For a player who is ranked 16 in the world and who has never won a major championship, the 35 year old has over a million followers on Twitter; a following which has led industry experts to call him golf's "biggest brand" outside of Tiger Woods, who has only 750, 000 followers. "You only have to see the ticket sales when Poulter plays in a tournament to see the power of his brand," said Neil Gray, of golf marketing firm GMS. "You can't hit golf balls 24/7, you need some kind of a life," Poulter said.
