"We are thinking of American brothers-in-arms and all those who lost love ones. In front of the U.S. Embassy in London's Grosvenor Square, dignitaries joined loved ones of 67 Britons who died in the attacks -- the most from any country outside the United States. At U.S. bases in Afghanistan, where soldiers are fighting a war triggered by the 9/11 attacks, soldiers took part in ceremonies to reflect as well.
