The country's longtime leader Kim Jong Il and his son Kim Jong Un were among members of the funeral committee, state media said. North Korea has been ruled by the Kim family since 1948, and it is widely anticipated that Kim Jong Un will eventually succeed his father, but little is known about the apparent successor. The son of Kim's third wife, who died in 2004 from breast cancer, Kim Jong Un reportedly studied under a false name at the International School in Bern, Switzerland, before attending the Kim Il Sung military academy in Pyongyang. "The old guard is fading in influence," said Scott Snyder, North Korea expert at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. "It's not clear if Kim Jong Un actually needs more titles to make it clear that he is on the rise," he said, referring to Kim Jong Il's son.
