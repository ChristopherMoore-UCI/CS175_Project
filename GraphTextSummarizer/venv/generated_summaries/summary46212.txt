The mother, 38, had just returned around 5:30 p.m. to the family apartment on Manhattan's West Side with her 3-year-old daughter, who she had just taken to swimming lessons, police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Peering into a bathroom, she let out a scream upon finding her 1-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter stabbed to death in the bathtub, according to Kelly. The nanny is at St. Luke's Hospital, also in New York, in critical but stable condition, according to Kelly. A kitchen knife sat next to her, according to police spokesman Paul Browne. After the doorman said they had not, the mother went back upstairs and started looking around, Kelly said.
