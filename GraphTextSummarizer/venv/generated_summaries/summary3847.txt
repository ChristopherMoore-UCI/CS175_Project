Hall was being driven by his friend, 73-year-old Howard Zielke, when someone collided with their vehicle Saturday afternoon in Fannin County, Texas, the state Department of Public Safety reported. Shortly after losing a Republican primary this spring to tea party-backed candidate John Ratcliffe, thus spelling an end to his 32-year stay in Congress, Hall cracked: "I figured it out -- damn guy got more votes than I did!" Congressman Ralph Hall underwent surgery to repair damage to his hip after a car accident, his office said Sunday. Hall, a Texas Republican and the oldest sitting member of Congress, was airlifted to the hospital Saturday following the accident. "At 91 years old a contract for six months -- you can't beat it," he said then, referring to the rest of his term in the House.
