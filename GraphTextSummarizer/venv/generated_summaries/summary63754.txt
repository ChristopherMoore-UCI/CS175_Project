Peter Rodger, the father of killer Elliot Rodger, met with Richard Martinez, whose son Christopher was killed by the younger Rodger in the deadly rampage through the college town of Isla Vista just over a week ago. Police say Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 the night of May 23 after years of rejection and jealousy. An emotional Martinez has been an outspoken critic of the nation's gun laws in the days since his 20-year-old son, a junior at the University of California at Santa Barbara, was gunned down by Rodger inside a deli on campus the night of the rampage. -- Two grieving fathers, who each lost a son in the recent killing spree in Santa Barbara, California, met for the first time Sunday. "I have met with Peter Rodger and we plan to work together so other families such as ours will not suffer as ours have," Martinez told CNN affiliate KEYT.
