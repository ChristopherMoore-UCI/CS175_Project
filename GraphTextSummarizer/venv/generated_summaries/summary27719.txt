But last year Godane seemed to be refocusing the group on terrorist attacks beyond Somalia -- against East African states supporting the Somali government, especially Uganda and Kenya, and against Western interests in East Africa. Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to Al-Shabaab,"  said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby. Godane was said to be 37 years old, and was originally from Somaliland in northern Somalia. On Monday, U.S. military conducted a strike in the African country targeting Godane, who had pledged allegiance to al Qaeda. Still, the Westgate siege demonstrated Godane's desire to align his group more closely with al Qaeda.
