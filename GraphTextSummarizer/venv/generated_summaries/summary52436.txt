-- Former Inter Milan striker Adriano has revealed he had to leave the Italian Serie A giants because of alcohol problems. "After the death of my father I fell into a depression that I only managed to cure with alcohol," Adriano told Brazilian magazine R7. I went out every night and drank whatever happened to be in front of me: wine, whisky, beer...a lot of beer. Adriano had a troubled time in Italy and his career was often called into question by off-the-field reports. Reports at the time suggested Adriano was once again turning up to training drunk and the Brazil international has admitted that was why the Nerazzurri eventually gave up on him.
