We've just discovered that several credit card transactions shared on social networking site Blippy have been exposed -- with full credit card numbers included -- in Google search results. That search returns results showing detailed purchase information for transactions. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system." Tipster Trey Copeland wrote to us with a link to results for the search: site:blippy.com +"from card". Blippy users who share their credit card and bank account information do so with the assumption that this information will remain private.
