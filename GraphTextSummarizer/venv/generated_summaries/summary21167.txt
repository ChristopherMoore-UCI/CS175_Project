The vote will be the first since ethnic violence followed disputed elections four years ago and left more than 1,000 people dead and 350,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross. Setting the date for new elections has been a contentious process. However, because Kenya is in a unique situation -- it has a coalition government following the 2007 disputed elections -- the president and prime minister have to agree on when to dissolve the coalition parliament to pave way for the electoral body to set an election date. Former Agriculture Minister William Ruto and radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang face similar charges. In that election, both Mwai Kibaki, the incumbent, and challenger Raila Odinga claimed to have won.
