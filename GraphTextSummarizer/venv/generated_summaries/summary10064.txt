A Haitian pastor informed Gibson that the road out of town was open, so the missionaries climbed aboard a commercial bus and tried to make it into nearby Dominican Republic. Until Wednesday morning, Gibson and his fellow volunteers had been holed up in a hotel on a hilltop overlooking Cap-Haitien, after demonstrators put up networks of barricades through the streets and began attacking the bases of United Nations peacekeepers with rocks, bottles and petrol bombs. "We almost made it out of town," team member Kerry Gibson told CNN in a phone call after his team survived the attack unharmed. One of its goals, Gibson said, is to donate motorcycles to Christian leaders. "We put wheels under indigenous local pastors," Gibson explained.
