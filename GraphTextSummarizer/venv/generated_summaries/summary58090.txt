The justices in December heard arguments over the EPA's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. Defining "air pollutant" within the context of greenhouse gases -- and the ability of the EPA to exercise its rulemaking authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- took up much of the courtroom debate. The justices had previously rejected three other related appeals, including one from Virginia -- broader challenges to the EPA's power over carbon emissions. "Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?" asked Justice Samuel Alito. -- The Supreme Court tried mightily to wade through a cloud of bureaucratic regulations Monday over setting clear air standards, a high-stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the Obama administration against a coalition of states and utilities.
