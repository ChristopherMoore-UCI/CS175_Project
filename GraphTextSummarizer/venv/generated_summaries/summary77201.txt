Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, allegedly threatened and intimidated flight attendants on a British Airways flight from London to Los Angeles last summer, using profanity, smoking in a bathroom and calling passengers "peasants," federal authorities said this week. On the July 31, 2014, flight, a flight attendant told the FBI that Hilton appeared to be "under the influence of drugs because of his erratic behavior while walking through the cabin," court papers said. The captain authorized crew members to form a "restraint team" to restrain Hilton before he woke up, authorities said in court papers. Hilton, 20, surrendered himself to the FBI on Tuesday -- charged with interfering with flight crew members -- and appeared in court later that day, said spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The flight's pilot, who was second-in-command to the captain, "noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels, apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding," court papers said.
