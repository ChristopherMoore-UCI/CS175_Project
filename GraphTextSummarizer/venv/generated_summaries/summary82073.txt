In the e-mails, acquired by Gawker's Valleywag blog, Evan Spiegel encourages fellow Kappa Sigma members to get sorority women drunk enough to have sex, mocks another fraternity by suggesting its members are gay and refers to a different group of sorority members as "sororisluts." "Hope at least six girl[s] [performed a sex act on you] last night because that didn't happen for me," he wrote in one e-mail after a fraternity party, according to the Gawker blog. -- The CEO of popular messaging app Snapchat is apologizing after a set of filthy e-mails he wrote several years ago to his fraternity brothers at Stanford University was leaked publicly this week. Spiegel's leaked e-mails may be seen as yet another example of a "brogrammer" culture in Silicon Valley and the male-dominated tech industry, where some female employees have complained about sexist comments and a lack of respect from their male co-workers. In a written response sent to CNN by Snapchat, Spiegel, now 23, apologized for the e-mails. Spiegel created Snapchat along with fraternity brother Bobby Murphy while attending Stanford.
