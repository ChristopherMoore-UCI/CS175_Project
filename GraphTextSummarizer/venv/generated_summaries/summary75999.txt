The driver switches have left Scotland's Paul di Resta, who was at Force India last season, without a confirmed drive for 2014. The 30-year-old Sutil has spent his previous six seasons in F1 with the Force India team, who had already confirmed Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez as their drivers for the 2014 campaign. The ramifications from the incident meant Sutil missed the 2012 season, being replaced at Force India by Hulkenberg, who had been the reserve driver at Force India. Sauber will look to build on that strong run at the end of last season and team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said they had been hoping to sign Sutil for some time. Sutil made his debut in F1 in 2007 for the Spyker team, which was sold to the Force India syndicate a year later.
