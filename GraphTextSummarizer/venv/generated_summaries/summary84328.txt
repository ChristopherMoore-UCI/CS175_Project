Harris-Moore dropped out of high school and, according to Wallace, police believe he spent his teens burglarizing unoccupied homes on Camano Island, a vacation community of about 15,000 people off the Washington state coast. "He then leaves the credit cards behind so people don't realize they have been stolen." Wallace said Harris-Moore has charged thousands of dollars worth of video games, GPS devices and police scanners online, using stolen credit cards. Harris-Moore faces 10 counts in that case, as well as other thefts, Internet crimes and burglaries, Wallace said. "Colt," as he is called, was first arrested for burglary at age 12, said Detective Ed Wallace, a spokesman for the Island County Sheriff's Office. Now police in five counties in Washington state are looking for him.
