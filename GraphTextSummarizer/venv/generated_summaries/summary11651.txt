But either way it's an infinitely more pedestrian entertainment, essentially a long succession of repetitive chase scenes, hollow explosions and the kind of speech balloon dialogue that reduces even good actors to robotic mode. In the new movie, the guy, Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell), commutes halfway around the world from Australia -- "The Colony" -- to the only other liveable land left, the United Federation of Britain, to work on an assembly line putting together robots. Presumably it's intentional that Quaid's wife, Lori (Kate Beckinsale), could easily be the sister of Resistance fighter Melina (Jessica Biel) -- they might share the same plastic surgeon -- but if there was a point I suspect it wound up on the cutting room floor. Yet the film versions of his stories -- "Blade Runner," "The Adjustment Bureau," "Paycheck" -- give a highly sanitized, streamlined impression of his work. Why would workers in the Colony commute, daily, by rocketship, to the other side of the globe to add rivets to robots?
