-- I was 14 on September 11, 2001, and I was a freshman at Marlboro High School in Monmouth County, New Jersey. Now, nearly 10 years later, we were told on Sunday night that we had brought bin Laden, the man responsible for the horrific attacks on September 11, to justice. The anxiety and fear that I experienced on and after the attacks on September 11 came rushing back the instant I heard of Osama bin Laden's death. Unlike the crowds of people who were seen celebrating in the streets in Washington and at ground zero in Lower Manhattan, I was scared the same way I was on September 11. As Americans watched the towers crumble on September 11, we realized that America is not an impenetrable force, and our lives would never be the same because of it.
