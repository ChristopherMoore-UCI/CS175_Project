Suzanne Crough, the child actress who portrayed youngest daughter Tracy on the '70s musical sitcom "The Partridge Family," has died. The group consisted of a widowed mom, played by Shirley Jones, and her five children, played by David Cassidy, Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce, Brian Forster and Crough. "I'm an office manager for Office Max," she told host Matt Lauer. Crough also starred in the TV series "Mulligan's Stew" and had spots on other series in the '70s. Tracy played tambourine and percussion in the traveling "Partridge Family" band.
