"This has been a true price crash," said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey. Prices at the pump should drop even more in the coming days, as refiners cut how much they're charging distributors and retailers, Lundberg said. The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.38, down nearly a dime over the past three weeks, Lundberg said. Here are average prices in some other cities: • Boston - $3.59 • Baltimore - $3.34 • Atlanta - $3.27 • Baton Rouge, Louisiana• - $3.11 • St. Louis - $3.05 • Salt Lake City - $3.40 • -- Gas prices have plummeted 46 cents a gallon over the past two months, according to a survey released Sunday.
