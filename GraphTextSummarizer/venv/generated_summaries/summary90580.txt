The two Navy officers, roommates in the apartment where the shootings happened, were F/A-18 jet pilots assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 101, Marine Aircraft Group 11, Third Marine Aircraft Wing, the Navy said. Lt. J.G. John R. Reeves, 25, put a gun to his own head and killed himself after shooting to Lt. J.G. David A. Reis, 25; Karen Reis, 24; and Matthew Saturley, 31, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. -- The killings of four people, including two U.S. Navy pilots, in a Coronado, California, apartment early New Year's Day was a murder-suicide, investigators said Wednesday.
