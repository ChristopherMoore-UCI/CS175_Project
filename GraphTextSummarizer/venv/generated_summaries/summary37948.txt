In awarding the prize, judges Luis Mansilla -- Mansilla + Tunon architects -- and Martin Keiding -- editor-in-chief of Arkitektur DK -- described the scheme as: "a perfect example of bringing dead nature back to life by converting rubbish into a beautiful piece of landscape architecture...using few and humble means". There is an underground drainage system on site which filters contaminated waste fluids. "We are facing big problems, so it is a great opportunity for architects to work seriously with this problem on many different levels. It is landscape architecture that is inspiring. Joan Roig of Batlle and Roig Architects told CNN: "The idea was to create a system of hills and banks in a way that would avoid erosion from water and to give the rubbish dump back to nature with a natural design." Work to transform the site -- the largest landfill in Spain -- began in 2000 and was completed earlier this year.
