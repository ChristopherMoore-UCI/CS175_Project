The Stop Online Piracy Act works by cutting off the money to foreign illegal sites and making it harder for online criminals to market and distribute illegal products to U.S. consumers. Internet protest stalls online piracy bills in Congress The Stop Online Piracy Act protects consumers and innovators by targeting foreign websites that traffic in stolen or counterfeit products, everything from movies to medicine to baby food. And it provides innovators with a way to bring claims against foreign illegal sites that steal and sell their technology, inventions and products. The bill includes provisions that "follow the money" to cut off the main sources of revenue to these sites, and also protects consumers from being directed to foreign illegal websites by search engines. For instance, Google -- a major opponent of the bill -- paid $500 million to settle a criminal investigation for promoting foreign illegal online pharmacies, possibly endangering Americans' health.
