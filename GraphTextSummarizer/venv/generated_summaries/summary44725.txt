"It's hard to imagine that kind of horror," said Milton, Massachusetts, Police Chief Richard G. Wells Jr. Mere seconds passed before other officers arrived and rushed into the home in the tony Boston suburb of 25,000. Kerby Revelus then began attacking Sarafina with the knife, Wells said, prompting police to open fire and kill him. Mother Regina Revelus was at work, and father Vronze Revelus was not at home. It was not the first time police have visited the home answering a domestic violence call, Wells said. Jessica Revelus told officers at the time that "she was not in fear of her brother," according to a police report from the incident, the Boston Herald reported.
