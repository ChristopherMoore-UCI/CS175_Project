Army spokesman Lt. Col. Clarence Counts said that five service members were wounded in the attack and a building suffered minor damage. Taliban fighters have lobbed rockets into the base in previous attacks. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN that 20 armed men wearing suicide vests stormed the base around 4 a.m. (7:30 p.m. Tuesday ET), with four of them detonating explosives at the entrances to allow the other men to move in. But Army Specialist Christina Dion, a spokeswoman who both lives an works on the base, told CNN that personnel were ordered to enter bunkers when the base came under attack and were allowed to return to their huts and tents about 90 minutes later. "We're always prepared to deal with attacks on our base," Counts said.
