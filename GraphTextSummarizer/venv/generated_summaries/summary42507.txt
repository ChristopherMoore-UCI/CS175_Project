Dozens of phrases are censored on social media including any mention of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or the recent Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Far from relenting, the government is introducing a swath of regressive legislation and regulations in a further assault against online privacy and freedom of expression. The Chinese authorities abuse the law to suppress online freedom and target critical voices, yet have the guile to portray such persecution as evidence of the rule of law in action. It is with these courageous individuals that those of us who value online freedom must stand united. It is women's rights activists, anti-corruption and environmental campaigners, and those urging debate on political and legal reforms who fall foul of online censors.
