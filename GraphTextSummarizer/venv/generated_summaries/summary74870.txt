" PGA Tour against 'belly putter' ban The PGA Tour runs the American circuit and plays a leading role in staging World Golf Championship events. "Anchored" putting method to be banned from 2016 PGA Tour commissioner Tom Finchem has already stated that the organization did not see "a competitive advantage to be gained by using anchoring." The World No.1 fears that the game could be torn apart with the PGA Tour joining the PGA of America in opposing the proposed ban of advanced anchored putters from 2016. It has traditionally adopted the rules of the R&A and USGA, which runs the Open Championship and U.S. Open, while the PGA of America organizes the US PGA Championship and American Ryder Cup team. I sort of think it was a bit of a knee jerk reaction to how much success people were having with it (players using long putters have won three of the last five majors).
