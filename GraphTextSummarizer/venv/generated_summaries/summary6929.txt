The story is a fabrication, a compiling of events that may or may not have happened to paint a broad picture that Native American leaders say does not exist. " "They are raising money in the name of Indians, using the worst of poverty porn of all Indian country to raise money on all our social ills," said Roberts, whose Colorado-based group represents six Native American nonprofit organizations. " Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute that aims to strengthen and support Native communities, went further. " The letter, he added, "is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the Native American community, but in families found in every sphere of society." He said it wasn't the "intention to disparage in any way the Native American community."
