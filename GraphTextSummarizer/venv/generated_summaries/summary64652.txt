There's no harm in going back to where the blaze or trail was and really scan, like a camera in pan mode, to see the natural path of least resistance. As the afternoon progressed, we realized that we weren't seeing trail markers on the trees -- only two after four hours of solid hiking. With the snowdrifts more than 6 feet deep at points, Matt and Mike took the snowshoes to punch out a more solid path for Rick and me. We encountered almost every type of backcountry terrain -- me with a 30-pound pack on my back and Matt carrying a 50-pound pack. Luckily, Rick and Mike had hit the first marker and waited for Matt at the top of the hill.
