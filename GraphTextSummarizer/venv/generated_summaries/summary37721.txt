" Right now, APOE gene testing is only recommended for people with mild problems with mental function or dementia; for people with no symptoms, it should only be done in a research setting, experts said. But, Caselli points out that trying to encourage people to exercise in order to prevent heart disease, for example, has been far from successful, and getting people to be active to ward off Alzheimer's may be equally difficult. Despite the gene-related health problems, another study in the same issue of the journal suggests that people who learn they do have APOE e4 seem to handle the information pretty well. In addition to increasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease, APOE e4 is also associated with a greater risk of heart disease. "I think it opens the door to ask the deeper questions," said Kosik, referring to the possible consequences for individuals and society if widespread APOE testing were introduced.
