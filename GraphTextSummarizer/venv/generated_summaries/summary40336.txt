UEFA has looked to crack down on clubs overspending in recent years, introducing financial fair play rules which aim to stop teams getting into unmanageable debt. The Serbian champions -- also known as FK Crvena Zvezda -- were found to be "in breach of a number of provisions of the UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations," a statement on UEFA's website said. The Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body reported the case in early April "after becoming aware of the existence of overdue payables as a result of a complaint," the UEFA statement continued. -- Red Star Belgrade have been excluded from next season's Champions League for failing to meet their debts. City rival and league runner up, Partizan Belgrade, could be awarded Serbia's Champions League spot in Red Star's place while the country's football association may face a UEFA investigation of its own for granting a license to the club.
