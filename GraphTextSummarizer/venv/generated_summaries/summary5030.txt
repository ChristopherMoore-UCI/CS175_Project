There's no doubt his eyes were upon us," Fennville coach Ryan Klingler told reporters, choking back tears. An autopsy Friday revealed Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, according to a statement from Dr. David A. Start, the Ottawa County chief medical examiner. Fans erupted in a standing ovation and wiped away tears during a moment of silence before the tipoff of Fennville High School's first game without Leonard as the point guard. Friends came to the game with homemade shirts and signs, saying he was their angel on the court, CNN affiliate WZZM reported. Friends and family paid their last respects at a funeral for 16-year-old Wes Leonard of Fennville.
