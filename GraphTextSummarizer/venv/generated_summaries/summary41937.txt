In the past few weeks, images of the former farmer from Hunan province have appeared on Taobao, the Chinese version of eBay, marketing clothes for Yecoo, a business set up by his granddaughter Lv Ting and four of her friends. The range of clothes Liu models has now been dubbed "Grandpa style." And they'll take more photos, Lv says, as long as Liu enjoys it. Liu's fame has also translated into higher sales for the fledgling company, which only launched in May. Sales have surged fivefold since his image appeared on the site, an unforeseen benefit according to Lv, who says the photos were just taken for fun. Liu has attracted a lot of attention on Weibo, China's version of Twitter.
