The ASPCA was one of several animal rights groups that sued Feld Entertainment in 2000, alleging that circus elephants were abused. "These defendants attempted to destroy our family-owned business with a hired plaintiff who made statements that the court did not believe," said Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, in a statement. Feld's cases, which include allegations of litigation abuse and racketeering, will continue against the other defendants -- the Humane Society of the United States, the Fund for Animals, the Animal Welfare Institute, the Animal Protection Institute United with Born Free USA and Tom Rider, a former circus employee who testified against Ringling Bros. Feld Entertainment, Inc., trumpeted the settlement with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) as a victory for its Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. John Simpson, lead counsel for Feld and a partner at Fulbright & Jaworski in Washington, said Feld's legal costs since July 2000 have exceeded $20 million, but that settlements with other defendants may be reached.
