-- A Venezuelan prosecutor on Friday formally charged opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez with public incitement, property damage, arson and conspiracy. Earlier this year, Lopez organized protests demanding better security, an end to shortages and protected freedom of speech. Back in 2008, the government of then-President Hugo Chavez banned him from running for public office, accusing him of corruption and misuse of public funds. Venezuela's state run news agency said that 39 people have died and more than 600 injured in clashes. He is accused of inciting anti-government protests throughout Venezuela that began February 12.
