" Gard is one of the organizers of "Occupy Melbourne," a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2,000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square. Similar calls have sprung up around Australia: "Occupy Brisbane," "Occupy Perth," and "Occupy Sydney." "We are inspired by what's happening on Wall Street and loosely liaising with each other, but it's not organized in any central way," said Gard, who works as a mechanic on cargo ships. There are Facebook calls for a global demonstration on October 15 in cities in more than 25 countries stretching from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires, Dublin to Madrid. "Occupy Wall Street" began on September 17 and is now spreading to cities across the U.S.
