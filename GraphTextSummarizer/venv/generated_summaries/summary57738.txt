Elsewhere, the fast-moving storm caused injuries and damage in Pulaski and Laclede counties in Missouri, knocking out power at Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army post that took a direct hit from a suspected tornado, accordingto Laclede County Emergency Management spokesman Gail Teter. While a sixth storm-related death happened at a home just north of Rolla, Missouri, about 106 miles southwest of St. Louis, said Phelps County Emergency Management spokeswoman Sandy North. CNN affiliate KMOV on Friday broadcast images of heavy damage -- including destroyed homes and overturned vehicles -- in Sunset Hills, Missouri, approximately 15 miles southwest of St. Louis. The storm also left heavy structural damage to buildings in its wake -- including a popular shopping center and Catholic church -- in the town of Fenton, some 18 miles southwest of St. Louis, said Fenton Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Heidbreder. Search and rescue workers were deployed to assess the storm's damage in St. Louis County, where there were reports of injuries, according to Mark Diedrich, the county's emergency management acting director.
