An attorney for Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.) is raising the prospect of a long, drawn-out battle over control of his Tucson-area district, a seat once held by his former boss Gabby Giffords, as his contest with Republican Martha McSally looks increasingly likely to head to a recount. Democrats won't publicly address the prospect of pursuing legal options in the race, and Hamilton declined to comment specifically on what those options might be. Kevin Hamilton, Barber's legal counsel, said Wednesday that the campaign isn't taking "anything off the table" in potentially challenging the outcome of the race when it's certified next month. But Barber's campaign has identified more than 130 ballots in Pima County they say were illegitimately thrown out, and say there are likely others. Two House races in Louisiana are going to runoffs next month, and two House races in California are still too close to call.
