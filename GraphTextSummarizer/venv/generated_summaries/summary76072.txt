"This new network of marine reserves will help ensure that Australia's diverse marine environment, and the life it supports, remain healthy, productive and resilient for future generations." "We have an incredible opportunity to turn the tide on protection of the oceans and Australia can lead the world in marine protection," said Tony Burke, the country's environment minister. Paul Gambin from WWF Australia cautioned that some areas equally rich in biodiversity had not been included in the plan, possibly because of their proximity to rich reserves of fossil fuels. Australia plans to create the world's largest network of marine reserves, its government announced Thursday. "These are among the jewels in the crown for Australia's marine environment and surrounding waters have not been protected under this plan."
