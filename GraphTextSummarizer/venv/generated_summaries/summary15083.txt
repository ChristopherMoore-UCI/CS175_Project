The U.S. Marshals Service sold off nearly 500 pieces of personal property belonging to Bernie and his wife Ruth Madoff in New York on Saturday morning. "Another chapter (in the Madoff saga) ended here today," Deputy U.S. Marshal Roland Ubaldo told CNN by e-mail. On Saturday, some of Madoff's riches taken from his homes in New York City and Montauk, Long Island, were on the auction block. Last year, the first auction of Madoff's property brought in more than $900,000, with most items selling for prices well beyond the highest pre-sale estimates. The money raised through the auction goes the U.S. Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund to compensate the victims of Madoff's history-making fraud.
