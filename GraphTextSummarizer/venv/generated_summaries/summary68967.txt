Opinion: Why the Muslim Brotherhood can't back down Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's ouster, with the military and Morsy opponents battling Muslim Brotherhood members and others. The move is the latest in an anti-Muslim Brotherhood crackdown that began when the military ousted President Mohamed Morsy, who was backed by the Brotherhood, in early July. The country's Ministry of Social Solidarity said earlier this month that it was considering punishing the group, accusing it of violating a law regulating non-governmental groups, EgyNews reported. Violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations a few days later. Many of the deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo.
