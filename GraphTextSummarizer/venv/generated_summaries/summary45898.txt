On the Fourth of July, for example, I once had a party that included American flags, hot dogs and hamburgers in order to educate my Mexican friends about American culture. Viva to Manzano for being proud of who he is: someone who is American, but also has a part of Mexico in him. However, Mexico is so close to the United States that Manzano, or any other Mexican or Mexican-American, can just drive their car across the border. When I am in Mexico City, I certainly never forget that I am also an American. " I like this statement because even though I was born and raised in Dallas, I have no problem crossing borders, loving both Dallas and Mexico City.
