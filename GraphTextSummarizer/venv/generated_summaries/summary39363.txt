Filmmaker Andrew Jenks, 24, discovered this when he set out to star in, direct and produce his latest project, MTV's "World of Jenks." During his time at the facility, Jenks starred in, directed and produced "Andrew Jenks, Room 355," a feature film that HBO eventually bought the rights to and aired in 2008. " CNN spoke with Jenks about his show, which will premiere on Monday at 10 p.m., ET, on MTV. The docu-series follows Jenks as he jumps from various people's worlds: A rapper, a homeless girl, a cage fighter and others. We have a research team -- for instance, I'll say, "We're interested in doing a homeless kid, or we're interested in following someone with autism or we're interested in a cage fighter," and then our research team will investigate those worlds and see who are the different characters out there that are interesting.
