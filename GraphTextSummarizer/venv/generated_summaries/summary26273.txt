-- The brother of Florida child murder suspect Casey Anthony acknowledged Thursday that he tried to coax information out of his sister during jailhouse visits, but denied police put him up to it. During a videotaped jailhouse conversation shortly after his sister's arrest, Lee Anthony promised to keep secret any letter she sent him while she was being held in connection with the disappearance of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. "(Did) you tell your sister that if she gives you a letter through this letter system, that you won't share it with anyone if she doesn't want you to?" defense attorney Jose Baez asked Lee Anthony during the pretrial hearing Thursday. " Wednesday, Orange County Deputy Sheriff Ryan Eberlin said he handcuffed Anthony after he arrived at her parents' home following three 911 calls from the defendant's mother, Cindy Anthony. But Anthony said he was only trying to help find Caylee, whose body was found five months after her reported disappearance, and that police never forced him to do anything. Cindy Anthony has said she called police to accuse her daughter of theft after learning her granddaughter had been missing for a month, hoping to get her daughter thrown in jail in hopes of finding out what happened.
