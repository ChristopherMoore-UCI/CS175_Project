A court in Turkey this week sentenced two cartoonists to 11 months and 20 days in prison for insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils Mui≈ænieks, expressed his concern about the ruling against Penguen as well as the surge in criminal cases against people accused of insulting Erdogan. The ruling comes amid an increase in criminal cases lodged against journalists, students and public figures for "defamation against a public officer." Ann Harrison of freedom of press advocacy group PEN International told CNN, "We have long called for decriminalization of defamation, particularly of state officials, as to criminalize criticism of authorities severely stifles reporting and public debate. A defamation suit was filed against an August cover of Penguen in which a cartoon figure of Erdogan is welcomed to the presidential palace by a public servant.
