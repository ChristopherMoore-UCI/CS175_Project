"The Talk" co-host and wife of rocker Ozzy Osbourne went on a Twitter rant about the group's recent free release of its new album on iTunes. Or are you front row at another tragic fashion show?" and finished her tirade with "Jimmy Iovine, iTunes, U2, you're a bunch of megalomaniacs. In a deal that cost Apple a reported $100 million -- including fees to U2 and a marketing campaign for the album -- the Irish rockers released their first album in five years,"Songs of Innocence," through iTunes to every subscriber to the Apple service. "I do believe you have over half a billion subscribers to iTunes, so -- could you get this to them?" Bono talks U2's surprise album, 'Songs of Innocence' Apple offers a way to 'return' that free U2 album Osbourne is clearly not a fan and shared her irritation with her Twitter followers.
