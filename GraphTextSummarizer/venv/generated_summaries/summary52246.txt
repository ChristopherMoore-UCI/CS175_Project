In school shootings, patterns and warning signs The arrests come after investigators in the Connecticut elementary school shooting issued stern warnings to potential copycats. Last week, Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance warned that threats would be "investigated statewide and federally and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified." However, such arrests may prove difficult to prosecute, legal experts say. -- Two teens who, in separate incidents, threatened to carry out similar attacks as the massacre in Newtown were promptly arrested this week -- a sign that law enforcement officials have taken an aggressive no-tolerance approach against potential copycats. "This country is based on freedom of speech," said Ryan Calo, a law professor with the University of Washington. In California, Sergio Cabada posted messages online that he "both supported the actions of the school shooter in Connecticut and had thought of possibly committing similar acts," police in the city of Fairfield said.
