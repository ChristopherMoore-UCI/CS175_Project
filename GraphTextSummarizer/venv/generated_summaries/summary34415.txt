While many Iranians have grown disillusioned with the Islamic revolution, anti-American anger endures. There is a sound-proof meeting room, encrypted Telex machines -- one marked as belonging to the National Security Agency -- and the shredders said to have been used by embassy staff to destroy secret documents as the diplomatic facility fell to the revolutionaries. There are offices on the first floor, while exhibits are displayed on the second. Upon entering, the counter area where U.S. Marine guards had been posted when the embassy was seized is intact, as is the colorful tile work on some of the walls. Bright red murals cover the main stairway walls leading to the second floor.
