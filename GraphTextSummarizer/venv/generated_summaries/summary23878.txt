In true Twitter fashion, the social community soon asked why Eastwood should be having all the fun and decided to turn the spotlight back on themselves by snapping photos of their own empty chairs and tagging them #eastwooding. Olympian Mike Eruzione got choked up speaking about carrying the World Trade Center flag during the 2002 Opening Ceremony, but it was Romney talking about single rose his father would leave by his mother's bedside every day that had most eyes welling up, including Romney's. The Facebook page Invisible Obama (one of three) began posting photos of, wait for it, Invisible Obama doing things POTUS would. "After Clint Eastwood's chair, Romney is back stage feverishly making a sock puppet," wrote @rationalists One of Eastwood's most tweeted moments was his reference to crying when Obama was elected.
