-- At least 23 people were killed and dozens wounded in a series of attacks targeting Sunni areas across northern Iraq on Thursday, police officials told CNN. Sunni-Shiites frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. And in al-Adil, a Sunni neighborhood in western Baghdad, gunmen opened fire on a group of people in a residential area and killed two people, police said. Another 27 were wounded in the largely Sunni city, about 100 km (63 miles) north of Baghdad, police said. Mosul is a largely Sunni city about 360 km (224 miles) north of Baghdad.
