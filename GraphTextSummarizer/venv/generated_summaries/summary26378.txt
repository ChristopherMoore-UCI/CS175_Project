After receiving their degrees, more than 90% of our alumni returned home to become leaders in the public, non-profit, and private sectors in Africa, where they contributed to strengthening the foundation for African development. African diasporans, especially young people, can become the face of a "new Africa" -- educated, optimistic, and actively working to transform and shape Africa's future. Read this: 'New wind of change is blowing through Africa' With 23,000 AAI alumni worldwide, we proudly count prominent alumni such as Wangari Maathai, the late Kenyan environmental and women's rights activist and Nobel Laureate; Prime Minister H.E. Nahas Angula of Namibia; and President Joyce Banda of Malawi, among other distinguished African leaders. Harnessing the talents and expertise of the African Diaspora can help to bolster Africa's workforce development. Today, AAI offers rigorous professional development and leadership training programs through our African partner institutions to women and men who exhibit talent and leadership in key fields -- and who display a deep commitment to advancing to Africa's development.
