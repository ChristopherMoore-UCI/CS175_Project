In other words, the real news is no Oklahoma disaster relief bill exists and, as Reid says, "we don't need the money." Still, I have no objection to stating unequivocally that if FEMA runs out of money, I will encourage my colleagues to pay for any new assistance for Oklahoma, or anywhere else by reducing lower-priority spending rather than borrowing new money. Under congressional budget rules, if disaster funds are exhausted, Congress can pass an "emergency supplemental spending" bill that does not count against that year's budget caps. My position has been to oppose politicians who use disasters to spend money that has nothing to do with helping victims of disasters. There is no Oklahoma disaster relief bill. But my position has been the same for my entire service in Congress, starting when I pushed for offsets to the Oklahoma City bombing supplemental bill in 1995.
