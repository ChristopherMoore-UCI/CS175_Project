-- House Speaker John Boehner says he and President Barack Obama have a "pretty good relationship," but he also criticized Obama for fomenting what Boehner called "class warfare" in the political debate over spending, taxes and job creation. In an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC's "This Week" program, Boehner defended Republican opposition to efforts by Obama and Democrats to increase taxes on wealthy Americans as part of deficit reduction and job creation measures. "We are not going to engage in class warfare," Boehner said, adding: "The president's clearly trying to do it, and it's wrong." Republicans generally want to cut government spending and debt by shrinking the size of government and therefore oppose raising taxes or adding new tax revenue. "How much more do you want them to pay?" Obama has crafted a campaign theme of Republicans defending the wealthy against tax cuts as part of a narrative that Boehner said was intended to pit segments of society against each other. During negotiations with Obama this year on a possible comprehensive deficit reduction deal, Boehner reportedly agreed to as much as $800 billion in additional revenue as part of the package.
