The lion's share of U.S. drone missions are flown by Air Force pilots stationed at Creech, a tiny outpost in the barren Nevada desert, 20 miles north of a state prison and adjacent to a one-story casino. Which means they are supposed to be largely immune to viruses and other network security threats. Drone units at other Air Force bases worldwide have now been ordered to stop their use. More than 150 additional Predator and Reaper drones, under U.S. Air Force control, watch over the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Predator and Reaper crews use removable hard drives to load map updates and transport mission videos from one computer to another.
