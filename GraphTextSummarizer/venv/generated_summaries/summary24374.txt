According to E!, Harris and Burtka wore matching Tom Ford tuxedos at the wedding ceremony, which was officiated by their friend, "How I Met Your Mother" director and producer Pam Fryman, and included a performance from Elton John. Harris, who came out as "a very content gay man" in 2006, told Details magazine in 2012 that he thought he'd always be single -- until he came across fellow actor Burtka. "I'm infinitely grateful all those steps led to Mr. Burtka -- once we started talking, we never stopped. When New York legalized gay marriage in 2011, Harris said that he and Burtka, 39, had proposed to one another at least five years prior and had "been wearing engagement rings for ages." The 41-year-old actor revealed in a tweet on Monday that he and his partner of 10 years, David Burtka, exchanged vows in Italy on Saturday.
