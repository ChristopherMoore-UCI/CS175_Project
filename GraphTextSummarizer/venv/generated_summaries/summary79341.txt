Samuel David Crowe's death sentence was changed to life in prison by Georgia authorities, his attorney says. He spent his time behind bars counseling other inmates, teaching some of them to read and writing to people outside of prison who had drug habits. Crowe had a cocaine habit that his attorney says he kicked in prison. Crowe was convicted in 1988 of murdering Joseph V. Pala, the retail manager at Wicks Lumber Company in Douglas County. When attorney Ann Fort called Crowe with the news, he was quiet.
