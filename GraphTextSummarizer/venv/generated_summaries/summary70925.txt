"We're very excited about tablet computers," Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a television interview last year, "because they have great Web browsers, and they make it easier for people to shop at Amazon. " Factoring in projections for all of the e-books, music and video that customers will likely purchase for the device, Amazon is expected to turn a profit of $10 per Fire, iSuppli said in a statement. It could also heavily market the Amazon Prime club subscription to Fire customers. When factoring in marketing and other costs, Munster's estimate could jibe with iSuppli's. The company could make up for the losses with digital sales or physical products bought through its online store using the tablet.
