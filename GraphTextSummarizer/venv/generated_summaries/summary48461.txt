The Breakaway Brazil Facebook and the YouTube pages were filled Wednesday with tributes to Swanson from soccer fans around the world. "Someone should see to it that his ball makes it to the World Cup," Megan Cruz wrote on the page for Breakaway Brazil. That would be more than 6,700 miles of dribbling, from his home in Seattle to Sao Paulo, Brazil. Supporters want the ball Swanson was dribbling to be in Brazil. "Your name will never be forgotten by my dear Brazil," wrote Vanessa GonÃ§alves.
