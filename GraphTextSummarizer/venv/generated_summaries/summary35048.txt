Zellner believes that another big clue was a red car similar to a Chevrolet Cavalier parked outside the Fox home that night, before Kevin Fox and his children returned home. Fox spent eight months in jail, but DNA evidence from the rape kit conducted on Riley's body finally exonerated him. Kathleen Zellner, Fox's attorney, said that the crime scene was brutal and that the theory is that Riley was snatched from her home, sexually assaulted and then thrown from the bridge overlooking the river where she drowned. Fox searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their Wilmington, Illinois, home and then called police, according to authorities. "From the beginning, we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when Kevin got home with the kids that night, " Melissa Fox said.
