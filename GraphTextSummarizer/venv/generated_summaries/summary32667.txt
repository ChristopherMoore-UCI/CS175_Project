In Roseanne Barr's third book, "Roseannearchy: Dispatches from the Nut Farm," the comedian candidly discusses everything from her half-Jewish, half-Mormon upbringing in Salt Lake City, to the sitcom that made her world famous, to ex-husbands and owning her very own macadamia nut farm in Hawaii. "The fact that they found it and watched it is the best." Barr keeps in touch with most of her "Roseanne" cast mates and is delighted that the show -- which tackled hot-button issues that other shows wouldn't touch in its day -- remains relevant. " In his foreword, Barr's ex-husband recounts the years the couple spent (pre-kids, pre-fame) living in the mountains of Colorado in the 1970s. "A lot of good ideas were mined over and over and over from that show." Barr also said she was flattered that "Roseanne" was spoofed on "Family Guy," although she said didn't get to see the episode "because I never know when anything is on, so someone told me about it, but 'Family Guy' is a good show." When the subject turned to politics, Barr said, "I'm running for president of the United States and prime minister of Israel -- that's kind of a twofer -- on the Solutions Party and the Green Tea Party seeking solutions.
