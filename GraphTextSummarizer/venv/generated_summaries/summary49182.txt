Black Caviar's incredible run puts her equal with Desert Gold (1915 - 1917) and Gloaming (1919 - 1921) for consecutive victories on top-class Australian tracks (other horses have won more consecutive races on low-grade country tracks), although she is the only horse to win 19 without defeat. Royal approval: Will unbeatable Black Caviar grace Ascot? A decision on Dubai is expected to be made in the coming weeks, with Moody having already revealed that Black Caviar has had all her vaccinations for both the Middle East and England. If, as is widely expected, the lure of Dubai's $2 million Golden Shaheen proves too great a temptation to resist (there is a $600,000 bonus offered as part of the Global Sprint Challenge, rising to $1 million if she can win on three continents), it will mean Black Caviar's 20th race could be her toughest yet, pitting her against Sheikh Mohammed's super colt Sepoy. After yet another demonstration of her superiority over five furlongs (1,000 meters), there are few superlatives left to describe the extraordinary record of five-year-old Australian mare Black Caviar.
