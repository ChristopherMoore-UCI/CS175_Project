" History suggests the midterm electorate will be older and whiter than in a presidential year, something that would tilt the scales -- on health care and other issues -- in the GOP direction. But whether the improving numbers can be used to reshape the political climate as it relates to the health care law depends on whether Democrats on the ballot this year in competitive races have the courage to more forcefully rebut the Republican argument that the health care law is a disaster. Some of her appeal, though, is raw politics: She believes that Democrats who run from the health care law only help Republicans who are making it their focus in the midterm campaign. And the potency of the health care issue for the GOP comes into stark focus when you dig deeper into the demographic splits in the Pew data. In presidential years, when more younger voters and people of color turn out, the demographics favor Democrats.
