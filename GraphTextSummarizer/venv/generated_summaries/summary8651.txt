The majority of news reports on the problem have involved iPad purchases at Walmart, although other retailers are not immune. That same year in Vancouver, British Columbia, several iPad shoppers at Future Shop and Best Buy stores said they opened the Apple packaging to find plastic bags filled with modeling clay. Walmart's Gee recommends that iPad shoppers open the box and check the tablet carefully before making a purchase. Last November, a man in Miami accidentally gave his wife a fake iPad for her birthday, thinking he'd spent $480 on the real deal. If you're handing over cash for a heavily discounted iPad from some random guy in a McDonald's parking lot or at a gas station, then yes, you should consider your purchase a risk.
