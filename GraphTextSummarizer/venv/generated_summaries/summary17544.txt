" "Issuing mass death sentences whenever the case involves the killing of police officers now appears to be near-routine policy, regardless of facts and with no attempt to establish individual responsibility," Sahraoui added. "So far, 415 people have been sentenced to death in four trials for the killing of police officers, while the case against former President Hosni Mubarak, involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the uprising, has been dropped. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz reported from Abu Dhabi, journalist Sarah Sirgany  from Cairo, and CNN's Josh Levs from Atlanta.

It followed a massive, deadly crackdown by Egyptian forces on supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy.
