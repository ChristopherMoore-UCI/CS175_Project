There was a glimpse of goal for Messi a little under the quarter hour mark but his stabbed cross-shot was pocketed by Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. "I was nervous towards the end because we couldn't score and any mistake could have knocked us out," Argentina captain Messi told a press conference. But just as the thousands of Argentina fans inside the stadium prepared to hail their saviour once more, Benaglio flung out his right hand to make a superb save and ensure the game remained goalless. With the contest a matter of seconds away from penalties, the decisive blow was conjured between two men who operate at opposite ends of Spain's fiercest rivalry. Di Maria, who enjoyed such a stellar end of season with European Champions League winners Real Madrid, cut a profligate figure through the game, but tested Benaglio with a stinging drive from range.
