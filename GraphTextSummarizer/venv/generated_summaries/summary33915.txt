After a mere two days immersed in Chinese culture, Fei Bo and I combined our influences from east and west to create something new: a fusion of dancing cultures. So what they call classical Chinese dance is really only 10 or 20 years old and has bits of traditional ballet, a little bit of Kung Fu, a bit of contemporary dance, a bit of everything. Guided on her trip by a local rising star of Chinese contemporary dance, 34-year-old choreographer Fei Bo, Rojo said the experience will change how she thinks about performance forever. I'm not going to pretend that in one week I understand all the depth of Chinese culture or that I can really move my hands like a traditional Chinese dancer -- that would be naÃ¯ve and arrogant of me. Over the course of 10 days, the classically trained ballerina traveled from London to Beijing to immerse herself in the traditions of Chinese dance and create a brand-new piece inspired by this meeting of east and west.
