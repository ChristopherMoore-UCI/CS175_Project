The parents of missing U.S. serviceman Bowe Bergdahl led the Rolling Thunder ride in Washington on Sunday, trailed by the roar of what was estimated to be hundreds of thousands of motorcycles. But the last video was sent in February 2011, and it's unclear where Bergdahl is being held now, according to John Wagner, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. Bergdahl, a 26-year-old army sergeant, was captured in Afghanistan in 2009 after he finished his guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province. Kevin Coffey rode in on his Ultra Classic copper pearl Harley Davidson from North Carolina with the Rolling Thunder Chapter 7, the group that sponsored the Bergdahl's participation this year. Your state of Idaho has not forgotten you, and thanks to all of you here today, Washington D.C. has not forgotten you," his father, Robert Bergdahl, told a cheering crowd.
