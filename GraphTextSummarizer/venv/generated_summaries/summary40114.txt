Erik Ramsey shortly before a car crash left him "locked-in," able to think and reason but paralyzed except for his eyes That's how 24-year-old Erik Ramsey has spent the last eight years of his life. "Even sweat rolling down his skin or something, there's nothing he can do about it," said Eddie Ramsey, 57, Erik's father. His descriptions of life as a man who is paralyzed and mute gave Eddie Ramsey the first detailed account of what it must be for his son to live with locked-in syndrome. He invented an electrode that detects the neural signals in the speech motor area of Ramsey's brain. In December 2004, the electrode was implanted, and Kennedy, along with four independent labs, began decoding the signals in Ramsey's brain.
