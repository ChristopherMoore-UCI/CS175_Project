The divisive issue of same-sex marriage in California may become another landmark case taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court after federal appeals court judges refused Tuesday to revisit an earlier ruling. " "Millions of Californians who gave their time and treasure to protect marriage deserve better," said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage. California's Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in 2008, before Proposition 8 went before voters. Last month, a federal appeals court in Massachusetts struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act -- the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage -- as unconstitutional. In its split decision, the panel found that Proposition 8 "works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians" by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th Amendment.
