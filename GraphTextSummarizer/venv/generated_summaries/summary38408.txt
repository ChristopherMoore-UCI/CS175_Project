Kelly Cripe, a spokeswoman for Texas state lottery that is currently overseeing Mega Millions, said the day's sales in the 42 states plus the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, where the game is played, added up to $651,915,940. It ended up being a boon to many state coffers -- who reap some of the money from lottery sales -- not to mention those selling the tickets. Winners can also remain anonymous in Kansas, that state's lottery director Dennis Wilson said. While no one has yet stepped forward to claim the prize, Wilson had some advice for the winner or winners: Sign the back of the ticket. For winners in three states, all it took was a dollar to cash in and reap the rewards of Friday's record-setting Mega Millions jackpot.
