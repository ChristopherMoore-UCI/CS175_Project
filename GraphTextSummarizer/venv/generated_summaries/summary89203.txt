Visitors can also enjoy the hot chocolate bar, snap family Christmas photos and shop in the boutique for ornaments and other gifts. Daily tours show off the more than 20 designer Christmas trees and other colorful embellishments, with roving carolers, violinists and other performers making select nighttime tours even more joyous. Three of these decadent Gilded Age dwellings deck their halls each December for the annual Christmas at the Newport Mansions event, where festival goers can chat with jolly ol' Saint Nick (eggnog and cookies provided), attend evening concerts, capture pics of the gingerbread masterpieces created by local pastry chefs and more. The opulent "cottages" hosting holiday events are The Breakers, an Italian Renaissance-style palazzo finished in 1895 for Cornelius Vanderbilt II; The Elms, a summer house completed in 1901 for coal magnate Edward Julius Berwind; and Marble House, which was inspired by the Petit Trianon at Versailles and completed in 1892 for Mr. and Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt. The estate is even more enticing when embellished with fresh fruit, lush greenery and other Creole touches as it would have been in holidays past.
