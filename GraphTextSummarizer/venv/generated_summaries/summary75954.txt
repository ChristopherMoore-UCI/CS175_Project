Very, very interestingly, this comes at a time when the new president of Pakistan has, in fact, gone further than any previous Pakistani leader in saying they want to improve relations with India, in saying they want to jointly combat terrorism together. Certainly, Kashmir is a flashpoint for India and Pakistan, and really back in 2006, there were Islamic militants blamed for recent attacks. The one that came closest to pitting India against Pakistan was in 2001, when Islamic militants attacked the Parliament. CNN's Christiane Amanpour says India and Pakistan might be warming toward each other. Talk to me about why it would be in the interest of these people to sever this tie between Pakistan and India.
