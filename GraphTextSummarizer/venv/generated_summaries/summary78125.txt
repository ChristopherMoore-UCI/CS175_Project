-- The percentage of Americans who self-identify as favoring abortion rights has hit a record low of 41%, while those who consider themselves "pro-life" reached 50%, according to a new Gallup poll released Wednesday. "Pro-choice victories on ballot measures in states like Mississippi and South Dakota in the last few years, combined with the backlash against recent attacks on women's reproductive rights, are a clear sign that voters want to protect a woman's right to choose." CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report. First established in 1975, the survey asks if "abortion should be legal in all circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or illegal in all circumstances." Since 2001, the middle category has been chosen by about half of poll respondents, who far outnumber those who took either of the absolute choices. But abortion rights groups downplayed the labels' significance while also pointing to an apparently increased U.S. willingness to allow abortions in some circumstances. About 52% of those currently polled believe abortion should be legal under certain circumstances, a slight increase from last year's findings of 50%.
