-- Switzerland and Belgium will shake up the seedings ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup finals in Brazil. Belgium were also unbeaten in qualifying, finishing nine points of second place Croatia. Hosts Brazil and defending champions Spain, along with Germany, Argentina and Colombia are all seeded while England and Italy, both unbeaten in qualifying, narrowly miss out. The appearance of those two countries in the top bracket of seeds means it is possible that hosts Brazil could be drawn in a group with Italy, or Argentina with Netherlands. The 64-year-old, who has held the post since 2008, led the Swiss to a famous 1-0 win over world and European champions Spain at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
