" Hong Kong police arrested two brothers in connection with the incident. -- For the second time in a week, suspected Hong Kong organized crime syndicates -- known better as triads -- have targeted the production of "Transformers: Age of Extinction" being filmed in the Chinese territory. "The separate side of this is that the triad control of the movie industry in Hong Kong is a very complicated issue and has been in place for many years," added Vickers. "The two incidents associated with Transformers are indicative of low-level attempts to extort money from a big production by persons who may be triad members," said Steve Vickers, former head of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force's Criminal Intelligence Bureau and now CEO of Steve Vickers and Associates, a specialist political and corporate risk consultancy. Bay, 48, explained that every vendor that experienced disruptions from filming in the area "got paid a fair price for our inconvenience" but one man "wanted four times that amount" -- around $13,000 (100,000 Hong Kong dollars).
