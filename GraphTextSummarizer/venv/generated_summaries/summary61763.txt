"Due to the dynamics of North Korea with succession and the long history of this occurring, our concerns are that we're in a period of compressed time line for Kim Jong Il to train Kim Jong Un in these, in these coercive measures," Adm.

The location of the facility also would allow North Korea to launch a payload at an angle that would avoid an flight over other nations.

This site would allow them to do so but, the official cautioned, the site could also be used to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMS) which could pose a threat to the United States and other nations. However, we continue to call on North Korea to fulfill its international obligations; cease provocative behaviors; and take steps to improve relations with its neighbors," said Pentagon spokesman Col.
