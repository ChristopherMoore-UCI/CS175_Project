Newcastle United has fined their manager Alan Pardew £100,000 ($168,000) for head-butting an opposition player during an English Premier League match on Saturday. The 52-year-old clashed with Hull City midfielder David Meyler during Newcastle's 4-1 win at the KC Stadium. In a statement published on the club's official website, Saturday, Newcastle said that Pardew's actions were "disappointing" and "unacceptable" and took away from a positive performance on the pitch. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behavior today and also a Club fine of £100,000." Pardew, who has been manager of Newcastle since December 2010, will also be investigated by the English Football Association about the incident. "Alan unreservedly apologized immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United," the NUFC statement said.
