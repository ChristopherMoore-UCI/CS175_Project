-- On Tuesday, new Apple CEO Tim Cook is expected to help unveil Apple's latest iPhone at its first big event since co-founder Steve Jobs stepped aside in August. They also must continue Apple's logistics revolution, so that consumers don't have to wait forever to buy new Apple devices -- or turn instead to the competition. As Apple enters its next chapter, some of Cook's biggest practical challenges will include scaling production, deciding how to prioritize the company's existing businesses and figuring out which new businesses to enter -- such as making TVs. Right now, for example, Apple will have to ramp up production of millions of new iPhones, and possibly new iPods, for the holidays. So Cook will have to figure out how to become the type of company that can ship 500 million gadgets per year -- from staffing to product design to iCloud server infrastructure to components to manufacturing, sales and support.
