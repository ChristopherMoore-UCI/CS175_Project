"Thanks to one of the greatest singers ever, Rodriguez." Bendjelloul had likened the Oscar to winning his native country's Nobel Prize. -- Malik Bendjelloul, the acclaimed Swedish director who ran out of cash and finished shooting his Oscar-winning documentary "Searching for Sugar Man" with a smartphone app, died suddenly Tuesday in Stockholm, police said. "Searching for Sugar Man" is the story of Sixto Rodriguez, a singer from Detroit who became a legend in South Africa. "A man who lives his whole life in Detroit working as a construction worker, without knowing that, at the very same time, he's more famous than Elvis Presley in another part of the world," Bendjelloul told CNN's Poppy Harlow in 2012. "It was this lost masterpiece, like a Cinderella story, a fairy tale," Bendjelloul said of Rodriguez's life.
