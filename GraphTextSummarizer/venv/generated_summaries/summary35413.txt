And while there are lots of other unique workouts and quirky classes to be had at the gym nowadays, they're not for everyone. Logging an hour-long run on the treadmill may be great exercise, but it can be mind-numbingly dull. It's based on studies of high-intensity intermittent training by Japanese researcher Izumi Tabata. In his original 1996 study, Tabata monitored athletes as they cycled at their absolute highest intensity — 170% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) — for 20 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of rest. If followed correctly, Tabata should fatigue even the most fit gym bunnies.
