The report, titled " 'Welcome to hell fire': Torture and other ill-treatment in Nigeria" alleges that abuse is so widespread that many police stations have an informal "officer in charge of torture" and that some police sections have special rooms, or "torture chambers" where it is carried out. " "Torture or ill-treatment is not, repeat, not an official policy of the Nigeria Police," said Emmanuel Ojukwu, force public relations officer and acting commissioner of police, in a statement. In the study, released Thursday, the rights group alleges systemic use of torture by the police, based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over the course of 10 years. "Across the country, the scope and severity of torture inflicted on Nigeria's women, men and children by the authorities supposed to protect them is shocking to even the most hardened human rights observer. " Belay called for Nigeria's Parliament to take the "long overdue step" of passing a law to criminalize torture, which is banned under the country's constitution and international treaties.
