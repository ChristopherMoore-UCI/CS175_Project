One wall is lined with gang monikers and symbols, the other with bongs for smoking marijuana and other drugs -- one even shaped like a skull. Chicago gang activity extends more than 60 miles into the Illinois city's suburbs for narcotics and weapons trading. The tattoo parlor was the brainchild of Richmond County Sheriff Ron Strength, who wanted to snuff out gangs carrying out violent crimes in his east Georgia community. The ATF, he said, has seen one of the most dramatic increases in gang activity in the last three years and is cracking down.
