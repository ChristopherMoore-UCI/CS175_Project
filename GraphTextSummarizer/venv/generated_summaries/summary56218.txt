Android smartphone market share trails iPhone market share by a scant 9 percentage points in a recent study from analysis giant Nielsen. Last month, Nielsen's stats showed that Android was the preferred platform of new smartphone buyers, suggesting that big-budget marketing campaigns for devices such as the Droid lineup and HTC's Evo were paying off. According to statistics on overall U.S. market share, Android is the single fastest-growing mobile platform. Nevertheless, these stats still show iOS devices as the leading smartphones in the Android-versus-iPhone battle. And we're sure it won't be too long before Android and iOS are neck-and-neck in competing for smartphone dominance.
