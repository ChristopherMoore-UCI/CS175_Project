Saturday's disorder erupted after a Cairo court confirmed death sentences previously handed down to 21 defendants in the Port Said soccer riot case and sentenced more than 20 others to prison terms, state media said. A majority of the victims in the stadium rampage -- where fans went at each other with rocks, chairs, knives and swords -- were Cairo fans. The sentences have prompted anger in both cities, with some protesters in Port Said believing they are too harsh and others in Cairo convinced they do not go far enough. Some complained that justice for Port Said was sacrificed to placate Cairo. Journalists Ian Lee and Adam Makary reported from Cairo, Nada Wassef from Port Said and CNN's Salma Abdelaziz from Atlanta.
