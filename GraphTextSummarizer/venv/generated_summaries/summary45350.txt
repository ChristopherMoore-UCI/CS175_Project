Importantly, federal law does not protect LGBT persons from discrimination by private actors, and neither does Indiana state law. In essence, this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the RFRA: absent local nondiscrimination laws, persons are free in Indiana to discriminate against LGBT persons on any basis. Another possibility would be to amend the statute to confirm that any federal, state, or local nondiscrimination laws constitute a compelling state interest for the purposes of the RFRA. The adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests, and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it, so they are the least restrictive means. The result: the bill's sponsors tabled it, noting that the exception for local nondiscrimination laws would "gut" the bill.
