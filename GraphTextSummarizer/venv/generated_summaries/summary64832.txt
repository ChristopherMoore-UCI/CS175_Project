Israel has identified Sudan as one of the countries through which weapons are smuggled to Hamas and other militant groups operating in the Palestinian territory of Gaza, and to Hezbollah in Lebanon. -- Sudan on Wednesday blamed Israel for an airstrike that killed two people near the coastal city of Port Sudan. He argued that Israel doesn't want Sudan removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told an Israeli reporter in 2009 that "Iran is using all resources and footholds for shipping weapons to Lebanon," and that includes Sudan. Sudanese authorities said that Israel struck a Gaza-bound arms convoy in Sudan two years ago, an attack that killed 39 people.
