"Running the race with the world's top-rated sprinter, Black Caviar, representing Australia in what is historically Europe's most international race would be a wonderful way to begin a new era for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes," said an Ascot spokesman. Foaled in 2006, the five-year-old bay had only been lightly-raced in her two, three and four-year-old seasons, but she has been busier this campaign with connections now aiming for the glamor Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot for her first foray on English soil. But first Black Caviar must overcome her next immediate challenge: Saturday's meet could pit her once again against her principal rival, Hay List -- the only horse who has given her a run for her money so far in Australia, and a top sprinter in his own right. Black Caviar's annihilation of the rest of the field in Saturday's Orr Stakes in Melbourne matched the feats of legendary 18th century racehorse Eclipse, putting them joint third in the all-time list of undefeated thoroughbreds. Frankel aside, all eyes in the Black Caviar camp are surely trained on the ultimate prize of Royal Ascot, with a possible stopover in the Middle East en route for the Dubai World Cup also thought to be on the cards.
