-- Oscar Pistorius spoke to a friend of Reeva Steenkamp's in a "very sinister tone" Tuesday, asking her: "How can you sleep at night?" There is no dispute that Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp in his home early on the morning of Valentine's Day 2013. They testified that Pistorius was desperate to save Steenkamp's life after he shot her. And I feel it," said Stander, who was the first person Pistorius called after killing Steenkamp. Prosecutor Nel tore into Pistorius over five days in court in April, saying the Paralympic medalist had argued with Steenkamp and killed her on purpose.
