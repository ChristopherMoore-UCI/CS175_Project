Most of the Chinese drywall, they say, ended up in southwest Florida during the housing boom, where it was used in new housing developments. " Massachi and her family are among homeowners in more than a dozen states who allege Chinese drywall has emitted corrosive gases they believe have given them health problems. Prices were sky high, and the country was hit by two active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, increasing the demand for home repairs.

Some was also used in remodeling projects all over the country, so the number of homes affected is difficult to calculate.
