iReport.com: Share your story of gender change Doctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined what in the biological makeup determines that gender. Some say changing genders is one of the best things they've done, like Jamison Green, 60, author of "Becoming a Visible Man," who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery. While still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. "Some of it is that I'm not exerting so much energy hiding myself." Psychologists recommend that people who change genders adopt a "transgendered identity," and not keep their history of transition a secret. Some states require people to show proof of a medical procedure before changing gender on documents such as driver's licenses, while others require that the person has taken hormones, Kraft said.
