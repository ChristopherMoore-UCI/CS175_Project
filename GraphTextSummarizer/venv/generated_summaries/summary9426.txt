" California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon also isn't interested, his spokesman said. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein told reporters in the Capitol on Thursday she thinks there's "a high likelihood" that Newsom and Villaraigosa will run, and that she's heard of a few House members interested in the race as well. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California became emotional during a press conference on Thursday when a reporter asked her about Boxer's announcement. "The first thing we should do today is thank Senator Barbara Boxer for being a powerful champion for our city, state and nation in the United States Senate," Garcetti said in a statement. Sen. Barbara Boxer announced Thursday that she will not run for reelection in 2016, setting up a big money political battle for her seat in the nation's most populous state.
