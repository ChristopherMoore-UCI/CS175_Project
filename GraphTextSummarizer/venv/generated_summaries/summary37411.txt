My DIY skills have come a long way -- making scarves, wine, soap and toothpaste, though it seems like whittling sticks when compared to the possibilities of open hardware and digital manufacturing. Makeblock: open source 'Lego for adults' For a year, I'm using or developing products and projects that are shared under open licenses, made to be copied or built upon by others -- which also means not buying any traditionally copyrighted or patented products. The online sharing of 3D files allows people around the world to collaborate and create intricate physical objects using laser cutters, 3D printers and CNC mills. Over time that initial little moment of wonder grew into a fascination with the culture around shared information - code and designs that can be studied, modified, and redistributed by anyone, for any purpose.
