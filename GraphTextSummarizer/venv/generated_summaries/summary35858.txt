As the largest crocodile in New South Wales, Elvis has exceptionally big teeth, keepers say, with the largest measuring 9 centimeters in length (3.5 inches). The five-meter (16-foot) beast, who lives at the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby, near Sydney, apparently became enraged when two noisy mowers were taken into his enclosure at the same time, a keeper told CNN affiliate 7 News. The 50-year-old reptile was given a home in the park in 2008, after causing trouble in Darwin harbor by climbing onto fishing boats, according to the Australian Associated Press. He then guarded his new prize until a couple of brave keepers jumped into the enclosure to retrieve the mower and two teeth that he lost in the process! An Australian crocodile named Elvis took matters into his own hands -- or rather, jaws -- Wednesday when he became annoyed by the sound of a lawnmower.
