It seems iPads hold their value pretty well, especially if they have papal connections One that Pope Francis once owned just sold for $30,500, according to Castells, an auction house in Uruguay. "His Holiness Francisco" and "Vatican Internet Service, March 2013" were engraved on the back in Spanish and Italian. The proceeds will go to a school in Montevideo, Uruguay. Last year, the Pope donated a Harley-Davidson that he was given to charity. It's not the first time a papal hand-me-down has gone for big bucks.
