Berle said Obama's stance on gay marriage didn't match that of most Americans. Obama spoke of growing tolerance measured, he said, by ordinary Americans: "A father realizes he doesn't just love his daughter but also her wife." Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said after the speech that Obama reaffirmed commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. "As all Americans are becoming open to marriage equality, the president is taking a retreat," Berle said. " Wolfson, along with other organizations advocating for legal same-sex marriages, said the Obama administration had made significant progress on some issues, but that support for marriage equality was still an important goal. The president currently supports same-sex civil unions, and has said his views on gay marriage are "evolving."
