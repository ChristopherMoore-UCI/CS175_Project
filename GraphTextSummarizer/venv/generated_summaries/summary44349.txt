The 2010 world champion, who finished first in the season-opening Qatar MotoGP, narrowly beat compatriot Dani Pedrosa on a Honda in a time of one minute 39.532 seconds. Lorenzo and Pedrosa battled for the fastest time throughout qualifying but it was Lorenzo who finished on top bettering Pedrosa's fastest lap time at the circuit set back in 2010. Yamaha rider Jorge Lorenzo notched up his 46th career pole position on Saturday at qualifying for the Spanish MotoGP in Jerez. Defending world champion Casey Stoner of Australia will start Sunday's race in fifth. You had to pay a lot of attention, it would have been easy to crash and get injured," Lorenzo said.
