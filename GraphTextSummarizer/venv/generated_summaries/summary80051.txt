Klasfeld, a commercial and music video director, says his first love is viral videos. But it's not really a school play, says producer Marc Klasfeld of Rockhard Films. "I love the aesthetics, and it's a brand new avenue of expression for filmmakers to express themselves freely," says Klasfeld, whose previous video statements include "Hammer Pants Dance" for A&E, featuring a group of people invading a clothing store in gold lame "Hammer pants" -- a la M.C. Hammer, circa 1989 -- and dancing, much to the surprise of shoppers. "What's interesting to me and my wife is that the video is shocking, yet everyday, we have to guard what our children view from television commercials or video game violence," he said. With two young children, Klasfeld said the issue of what is and isn't permissible in media content is a key issue.
