-- A 13th-century painting that was up for auction by Sotheby's is now in the hands of the U.S. government after it was determined to have allegedly been stolen from a safe deposit box in Switzerland in 1986, according to court documents. Sotheby's had described it as sharing "an affinity with models by Duccio di Buoninsegna" (a painter of that time from the Tuscan city of Siena) but concluded that it was more likely the work of a Florentine painter influenced by Cimabue (a pioneer in the post-Byzantine style who was a contemporary of Duccio), according to documents cited in a forfeiture complaint filed this week in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Shortly after the listing, Sotheby's performed its regular background check on the piece and discovered that it was in a database of stolen art, according to a Sotheby's statement to CNN Wednesday. Sotheby's says it "immediately and voluntarily" removed the painting from auction and has "cooperated fully with the investigation." An Interpol investigation began in 1991, but the painting was never found until it turned up listed on Sotheby's for auction earlier this year, according to the complaint.
