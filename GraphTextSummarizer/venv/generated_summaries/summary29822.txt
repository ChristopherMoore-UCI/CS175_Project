The search giant has confirmed to tech blog Engadget that it is testing a system that would offer video chats with doctors to people whose search terms involve medical symptoms. Doctors are famously frustrated by patients who search for symptoms online. While there are quality sites out there, such open-ended searches can convince people they're sicker than they really are, and more dubious sites can offer sketchy advice about how to treat the symptoms. People using Google to search for information about their medical problems may soon get another source of information: a real-time chat with a doctor. Here you can find health care providers who you can visit with over video chat.
