But other highly publicized, vicious attacks on women and girls have not had such triumphant outcomes. "Empowering and educating girls and women and leveraging their talent and leadership fully in the global economy, politics and society are thus fundamental elements of succeeding and prospering in an ever more competitive world."

Increasingly the world is recognizing the value and the contributions of girls and women. No less than investment oracle Warren Buffett made that very case recently, referring to the United States, which has seen its share of less brutal attempts to hold women back.
