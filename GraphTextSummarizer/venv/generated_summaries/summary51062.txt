Staffers checking mail in the Tucson, Arizona, office of U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva on Thursday found a white, powdery substance and drawings of two swastikas inside an envelope, Grijalva campaign spokesman Adam Sarvana told CNN. Those tests came back negative midday Friday, according to FBI Special Agent Manuel Johnson. "It's just a continuation of a problem we've been having," Grijalva told CNN affiliate KVOA. I feel concerned for the constituents that come to that office," Grijalva told KVOA Thursday. Scientists at an FBI laboratory in Phoenix, Arizona, conducted a full analysis of the substance, according to Sarvana.
