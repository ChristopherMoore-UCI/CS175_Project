Mladic, wanted in connection with the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, Bosnia in 1995, among other crimes, was captured in May after 15 years in hiding. Mladic led Bosnia Serb forces in the civil war that broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina when Yugoslavia dissolved in the early 1990s. The court, however, denied media reports Mladic had collapsed, and refused to comment on reports he had pneumonia. The Tribunal continues to provide Mladic, as any other detainee, with the best possible medical care and attention available in The Netherlands," spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic said in a statement. Prosecutors want to try the former general in two separate cases, they said in August -- once over the Srebrenica massacre and once for spreading terror in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and for taking UN personnel hostage.
