As mental health is a global issue so, sadly, is mental health stigma, shame and discrimination. Talking about mental health can make a big difference and social contact -- which is where people with and without mental health problems come together to have a conversation -- is an extremely powerful approach in breaking down the taboo around the issue. On World Mental Health Day, around the globe many of us, perhaps hundreds of thousands or even millions, will be raising awareness of mental health issues to challenge outdated views, and to put an end to life-limiting, and sometimes life-threatening, stigma and discrimination that's still attached to having a mental health problem in so many countries and communities. In Britain, the figures show that one in four of us will be affected by mental health problems, yet despite touching the lives of so many, people still come up against negative reactions when they disclose their illness, which makes speaking out and seeking the support they need much harder than it needs to be. In reality, nine in 10 people tell us at Time to Change that they face stigma and discrimination because of their mental health problem.
