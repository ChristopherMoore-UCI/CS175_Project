For ten months, protestors have gathered at HSBC's headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district to air their grievances against corporate greed and social inequality But on Monday, a Hong Kong court ruled in favor of HSBC's request to remove protesters camped by the entrance of its Asia-Pacific headquarters. "Nowadays, most Hong Kong people aren't happy," Ho said. The order to evict Occupy protestors in Hong Kong comes a week after police cleared Occupy Frankfurt's encampment outside the European Central Bank's headquarters. "We welcome the decision of the court," HSBC spokesperson Gareth Hewett wrote in an email, adding that protesters will have two weeks to clear out before the bank intervenes. "The workers work for their whole lives for Hong Kong but they don't have money to buy food." Chin Tang, an active Occupy Central member who works as a freelance graphic designer, said the protest sends a crucial anti-capitalist message to a city that is fueled by finance.
