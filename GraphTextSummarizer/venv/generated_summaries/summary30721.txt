But they were given a tough fight by underdogs Italy, who were inspired by an 80,000 crowd in a stadium normally reserved for Serie A giants Inter and AC Milan. The New Zealand All Blacks gave their nation double reason for cheer with a 20-6 win Italy before a massive crowd at the San Siro in Milan. South Africa's points came from Morne Steyn with a penalty and drop-goal as well as converting a fine try by captain John Smit. Italy briefly led as former Australian rugby league international Craig Gower kicked a penalty. Johnnie Beattie and Graeme Morrison went over for tries for Scotland at Murrayfield.
