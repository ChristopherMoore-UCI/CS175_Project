Their assertions are dubious as a legal matter because of the very weak support for the "inherent authority" notion and because, in the area of immigration, the states lack even the right to duplicate federal law word-for-word. Sen. Russell Pearce and others who support the bill are now arguing it does nothing but reiterate existing federal law and that the law is legitimate because police officers always had "inherent authority" to enforce federal immigration law. They and other proponents have at various times maintained, in more or less blatant contradiction of their rhetorical defense of the law's constitutional propriety, that SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen Arizona. Yet, California not only paid a lot of state lawyers to defend these suits -- and ultimately paid much of the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees as well -- but also had to divert bureaucrats throughout state government from their other tasks to analyze and plan how to implement a law that could never be implemented. Indeed, what we have seen since Friday is the usual pivot by those who propose and support unconstitutional laws like SB 1070.
