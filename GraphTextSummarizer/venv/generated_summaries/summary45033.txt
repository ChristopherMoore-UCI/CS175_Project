She shot a 1980 photograph of a nude John Lennon hugging his clothed wife, Yoko Ono, that appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone and two cover shots for Vanity Fair of actress Demi Moore, one showing the nude actress seven months pregnant, the other showing the nude actress with a suit painted on her body. Vanity Fair spokeswoman Beth Kseniak also defended the pictures, which are posted on the magazine's Web site and are being published in the June issue. She gets this puppy dog look and you're like, 'O.K.' " A Disney Channel spokesman, Patti McTeague, said in a statement released Sunday that the photos were meant to sell magazines.
