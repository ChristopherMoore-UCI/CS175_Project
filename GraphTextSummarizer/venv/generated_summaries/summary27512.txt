TSA screeners put inspection notices in bags they didn't inspect TSA reprimands bag screeners over job performance at Boston airport Speedier trip through airport security could come within a decade TSA behavior detection officers will be retrained after profiling complaints And last year, 36 checked-bag screeners in Hawaii were fired after they were caught on a security camera in 2010 ignoring procedures, including putting bag inspection notices in bags without actually inspecting them, an inspector general's report said. The punishment marks the largest removal and suspension of TSA officers in the agency's history, and part of a larger internal crackdown on improper behavior by TSA agents. In June, the same investigation prompted the agency to fire eight checked-baggage screeners at Newark for violating TSA procedures, including some of them for sleeping on the job. After passengers check their bags, TSA screeners are supposed to search the luggage with electronic scanners and open some bags by hand.
