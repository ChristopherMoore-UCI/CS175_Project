Congress can: -- Spur clean energy innovation, manufacturing, deployment, and export through an ambitious renewable electricity standard, extensions of the successful Treasury grant program (1603) and Section 48c manufacturing tax credit, and by establishing a Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA, or "Green Bank") to leverage private sector investment for the deployment of clean energy. Even without comprehensive climate and clean energy legislation, the next Congress can take concrete steps to strengthen the U.S. market for clean energy, providing critical stability and certainty for investors, business, and consumers. If Congress chooses the collaboration path, members can tackle one issue that will enhance our national security, create jobs and help stabilize the climate --an issue with bipartisan roots that touches every corner of this nation: clean energy. In turn, these actions will lower costs to consumers, create jobs, and spur an export market for innovative energy technologies. We have no long-term clean energy plan, and so we have few domestic clean energy technologies or industries.
