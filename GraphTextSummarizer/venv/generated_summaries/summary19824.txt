A Missouri State Highway Patrol officer found the remains Tuesday evening along a ditch northeast of Hornersville, Missouri, about 8 to 10 miles from the girl's home in Senath, said Dunklin County Prosecuting Attorney Stephen Sokoloff said. In a statement, Dunklin County Sheriff Bob Holder thanked the community for its assistance. Earlier Tuesday, 43-year-old Shawn Morgan of Senath appeared in court. According to a probable cause affidavit dated Saturday, police interviewed Morgan on Friday at the police department in Kennett, a larger community about 10 miles northeast of Senath. -- Authorities have found what they believe to be the remains of Breeann Rodriguez, a 3-year-old Missouri girl whose neighbor told police he had suffocated the girl with a plastic bag and then tossed her from a highway.
