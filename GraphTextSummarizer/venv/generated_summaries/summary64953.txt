Local control has always been an essential right of education in America, but there was a growing problem: When different states with different standards and different tests proliferated, we ended up with unreliable measures of how our children are really doing. So began the coordinated effort from governors, educators and legislators to compose benchmarked standards that would be the same across state lines. While various questions about Common Core and its implementation persist, such as how to handle data privacy or concerns that some of the standards may not be rigorous enough, individual states have the right and ability to craft their own supplemental solutions. These exams highlighted how the performance of American students differed widely between states and districts. Some of the criticisms leveled against Common Core stem from mistakes made in local implementations -- not from a uniform federal mandate.
