But men yelling "Iron my shirt" at a campaign rally, cable news pundits associating Clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing Hillary Clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections, partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know. "If Hillary Clinton can't win an election," potential female candidates will ask, "How can I?" Hillary Clinton finally answered the question we've all been asking for years: Will she run for president in 2016? Too often, we treat Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power. The Clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address, which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes.
