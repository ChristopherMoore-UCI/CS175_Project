Goo.gl was originally a proprietary way for Google to abbreviate its Web addresses within services such as Google News (for saving article links) or Google Maps (for sending a location). Google says it is also using special provisions to prevent blind links from leading to malware or dangerous websites. TinyURL has been abbreviating Web addresses for nearly a decade, and the advent of Twitter has encouraged more sophisticated abbreviators, like bit.ly, which allow people to organize and search through their saved links. Now Google hopes to revolutionize the Web address shortening arena with Goo.gl, now available to the public through its website at http://goo.gl. -- Web-page addresses can be notoriously long, but even the normal ones seem absolutely huge in our age of Twitter and text messaging.
