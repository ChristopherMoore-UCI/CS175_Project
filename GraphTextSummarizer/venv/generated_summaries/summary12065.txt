Barrino was treated at a Charlotte hospital for a "sleep aid" overdose several days after Cook's wife filed her child custody petition in Mecklenburg County District Court in August. Barrino's controversial relationship with Antwaun Cook led his wife, Paula Cook, to accuse the "American Idol" winner of wrecking her marriage and stealing her husband. -- Fantasia Barrino testified in her boyfriend's child custody case in a Charlotte, North Carolina, court Monday, according to a court spokesman. Barrino publicly acknowledged the relationship last summer, but she insisted then that she did not know Cook was a married man. Paula Cook alleged in a court filing that her husband and Barrino engaged in a year-long affair in which her husband enjoyed "the lavish benefits associated with the high-profile relationship."
