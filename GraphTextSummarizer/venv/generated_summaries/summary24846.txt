"We've also started doing what we call a family fun and food night, which is once a month families come and gather and have a fun meal together," da Silva said. There are newly needy families, and what I mean by that are families who have had jobs, who have had one- or two-parent incomes, who have had a home, might have even been small donors to the Relief Nursery or volunteered their time here. The Relief Nursery, whose primary mission is helping children and families with a history of abuse and neglect, was trying to combat the hunger problem, only to have its mobile food bank recently destroyed by vandals. "And we served over 1,000 children last year," da Silva said at the Eugene facility. What we're finding in Oregon is that early childhood and family hunger is drastically increased.
