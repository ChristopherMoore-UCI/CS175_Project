Despite a global search none of the suspects Dubai police identified as Mossad agents has been prosecuted and few are holding their breath for a breakthrough in the case. Closed circuit cameras in Dubai hotels and airports infamously captured the last known movements of al-Mabhouh and those of his assassins leading Dubai police to assert that they were 100% certain that the Mossad was behind the plot. " Refaeli, who is one of Israel's best-known international faces, says she grew up hearing stories about the exploits of Mossad agents, but she acknowledges the sensitivity of the subject matter and works hard to avoid the politics. The scene -- loosely based on a true story -- is being played out on the set of a new Israeli film called "The Javelin," showcasing the unsolved murder of Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel room more than two years ago. This is not the first time the Dubai killing has served as grist for Israeli popular culture.
