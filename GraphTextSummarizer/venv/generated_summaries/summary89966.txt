-- With lights, floats and flying, Russia kicked off the opening ceremony in Sochi as the world turns its attention to the costliest Olympic Games in history. That's more than four times over budget and surpasses the cost of Beijing's 2008 Summer Games -- making it the most expensive Olympics ever, summer or winter. PREPARATIONS When Russia bid to host its first Winter Olympics in 2007, a document quoted an expected cost of around $12 billion. Russia had less than seven years to transform what was a fairly low-key seaside resort town into a Winter Olympics venue. SECURITY Russia has drafted 37,000 police and security officers to handle security in Sochi, but that has not done much to assuage fears.
