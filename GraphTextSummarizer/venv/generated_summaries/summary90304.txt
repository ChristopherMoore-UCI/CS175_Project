Obama has been holding regular meetings with his war council to develop options for sending more troops to Afghanistan. " Obama said if he were concentrating on re-election, he wouldn't be tackling politically hot topics such as health care and education reform, development of a clean-energy economy and the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. "We have a vital interest in making sure that Afghanistan is sufficiently stable, that it can't infect the entire region with violent extremism," Obama said. Last week, the president told the group -- comprising top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended and then asked for revisions to options he previously received, a senior administration official said at the time. -- A little more than a year after his election, President Obama said his administration has laid the groundwork for success on global and domestic matters.
