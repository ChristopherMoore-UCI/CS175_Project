Bangladesh are also facing political turmoil following the mutiny of border security forces group Bangladesh Rifles in the capital that left more than 70 dead. "The BCB has been in touch with Sri Lanka Cricket, Pakistan Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council and has voiced its alarm at the incident. " Pakistan board chairman Ijaz Butt has urged International Cricket Council hierarchy to wait at least 12 months before considering whether or not to move 2011 World Cup games away from his country. Pakistan are scheduled to co-host the World Cup along with India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. "It would be too unjust to doubt Pakistan's ability to host the 2011 World Cup in the wake of terrorists attack on the Sri Lankan team," PA Sport quoted Butt as saying.
