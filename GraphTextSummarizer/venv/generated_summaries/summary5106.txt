According to a motion filed last year by Maharaj's attorneys, a "Colombian drug cartel member confirmed that the Moo Young murders were committed at the behest of Pablo Escobar." "The Moo Youngs were laundering money for the Colombian cartels," the defense motion said. Krishna "Kris" Maharaj, 75, was not in court when Judge William Thomas said, "This court fully weighed the materiality, relevance and inconsistencies of the newly discovered evidence, and concludes that such evidence falls dramatically short of establishing that the murders were committed by anyone other than Mr. Maharaj. From luxury living to prison bars It was October 1986, when police arrested Maharaj -- an international food importer and newspaper owner -- in the shooting deaths of his business partners, Derrick Moo Young and his 23-year-old son. An ex-cartel member confirmed that "Maharaj was not involved in the murders of the Moo Youngs, and that they had to be eliminated because they had lost Colombian drug money," according to the defense motion. A hearing was held in November to determine whether new evidence from Maharaj's lawyers "undermines confidence in the verdict," according to court documents.
