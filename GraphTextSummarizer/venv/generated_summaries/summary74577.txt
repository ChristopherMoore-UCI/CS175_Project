" Title leader Alonso fit for Monza after Belgian Grand Prix horror crash Two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel capitalized on the chaos of the Spa pileup to finish second at the Belgian GP and move ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in the overall standings, cutting Alonso's advantage by 10 points. " Button wins in Belgium in race marred by spectacular first corner crash Alonso viewed six drivers -- Red Bull's Vettel and Webber, Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus, as well as McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button -- as threats to his chances of a first crown since he won for the second successive year with Renault in 2006. "We know in some races the McLaren will look strong and win the race and in some races we will be strong and win the race, and in some others it will be Red Bull," said Alonso, who will be fit for Ferrari's home race at Monza after recovering from injuries sustained in a spectacular crash at Spa on Sunday. Alonso hopes that home advantage will give Ferrari an added edge at Monza. Ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, the 31-year-old Alonso leads the standings by 24 points despite not getting past the first corner in Belgium last weekend.
