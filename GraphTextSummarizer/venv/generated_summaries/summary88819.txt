-- Sporting a head bandage after a painful earlier clash it just had to be Martin Skrtel to perform injury time heroics to salvage a vital 2-2 draw for Liverpool against Arsenal Sunday. Referee Michael Oliver had added nine minutes of extra time -- ironically most of it as a result of the injury suffered by Skrtel after being accidentally caught by the studs of Olivier Giroud. Then up stepped Skrtel to power the equalizer, but there was still time for Santi Cazorla to almost put Arsenal ahead again, his effort pushed away by Brad Jones. With Luis Suarez leaving for Barcelona, this season has been a struggle, increasing the pressure on manager Brendan Rodgers, but Skrtel's late brave intervention could prove a turning point. But the lead was short lived and Debuchy leveled with a header just before half time.
