"Jean was an inspiration and an innovator who leaves behind a legacy and program that has positively impacted the health and well-being of millions of people around the world," said Jim Chambers, president and CEO Weight Watchers International. " Through the program of regular weigh-ins, peer support and accountability, not only did Nidetch lose 72 pounds, but she inspired millions more to shed pounds too. What would become Weight Watchers started as a group of friends meeting in her Queens, New York, living room in 1961. "It is our honor and responsibility to carry on her legacy to help more people to transform their lives." The founder of Weight Watchers died Wednesday at her home in Florida.
