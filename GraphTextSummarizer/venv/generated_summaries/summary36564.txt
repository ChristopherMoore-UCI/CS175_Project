"We all have a sense of the fact that slaves worked in fields and as domestic workers," but Lilienfeld adds that there are items on display that show that people forced into slavery were also painters, sculptors and poets. "There are so many stories in American history," says museum curator Bonnie Lilienfeld. "I think one of the main things we want visitors to walk away with is that they're part of American history," says Lilienfeld. Another item that dates back to America's beginnings is a suit once worn by founding father Benjamin Franklin. "The public hasn't even seen this yet," says Lilienfeld.
