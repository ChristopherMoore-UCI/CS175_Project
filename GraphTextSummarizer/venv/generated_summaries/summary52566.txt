-- "Talladega Nights" actor Luke Bigham, 20, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence harassment after a fight between him and his mother, Lorrie Crumley, on July 8. Bigham is best known for his role as the 10-year-old version of Will Ferrell's character, "Ricky Bobby," in the 2006 comedy "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby." When police arrived at the scene, Crumley, 42, said she was in pain from the attack, but did not wish to get medical attention. Bigham's most recent work was on HBO comedy "Eastbound & Down" in 2009. In that case, Bigham turned himself in to Trussville City Jail, where he was later released on a $1,000 bond.
