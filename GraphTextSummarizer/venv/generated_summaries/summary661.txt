The Seoul government pointed the finger at Pyongyang, citing similarities in code used in earlier cyber attacks by South Korean nationals in collaboration with hackers believed to be connected with a North Korean intelligence agency, South Korea's prosecutor's office said in a press release.

It is essential to train cyber security experts in all fields including those who will be working for commercial companies," said Lee, a prominent name in the South Korean hackers community. They are taking part in a six-month program organized by the South Korean government to train some of the brightest code-breaking minds to become the nation's first line of defense in the war against cyber crime. South Korea, which is one of the most Internet-connected nations in the world, is frequently subject to cyber attacks, especially from its northern neighbor, with whom it is still technically at war.
