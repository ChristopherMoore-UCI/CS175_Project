In 2004, we launched People for Children, our principal project, to provide education and solutions for international efforts to eliminate child trafficking. To prevent these crimes, we launched Navega Protegido.org, an online bilingual child safety website, that provides tools to protect children from pornography and sexual exploitation. I thank CNN's Heroes initiative for allowing the Ricky Martin Foundation to share and engage others in our commitment to end the exploitation of children by human trafficking and modern-day slavery. The pioneering investigation documents that too many minors in Puerto Rico are at risk of becoming exploited as sex slaves, as slave labor or used in pornography. We are developing our first Child Development and Prevention Center in Puerto Rico to serve as a safe haven for children and young people.
