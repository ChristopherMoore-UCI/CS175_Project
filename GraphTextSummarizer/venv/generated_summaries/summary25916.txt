Noting that civil rights leader Dorothy Height, who died Tuesday, had been known as the "godmother" of the civil rights movement, Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP, told the audience that they gathered to honor the "godfather of the NAACP and the civil rights movement. -- Scores of mourners packed a Memphis, Tennessee, church Wednesday for the funeral of Dr. Benjamin Hooks, a civil rights leader described as deeply inspirational and widely influential. "As a civil rights activist, public servant and minister of the gospel, Dr. Hooks has extended the hand of fellowship throughout his years," Bush said. Hooks, he said, believed "civil rights was a lifelong commitment," and while he was known for his strong oratory, his work in the trenches and his juggling of responsibilities were the qualities that made him effective. Hooks, who grew up in the segregated South, was "a vocal campaigner for civil rights in the United States," the NAACP said when it announced his death.
