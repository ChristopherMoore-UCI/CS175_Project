So, where do I stand now -- 30 years after "finding God," questioning my faith, committing sins, seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability? I guess I just love my exhilarating and torturous life. In the days when I thought I was going to pursue a life of ministry, I experienced and felt many things that were unexplainable. I discovered I had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry, but I felt good about this transition. A constant seeker within this world, among people and, of course, for spiritual enlightenment of all kind.
