NASA is hosting Star Wars Day events at Space Center Houston, including meet-and-greets with special effects artists from the movie series. Disney World will hold one of its Star Wars weekends, where folks can dine with actors playing characters from the saga as well as attending other activities. Movie houses in Australia and New Zealand were showing all six films. Parents were dressing up their children as characters from the films while others were reposting pictures of funny costumes for dogs or cats. It is after all May 4, the unofficial holiday celebrating of the sci-fi classic, which gave us one of the most repeated lines in movie history: "May the force be with you."
