Facebook intern Paul Butler was interested in the locations of friendships, so he decided to create a visualization of Facebook connections around the globe. Then I plotted lines between the pairs by weight, so that pairs of cities with the most friendships between them were drawn on top of the others. At first glance, it provides some expected data -- the U.S. has the highest concentration of Facebook friendships, and Africa has the lowest concentration. I defined weights for each pair of cities as a function of the Euclidean distance between them and the number of friends between them. I thought that making the lines semi-transparent would do the trick, but I quickly realized that my graphing environment couldn't handle enough shades of color for it to work the way I wanted.
