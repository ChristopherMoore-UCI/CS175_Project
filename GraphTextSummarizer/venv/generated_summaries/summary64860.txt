Glasspool's consecration drew opposition from Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who said Glasspool's ordination would deepen rifts in the Church. She has said that her sexual orientation is "not an issue." Bishop Jon Bruno of Los Angeles called Glasspool, an ordained priest for 28 years, a "highly qualified and experienced" cleric. That church is part of the Anglican Communion in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Episcopalians instituted a temporary ban on gay bishops after Robinson's ordination but revoked that ban last summer. Conservative factions in the Anglican Communion, a 77 million-member denomination worldwide that includes the Episcopal Church, have opposed the ordination of gay bishops.
