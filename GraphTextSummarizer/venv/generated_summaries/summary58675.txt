"Georgia State has taken responsibility for the object," Assistant Chief Shawn Jones said at a news conference Tuesday. But  Atlanta Police said it was a Georgia State University student's art project attached to the outer frame of the 14th Street Bridge in downtown Atlanta that shut down all north and southbound lanes of Interstate 75/85 for two hours on Monday. "Georgia State University sincerely apologizes for the traffic problems resulting yesterday from the mounting of a student camera at the 14th Street Bridge," Don Hale with university media relations said in a release. No explosives were found and all lanes of interstate traffic reopened shortly after 4 p.m. Georgia State announced Tuesday that an art project was to blame. Jones wouldn't describe what the object in question looked like, but a photo gallery obtained exclusively by CNN affiliate WSB, showed a soda can covered in duct tape.
