-- Mel Gibson will not have an acting role in a movie about Jewish historical icon Judah Maccabee, although he may direct the film, Gibson's representative said Friday. Hier disagreed, saying that "The Passion of the Christ," which Gibson produced and directed, depicted every Jew, with the exception of Jesus, as a "tyrant, buffoon, or an idiot." " "My anger with Mel Gibson is he has never made efforts to fix his past mistakes," Hier said. Gibson's representative, in an email exchange with CNN on Friday, said, "There are no plans at this stage for Mel to be in the film." Hier alluded to Gibson's infamous rant after his arrest on a drunken driving charge in 2006.
