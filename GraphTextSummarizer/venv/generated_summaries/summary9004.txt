Neglect The "Law of Protection of Rights and Interests of the Aged" was amended by China's legislature in December after a spate of reports about elderly parents neglected by their children. It's also a matter of concern for China's new leaders as they grapple with the burden of supporting the growing number of elderly people. A modest pension and social welfare system, particularly in rural areas, means elderly people are usually dependent on their children for support. Wang's dilemma is faced by many young people in China, where a one-child policy and three decades of economic reforms have accelerated the decline of the traditional extended family. New law A new national law introduced this week requires the offspring of parents older than 60 to visit their parents "frequently" and make sure their financial and spiritual needs are met.
