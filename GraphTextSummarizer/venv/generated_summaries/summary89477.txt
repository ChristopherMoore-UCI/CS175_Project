Official: Secret Service twice interviewed, released Gonzalez An officer parked behind the canine officer couldn't see past the 6- to 8-foot tall bushes and trees on the north grounds. The report details alarm and radio systems that didn't work as planned, a chase foiled when Gonzalez disappeared into the bushes, and an officer who was supposed to release canines trained to take down intruders who reacted 11 seconds late because he was in a van talking on his personal cell phone, without his radio earpiece in place and with his second radio in his locker. Organizational confusion, gaps in training, a series of communication failures and more allowed Omar Gonzalez to jump a fence and enter the White House in a September incident that led to the Secret Service director's resignation. "While some of these problems can be attributed to a lack of resources, others are systemic and indicative of Secret Service culture," Thompson said. The incident led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson.
