The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan on March 11 damaged nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, resulting in radiation leaks. -- Radioactive cesium has been found in baby formula in Japan following the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, the manufacturer of the product has said. Meiji accounts for about 40 percent of baby formula sales in Japan. " Ingredients of the baby powder may have come into contact with airborne radioactive cesium when they were being dried at a factory in Kasukabe, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tokyo, between March 14 and 20, the company said. Meiji Co., the maker of the formula, said Tuesday that it had found traces of cesium 134 and cesium 137 in samples of its Step Milk powder with the expiration date of Oct. 2012, but that the levels would not be harmful to babies' health.
