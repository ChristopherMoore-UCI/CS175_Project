Gadhafi: Libya's flamboyant, mercurial ruler Eyewitnesses told CNN by phone about tear gas and gunfire targeting anti-government demonstrators in Tripoli, and claimed that -- after days of unrest that left at least 219 dead, according to medical sources -- opposition forces had taken over Benghazi. -- The son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi early Monday proposed the speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms in the traditionally restrictive country, while warning of a chaotic civil war, return to colonialism and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators. Saif Gadhafi didn't confirm that assertion, though he did call out anti-government elements for "sedition." The central government lost control of Benghazi, with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over Libya's second-largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to Moammar Gadhafi. The crackdown, as well as the government's role and reaction to it, stoked the ire of many opposed to Moammar Gadhafi as well as governments outside Libya.
