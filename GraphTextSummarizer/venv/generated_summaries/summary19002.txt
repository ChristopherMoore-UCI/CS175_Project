Adam Troy Baker was arrested in late October in nearby Catawba County on eight charges: five counts of writing bad checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. -- A judge could decide next week whether some or all of the details in search warrants related to the death of a 10-year-old disabled North Carolina girl will be made public. In that warrant, police were seeking to search the Hickory home that Zahra lived in with her stepmother and father Adam Troy Baker. In one search warrant, dated October 27, police say they were looking for "latex gloves used while the body of Zahra Baker was dismembered." According to one of the search warrants, a tipster told police that Zahra had been at a North Carolina home with two men and one of the men said "he had done something very bad and needed to leave town."
