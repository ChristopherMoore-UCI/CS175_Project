"Such behavior cannot be tolerated on any football pitch, and in particular not at a FIFA World Cup when the eyes of millions of people are on the stars on the field," said FIFA disciplinary committee chairman Claudio Sulser. Ahead of the World Cup, Suarez had undergone knee surgery, missing Uruguay's first World Cup game, before returning to face England, when he scored twice in the South American team's 2-1 win. "The first match of this suspension is to be served in the upcoming FIFA World Cup fixture between Colombia and Uruguay on 28 June 2014," said FIFA's statement, referring to the last-16 game between the South American teams in Rio de Janeiro Saturday. Former Italian international Mauro Tassotti was given an eight-match ban in 1994, the longest suspension in World Cup history, after breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique. "The remaining match suspensions shall be served in Uruguay's next FIFA World Cup match(es), as long as the team qualifies, and/or in the representative team's subsequent official matches."
