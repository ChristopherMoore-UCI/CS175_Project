In the spring of 2003, software developer Beverly Sobelman was 39 years old and near the top of the heap at Microsoft, sitting at conference tables with Bill Gates and "managing people who managed people who managed people," as she puts it. If you've ever wanted to run away and join the circus, Beverly Sobelman -- intrepid aerial artist and midlife career changer -- can show you how. "I get a lot of people who were traumatized in grade school because they couldn't climb a rope in gym class. By 2007 Sobelman's classes were so popular -- particularly with women in their early 20s to mid-40s -- that she founded Versatile Arts, Seattle's first full-time aerial studio. She traveled to Melbourne, Australia, for months of training with Circus Oz and the National Institute for Circus Arts.
