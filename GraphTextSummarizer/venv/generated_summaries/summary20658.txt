"WeChat, could you explain why?" In an online statement, WeChat -- owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent -- clarified that its team had added the U.S. flag special feature in honor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States on Monday and had meant for it to be seen only by users in the U.S. "A system error had caused users in other regions to use this feature as well," read the statement, which also apologized for the "misunderstanding." WeChat users typing in the phrase "civil rights" last weekend noticed a cascade of Stars and Stripes raining down their screens, much to the chagrin of some Chinese customers, who said that no special icons appeared when patriotic Chinese terms were entered. The country's top Internet regulator has shut down 133 public WeChat accounts for "spreading distorted historical information" about the ruling Communist Party, state media reported Tuesday. While many applauded the Communist Youth League's criticism of WeChat's flag feature, other Internet users called it narrow-minded. Earlier this week, the Communist leadership in Beijing ordered universities nationwide to fortify ideological control by "studying and propagating Marxism," as well as "cultivating and promoting the core values of socialism," according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.
