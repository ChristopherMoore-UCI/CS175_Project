-- Militants captured 70 construction workers, including Chinese nationals, in Sudan's volatile South Kordofan state, military officials said Sunday. Khalid blamed the attacks on the Sudan People's Liberation Movement -North, a rebel force in the border region with neighboring South Sudan. But human rights groups criticized China for the visit because al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war atrocities during the civil war in Sudan -- allegations he denies. China is Sudan's largest trading partner, while Sudan is China's third-largest trading partner in Africa. South Sudan became the world's newest nation last year after decades of conflict with the north.
