"Crown Forces Watch" had called for people to post pictures of police officers and details of security operations across Northern Ireland. The body representing officers, the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, had said publishing pictures was an attempt to "target police officers for murder." -- A Facebook page has been shut down following claims Northern Ireland police officers were being set up for assassination on the social networking site. The Facebook page claimed the men had been the victims of police harassment and intimidation and called for a response from the pro-Irish community. The page appeared after a series of recent police raids and arrests in connection with the murder in April of Catholic police officer Ronan Kerr.
