The lander -- crammed with devices to look for signs of life on Mars -- never radioed home after hitching a ride aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter and dropping into the atmosphere on December 25, 2003. The lander, which is less than 2 meters (6.56 feet) across when fully deployed, was first spotted in the NASA images by Michael Croon of Trier, Germany -- a former member of the European Space Agency's Mars Express operations team, the UK Space Agency said. "This finding makes the case that Beagle 2 was more of a success than we previously knew and undoubtedly an important step in Europe's continuing exploration of Mars." Croon is among a group of Beagle 2 team members who have spent years combing through images from NASA's HiRISE camera, which is on the agency's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, looking for signs of the missing craft, the agency said. Had the lander deployed properly, a suite of onboard tools would have been used to analyze rocks, soil and atmosphere for signs of life.
