"We could dramatically reduce child poverty if we chose to," Larry Aber, a professor of applied psychology at New York University, who has studies solutions to child poverty, told me. I'll also make a trip to California's Silicon Valley, home to Apple and Facebook -- and also to striking rates of child poverty. I can't think child poverty -- with its nasty outcomes, like prison time, low educational achievement and poor health -- is inevitable. "There are a lot of things we can do for children that we're not doing" in the United States, said Mary Hansen, an associate professor of economics at American University. I'm on the road this month, however, to try to understand the human cost of child poverty in the United States.
