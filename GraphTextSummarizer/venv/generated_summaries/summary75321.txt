We will improve medical care to minority veterans, including female veterans, who are enrolling in VA at historic rates. Five years from now, we intend to make VA the provider of choice for veterans -- in insurance, health care, education, home loans and counseling. We will also improve access to VA for veterans who live in rural areas. To achieve the president's vision, we must leverage new technologies to serve the various demographics and needs of today's veterans, while also renewing our commitment to the older generation of veterans. Within the next five years, we aim to eliminate veteran homelessness by providing grants to community-based organizations assisting homeless veterans and by attacking all the areas that often lead to homelessness.
