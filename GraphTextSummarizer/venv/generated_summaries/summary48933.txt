The frontman of the pro-independence campaign, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, says he looks forward to the Queen remaining as "Queen of Scots" in an independent Scotland. Breaking up the United Kingdom now would prompt an identity crisis for Queen and country. She said: "I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Queen has managed to "stay above politics" for more than 60 years -- and with Scotland voting on independence Thursday she's not about to upset things now. Scotland isn't some breakaway outpost of the British Empire; it's home turf which has remained uncontested since the Renaissance.
