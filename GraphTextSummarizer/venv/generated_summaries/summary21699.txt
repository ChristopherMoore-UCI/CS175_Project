Murray beat Djokovic in the men's final at Wimbledon but has struggled to find his best form in hard court warm up tournaments ahead of Flushing Meadows. Early exits in two hard court tournaments in the build-up to the U.S. Open were not ideal preparation, but Lisicki came through her opening two matches against Vera Dushevina of Russia and Argentina's Paula Ormaechea in straight sets. On the green grass of Wimbledon the popular 23-year-old German swept aside No.1 Serena Williams on the way to the women's singles final where she lost to Marion Bartoli. Fast forward to the final major of the season on the hard courts of Flushing Meadows and 16th seed Lisicki made a tame third round exit to Russian Ekaterina Makarova, while Bartoli has retired and is reporting the tournament for a television company. Lisicki's career was place on hold after a nasty fall at the 2009 U.S. Open which saw her depart the court in a wheelchair and with a severe injury to her ankle.
