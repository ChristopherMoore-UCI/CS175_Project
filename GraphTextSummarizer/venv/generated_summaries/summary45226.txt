Tax returns from Help Hospitalized Veterans showed six-figure salary payments to several of its key officers, including Chief Executive Officer Michael Lynch. When CNN investigated Help Hospitalized Veterans in August 2012, it found that most of the donations sent to veterans hospitals around the country amounted to so-called "craft kits" for recovering soldiers to use while hospitalized. Attorney General Kamala Harris said Help Hospitalized Veterans executives had "improperly diverted" donated funds to themselves as well as purchasing country club memberships and in one case a suburban Washington condominium for use of its officers. In 2008, a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing led by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, spent a day seeking testimony from the charity's founder, Roger Chapin, as well as other Help Hospitalized Veterans executives. Help Hospitalized Veterans, which is based in Temecula, California, will not close, said Hugh Quinn, the charity's attorney.
