-- More than 40 people have been killed in clashes between soldiers and a rebel militia in Southern Sudan, an official there said Monday, disputing rebel claims they have killed many more government troops. His forces have been attacking villages and clashing with the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the military wing of the movement that governs Southern Sudan. People in the region voted overwhelmingly for independence from the north in a recent referendum, setting the stage for Southern Sudan to become a new country. Athor took up arms in 2010 when he was not elected governor of Southern Sudan's Jonglei state. A mutiny among the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs) led by soldiers loyal to militia leader Gabriel Tang resulted in up to 50 deaths in February.
