First-half goals from Simon Rolfes and Sidney Sam earned the home side a sixth win in seven matches to consolidate third place, one point behind both Dortmund and Bayern. Bayern, who put four goals past Schalke last weekend, had to settle for a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. The rout got underway in the 35th minute when Marcus Reus tapped in after Robert Lewandowski's shot had been palmed away by goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. Borussia Dortmund recorded an emphatic 5-0 win over second-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday to improve an already healthy goal difference and stay top of the Bundesliga. Bayern travel to Manchester City on Wednesday for the second round of Champions League group matches.
