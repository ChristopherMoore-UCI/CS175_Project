Newton bested a field that included Oregon running back LaMichael James, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck, and Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore. -- Auburn quarterback Cam Newton won the 2010 Heisman Trophy on Saturday night, his on-field heroics enough to overcome off-the-field questions about his role in a purported pay-for-play scheme. The NCAA changed course, it said, after concluding that Newton wasn't aware that his father, the Rev. Cecil Newton, and an unnamed owner of a scouting service tried to market the star quarterback "as a part of a pay-for-play scenario in return for Newton's commitment to attend college and play football." " Auburn did limit Newton's father's access to its athletic program and Mississippi State has cut off relations with the other person, the NCAA said. The Rev. Newton did not attend Saturday's Heisman presentation, though Cam's mother, Jackie Newton, was in the audience.
