The American skier will have the support of golf star Tiger Woods as she competes in the downhill World Cup race at the French ski resort of Val d'Isere. Vonn made a successful return to racing earlier this month after undergoing reconstructive surgery on her right knee, an injury that was aggravated again in a training run in November. The 29-year-old had a best finish of fifth at Canada's Lake Louise course but hopes to make further progress on the French snow. Vonn is the Olympic downhill champion and wants to be fit enough to defend her title at the Winter Olympics which take place in the Russian resort of Sochi in February. "I'm going to put my clubs away for a while to spend more time with my kids and support my girlfriend Lindsey Vonn as she tries to prepare for the Sochi Olympics," the 14-time major winner said.
