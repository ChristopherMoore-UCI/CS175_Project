-- The leaders of France and Japan vowed Thursday to work to bolster international safety standards for nuclear power plants, making the subject a prime topic at a pair of upcoming international summits. Sarkozy acknowledged Japan's crisis has affected France's take on nuclear energy. The French president, who traveled to Japan in his capacity as current head of the G8 group that also includes Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, said that there was a lack of clear, universal guidelines for nuclear safety. After that, he said, Japan will analyze and assess its energy policy -- including the role that nuclear power will and should play. A discussion and possible adoption of international nuclear safety standards, he added, would be sensible and mutually beneficial.
