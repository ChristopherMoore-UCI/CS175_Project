However, court documents and Justice Department officials described a Russian intelligence operation straight out of a 1950s spy novel. The suspects were "trained Russian intelligence operatives," a Justice Department spokesman said, and information from court documents alleged they were part of a mission to plant "deep-cover" agents in the United States. The Justice Department announced Monday that 10 people were arrested on charges of being Russian agents involved in a long-term mission in the country. The other suspects were identified in court documents as Donald Howard Heathfield, Tracey Lee Ann Foley, Michael Zottoli, Patricia Mills and Mikhail Semenko. A Russian Embassy spokesman said Monday that he was unaware of the reports of the arrests, and said he was seeking more information from Russian officials.
