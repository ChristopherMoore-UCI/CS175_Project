Hillary Clinton edges down slightly in new CNN/ORC 2016 poll Stepped up attacks While she mulls her decision, the GOP and pro-Republican outside groups have stepped up their attacks on Clinton, on everything from the Benghazi incident to the 1990s Monica Lewinsky scandal. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said "Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there are no words for this level of lying." Age an issue in presidential elections Rove pointed out that some Democrats in 2008 made Republican presidential nominee John McCain's age an issue during the campaign. "Thirty days in the hospital?" asked Rove, a Fox News Channel contributor, according to the report. Rove defended his comments on Tuesday on Fox News Channel, saying that it's legitimate to ask about a potential presidential candidate's health.
