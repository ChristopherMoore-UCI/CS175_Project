-- Voters in Belarus head to the polls Sunday to cast their ballots in presidential elections. According to BelTa, organizers of public events must receive official permission 15 days before holding a public event. In neighboring Ukraine, Orange Revolution deposed the regime of Leonid Kuchma two years earlier and the 2005 Tulip Revolution in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan brought down president Askar Akayev and his government. However, during the Sunday elections, all public events have been banned, said official news agency BelTa. Legislation of Belarus allows presidential candidates to campaign until the day before the elections.
