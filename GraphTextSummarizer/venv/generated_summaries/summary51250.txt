There's not much of a gap between third and fourth on the grid, so I think the podium is a realistic goal." Last year Vettel was upstaged by new teammate Daniel Ricciardo, who qualified second and then finished runner-up in his home race only to be disqualified for a fuel-flow infringement. The world champion will start on pole for the Australian Grand Prix, as he did last year and has done on three other occasions in his career. "We had a difficult season last year here, so definitely as a team, as a whole, we're hoping for a better start, for both cars to succeed tomorrow," the 30-year-old said. "The Ferraris looked strong and were pushing us hard," said the Brazilian, who has failed to finish in seven of 12 starts at Albert Park including last year. "We suffered a bit this time last year, but there are a few more issues this year which weren't expected," said Ricciardo, who was third in the 2014 championship.
