Apple has scheduled a company-only Wednesday memorial service for former CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs, who passed away two weeks ago. In an email to employees, CEO Tim Cook said that the memorial is being held "to take time to remember the incredible things Steve achieved in his life and the many ways he made our world a better place." Employees at Apple's Cupertino campus will attend in person, and various retail stores will close for at least an hour in order for employees to view a live broadcast of the service. Apple Stores rarely close during operating hours. Makeshift memorials were erected at Apple's headquarters, as well as at Apple Stores around the world, to celebrate and honor the life of Apple's longtime CEO.
