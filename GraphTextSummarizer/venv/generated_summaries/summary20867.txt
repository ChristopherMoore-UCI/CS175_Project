Armed inmates inside the Rodeo II prison in the northern state of Miranda, east of Caracas, have rejected government calls to disarm since last week. Conditions in Venezuelan prisons have been the subject of concern for human rights organizations for some time. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, 476 inmates reportedly died in Venezuelan prisons in 2010 and another 967 were injured. In another report, the commission found that "the state has failed to adopt an effective policy to prevent violence within its detention centers" and that "Venezuelan prisons are the most violent in the region." The operations at the Rodeo prison complex come a week after a prison riot that left 22 dead.
