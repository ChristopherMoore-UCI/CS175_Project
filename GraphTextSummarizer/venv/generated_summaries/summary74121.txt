With the Santiago business traveler in mind, CNN asked Lonely Planet's Bridget Gleeson, co- author of Lonely Planet Chile and Easter Island Travel Guide, to lend her expertise in selecting the city's best spots. Those on a quick stop-off before heading back to Santiago however may make the most of their time by taking "a quick boat ride from Muelle Prat (harbor) to get a feel for the city," Gleeson advises. This surge has been concentrated mainly in Santiago, Chile's nerve center and economic engine room, and it's here that Pardo and the country's tourist board spy an as yet untapped opportunity. Wine regions Chile is a major exporter of wine and visiting some of its fertile vineyards is a rite of passage for many a connoisseur. Historic sites such as the Catedral Metropolitana contrast sharply against the rowdy Mercado Central fish market, which offers "a colorful attraction for photographers and foodies alike," says Gleeson.
