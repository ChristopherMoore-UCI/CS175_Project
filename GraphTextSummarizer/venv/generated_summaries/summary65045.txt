"Computer hackers like Mr. Suvorov victimize businesses and individuals, posing a serious threat to their financial security," said Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. "Suvorov reached across an ocean to victimize thousands of Americans," said Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. In the one involving Dave & Buster's he was an accomplice of Albert Gonzalez, a man the Justice Department describes as "one of the most prolific identity thieves ever prosecuted by the U.S. government." The second illegal operation involved a conspiracy to sell more than 160,000 stolen credit card numbers to a buyer in San Diego. Gonzalez received a 20-year sentence in March 2010 for his role in several hacking operations including the one involving Dave & Buster's restaurants.
