"In an unprovoked attack captured on film, the Japanese security ship Shonan Maru No. 2 deliberately rammed and caused catastrophic damage to the Sea Shepherd catamaran Ady Gil," said a statement from Sea Shepherd. "This is a continuation of the harassment of the Japanese research whaling program by Sea Shepherd and is extremely dangerous to threaten vessels and its crew. Sea Shepherd Conservation Society says its boat was ripped apart by the Japanese vessel during the incident. The incident continues an ongoing feud between conservation agencies and Japanese whaling fleets. But Japanese authorities deny their boat intentionally rammed the activists' catamaran and said instead the incident happened accidentally when the activists were harassing their whaling fleet.
