U.S. District Court Judge Larry Burns said in a motion issued Monday that there was a "substantial probability" that Jared Lee Loughner will be restored to competency and be able to stand trial for his role in a mass shooting in January outside a Tucson supermarket. During it, both the judge and mental health experts noted that Loughner was able to sit calmly during the hours-long proceeding, court sources said. Several mental health experts testified at last Wednesday's hearing, including Loughner's "daily, treating psychologist" Dr. Christina Pietz and an outside expert psychiatrist, Dr. James Ballenger. He refused to alter Loughner's current mental health treatment plan, pointing to his observations that the suspect has improved in recent months. Prosecutors have written in court documents that Loughner has expressed "regret for the circumstances that led to his arrest."
