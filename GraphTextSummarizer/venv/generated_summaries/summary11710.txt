Long before I would ever see a therapist, the VA would cycle me through half a dozen medicines in less than three months, though this was far less than the buffet of lithium and opiates many other veterans are prescribed. I had been following the association's MDMA PTSD treatment research for years, and regularly advocated for MAPS in my daily discussions with fellow veterans. In Peru, I met other veterans who had also become disillusioned with the cold, sterile, institutionalized treatment they had received when they returned home from combat. I had read about ayahuasca, and listened to firsthand accounts from other veterans of its healing effects, but never imagined I myself would have the opportunity to experience it firsthand. I participated in three ayahuasca ceremonies, all conducted alongside other veterans.
