Djokovic doffs hat to Nadal In Shanghai, Novak Djokovic is on a mission to defend his Masters title this week but regaining the world No. 1 spot is not top of his agenda. Rafael Nadal took over the top ranking Monday but Djokovic is philosophical about wrestling back top spot before the season is out. "Something that makes me very happy is that I managed to regroup and mentally find my concentration and determination after the U.S. Open final loss against Nadal." The top eight seeds, which include Federer, Djokovic and Nadal, all have a bye into the second round. The 43-year-old may be in the twilight of her career but these are still golden years for the evergreen player from Kyoto.
