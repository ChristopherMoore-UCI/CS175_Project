I find Lin walking in a festering landscape of rotting food, plastic bags and junk at the Mae Sot garbage dump in Thailand near the Thai-Myanmar border. The United Nations established refugee camps in Thailand for those who flee Myanmar, but the camps are reserved only for victims of political persecution. It buys what bottles and plastics Lin and others salvage. Her answer is as hard as the world she and Lin inhabit. My assistant told me about Lin's home while he was researching another story on the border area in Myanmar, the country once known as Burma.
