Those wet roads In Boston, officials said there's a chance of rain Thursday, so the city's music-and-fireworks event might not happen that day either, reported CNN affiliate WCVB. Arthur is expected to become a Category 1 hurricane off the North Carolina coast on Thursday, and although the eye might not hit land, the storm could create dangerous rip currents that day along the Outer Banks and Pamlico Sound, forecasters said. "I don't want you to put at risk not only yourself but also people who may try to help you, especially our emergency operation workers," said Gov. Pat McCrory. The same Florida coast might be an ideal place to spend July Fourth, as Arthur should be far away from there by Friday and fireworks will burst over the beaches from Key West to Jacksonville. "Don't put your stupid hat on," McCrory said at the New Hanover County Emergency Operations Center, according to CNN affiliate WWAY.
