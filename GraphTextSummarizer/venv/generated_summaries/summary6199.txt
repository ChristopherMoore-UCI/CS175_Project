His office deleted the tweet 17 minutes after it was posted, but Politwoops, a website that documents deleted tweets by politicians, captured the original tweet with the link: "At Warner E.S. in #WilmDE to announce new initiative to support many of #netDE's most disadvantaged students PHOTO: http://ow.ly/i/6M3N" Markell's office sent out a longer statement Thursday attempting to clarify the situation. -- Delaware Gov. Jack Markell's office apologized Thursday for a tweet containing a link to a racy photo of a woman wearing what appears to be leather straps around her neck and chest. "The lessons here are not to compose tweets too quickly and there is a lot of odd stuff on the internet," the statement read. "We just wish the accidental link had been a cat video." Earlier this week, Texas Gov. Rick Perry also apologized for what he described as an "unauthorized" tweet related to his indictment. We are looking into how this occurred but apologize to anyone who was offended," Markell's Twitter account read.
