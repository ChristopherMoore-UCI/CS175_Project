The use of fakes names was a routine way to hide Smith's medical information from prying tabloid journalists who would pay medical workers to leak it, Steve Sadow, Stern's defense lawyer, told jurors. Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, also was prescribing powerful drugs to Smith using fake names, Rose said. She sought the medications for "real pain, constant pain, chronic pain." A defense lawyer said Smith was not a drug addict, but was a victim of chronic pain who was seeking relief. Her identity was not secret to the pharmacist who regularly filled her prescriptions, he said, but Smith feared medical workers would sell her information.
