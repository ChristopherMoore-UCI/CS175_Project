AEG hired Dr. Conrad Murray, the man who is in jail for killing Michael Jackson." Jackson lawyers, who were discussing the grounds for an appeal even before the verdict was read, indicated the legal fight is not over. Jackson lawyer: 'We found the truth' "AEG has denied for years, and continues to deny, that they hired Dr. Conrad Murray," Katherine Jackson's lawyers said in a statement released late Wednesday. Barden suggested jurors were boxed in by the wording of the second question on their verdict form: "Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?" Jurors interpreted "the work" to be as a "general practitioner" who was expected to treat Jackson and his children for routine illnesses -- not to infuse him with profopol to put him to sleep every night, Barden said. Valerie Wass, who had sat in on much of the trial so she could give personal reports to her jailed client, let out an audible gasp when the court clerk read the jury's "No" to the question "Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?" Murray was "very, very emotional" when Wass visited him in jail to discuss the verdict Wednesday evening, Wass said. The jury found that AEG Live had hired Conrad Murray, but that Murray was competent.
