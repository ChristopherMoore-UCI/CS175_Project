Questlove says roughly 30 tracks have been recorded over the last few years, with many sessions taking place at Electric Lady in New York, where the singer cut Voodoo. " During the live jam session, D'Angelo surprised the crowd by grooving with Funkadelic singer Kendra Foster during a funky cover of the Beatles' "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window" and shredding guitar on Jimi Hendrix's "Power of Soul." "He's elated," Questlove says. "I said, 'It will be a whole night doing what we used to do at Electric Lady in the Nineties,'" Questlove tells Rolling Stone. Questlove remembers the moment he called D'Angelo and asked him to make his first U.S. concert appearance in 12 years on June 9th, for the drummer's late-night Super Jam at Bonnaroo. "My whole reasoning for doing [Bonnaroo]," Questlove says, "was to show him who his real audience is."
