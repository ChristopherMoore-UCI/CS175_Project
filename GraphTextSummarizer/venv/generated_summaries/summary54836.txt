Saeed has repeatedly denied any involvement with the Mumbai killings or support for terrorism despite accusations he has masterminded numerous attacks. Until then, Hafiz Saeed - surrounded by armed guards - says he will continue to provide moral support, but no more, in the cause of liberating Kashmir. Even Lashkar-e-Tayyiba as denied responsibility for the Mumbai attacks, which saw the Taj Mahal Hotel set alight, according to the Council on Foreign Affairs. India's National Investigation Agency is to carry out inquiries in Pakistan into possible connections with the Mumbai attacks. But Saeed takes security seriously and required that the crew first meet with one of his men on the outskirts of Lahore then follow him into town.
