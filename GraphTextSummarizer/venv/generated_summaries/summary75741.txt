ACLU Deputy Director Chuck Thornton said that when the commandments were erected on public property, it became an endorsement of religion. The monument was removed in March, and the attorneys' fees were settled last week, ACLU attorney Micheal Salem said. The county has been in litigation with the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma since 2006, after it allowed a resident to pay for and erect the granite monument on the courthouse lawn in Stigler. "The ACLU would never have been involved if it was somewhere other than public property. Salem said the commandments were moved to private property owned by the American Legion about 150 feet from the courthouse.
