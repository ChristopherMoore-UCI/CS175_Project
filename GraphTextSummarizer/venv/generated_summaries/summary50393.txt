Once an international investigation concluded last week that the patrol ship Cheonan was sunk by a North Korean torpedo, a White House statement called the ship sinking "an act of aggression ... one more instance of North Korea's unacceptable behavior and defiance of international law. The United States also is emphasizing -- in both words and deeds -- its military ties to South Korea, including an announcement Monday at the Pentagon that the U.S. and South Korean militaries would conduct joint anti-submarine exercises. "This is a highly precarious situation that the North Koreans have caused in the region and it is one that every country that neighbors or is in proximity to North Korea understands must be contained. Over at the Pentagon, Gates and Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both sidestepped questions about whether what North Korea did constitutes an act of war. The United States has been vocal in condemning North Korea for what it calls an act of aggression and provocation in the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors.
