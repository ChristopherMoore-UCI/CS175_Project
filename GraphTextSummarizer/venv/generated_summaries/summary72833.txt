"Nissan Motor Company's willingness to question conventional thinking and to drive progress is what sets us apart," said CEO Carlos Ghosn, in a press release. Meanwhile, Nissan's not the only automaker looking into driverless cars: Audi and Toyota have both displayed driverless car prototypes. It's unclear how long Nissan has been testing the technology, though the release refers to "years." Nissan has just joined Google in the race to make driverless cars a reality. The Japanese automaker is aiming to have such driverless autos on the road by 2020.
