Around 6 p.m., the vessel was pulled off the bridge and safely moored at the state pier on the New Hampshire side, said Coast Guard spokesman Robert Simpson. The matter is under investigation, Coast Guard spokesman Adam Stanton said. -- A disabled tanker ship collided with a bridge linking Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Kittery, Maine, on Monday, closing the heavily used span to traffic. The bridge, which was built in 1940 and normally carries about 14,000 vehicles per day, sustained some damage, said Bill Boynton, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Transportation Department. The 470-foot Harbour Feature was carrying tallow oil when it hit the aging Sarah Long Bridge stretching over the Piscatagua River.
