We should mitigate the incentives for excessive risk-taking and the short-term focus that has so long prevailed, for instance, by requiring bonuses to be paid on the basis of, say, five-year returns, rather than annual returns. It managed to sustain the economy, but the way it did it was shortsighted: America was living on borrowed money and borrowed time. The new "innovations" simply hid the extent of systemic leverage and made the risks less transparent; it is these innovations that have made this collapse so much more dramatic than earlier financial crises. Historically, rapid expansion of lending has been responsible for a large fraction of crises and this crisis is no exception. We need to impose other regulations to improve the safety and soundness of our financial system, such as "speed bumps" to limit borrowing.
