"But of course the headlines are going to come from New York City and New Jersey, where a forecast of more than 2 feet turned out to only be about half that," Miller said. "The National Weather Service forecasters in New York certainly went all in with the NAM and ECMWF forecasts, and all but ignored the GFS, without providing much room for uncertainty that should come with the GFS showing a vastly different solution." "Better safe than sorry," said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had warned Monday that the storm could be one of the largest "in the history of this city." "As meteorologists we must convey the uncertainty associated with these forecasts." Opinion: Weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report from New York; Josh Levs reported from Atlanta. In this case, the NAM and the ECMWF both showed 2 feet of snow or more for New York City, while the GFS (which has just been upgraded this winter) showed a more conservative 6 to 12 inches.
