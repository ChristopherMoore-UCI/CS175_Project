Canada's largest airline announced Monday it has suspended flights to and from Venezuela capital Caracas as violent protests continue in the country. "Due to ongoing civil unrest in Venezuela, Air Canada can no longer ensure the safety of its operation and has suspended flights to Caracas until further notice," said the airline in a statement. "Air Canada will continue to monitor the situation and will evaluate the re-introduction of flights with the objective of resuming operations on the route once Air Canada is satisfied that the situation in Venezuela has stabilized," said the statement. Venezuela not playing by the rules Air Canada's cancellation of its Caracas services comes amid a financial dispute between airlines and Venezuela's government. For more than a month demonstrators have been clashing with security forces in Venezuela, marking the biggest threat President Nicolas Maduro has faced since his election last year.
