The first round was completed on Tuesday, with American Serena Williams continuing the form which saw her claim the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Canada last weekend. Maria Sharapova headed the pack as four of the top 10 seeds at the Western and Southern Open advanced to the third round of the Cincinnati event with wins on Tuesday. The 29-year-old was pleased with her return to form having been eliminated from last week's Rogers Cup in the first round. The 13-time major champion will now come up against Australian 10th seed Samantha Stosur, who beat qualifier Eleni Danilidou 6-3 6-1. Fourth seed Sharapova, a beaten finalist at the Lindner Family Tennis Center last year, secured her place in the third round with a 6-1 6-3 victory over Australian qualifier Anastasia Rodionova.
