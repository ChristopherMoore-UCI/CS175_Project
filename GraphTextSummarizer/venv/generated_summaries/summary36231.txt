Authorities began receiving reports of a plane crash around 1:30 p.m. MT, Brough said, adding that people had seen flames in the air in an area less than five miles from the Boulder Municipal Airport. The pilot of the Piper died in the collision, said Rick Brough of the Boulder County Sheriff's Office. The debris field was spread out over a couple of miles, Brough said. Cirrus aircraft come equipped with an airframe parachute system that deploys in the event of an in-air emergency. But the pilot of the glider, which was carrying two passengers, detached from the plane and landed safely, Brough said.
