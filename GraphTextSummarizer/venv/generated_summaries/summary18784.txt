"It is a true pit bull head on a dachshund body," Dawn Blanton of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Humane Society said last month. And the pup's taking his ambassador role seriously: His page features photos of him sending off fellow animals to new owners. His picture posted on the shelter's Facebook page has more than  2.4 million hits, Blanton told CNN affiliate WALB. His mission: become a therapy dog and bring awareness about unique pets in shelters everywhere. Adoption offers and fame pour in.
