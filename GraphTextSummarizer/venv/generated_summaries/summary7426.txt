-- Libyan government tanks were shelling civilian areas in Misrata Tuesday and government forces were using heavy artillery as well, bringing "absolute and utter carnage" to the city, a witness told CNN. The Libyan government took some journalists to Misrata Monday in an effort to suggest that Gadhafi's regime had control of the city, but did not allow journalists into the city center, which rebels have said they control. In an interview with CNN, he pleaded for coalition forces to take action and stop the government troops. Government forces were also evicting thousands of residents and looting their homes, according to the source with the Libyan opposition. Misrata is in western Libya, east of Tripoli.
