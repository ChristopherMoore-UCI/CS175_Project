Sadly, you all provided this symposium of snobs with even more grist for the you're-an-idiot mill when, following the Arcade Fire's Grammy win last year, you took to the Web to cry: "Who is Arcade Fire?" After al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011, confused folks started flooding Twitter and other social sites, posing such queries as: "Who is Osama Bin Laden and why should I care?" Last week, Wikipedia went dark for one day in protest of SOPA (The Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (Protect IP Act), two (now tabled) bills in Congress designed to stop illegal copying and sharing of intellectual property online. With the advent of such tools as Open Book and resources like Lamebook and Buzzfeed, your utter mouth-breathing-ness has the ability to get the entire world wondering: How the hell do we continue to exist on this Earth when such stunning displays of dullness walk freely among us? Who is Arcade Fire?
