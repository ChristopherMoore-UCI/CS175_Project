" Weather conditions at the time of the accident were "not known," the report said, but Alaska Air National Guard rescuers were hampered by poor weather and terrain -- slogging for hours through rain, fog and wind to reach the rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska. Along with Stevens, 86, and Bill Phillips, the others who died were pilot Terry Smith, 62, of Eagle River, Alaska; Dana Tindall, 48, of Anchorage, Alaska; and Corey Tindall, 16, of Anchorage, Alaska. "The GCI lodge manager then initiated a phone and radio search to see if the airplane had diverted to Dillingham, Alaska or if it was en route back to the GCI lodge. Unable to locate the airplane, GCI lodge personnel initiated an aerial search along the pilot's anticipated route," the report said. The report said the de Havilland DHC-3T Otter -- a single-engine, turbine-powered, amphibious float-equipped craft -- "sustained substantial damage" when it crashed about 10 miles northeast of Aleknagik about 2:45 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time.
