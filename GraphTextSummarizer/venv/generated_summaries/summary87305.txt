The cause of the explosion in San Martin Texmelucan, in Puebla state, was under investigation, but preliminary reports pointed to the illegal extraction of oil from the pipe, said Laura Gurza, coordinator for civil protection in Puebla. Oil theft has been a persistent problem for Pemex, and has been on the rise since President Felipe Calderon took office. A Washington Post investigation found that drug cartels were increasingly diversifying into other areas, including oil theft, to the tune of more than $1 billion in a two-year period. Twelve of the people killed in the blast were children, the state news agency Notimex reported, citing Gurza. -- At least 27 people were killed and 52 injured after an oil pipeline exploded Sunday morning in central Mexico
