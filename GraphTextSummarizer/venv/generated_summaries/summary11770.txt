In limited release, Midnight in Paris director Woody Allen's latest film, To Rome With Love, got off to a blazing start with $379,000 out of just 5 theaters, which yielded a remarkable $75,800 per theater average. Just like the film in first place, the film in fifth place, Snow White and the Huntsman, is centered on a warrior princess. Brave continued Pixar's streak of number one debuts, as all 13 of the studio's releases have reached the peak position during their first weekend of wide release. Both efforts earned innumerable headlines for their absurdly straightforward, silly titles, but that early buzz didn't translate into substantial box office dollars.
