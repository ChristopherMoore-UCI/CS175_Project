Randy Fay, a helicopter rescue team coordinator for Snohomish County, on Wednesday recalled spotting the boy "out in the middle of nowhere" not long after his crew first flew over the scene Saturday. She was at work during Saturday's mudslide, which killed at least 16 people and destroyed much of two towns north of Seattle. "I said, 'Honey I'm a grandma, I'll take care of you until we figure this out,'" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. Another woman rescued that Saturday, Robin Youngblood, recalled talking to the boy and cradling him in a blanket. And he was calm as he was passed up into the arms of crew chief Beau Beckner.
