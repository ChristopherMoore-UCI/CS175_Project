Traffic trouble The United States, which plays it first match of the tournament on Monday, wanted to have a private scrimmage against Belgium on Thursday. First, referee Yuichi Nishimura awarded Brazil an undeserved penalty kick. But with a transit strike making bad traffic worse, Belgium coach Marc Wilmots and U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann agreed to call off the match, Sports Illustrated reported. With reporters descending on Sao Paulo for the opening match, protesters tried to make their way toward Arena Corinthians stadium and were met by tear-gas firing riot police. Here are five things that happened Thursday as the first ball was kicked in Sao Paulo.
