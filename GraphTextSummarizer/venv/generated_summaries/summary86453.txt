They include fellow police officers, mental health professionals, family members and people who live with mental health conditions. Police officers, families and certainly people with mental health conditions don't want this to happen. Here's how CIT works:  A team of police officers (or other first responders) from one department or jurisdiction, or from a coalition of neighboring departments, undergoes a comprehensive week-long (40-hour) training program that does several things. Of course, it costs money to pull officers off the street, to train police dispatchers, to pay for materials and for costs associated with using community buildings. It breaks my heart to read about the death of James Boyd, a homeless man shot and killed by Albuquerque police in March.
