Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, a measles-like rash, red eyes and, at times, bleeding from body openings. Ebola is caused by a highly infectious virus that spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids. At least 10 people died in a separate Ebola outbreak in late August in the Democratic Republic of Congo. "WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Uganda with respect to this event," it said. The Ebola virus was first detected in 1976 in the central African nation of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Uganda's neighbor to the west.
