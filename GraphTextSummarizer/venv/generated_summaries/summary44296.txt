Tuff set a goal of $1,500 when she started her fundraising campaign online on August 22, two days after her intervention was credited with averting a tragedy at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy near Atlanta. The president called Tuff last week and told CNN "New Day" anchor Chris Cuomo he plans to invite her to the White House. Donors have been rushing to support a fund for inner-city children started by Antoinette Tuff, the bookkeeper who persuaded a heavily armed intruder at a Georgia elementary school to surrender last week. Terrifying moments with school gunman unfold in 911 recording Tuff's invitation to donors said the money will fund travel for children. By Wednesday afternoon, 2,114 people had contributed $103,806, according to Tuff's page at fundraising site gofundme.com.
