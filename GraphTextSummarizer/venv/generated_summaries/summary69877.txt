New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged New Yorkers to prepare immediately for the storm, saying they should plan for "major disruptions" during Monday and Tuesday morning commutes. The blizzard warning is in effect from 1 p.m. Monday through Tuesday, with the worst conditions expected from late Monday evening through midday Tuesday. The National Guard will also have six dozen personnel and 20 vehicles stationed throughout the state starting on Monday morning. The storm could dump up to 3 feet of snow in Boston and New York before it ends Tuesday, along with freezing rain and strong wind gusts possibly reaching hurricane level. He repeated throughout a Sunday afternoon news conference that people should expect delays, very slow or stalled commutes Monday evening.
