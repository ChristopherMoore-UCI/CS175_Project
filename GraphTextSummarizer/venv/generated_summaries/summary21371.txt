"I want people the know there are some really good things happening in America," Obama declared at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Chicago, both summarizing his election-year pitch and capturing the political problem inherent in having to describe an economic recovery that many Americans still aren't feeling. The poll released Thursday showed Americans who earn north of $100,000 per year, and those living in the Northeast and West, far more likely to describe economic conditions as good. Although Obama can cite statistics that show a renewed U.S. economy, many Americans are still feeling battered by the downturn's legacy: stagnant wages and not enough full-time work. "Most people this fall are going to vote on economic issues," said Jay Carney, Obama's former press secretary, now a CNN contributor. Eager to highlight signs of an economy on the rebound, President Barack Obama launched a midterm election effort Thursday designed to convince voters of a vigorous recovery that a majority still doubts.
