You see, these are fans who are used to explaining -- and being summarily dismissed for -- their love of the band, said "RUSH: Beyond the lighted stage" documentarians Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen. Musicologist, author and RUSH researcher Christopher McDonald said fans deeply identify with the band because of that nonconformity. -- This is it: the night that RUSH fans have waited for since 1998, when the group was first eligible to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. While the first wave of RUSH fans in the 1970s were seen as a homogenous audience of jean-jacket-wearing, frowning boys, it soon became obvious that the fan base was far more diverse. But even so, he said, the group of RUSH fans who grew up with the band's music from the 1970s is still the largest group in the fandom.
