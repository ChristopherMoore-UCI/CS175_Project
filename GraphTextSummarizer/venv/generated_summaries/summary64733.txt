" Bernstein reemphasized that YSL had not infringed on Louboutin's trademark and "will continue to produce monochromatic shoes with red outsoles." Louboutin appealed after a federal court judge denied an injunction in August of last year that would have kept YSL from selling shoes with red soles. In the appellate decision, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes upheld trademark protection of Louboutin's red-lacquered outsole but said that YSL's use of the red sole in its monochromatic shoe does not infringe on the trademark. A federal appeals court has ruled that shoe designer Christian Louboutin can enforce a U.S. trademark of the red-lacquered sole that adorns the designer's footwear when it contrasts with the color of the rest of the shoe. A lawsuit filed in June 2011 by Louboutin took issue with four specific shoes from YSL's Cruise 2011 Collection: the Tribute, Tribtoo, Palais and Woodstock models, saying they violated Louboutin's trademarked "lacquered red sole."
