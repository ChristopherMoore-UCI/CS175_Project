Police have detained a man in his 70s at Montreal airport after a suspicious item was found in his luggage for a flight to Los Angeles, authorities said. The detained man is known to police, Lafraniere said, but not for anything related to terrorism. The item discovered wasn't an explosive but a part of a potential device, said Montreal Police Cmdr. Authorities then began searching the man's home and car, he said, seeking "anything that will make us understand what's going on." During the time it took police to secure the area around the man's home, about 20 people were evacuated from the area.
