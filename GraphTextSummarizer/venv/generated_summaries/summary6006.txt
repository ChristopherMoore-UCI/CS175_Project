The tiny, charitable publisher that Ohanian runs, called Breadpig, puts out books for popular Web comics, such as XKCD and Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. If the budding author can help rename a serious Greenpeace initiative as Mister Splashy Pants, maybe his viral abilities can sell books, too. People in the publishing industry began approaching Ohanian in 2009 after he gave a TED talk about an obscure Web meme called Mister Splashy Pants. The publishing house has produced best-sellers from CNN founder Ted Turner, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, and Zappos founder Tony Hsieh. To develop the book, he and his agent sought the services of Business Plus, an imprint of the Hachette Book Group-owned Grand Central Publishing.
