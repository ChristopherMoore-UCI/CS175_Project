Huddleston's expansive generosity about the humanity of all stood in sharp contrast to the way in which the community he served in Sophiatown was bulldozed by the apartheid government because its multi-ethnic character did not fit the paradigm of apartheid to separate people at any cost. Fifteen years later I asked Desmond Tutu when he would add LGBT people into his compelling vision that we are all "made for oneness." Tutu's insistence on our need for one another in order to be fully human is the signature idea behind his global leadership on reconciliation, ending conflicts and hope. Telling him of my lengthy hospitalizations as a teenager I said that I'd had an unexpected visitor in Trevor Huddleston whose book "Naught For Your Comfort" opened my eyes to the brutal realities of apartheid. I shared with him my willingness to go to prison indefinitely as a consequence for refusing to serve in the South African military that enforced apartheid.
