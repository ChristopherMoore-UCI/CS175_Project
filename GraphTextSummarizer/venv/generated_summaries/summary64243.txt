* * * * One morning, about two weeks before Picher's June 13 reunion, Hoppy's son moved his dad out of town while Hoppy was at his favorite restaurant eating breakfast. Hoppy Ray, 84, was among the last people to leave the toxic town of Picher, Oklahoma. Hoppy swore he wouldn't leave his hometown, that he would die before he'd leave Picher, even if his electricity and water were turned off. In those years, Picher was a bustling town with neon signs "like Las Vegas," Hoppy recalled. "I thought it was important that people ought to know what Picher's role was in two world wars," Hoppy said.
