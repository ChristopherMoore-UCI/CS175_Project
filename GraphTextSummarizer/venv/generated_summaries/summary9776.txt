Maybe she's a shade too attractive -- it's hard to take your eyes off her hair, so luscious it practically demands its own trailer -- but the contrast with flinty, brittle old Gus is effective, and Adams shows some grit too, easily bossing Justin Timberlake (game as the movie's token love interest). It's a peach of a role (it hardly needs pointing out that Eastwood has a long history of putting himself up against strong, independent women), and Adams is charming as a smart, attractive, career-driven, pool shootin', baseball lovin', perpetually thwarted daddy's girl. Although it's directed by a proxy (Robert Lorenz was assistant director on "Million Dollar Baby," "Mystic River" and "Space Cowboys" among others), "Trouble With the Curve" has all the hallmarks of an Eastwood movie in his folksiest mood. With Eastwood, when the script is strong and everything comes together, he's capable of producing wonderful movies. His buddy Pete (John Goodman) begs Gus' daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), to cover his back.
