Last year, prosecutors in New York charged Alcala with murder in the deaths of Cornelia Crilley and Ellen Hover. In June 1979, Alcala beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, authorities said. Rodney Alcala, 68, was escorted by U.S. Marshals to New York from California, where he had been on death row since 2010 for killing four women and a 12-year-old girl there. Authorities asked for the public's help in determining whether any of the people in the photographs were victims of Alcala. Alcala approached her at the beach in Huntington Beach and asked her to pose for pictures, authorities said.
