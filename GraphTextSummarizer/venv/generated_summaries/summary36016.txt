-- A lightning strike killed three people on a beach in Argentina Thursday and injured 22 others, state media reported. "We were hiding in a tent to take shelter from the storm when we felt an explosion, and then I saw my friend thrown to the ground," Rafael ViÃ±uela told the state-run Telam news agency. The state news agency reported that another victim, a 17-year-old, was playing soccer on the beach when the lightning hit, killing him and injuring several members of his family. It's summer in Argentina, and several witnesses told the state news agency they were vacationing in the area. The injured victims included 16 adults and six children, a health official said, according to Telam.
