"It seems like most presidents live exceptionally long lives." Health.com: How to live to 100 If that's the case, what explains the rapidly graying hair and premature wrinkles that seem to beset presidents? "The first eight presidents lived an average of 79.8 years during a time when life expectancy for men was under 40," says Olshansky, whose findings were published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They also take office in their mid-50s, on average -- a stage in life when the external signs of aging tend to become more pronounced in men. Wealth, access to healthcare, and education are all closely linked to longer lifespans, and presidents have all three resources in abundance, he reasoned; if anything, presidents should age slower than the average person. Michael Roizen, M.D., a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, even suggested on Obama's birthday that presidents age twice as fast as normal while in office.
