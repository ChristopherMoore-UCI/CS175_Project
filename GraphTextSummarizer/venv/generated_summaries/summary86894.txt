So when Gebrselassie labeled Nigerian sprinter Obinna Metu "a bundle of talent who has a very bright future because he is ready to learn," people began to sit up and take notice. " Bolt While most athletes would dream of having just one mentor with the experience and success of Gebrselassie, Metu is in the enviable position of having two -- and the second one isn't too bad either. Most of all Metu himself, who as the fastest sprinter in Nigeria is determined to emulate Gebrselassie's success. The opportunity to work with sprinters and coaches outside of his own country was important to Metu, who believes the lack of top training partners in Nigeria has hampered his progress. By working in the U.S. alongside some of the biggest names in athletics such as Bolt and Yohan Blake, Metu has gained the kind of experience he could never have gained in Nigeria.
