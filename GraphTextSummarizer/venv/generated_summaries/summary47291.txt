Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer for such David Fincher films as "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" (2011) and "The Social Network" (2010), noted that Willis was among a group (which included Cronenweth's father, Jordan) that changed American cinema. -- Gordon Willis, the cinematographer whose expert use of light and shadow on such films as "The Godfather" and "Manhattan" earned him the nickname "The Prince of Darkness," has died. " Willis' other films included "The Paper Chase" (1973), "The Godfather Part II" (1974), "The Parallax View" (1974), "Annie Hall" (1977) and "Presumed Innocent" (1988). On "The Godfather" (1972), Coppola's epic gangster saga, Willis' dimly photographed, almost sepia-colored rooms and bright outdoors scenes added both historical shading and ominous mood-setting to what was intended to be a quickie take on Mario Puzo's bestselling book. "On every movie I shot, I maintained strict developing and printing control -- everything was printed on one light," Willis told American Cinematographer magazine.
