The folder was bought and sold through Etsy, an online marketplace which Dickerson has helped lead since 2008, first as chief technology officer then as chief executive since 2011. "We believe that commercial activity, in the buying and selling of things, when done well actually improves the world." Etsy has perhaps benefited from the credit crunch, as those suffering financial pain seek to boost their incomes with online selling, but Dickerson also points to a "new form of economic activity." It is "not just the economic cycle, it's the creation of a new type of opportunity," Dickerson says. "I see the same dynamic on Etsy, but instead of creating open source software the Etsy community is creating something even more profound," Dickerson says. While Etsy, a headline act for Le Web London, is an e-commerce site, its "primary driver is a the authorship and provenance of where something came from," Dickerson told CNN. "When we talk about the vision for Etsy, we say that we are re-imagining commerce to build a more fulfilling and lasting world."
