Managers who are petrified by the looming issue of race and the potential of appearing prejudiced can make the mistake of not giving the type of critical feedback to minority team members that they readily offer to white team members. It became clear to me that white students were not giving the same level of critical feedback to minorities as they were to white team members. However well-intentioned, striving to create the appearance of colorblindness by sidestepping the specter of race can be more of an obstacle than an asset to good management practice. Rather than feeling reassured or comforted by your ability to avoid the race issue, consider that, according to research, minority employees like Larry are actually more (not less) distrustful of people who fail to acknowledge the elephant in the roomâ€”raceâ€”than they are of individuals who openly talk about it. But being more authentic and transparent about race can make people more relaxed in the workplace.
