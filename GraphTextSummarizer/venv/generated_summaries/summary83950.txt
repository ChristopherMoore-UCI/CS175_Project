At her MDNA tour stop in St. Petersburg, Russia, on August 9th, Madonna challenged the city's gay pride ban by giving away pink wristbands and speaking out at her show, according to The Hollywood Reporter. St. Petersburg prohibits the "propagation of homosexuality" and "promotion of gay lifestyles," and authorities had warned Americans of violent threats. In July, she was booed and called a "slut" by fans at an unexpected Paris show. France's far-right National Front party announced they will file a lawsuit against Madonna for her use of Nazi imagery at a tour stop in Paris. Despite several protests, the pop star handed out pink bracelets to concert attendees in opposition to the city's policies.
