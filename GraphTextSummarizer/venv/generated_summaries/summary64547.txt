-- As military operations against ISIS continue, there is a less visible, but no less important, diplomatic front, as the United States seeks to recruit new international members and keep Arab nations committed and willing to help strike both within Iraq and Syria. Oil is smuggled out of Syria by ISIS tankers, driven along secret routes in Turkey's southern corridor and sold by middlemen and local tribes. John Kerry: The fight against ISIS is 'going to go on' Obama: U.S. misjudged ISIS threat As of Friday, the coalition had carried out more than 200 strikes in Iraq and 43 in Syria, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Kerry said the threat ISIS poses to the region has been a wake-up call for nations to get serious about stopping the funding, including to Syrian groups. And since the Syrian conflict began more than three years ago, funding to various Syrian opposition groups has often ended up in the hands of more extremist elements.
