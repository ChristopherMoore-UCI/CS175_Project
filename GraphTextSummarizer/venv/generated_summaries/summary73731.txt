Time will tell whether Maxwell, the unconventional name that Jessica Simpson gave her daughter, will climb the list from its current spot at No. 134 as a boy's name. Among girls, Sophia rose from No. 2 in 2010 to claim the No. 1 spot from Isabella, pushing her down to No. 2 in 2011, according to the annual top 10 list. Isabella entered the top 10 in 2004 at No. 7. Jacob entered the list at No. 9 in 1993 and began his winning streak in 1999. The data come from Social Security card applications for births in the United States.
