The plan focuses on three tiers of training: -- Tier one for experts who may frequently deal with "don't ask, don't tell" repeal matters, like chaplains and military lawyers. -- It's been less than two months since President Barack Obama signed the bill that will eventually lead to repeal of the controversial ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military. The Pentagon released a memo Friday that finalizes how the department will begin adopting its policy to the new law, how it will train troops with regards to gays and lesbians serving openly and how it all will be communicated to Congress and the public. At that point, the secretary, chairman and the president will certify the department is ready for gay men and lesbians to serve openly. On March 1 Clifford Stanley, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, will provide a progress report on the preparation for repeal to the White House, the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
