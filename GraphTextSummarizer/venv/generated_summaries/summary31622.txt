After two days in Madrid, they will go to Seville on Friday for more official events, and then have a private weekend in southern Spain, before their official visit to Morocco on Monday, Clarence House and British officials in Madrid said. Later on Wednesday, Prince Charles will meet the president of Madrid's regional government and business leaders, members of the British community in Spain and attend a dinner at Spain's Royal Palace in central Madrid hosted by Prince Felipe. Prince Charles is expected to make brief speeches only twice during the trip, during a toast at the Royal Palace dinner on Wednesday and at Madrid city hall on Thursday morning, said British Embassy officials in Madrid. Prince Charles has made two previous official visits to Portugal, 10 to Spain --- most recently for the 2004 wedding of Prince Felipe to Letizia in Madrid --- and two to Morocco. Hosts for the visit will be Spain's Crown Prince Felipe and his wife, Princess Letizia, who will receive the visiting British royalty at the Pardo Palace, on the western outskirts of Madrid, for an opening ceremony with color guard.
