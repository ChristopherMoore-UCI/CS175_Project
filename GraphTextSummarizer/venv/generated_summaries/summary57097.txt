And the film's most deluxe monster is Kronos (father of Zeus, Hades and Poseidon), who, after being overthrown and imprisoned, has now risen up in the form of a really, really gigantic giant made entirely of volcanic rock and ash, with humungous arms that disintegrate and reconstitute themselves as they throw off fiery streams of lava. What there is of it consists of actors like Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ã‰dgar RamÃ­rez (as the evil Ares) staring at each other and saying ''You're my brother and you betrayed me!'' For a movie that's basically all warmed-over pseudo-mythology and special effects, "Wrath of the Titans" is certainly more fun, in its solemnly junky way, than "John Carter."
