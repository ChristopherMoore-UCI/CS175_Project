Ruckinger's husband then fired shots at John Sr., who responded in kind, Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement. "He was very cooperative with the investigation and his report of the events matches the physical evidence that we found," Pennsylvania State Trooper Matthew Evans said in an e-mail to CNN. Once "the immediate threats had been incapacitated," John Sr. called 911 and waited, said police. No charges have been filed against John Sr., police said. Ruckinger and her husband, Jeffrey, both 43, broke into an Ashville, Pennsylvania, home, where they shot and killed her mother and brother, before being killed by Ruckinger's father, according to Pennsylvania State Police.
