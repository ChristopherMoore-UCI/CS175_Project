We're building it to make digital life more elegantly and seamlessly integrated into physical life, or even to remove those barriers entirely. I know that some people worry wearable connected technologies will become just the next step down the path of draining our attention and further widening the schism between our physical lives and digital lives -- just another techno-distraction. Society has embraced eyeglasses to such a large degree because they offer us the best kind of technology -- there is no owner's manual, we don't have to fight with the user interface, and we forget they are there and become aware of them only in their absence. It is true that technology has the potential to dramatically help society. The most successful wearable technology in human history is something people don't even view as technology anymore:  eyeglasses.
