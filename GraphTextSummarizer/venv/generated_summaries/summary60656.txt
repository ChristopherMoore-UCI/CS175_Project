-- With New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer's resignation, Lt. Gov. David Paterson will become the first African-American governor of the state and the fourth in U.S. history. David Paterson earned his bachelor's degree in history from Columbia University and got his law degree from Hofstra Law School in 1982. He is the highest-ranking African-American elected official in New York state and is the first nonwhite legislative leader in Albany's history. He lost a race for lieutenant governor in 1970 and was deputy mayor of New York City under Mayor Ed Koch, according to The New York Times. In November 2002, Paterson was elected New York Senate minority leader.
