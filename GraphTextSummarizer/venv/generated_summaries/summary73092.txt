Coming from Miller, the chief of Russian energy giant Gazprom, it was a not-too-subtle nudge that global importers of energy, especially Europe, should invest more in Russian oil and gas capacity. However, Gazprom has been one of many Russian energy companies trying to attract more foreign investment to further exploit its vast and proven oil and gas reserves. Oil cartel OPEC has tried to calm concerns, saying spare capacity exists to soften the blow and moderate price spikes. "There is growing concern in the market that there isn't the spare capacity in Saudi Arabia that the markets have been told there is," said Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. "The question about the reliability of gas deliveries from North Africa to Europe should be more critically examined than it is currently." said Miller in comments to NTV, a Gazprom-owned Russian broadcaster.
