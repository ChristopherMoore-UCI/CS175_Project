Tony Stewart, one of the founders of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations in nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, told CNN last week that he found the timing of the planted bomb and two recent neo-Nazi activities in Coeur d'Alene One shirt says "Treasure Island 2009" and the other reads "Stevens County Relay For Life June 25th-26th 2010." Frank Harrill, special agent in charge of the FBI's Spokane field office, said last week that authorities know of no link to "any specific group or individuals" and called reports linking the bomb to recent neo-Nazi activity in a nearby Idaho town "premature." Before the King march kicked off last week, three parade workers found the gray backpack on a bench at the northeast corner of North Washington Street and West Main Avenue in downtown Spokane. But Stewart had no evidence tying the Spokane bomb to the two activities in Coeur d' Alene. Then, during the evening of the King holiday, about 15 neo-Nazis demonstrated outside the Human Rights Education Institute in downtown Coeur d'Alene, Stewart said.
