The man who in 2006 called for theaters to not screen the film that portrayed Bush being assassinated sang a far different tune when interviewed earlier this week by CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Another thing I can't forget is the outrage that DOAP sparked among some conservative commentators, including some of those very same people who are now defending Sony's film "The Interview," about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Not everyone will remember "Death of a President," the 2006 movie that included a controversial scene in which President George W. Bush was killed by a sniper. King went on to state -- as if he had no recollection of what he said in 2006 -- that there have "been terrible things said about our presidents and our leaders in movies. ... Rep. Peter King of New York, then chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, dubbed the film disgusting, claimed it "could incite real violence" and reportedly warned that the filmmakers "would have blood on their hands if anything should ever happen."
