With new season set to start on March 15 in Australia, the team has only a further four-day test at the same venue later this week to sort out its problems Alonso, who left Ferrari to join McLaren at the end of last season, has 32 career F1 wins but his two title wins date back to the 2005 and 2006 seasons. Alonso's fellow Spaniard, rookie Carlos Sainz Junior, was fastest in the session in his Toro Rosso in a time of one minute 25.604 seconds, running on fast super-soft tires. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso was airlifted to hospital after crashing his McLaren-Honda in the final day of pre-season testing in Barcelona Sunday. Last year's all-conquering Mercedes also had good reason to be satisfied with Nico Rosberg completing over 100 laps, with his best effort the second-best of the four-day test, despite running on slower medium compound tires. Spain's Alonso was on his 21st lap at the Circuit de Catalunya when his car left the track at Turn 3 and hit a wall at about 150kph per hour.
