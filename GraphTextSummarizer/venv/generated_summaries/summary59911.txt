Prosecutors charged the captain, Lee Joon-seok, and the three crew members with murder, because prosecutors allege the ferry's crew members didn't use the ship's facilities such as life rafts, life vests and announcements to evacuate passengers. He also added that South Korea does not usually sentence convicted criminals to life without parole --  so life sentences usually represent about 20 years or less of imprisonment. "The death penalty is essentially a mere life sentence," said Jasper Kim, a professor at the Graduate School of International Studies at Ewha University, who has a background in law. South Korean prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the captain of the capsized Sewol ferry and life in prison for three other crew members involved in the deadly disaster earlier this year. The Sewol disaster caused widespread outrage in South Korea over lax safety standards and the failure to rescue more people as the ship foundered.
