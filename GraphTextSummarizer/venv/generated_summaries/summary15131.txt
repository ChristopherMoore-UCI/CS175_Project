According to the Justice Department, it did not make a finding that officers engaged in a pattern of discriminatory policing, but "the investigation raised serious concerns that some of SPD's policies and practices, particularly those related to pedestrian encounters, could result in unlawful discriminatory policing." Investigators looked at a random sample of force reports between 2009 and 2011 and concluded when Seattle Police Department officers use force, they did so in an unconstitutional manner nearly 20% of the time. "Proper leadership, training (including mentoring), and oversight are critical for molding this next generation of SPD officers," said Justice officials in a letter sent to Seattle Mayor Michael McGinn and Police Chief John Diaz. In an effort to restore public confidence and trust, the Seattle Police Department has begun to implement a number of remedial measures, including new force policies and training for officers on how to conduct effective and constitutional policing, according to the Justice Department. "SPD officers escalate situations, and use unnecessary or excessive force, when arresting individuals for minor offenses," the Justice Department said. " Justice officials found that problems within the police department were exacerbated by the large number of less-experienced officers.
