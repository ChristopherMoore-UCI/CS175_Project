Recent park service changes -- with visitors to be allowed on ferries and on the islands before security scrutiny -- were challenged by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and New York City Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly. -- Days after a senator and a police official raised security concerns, the Interior Department has reversed a National Parks Service plan to screen visitors only after they arrived by ferry at two of New York's landmarks -- Ellis and Liberty islands. Jewell requested that the city immediately begin getting the permits to build a temporary security screening facility in Manhattan before the July 4th opening weekend for Liberty Island, which is home to the Statue of Liberty. Criticizing the proposed security changes, Kelly told reporters last week, "The NYPD and the National Park Service have differences when it comes to ideas on how to protect visitors from a terrorist attack. It's sort of saying we are going to screen people at airports after they get on the plane," Schumer told reporters last week.
