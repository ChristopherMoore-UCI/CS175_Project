-- Good news, ladies (and gentlemen): Country star Jason Aldean is extending his sold-out Burn It Down Tour into 2015. " Aldean's "Old Boots, New Dirt" album hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and broke the record for most first-day and first-week streams by a country album on Spotify, according to the magazine. Swindell's "Chillin' It," released on his debut album in February, made him a recognizable name, and the singer has opened for Luke Bryan on several occasions. The second leg of the tour will kick off in Greenville, South Carolina, on February 12, and Aldean will travel through Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee before heading to an additional 16 states across the country. "When you're out on the road for as long as we are and playing as many dates as we are, you want to be out there with guys that you enjoy hanging out with," Aldean told Rolling Stone.
