Just three weeks later, reality star Kim Kardashian landed herself on the front of People magazine with a big ring (with a 20.5-carat diamond, for those keeping score) and the big news that she was engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries. "Exclusive wedding photos can go for a lot of money," said Kelly Davis, a writer for celebrity photo site X17online.com. Magazines that don't want to spend the money [on wedding photos] will probably just use a shot of [Kim] in a white dress from the red carpet," she added. "Kim is our people's princess," Life & Style Weekly's editor-in-chief Dan Wakeford said. If a magazine with an exclusive deal in place finds out that another photo agency has candid pictures, it might shell out big money to scoop them off the market, she added.
