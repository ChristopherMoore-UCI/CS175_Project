-- While Rafael Nadal climbed into the crowd to hug his friends and family after clinching a record seventh French Open title on Monday, Novak Djokovic sat disconsolate at the side of the court. " Djokovic, who lost in the semifinals last year, was left on five grand slams. He has won the Australian Open three times, including a record-breaking near six-hour final against Nadal in January, plus last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open tournaments. The tennis season now moves onto grass ahead of the next grand slam, Wimbledon, which starts in London on June 25. He has now joined the legendary Swede on 11 grand slam titles overall, along with Australian Rod Laver -- who was the last man to hold all four major titles at one time.
