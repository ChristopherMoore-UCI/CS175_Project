Vowell describes a "fantastical scene" of all these people participating in a procession through Honolulu: Hawaiian royals in Western clothes, nine other Hawaiians in yellow-feathered war cloaks, British Royal Navy officers in their uniforms and the missionaries in their black wool outfits. In "Assassination Vacation," she dipped into the times of political violence that claimed the lives of U.S. Presidents Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield and William McKinley. When writing about Hawaiian royals in 1819 dropping one taboo on what women could eat, she notes, "As a female carnivore, I'm delighted that half the population was freed to eat pork." And then there were native Hawaiian guards who were wearing a variety of western garb - but who apparently didn't understand the need for pants. Exploring U.S. history in a very chatty tone and with personal asides has put several of Vowell's books on bestseller lists.
