Bush launched the "Right to Rise PAC" on Tuesday, a Leadership PAC which will allow him to raise money, hire staff, travel around the country and donate to candidates and other groups that could help him lay the groundwork for a presidential run. Bush supporters also launched a Super PAC in the same name on Tuesday according to FEC filings. Both the Leadership PAC and Super PAC list the same assistant treasurer in documents filed with the FEC on Tuesday. Bush aides gave Ryan a "heads up" about naming the PAC based on Ryan's use of the "right to rise" phrase, Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert said. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched a new political action committee Tuesday in the latest move that he is moving closer to a 2016 presidential run.
