-- Gov. Sarah Palin on Wednesday said Sen. Barack Obama has ties to a Columbia University professor who she said is "a former spokesperson for the Palestinian Liberation Organization." Palin said she and McCain are determined to put the country on "a path toward energy independence" and charged that an Obama administration would hinder that process. Palin said her assertion "is not negative campaigning to call someone out on their record." "It seems that there is yet another radical professor from the neighborhood who spent a lot of time with Barack Obama going back several years," Palin said at an event in Bowling Green, Ohio. " The poll of polls consists of eight surveys: ARG (October 25-27), IPSOS-McClatchy (October 23-27), Pew (October 23-26), ABC/Washington Post (October 24-27), Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby (October 26-28), Gallup (October 26-28), Diageo/Hotline (October 26-28), and IBD/TIPP (October 24-28). The Obama campaign called Palin's remarks "another recycled, manufactured controversy from the McCain campaign to distract voters' attention from John McCain's lockstep support for George Bush's economic policies.
