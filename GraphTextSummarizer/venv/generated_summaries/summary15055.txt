Our offense controlled the momentum and our special teams played well," Alabama coach Nick Saban said. But Alabama was able to overcome the loss and moved the ball up and down the field all game long, to the chagrin of the thousands of purple-and-gold-clad LSU fans who packed the Superdome in New Orleans. By the fourth quarter, the stands seemed like a sea of crimson as Alabama fans celebrated. Alabama's stifling defense battered LSU the entire game, holding the Tigers to just five first downs. College football pundits dubbed it the game of the century and Alabama lost 9-6 in overtime.
