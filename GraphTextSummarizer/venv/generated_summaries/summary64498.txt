India called off talks planned for Monday with Islamabad after Pakistan's New Delhi-based high commissioner, Abdul Basit, invited Kashmiri separatist leaders for consultations ahead of the summit. But Pakistan said in a statement it is a "longstanding practice" to meet with Kashmiri leaders before India-Pakistani talks are held. During his visit to Indian-administered Kashmir this month, Modi condemned "the continued proxy war by neighboring Pakistan." The New Delhi foreign secretary told Basit "in clear and unambiguous terms, that Pakistan's continued efforts to interfere in India's internal affairs were unacceptable," India's External Affairs Ministry said in a statement. Pakistan and India exchanged fire near the border in the disputed Kashmir region early Saturday, killing at least two people from each country.
