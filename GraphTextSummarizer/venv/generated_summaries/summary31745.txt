"The discovery of Ms. Marrero's remains now gives us the evidence we need to file this charge." Once he entered the guilty plea, Ridgway was given a 49th life sentence and returned to his prison cell at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. In a plea deal dating to November 2003, when he was sentenced on 48 counts of aggravated murder, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against Ridgway if he agreed to "plead guilty to any and all future cases (in King County) where his confession could be corroborated by reliable evidence," Satterberg said. Satterberg said his predecessor, Norm Maleng, opted to eliminate that option in King County in hopes of resolving more cold cases. Ridgway may still face the death penalty if convicted of murder outside King County. While not indicating any news on the horizon, Satterberg did not close the door to further murder charges against Ridgway.
