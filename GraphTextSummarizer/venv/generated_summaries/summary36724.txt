The Stone Ridge Fire, in the north, destroyed seven homes and 11 outbuildings and scorched 1,243 acres, but was fully contained Monday evening, said Tim Evans, a public information officer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. The Pitt Road Fire, on Amarillo's south side, destroyed five homes and eight outbuildings and damaged four other homes, but was 100% contained Monday, said April Phillips with the Texas Forest Service. -- Officials on Monday lifted evacuation orders that had sent hundreds of residents fleeing parts of Amarillo, Texas, as two wildfires approached Sunday. The blaze began Sunday afternoon amid what police called "very dry conditions, with zero chance of rain. " The current wildfire season is one of the worst in Texas history.
