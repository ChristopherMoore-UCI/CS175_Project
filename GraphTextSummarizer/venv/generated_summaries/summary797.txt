Jennifer Kirkland, an amateur paranormal investigator from Kentucky, agrees: "I love scaring people!" Sure, vampires and zombies are cool, but what is really freaky are the costumes that are basically normal people, but with some type of creepy or disturbing element added. " Her creation "Sightless" succeeded -- a blood-dripping horror with gouged-out eyes, which she turned on unsuspecting visitors at Devine's Haunted Corn Maze in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. "It's a chance to change into someone else entirely and take a vacation from yourself and enjoy being a character for a night or more" For others, Halloween holds the opportunity to get together and share in the scares: whether in a family group (like the gloriously grizzly, undead Rausch family), or in a terrifying mass with Berlin's Zombie Walk mob.
