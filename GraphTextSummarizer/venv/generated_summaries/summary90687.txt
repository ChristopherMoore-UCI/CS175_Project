Twelve House Democrats who sit on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Goodell that marked the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act and included this gem: "Given the important role the NFL and the other major professional sports leagues can play in shaping public perceptions concerning domestic violence, it would appear to be in the public interest to have the highest level of transparency associated with reviews of potential misconduct." In other words, if Ray Rice should be banned from the NFL for life, then why not Mark Fuller from the U.S. District Court? In sending two letters to the NFL regarding domestic violence, Congress has stated it expects a high bar to be set for professional athletes. If the NFL's pathetic handling of the domestic violence charges involving Ray Rice and Greg Hardy makes you angry, then you're going to blow a fuse over Fuller. So while members of Congress insist that an organization it has no authority over should permanently remove perpetrators of domestic violence, they have not taken a similar public stance regarding the domestic violence perpetrator whom they actually can do something about.
