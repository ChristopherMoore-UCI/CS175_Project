When Andy Roddick played tennis, the grand slam winner and former world No. 1 never shied away from conversing, or arguing with chair umpires. Having retired in 2012 and now watching the game as a pundit, Roddick, perhaps unsurprisingly, says there is not enough interaction between players and umpires. "This is completely different to what I thought as a player, but I would get rid of the challenge system," Roddick told CNN's Open Court on the sidelines of the charity event Mylan WTT Smash Hits in December. I am not saying we parade around and go all Hulk Hogan and enter the court in feather bows or anything, but if we play tennis with regular umpires forever and a day and it worked -- it wasn't like it was broken at all." Enric Molina, a former elite umpire who was in the chair for grand slam, Davis Cup and Olympic finals, didn't entirely disagree with Roddick.
