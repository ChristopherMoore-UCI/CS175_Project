-- About 14,000 Ivory Coast residents escaping their country's political instability and violence have fled to eastern Liberia in what has been an arduous journey, the United Nations refugee agency said Saturday. The agency has so far registered 14,000 Ivorian refugees in eastern Liberia and has prepared supplies to help up to 30,000 refugees in the area. "This is causing refugees from the Danane villages to deviate their route by up to 80 kilometers southward to enter Liberia. "Some are arriving with severely swollen feet, like a 75-year-old man whom we transferred from Butuo, one of the main entry points into Liberia. The refugee agency said "humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them" and the growing number of newcomers is affecting host communities.
