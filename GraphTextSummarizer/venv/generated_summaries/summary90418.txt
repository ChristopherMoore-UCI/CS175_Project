Schools that consistently report high student achievement consistently have students with great attendance. Regardless of the studies and research aimed at school improvement, I believe good educators have always known what makes schools work more efficiently. A large percentage of children who drop out of high school read far below grade level. If it is proven that a teacher can't teach (as indicated by low student performance, low enthusiasm, non-existent relationships with students and co-workers) why aren't they fired? I have worked at every level of the public school spectrumâ€”elementary through high school.
