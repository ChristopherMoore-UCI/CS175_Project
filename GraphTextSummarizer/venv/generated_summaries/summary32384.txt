Germany coach Joachim Low has ended speculation over his future by signing a two-year contract extension in the wake of a successful World Cup campaign. Low's young Germany side won rave reviews as they thrashed England and Argentina before losing to eventual winners Spain in the semifinals. "Our team has excellent sporting prospects and it is a big challenge for us to be able to get stuck into the preparations for Euro 2012 after the successful World Cup in South Africa. " Zwanziger was keen to extend Low's position as coach of Germany after the former Stuttgart manager guided his country to third in South Africa. Low, who has won 38 out of 55 matches since succeeding Jurgen Klinsmann in 2006, also guided Germany to the final of the European Championships of 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, where they were defeated 1-0 by Spain.
