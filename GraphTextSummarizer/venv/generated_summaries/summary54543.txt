Mexican authorities have arrested a former soccer star whom they accuse of using his social status to help a kidnapping gang track down information about potential victims, officials said. Trevi has not spoken publicly about the alleged kidnapping, which was widely reported in Mexican media. The gang was responsible for at least 20 kidnappings, spokesman Jorge Domene told reporters, including the abduction and release of pop singer Gloria Trevi's husband. Omar Ortiz, known as "The Cat," played for the Rayados de Monterrey before the Mexican Football League suspended him in April 2010 after he allegedly tested positive for steroid use. Journalists Javier Estrada and Victor Badillo, and CNN's Joseph Netto and Michael Roa contributed to this report.
