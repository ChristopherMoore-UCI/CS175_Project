We need to embrace the same strategic approach to border security and abandon a system that does not adequately distinguish between worker crossings and true dangers to U.S. security. However, border security also is about ensuring the safe, efficient flow of commerce and increasing international trade. Too often, border security is viewed as preventing the illegal entry of people and goods across state lines. The best way to strengthen border security without stifling trade is for Congress to establish a system whereby migrant workers can apply for validated, biometric entry keys to cross our border safely and legally. Nations cannot seek maximum security without shuttering trade, but nations cannot have fully open borders if they want real security.
