No one has yet been charged in the case, said Ortiz, who appeared with Schuette at a news conference in Detroit Monday morning. However, Michigan -- which had the most deaths of any single state in the 2012 outbreak -- will let its own grand jury in the case take a "temporary pause" in the probe of the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said. -- Michigan and federal authorities will coordinate their criminal investigations into a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak that killed 22 people in that state and 64 people total nationwide, the Michigan attorney general and the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts said Monday in Detroit. "This will help us reach our mutual goal: to secure justice for victims of fungal meningitis," Schuette said. The outbreak, thought to be caused by tainted steroid injections from the New England Compounding Center, infected 751 people in 20 states last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
