Unfortunately, a guy from Central Asia is seen the same as illegal migrant, even if he has spent his whole life in Russia. I saw the opportunity to do something I have always wanted to do -- see what life is like in Russia for migrant workers, or, as they are called here, "gastarbaiters". Nearly half of Tajikistan's GDP comes from money sent home by migrant workers in Russia. The piece was republished in Tajikistan and even in the Vietnamese press (lots of Vietnamese work in Russia as labor workers too). The abundance of workers from Tajikistan stems from the ease with which Tajiks can find employment in Russia.
