It wasn't until midway through the first half that Brazil fashioned a real opportunity -- but when it came it needed a wonderful save by Ochoa to keep Mexico level. And when Brazil did managed to create a chance, it found Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa in irrepressible form. Dani Alves, sporting his freshly sprayed silver hairstyle, escaped down the right and his cross was headed towards goal by Neymar only for Ochoa to scramble across goal and tip the ball away. It was the 22-year-old who was denied by Ochoa once again, this time the Mexican blocking Neymar's fierce drive from inside the penalty area. A free kick into the penalty area was chested down by Thiago Silva into the path of David Luiz but his effort was blocked by the onrushing Ochoa.
