Undule Mwakasungula, director of the Malawi Center for Human Rights and Rehabilitation, is quoted in a Human Rights Watch news release Friday that "Malawi has done right by Darfur victims today. -- Malawi said it won't host an African Union summit next month because the organization wants Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader accused of war crimes in Darfur, to attend. "Malawi joins an increasing number of countries that have declined to welcome al-Bashir," said Alan Wallis, international justice lawyer at the Southern Africa Litigation Center, quoted by Human Rights Watch. Al-Bashir made trips abroad for meetings despite the ICC warrants against him crimes in the Darfur region, where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the Janjaweed since 2003. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide, but he has eluded arrest.
