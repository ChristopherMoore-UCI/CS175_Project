-- Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo has been ruled out of Portugal's crucial final World Cup qualifier against Malta on Wednesday with an ankle injury and could be sidelined for up to a month. The results almost certainly means the departure of Swedish coach Lars Lagerback, who said on Sunday that he will resign if his team fail to qualify for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Portugal, who have made a late charge in World Cup qualifying after looking set to make an ignominious exit, need to beat Malta in the home game to be sure of a place in the European playoffs. Meanwhile, Ronaldo's former Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney has been ruled out of England's final World Cup qualifier against Belarus with a calf strain. "Roland and I will resign depending on the result, either after the World Cup in South Africa, after the playoffs or after the (last) qualifier against Albania," Lagerback said.
