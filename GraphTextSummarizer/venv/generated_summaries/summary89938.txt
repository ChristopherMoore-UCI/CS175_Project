Kesha, whose full name is Kesha Rose Sebert, was "an intelligent, family-oriented, and joyful young woman" before Dr. Luke "showered her with promises of fame and fortune" and induced her to sign a contract with him in 2005, her lawsuit said. -- Kesha and Dr. Luke exchanged harsh accusations in lawsuits filed by the singer and producer Tuesday. Kesha's lawyer Mark Geragos said her lawsuit "is a wholehearted effort by Kesha to regain control of her music career and her personal freedom after suffering for 10 years as a victim of mental manipulation, emotional abuse and sexual assault at the hands of Dr. Luke. Kesha's civil complaint filed in Los Angeles claims that Dr. Luke sexually, physically and verbally abused her over the 10 years since he signed her as an 18-year-old artist. Christine Lepera, the lawyer who filed the suit for Dr. Luke, said Kesha's complaint "is nothing more than a continuation of her bad and offensive acts." "As set forth in the complaint that we have filed on behalf of Dr. Luke, Kesha and her mother are engaged in a campaign of publishing outrageous and untrue statements about Dr. Luke to third parties, including scurrilous and false statements of purported physical and mental abuse of Kesha," Lepera said.
