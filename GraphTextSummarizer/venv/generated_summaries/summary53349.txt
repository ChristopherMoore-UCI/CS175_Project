Two of the vessels foundered Sunday afternoon as they battled gales about 330 kilometers from the Chinese island of Hainan, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. As of Tuesday morning, rescuers had retrieved 16 survivors, the state-run China News Service reported, citing the Hainan government. Rescue operations have been hampered by strong gales and rough seas. A total of five fishing boats with 171 crew aboard had been caught in the storm, the Hainan Maritime Search and Rescue Center said, according to Xinhua. Xi also ordered the armed forces and central government departments to help in the rescue effort.
