-- Two Mexican brothers have been extradited to the United States to join a third brother to face sex trafficking charges in New York as part of a complex collaborative effort to combat human trafficking, federal officials said Monday. United States v. Carreto is considered to be "one of the first sex trafficking cases prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn," according to Monday's news release, "After substantial post-conviction investigation and international coordination, the child was located and reunited with the victim-mother." Sienna Baskin, co-director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center, called this "an example of people going above and beyond and being creative and thinking outside the box in order to make this happen. Under the initiative, "the United States and Mexico have collaborated to bring high-impact prosecutions under both U.S. and Mexican law to more effectively dismantle human trafficking networks operating across the U.S.-Mexico border," Monday's news release said. "The indictment charges the defendants with sex trafficking, interstate prostitution, alien smuggling and money laundering offenses, involving victims as young as 14 and 15 years old," it said. The extensive indictment is the product of the Bilateral Human Trafficking Enforcement Initiative, an in-depth partnership involving the Department of Justice, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Urban Justice Center and many non-profit and non-governmental organizations in the United States and Mexico, the release said.
