"Intimidation of victims and witnesses in sex abuse cases in the Orthodox community is what has made prosecuting these cases so difficult," said Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes. -- A teenage girl and her boyfriend were allegedly offered half a million dollars to keep quiet or flee the country to avoid testifying in an upcoming child sex abuse case against the girl's former therapist in Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, according to prosecutors. When they didn't cave, Jacob Berger allegedly ripped the certification down from the wall, prosecutors said, the latest in a string of alleged harassment against the girl, her boyfriend and their family. Prosecutors say the men pressured the girl and her boyfriend "to not cooperate with law enforcement," and threatened to take away her boyfriend's rabbi-issued kosher certification from his Brooklyn restaurant. If found guilty, Joseph and Hertzka Berger each could face up to a year in jail, while Jacob Berger faces a potential four years.
