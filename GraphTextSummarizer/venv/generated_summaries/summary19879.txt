Taeheung Kim, 41, became separated from his tour late Thursday afternoon and was last seen by a security guard at 5 a.m. Friday in front of the museum, police said. " On Saturday, New York City police asked for the public's help in finding the man, whom they described as 5 feet 6 inches tall and legally blind. Details on where he'd been and what he'd done since late Thursday afternoon were not immediately available. A spokesman at the South Korean consulate in New York -- who asked not be named -- told CNN early Saturday evening that Kim had flown back home with his sister. They issued an update shortly before 6 p.m., saying Kim had "been located and is in good health."
