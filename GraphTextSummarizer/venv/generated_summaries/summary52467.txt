Sick sea lion ends up on hotel patio Lost sea lion pup visits neighborhood Dolphin refuses to leave Southern California channel Hoppie is not the first California sea lion to swim up the San Joaquin River channel, according to The Marine Mammal Center. That's the situation an adventurous California sea lion found himself in after swimming up the San Joaquin River, ending up at Mape's Ranch in Modesto, California, about a 100-mile drive from the Pacific Ocean. Assistant wildlife refuge manager Eric Hopson arrived on site and with the help of ranch hands helped corral the sea lion into a trap, said Jack Sparks with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. After finding Hoppie, Lyons contacted the nearby San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge.
