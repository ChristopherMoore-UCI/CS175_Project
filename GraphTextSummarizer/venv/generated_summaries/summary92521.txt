Previous years have showered nominations on "Game Change," "Angels in America," "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee," "Grey Gardens" and "John Adams." Last year the Outrage Machine (commonly known as "the Internet") was inflamed by the lack of attention paid to "Orphan Black," the thrilling BBC America series that stars Tatiana Maslany as several mysterious clones. Similarly, Fox's "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" had an up-and-down season, with its surprise Golden Globe win contrasting with mediocre ratings and uneven scripts. Last year it was "Behind the Candelabra." This year, look to "The Normal Heart," the film version of Larry Kramer's wrenching play about AIDS, to be among the leaders for total nominations, with stars Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts leading the way.
