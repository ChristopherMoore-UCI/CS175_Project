If there's a welcome surprise in the slow-moving disaster that's the great Mississippi River flood of 2011, it's that the crawfish are now running heavy, said craw fisherman Jody Meche, 41, of Henderson, Louisiana. Past hurricanes such as Gustav in 2008 felled many trees along the river, and the timber has since been lodged along the banks, said Stephen Minvielle, director of the Louisiana Crawfish Farmers Association. Crawdads are so big in this part of the country that Louisiana accounts for 98% of the country's production, according to the Louisiana Crawfish Farmers Association. "The crawfish is going to run heavy, but it's a hectic situation," said Meche, who's also vice president of the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association West, which has 400 to 500 members. But the rising waters have forced Meche to string the crawfish traps to higher tree branches, he said.
