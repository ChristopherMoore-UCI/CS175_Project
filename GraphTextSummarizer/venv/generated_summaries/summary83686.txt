" The federal complaint against Romero said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by Klinko. The judge declared a mistrial in the sham marriage trial of Mexican soap opera actress Fernanda Romero on Friday after jurors said they were deadlocked with no hope of agreeing. " Romero said the relationship initially was "professional and creative," but she eventually engaged in a "short affair" with Klinko as he helped with her modeling career. When Klinko testified for the prosecution last week, he said it was "completely incorrect" that his motivation was to get Romero deported. The case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases.
