Poehler reportedly will join Meyers for some segments of "Weekend Update Thursday," a 30-minute, prime-time version of the skit that debuted during the 2008 presidential election and that the network hopes will have similar success during the upcoming season. " Poehler won't be the only cast member from last year missing on the September 26 premiere, hosted by actress Megan Fox with musical guest U2. "It looks like for right now, we're going to stick with doing it solo," Meyers said Monday in New York as he was getting ready for the show's 35th season premiere on September 26. Meyers, SNL's head writer, hosted the popular sketch alone after Amy Poehler left the show last season. " Meyers called Wiig "almost too valuable," saying making her a full-time co-anchor would mean she could never play guest characters during the segment.
