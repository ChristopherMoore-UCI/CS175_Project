Scott said he had no idea when a trial would be set for Phillip and Nancy Garrido, who have both pleaded not guilty to charges relating to Dugard's alleged kidnapping and subsequent abuse. More than anything, Scott said, Dugard's family is working to make life as normal as possible and allow them to make up for lost time. " Scott also said that because of Phillip Garrido's previous criminal history, which includes a kidnapping and rape charge for which he was registered as a sex offender, Garrido would automatically receive a sentence of 25 years to life if he were found guilty on only one felony charge. He praised law enforcement and family members for helping protect Dugard and her children after her discovery. " Scott said Dugard's daughters, who police said never went to school or a doctor, were receiving tutoring.
