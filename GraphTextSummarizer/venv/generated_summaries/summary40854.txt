In a bid to resolve the current crisis, Yingluck dissolved parliament last month and called for new elections to be held on February 2. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. Since demonstrations against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government began in November, nine people have died and more than 450 have been wounded, according to authorities. The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. One man wounded at the protest Friday died Saturday, emergency officials said.
