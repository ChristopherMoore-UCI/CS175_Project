"If anybody doubted before this accident that faith moves mountains, if anybody doubted that when us Chileans get united we are capable of reaching great goals, if anybody doubted our ability to make great achievements, I think that your example has dissipated those doubts," Pinera said, referring to the miners. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera invited the miners, known as "the 33," to a special ceremony in Santiago. " The miners have garnered much attentions since their rescue, and many of them still wore the $400 Oakley sunglasses they were given to protect their eyes as the exited the mine. The rescue earlier this month captured the attention of the world, as one by one the trapped miners were pulled to the surface in a custom-made capsule that was lowered through a hole drilled into the rock. The decision was to assume in its entirety 100 percent of the responsibility," Pinera said.
