-- A manhunt was under way Saturday in Greece for two suspects who tied up a guard, stormed the Archeological Museum of Olympia, smashed glass casings and stole dozens of small statues, state media reported. Closed-circuit video footage showed the suspects as they seized about 65 statuettes, Greece's official AMNA news agency reported. The robbers took 65 to 68 clay and brass statues, and a gold ring, police spokesman Athanassios Kokkalakis said Friday, the day of the theft. It's the second big theft of this kind in Greece this year. The museum, built on an ancient site in the Peloponnese peninsula, is considered among the most important in Greece.
