So when I heard St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCullough describe how Michael Brown allegedly lunged at Officer Darren Wilson in his police car, I knew it was likely that my husband could have responded the same way: shoot to disable the threat. These conflicting parts of my reality are why the South Carolina state trooper shooting earlier this year isn't, to me, a black-and-white case of excessive force used by white law enforcement on an unarmed black teenager. So the grand jury's decision seems to double down on a pattern in this country of killing black boys without care or consequences. Like Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and Oscar Grant. Not simply because I knew it was likely to lead to more heartache and unrest for the black community -- my community -- but because it would most certainly dredge up deep internal conflict for me.
