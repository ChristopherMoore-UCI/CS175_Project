In the southern city of Guangzhou, as many as 500,000 train passengers were stranded the past few days when a power failure in neighboring Hunan province crippled the regular train services, local officials said. "We've never seen such a cold weather lasting for such long a time," said Tang Shan, a man in his 70s in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province. For several days before and after that day, an estimated 178 million Chinese will travel by train, and 22 million more by plane, officials say. Railway and highway routes have been brought to a standstill, several regional airports have been closed and many provinces have imposed power "brownouts" to conserve energy. Tang Shan, the retired official in Hunan, is staying put instead of joining the holiday exodus.
