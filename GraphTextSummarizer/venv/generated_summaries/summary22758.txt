That's why we're asking Speaker John Boehner and the House leadership to make sure that the Violence Against Women Act continues to protect vulnerable immigrant women who are victims of human trafficking or domestic violence. Several provisions would leave immigrant victims of human trafficking and domestic abuse no legal way to break the cycle of violence in which they are trapped. Through local churches and ministries, we extend that love when we provide counseling and support for victims of human trafficking and domestic violence. With the help of a nonprofit legal service provider and the Salvation Army, Nicole was able to petition on her own for legal status -- and obtain it -- through a special "U" visa for immigrant victims of crime, allowing her to get back on her feet and begin rebuilding her life. The bill would also allow abusive partners in domestic violence cases to provide input as to whether their victim should qualify for immigration relief, stripping confidentiality provisions that currently protect victims.
