Seattle romped 43-8 by playing a suffocating defense and taking advantage of four Denver turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by quarterback Peyton Manning, the NFL's most valuable player for the season. The game pitted pro football's best offense, Denver, against the best defense, Seattle, but the drama disappeared early at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. A man was shot several times during a Super Bowl party at a residence in Denver, police said. Seattle won its first Super Bowl in franchise history. Though the game didn't experience the blackout that hit last year's Super Bowl, fans in Los Angeles had their own visual blackout.
