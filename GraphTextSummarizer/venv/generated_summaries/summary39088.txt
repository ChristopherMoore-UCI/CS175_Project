Investigators know Frein "has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said last week. He harbors a grudge against cops While authorities believe Frein has an intense grudge against law enforcement, one friend said his angst is actually against the federal government. But others close to Frein told investigators that he had talked about his disdain for law enforcement, authorities said. "Based on our investigations, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years," State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Sunday. Although Frein is on the run and possibly armed, there is no indication that he is a danger to anyone other than law enforcement, Bivens said.
