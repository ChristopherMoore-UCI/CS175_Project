-- One year ago, Tunisian fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi torched himself out of economic despair, and the news of his desperate act spread like a brushfire across the North African country, through the rest of the Arab world and around the globe. As protests unfolded after Bouazizi's self-immolation, the government could have reacted the way politicians do in the United States and other Western nations, Mhirsi said. Mothana said the uprisings across the Arab world would have happened with or without Bouazizi's act, noting that this "didn't come out of the blue." Shaikh said Bouazizi was seen as a man who struggled and tried to do the right thing, Shaikh said, but he wasn't born into the right clan or elite and was under the thumb of a dictatorial regime. Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center and fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, constantly heard about Bouazizi and Tunisia in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.
