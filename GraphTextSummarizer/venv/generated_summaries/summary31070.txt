Watch Johnson in the video below, inadvertently providing us with further proof that Fast & Furious has become the Nexus of All Action Movie Franchises, just like the M'Kraan Crystal, or whatever DC's version of the M'Kraan Crystal is. (EW.com ) -- Dwayne Johnson has long been rumored to play a character in Warner Bros' rapidly expanding DC movie universe. "DC and I have been talking for a couple of years now," said the Hercules star, clearly excited to talk about anything besides Hercules. As comic book fans know, the character originally known as Captain Marvel essentially has Superman-level abilities--abilities that are activated when he says the word "Shazam!" Warner Bros. had no official comment when contacted by EW, although it's worth pointing out that there is a rumored Shazam movie on the horizon for 2016.
