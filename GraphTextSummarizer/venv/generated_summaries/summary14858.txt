Malema has also called for nationwide strikes in the mining industry, dismaying politicians trying to quell labor discontent among workers. He said the charge against him is politically motivated by President Jacob Zuma. -- A South African court charged Julius Malema with money laundering Wednesday, and the firebrand politician scoffed at the accusations and riled up his supporters moments after his release on bail. Malema's controversial road to fame includes his calls to seize white-owned farms in South Africa, especially incendiary in a nation with a history of racial tensions. Malema was freed on $1,215 bail and is scheduled to return to court on November 30.
