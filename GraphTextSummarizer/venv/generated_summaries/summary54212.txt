Traditionalists are also yet to be swayed by Madrid's bold declaration that blue is the new red, with many iconic images of past tournaments showing players' pristine white outfits slowly becoming cloaked in red clay. Tiriac also pioneered the first blue hard courts and says the switch to blue clay is a logical step. He said: "As far as Nadal and Federer, they are great players and great human beings, I respect their opinion but I don't have to accept everything one player says. The 2012 installment of the $10.6 million tournament in the Spanish capital will be the first time an officially sanctioned Tour event will be played on a blue clay court -- a departure from the traditional red associated most closely with the French Open and Roland Garros. Tiriac says the new surface has been trialled on players in Spain's Davis Cup team and two-time major champion Marat Safin, all of whom gave the blue clay the green light.
