One of the most expensive pairs in his collection, valued at 110,000 yuan ($17,600), is a pair featuring the signatures of all the players in the Chicago Bulls team led by Jordan that won the 1993 NBA finals, reports said. The man, identified only by an English name, Mick, pawned 283 pairs of limited edition Nike Air Jordan sneakers in exchange for a $160,000 loan, which he plans to use to cover the down payment for an apartment to share with his new wife, the pawn shop said. CNN Beijing Interns Sherry Fei Ju and Harvard Zihao Zhang contributed to this report. Wang Xiaoyu, the vice president of marketing at Beijing World of Pawn Co told CNN that a very small number of the sneakers had been worn but most were in pristine condition, wrapped in their original packaging. An avid basketball fan, he particularly liked watching Michael Jordan matches.
