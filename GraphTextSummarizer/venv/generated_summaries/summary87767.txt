Colorado and Utah announced Tuesday they would order county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Because neighboring states are covered by the appeals court's jurisdiction, same-sex marriage could be extended in coming weeks to Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. Three judges from the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in California concluded the bans in the two Western states violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples to legally marry. "When same-sex couples are married, just as when opposite-sex couples are married, they serve as models of loving commitment to all." "It means so much for the courts to recognize our family and say that we must be treated equally," said Lori Watsen, who wed Sharene Watsen in New York in 2011.
