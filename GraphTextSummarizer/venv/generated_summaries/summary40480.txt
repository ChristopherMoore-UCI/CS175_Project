The officer retreated, but an undercover detective was nearby and shot Garnett in the upper body, said Phoenix police spokesman James Holmes. A nationwide manhunt for the suspected bank robber -- identified as 40-year-old Mario Edward Garnett by Phoenix police -- ended when a Phoenix police detective shot and killed a man after a new bank robbery on Saturday. Secret Service spokesman Max Milien said that Garnett is the same individual arrested in 2010 in Oklahoma City for threatening the President. The man suspected of robbing banks and killing a police officer was convicted of threatening President Barack Obama in 2010, the Secret Service said Sunday. Garnett's last heist took place Saturday morning in Phoenix.
