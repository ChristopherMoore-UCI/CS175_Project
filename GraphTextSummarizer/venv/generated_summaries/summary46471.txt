-- New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer said Wednesday he is giving up his proposal to grant driver's licenses to undocumented workers, a plan he said would "improve the safety and security of the people of my state." New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer says Wednesday in Washington that opposition to his plan doomed it. Spitzer said he was giving up because he had concluded that "New York state cannot successfully address this problem on its own." The effect was about 1 million undocumented workers in New York state, "many of whom are driving without licenses," said Spitzer, surrounded at a news conference by members of his state's congressional delegation. Watch Spitzer explain why he's withdrawing the proposal Â» Spitzer said licensing workers who did not have Social Security numbers, which New York had done in the past, would have aided law enforcement and would have made the state's streets safer and more secure.
