With the exception of a few of our leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln of Franklin Roosevelt, people tend to remember presidents in different ways at different times. The most obvious reason is that the passions for presidents -- both good and bad -- tend to go down after they leave office. Finally, and this is not relevant to Bush yet, the opening of archival records from the period a president is in office can dramatically change how we see him. Now, Gallup has released a survey showing that for the first time since 2005, more people approve than disapprove of Bush. Former President George W. Bush is enjoying another bounce in the post-presidential polls.
