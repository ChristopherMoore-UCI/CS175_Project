Kanye West takes the microphone from Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday. A giddy Swift was in the midst of her acceptance speech for Best Female Video when the often-mercurial West rushed onstage, grabbed her microphone and let loose an outburst on behalf of singer Beyonce Knowles, who had lost out in that category. Soon after, an apology to Swift appeared on his blog: "I'm sooooo sorry to Taylor Swift and her fans and her mom," the message said in all caps. The pre-show buzz had focused on the highly anticipated tribute to the late Michael Jackson, but West's disruption stole the spotlight. -- Even by the standards of the anything-goes MTV Video Music Awards, Kanye West's hijacking of country-pop sweetheart Taylor Swift's speech at the Sunday night ceremony was particularly brutal.
