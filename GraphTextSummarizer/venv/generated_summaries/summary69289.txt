The tooth fairy's trash became another man's treasure Saturday when a discolored molar that once belonged to John Lennon was put up for auction. Jarlett said Lennon gave his family many gifts over the years. Lennon gave the tooth to Dorothy "Dot" Jarlett when she worked as his housekeeper at his Kenwood home in Weybridge, Surrey, according to her son, Barry. Jarlett, who was employed between 1964 and 1968, developed a warm relationship with Lennon, her son said. He plans to keep a leather wallet, and his mother still has a pearl necklace Lennon gave her when he returned from Japan.
