The 46-year-old Dieudonne, who ran in the European elections as an anti-Zionist, has been fined several times in France for anti-Semitic commentary. The 34-year-old striker made the sign after scoring for his Premier League team, West Bromwich Albion, against West Ham on December 28. Dieudonne counters that it is anti-establishment but not anti-Semitic. "The Home Secretary will seek to exclude an individual from the UK if she considers that there are public policy or public security reasons to do so." The comedian has voiced his support for controversial French soccer star Nicolas Anelka, who faces a possible five-match suspension after being charged by the English Football Association for making a "quenelle" gesture in December.
