The alleged madam for a high-priced escort service in Manhattan pleaded guilty to one count of prostitution in the third degree on Tuesday, according to Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. When asked by New York Judge Juan Merchan in court whether she knowingly profited from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling and owning a prostitution business, Gristina answered affirmatively, according to the District Attorney's Office. We are left with a straightforward promoting prostitution case," Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan read in court on Tuesday, "a defendant who ran a brothel for many years and who profited from the sex trade. "Anna chose love over the ordeal of a trial." Merchan said Gristina will be officially sentenced on November 20 to six months in jail, but because she has already served several months at Rikers Island Prison, "this essentially amounts to time served followed by probation," according to the District Attorney's Office. Lawyer: NYC madam 'doesn't have 2 nickels to rub together' Gristina had allegedly made numerous claims that she had connections with the New York Police Department, the FBI, the governor's office and the District Attorney's Office, among others.
