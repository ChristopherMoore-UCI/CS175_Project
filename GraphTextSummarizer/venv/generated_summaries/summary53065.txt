-- Police evicted 200 Bedouins from their homes in a southern Israeli village on Tuesday and demolished their dwellings, an act decried by residents who said they are on ancestral land. "The state of Israel is treating us like cockroaches," said Sulaiman Abu Mdian, 29, a father of four who works as a chicken farmer. They said armed police deployed with tear gas, water cannon, two helicopters and bulldozers. Villagers said they've lived in the region for years back to the Ottoman days before Israel was founded, and have original deeds to the land. But Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said there were no disturbances and the operation went according to plan.
