The T-39N took off from Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida, about 400 miles south of Morganton, Bergen said. A fourth person aboard the jet was unaccounted for Monday night, said Harry White, spokesman for the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. "We got reports that it was flying pretty low," Bosen said. The mountainous area is ringed by national forest land, and the crash set the surrounding woods on fire. "We have about a 10- to 15-acre fire still working at this time," Bosen said.
