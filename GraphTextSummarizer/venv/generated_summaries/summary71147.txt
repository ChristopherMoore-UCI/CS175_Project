Marek was one of two men working in that part of the Lucky Friday mine when a 10-foot by 20-foot section of mostly rock fell on him, said Hecla's President and CEO Phil Baker. Lucky Friday is a "deep underground silver, lead and zinc mine," according to Hecla's website. Rescue workers had been digging through rocky earth more than 6,000 feet underground in an attempt to reach Marek, 53, following the April 15 collapse at the silver and mineral mine outside Mullan, Idaho. Earlier Sunday, the company had said it believed that Marek, a Hecla employee for more than 12 years, was dead. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones and friends," Hecla Mining Company said in a statement announcing that the body of Larry Marek had been recovered.
