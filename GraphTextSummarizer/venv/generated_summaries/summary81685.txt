-- Championship leader Jorge Lorenzo grabbed pole position for Sunday's Malaysian MotoGP with a record-breaking lap in qualifying at the Sepang International Circuit on Saturday. His compatriot Dani Pedrosa will start Sunday's race from second with Italy's Andrea Dovizioso third. Casey Stoner, who returned to action last weekend after recovering from an ankle injury sustained at the Indianapolis MotoGP in August, is third in the overall standings 113 points behind Lorenzo. Lorenzo is currently 28 points ahead of Honda's Pedrosa who has closed the gap on the championship leader in recent weeks, winning four of the last five races. Pole position is a very good position but we need to set-up the bike [for Sunday]," the Spaniard said.
