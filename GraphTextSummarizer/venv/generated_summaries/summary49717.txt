Justice Department records released Friday night showed that one of Holder's top lieutenants, Criminal Division chief Lanny Breuer, and then-ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson discussed whether illegal weapons could be intercepted in Mexico if U.S. and Mexican authorities worked together. Issa has hammered away at Holder during the course of the committee's inquiry and accused Justice Department officials of misleading Congress; Holder has slapped back by calling GOP allegations about the program "inflammatory and inappropriate. -- Democrats say a House committee has found no evidence showing that top Justice Department officials were behind a gun-trafficking investigation that let hundreds of high-powered weapons reach Mexican drug cartels. And the Oversight Committee's chairman, California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, released a letter to Holder on Tuesday in which he repeats demands for Justice Department documents he says are needed to determine "to what extent" the department "has obstructed our work." The Republican head of the committee, meanwhile, accused the department of obstructing its probe of the botched operation and threatened Attorney General Eric Holder with contempt of Congress.
