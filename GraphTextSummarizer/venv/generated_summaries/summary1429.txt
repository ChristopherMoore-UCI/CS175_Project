The prefecture of Kyoto in central Japan introduced a ban on possession of child pornography in 2011. "We need to allow the gray zone to exist as a necessary evil." 'An international hub' Some experts counter that children suffer in a culture that appears to tolerate images of child sexual abuse. In most of Japan, it's still legal to possess child pornography. Statistics show that child pornography remains a big problem in Japan. The U.S. State Department's 2013 report on human rights practices in Japan labels the country "an international hub for the production and trafficking of child pornography."
