The man suing ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez for shooting him in the face has responded to Hernandez's request for a delay in the lawsuit until his murder charges in Massachusetts are resolved. His attorneys further state any additional delays would be "highly prejudicial" to Bradley's case because there is no way of telling how long Hernandez's murder case will take to come to a conclusion. However, one of Bradley's lawyers has asserted the grand jury likely wanted to relate Hernandez's alleged conduct in Florida to Lloyd's slaying in Massachusetts. " Grand jury calls 2 to testify in deaths possibly linked to Hernandez Bradley is suing Hernandez, claiming the then-New England Patriot tight end shot Bradley in February after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed in June, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally "possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have." Bradley said he lost the sight in one eye and continues to receive treatment.
