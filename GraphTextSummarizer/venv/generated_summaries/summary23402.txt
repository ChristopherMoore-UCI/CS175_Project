Articles of clothing were found Friday in one mine, but authorities had not determined whether they are related to the disappearance of Robyn Gardner, Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN. Although officials have stopped actively searching for Gardner, they are continuing to seek evidence in the case, Stein said. Authorities are concerned for Gardner's welfare because she has not stepped forward despite all the publicity surrounding the case, Stein said. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner, also from Maryland, when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. The Aruban prosecutor's office has declined to say what evidence led authorities to suspect Giordano's involvement in Gardner's disappearance.
