Obama's comments don't just speak to the young black man who worries he's being followed, or who sees other people look at him with fear. Those misconceptions about him and the fear Martin felt that night are all too familiar to way too many Americans. And yes, he spoke to the white Americans who feel fear that of being robbed when approached by a young black man. Far too many people of different backgrounds who feel targeted, mocked, or looked down upon by others. He called for respect for the process and the verdict, but used the remarks as an opportunity to help others understand why so many people were angry.
