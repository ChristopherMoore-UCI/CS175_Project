Akihiro Suzuki, an assemblyman from the ruling LDP party, admitted to heckling fellow assembly member Ayaka Shiomura, who is from the minority Your Party, during her speech urging increased public support for pregnant Japanese women. Women are paid, on average, 30% less than their male counterparts, according to statistics cited by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during an editorial last year announcing the launch of "Womenomics." Women also hold just 3% of management positions in Japan's central government, according to the National Personnel Authority. The incident last week reignited the debate over sexism in the Japanese workplace. -- A male member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly apologized Monday for shouting sexist remarks at a female colleague as she was giving a speech last week. " Shiomura accepted his apology but stated, "I'm positive that there were others besides Mr. Suzuki who made comments."
