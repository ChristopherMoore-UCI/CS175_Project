Dialogue and the economy are related, as Iran faces sharp international sanctions over its nuclear program, but Rouhani said he foresees a "fresh opportunity for interaction at the global level. Calling relations between the U.S. and Iran an "old wound" and "complicated," Rouhani said that before there are talks, the U.S. must first promise to never interfere with Iranian domestic affairs and scrap its "unilateral" and "bullying policies. After his victory was announced over the weekend, Rouhani spoke of reforms without threatening Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, or the country's institutions -- of which he is a product. While Rouhani encouraged Iran to act with "unity and solidarity" as it transitions to his promised moderate rule in coming weeks, he said his primary goals will be "acting in line with salvaging the country's economy, reviving morality and constructive interaction with the world." He said he could not yet provide time lines but said he would first like to ensure that Iranians had basic commodities before his government pursues "the tranquility and stability of the economy." Rouhani has all-round credentials in Iran's institutions, including as a senior cleric and former commander of Iranian air defenses, and he is an intellectual with three law degrees, including from a university in Scotland.
