The incident occurred at Kilgore Flares Co. in Hardeman County, about 75 miles northeast of Memphis, said Jeremy Heidt, spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. Three others were at Bolivar General Hospital in good condition, said spokeswoman Kay Cranford of West Tennessee Healthcare. Kilgore Flares is one of the county's largest employers, Hardeman County Mayor Willie Spencer said. The Regional Medical Center at Memphis has received three patients, two of them flown in, said executive secretary Jackie Harris. According to its website, Kilgore Flares makes decoy flares for aircraft and naval forces, many of which are used as countermeasures against heat-seeking missiles.
