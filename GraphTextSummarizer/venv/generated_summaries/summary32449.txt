China has executed three men convicted of plotting a knife attack that killed 31 people at a railway station in the southwestern city of Kunming last year. The names of those executed suggested they were Uyghur, a mainly Muslim ethnic group from Xinjiang, northwest China. The Kunming City Intermediate People's Court said that Iskandar Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad were put to death Tuesday. Dressed in black and wielding long knives and machetes, several assailants stormed the station on March 1, 2014 seemingly hacking at anyone in sight. The train station attack shook the country and state media labeled it "China's 9/11."
