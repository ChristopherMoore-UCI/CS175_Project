"Harpham admitted that he is a white supremacist and white separatist, and that he placed the explosive device at the march with the intent to cause bodily injury to the person or persons in order to further his racist beliefs," a Justice Department statement said. Said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, in a statement: "Acts of hate like this one have no place in our country in the year 2011, but yet, unfortunately, we continue to see attempted violence in our communities due to racial animus." "Today, Mr. Harpham faces the consequences of his hate-filled act. A prototypical 'lone wolf' such as Mr. Harpham presents a particularly vexing threat -- with nothing foreshadowing a carefully planned attack," Laura M. Laughlin, special agent in charge of the FBI Seattle office, said in a statement. But law enforcement officials said that if Harpham had succeeded, many people could have been harmed.
