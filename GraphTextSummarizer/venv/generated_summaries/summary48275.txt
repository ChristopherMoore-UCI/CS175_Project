One of the two wounded suspects was taken to San Miguel Arcangel Hospital, where people believed to be fellow gang members unsuccessfully tried to rescue him, La Estrella newspaper said. A security guard and an assailant also were killed and two suspects were wounded in Tuesday's attack, La Estrella newspaper said. Opposition presidential candidate Balbina Herrera blamed the shootout on criminals who have invaded Panama, saying that immigration controls must be strengthened and that Mexicans and Colombians should have visas to enter the country, La Estrella said. Culture Minister Anel Omar Rodriguez had just stepped out of his car in front of the national lottery headquarters when four men and a woman got out of a sport utility vehicle and started shooting at a private armored truck, La Estrella said. Panama will hold its presidential election in May. Rodriguez, a former Panamanian ambassador to Cuba, left behind a wife and four children, La Estrella said.
