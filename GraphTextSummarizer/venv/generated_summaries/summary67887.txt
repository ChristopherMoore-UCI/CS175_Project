Even though this only existed in "The Hobbit" as a story Thorin told Bilbo to explain their quest, in "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" film we get to see what a thriving dwarf town looks like and how they lost it, even if Smaug himself is barely glimpsed yet -- a tail here, a wing there, an open eye that looks eerily like the Lidless Eye of Sauron. Dol Guldur Gandalf found Thorin's father Thrain in Dol Guldur, which was near the river where the Ring was lost, as "a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer," he says in "The Hobbit." In the book "The Hobbit," a company of dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield seek help from Bilbo Baggins because they need a "burglar." Of course, when Dol Guldur is threatened, Sauron need only move on -- to Mordor. But when J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the novel he had not yet conceived of Sauron and the One Ring which only came 17 years later in "The Lord of The Rings," so the connection between the Necromancer and Sauron was not made clear.
