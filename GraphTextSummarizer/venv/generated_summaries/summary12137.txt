The remaining $20 million will go to land acquisition projects in several Gulf states with the aim of funding environmental and natural resource-protected habitats. "The Department of Justice has not wavered in its commitment to hold all responsible parties fully accountable for what stands as the largest oil spill in U.S. history," Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. "This landmark settlement is an important step -- but only a first step -- toward achieving accountability and protecting the future of the Gulf ecosystem by funding critical habitat preservation projects." MOEX is the first company to settle with the U.S. government, which still has several claims outstanding against eight other defendants -- including BP Exploration and Production Inc., the majority owner on the doomed well. The company, a subsidiary of the MOEX USA Corporation owned by Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., will pay a total of $90 million in the settlement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday.
