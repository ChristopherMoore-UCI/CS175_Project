"Dirty Dancing" was the top pick for both men and women, although the study's author, music psychologist Daniel Mullensiefen, also pointed out that men are more willing to adjust their tastes in music in order to ensure "greater success in the bedroom. He said music activates the same pleasure centers of the brain that respond to rewards such as food, drugs or sex. Next on the list was "Sex on Fire" by Kings of Leon and "Angels" by Robbie Williams. The study was commissioned by digital music service Spotify to examine the relationship between music, romance and seduction. Mullensiefen said the best tracks for getting in the mood all possess similar vocal qualities, like a wide, dynamic range, more use of the "high chest voice" and raspiness.
