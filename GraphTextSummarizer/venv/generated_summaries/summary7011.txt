After allowing mobiles at five test events, chief of operations Andy Pazder said at the time: "Allowing mobile devices on-site at Tour events was a tremendous fan enhancement, and did not affect the integrity of the competition." However, the phone rules only apply to PGA Tour events, not the other three majors -- the Masters, U.S. Open or PGA Championship. "We are offering spectators access to an enhanced range of apps for Android, iPhone and iPad that will offer live video of play and other attractions at The Open and will keep them up to date with essential championship information including scoring, tee times, news and an interactive course guide," R&A chief executive Peter Dawson said on the R&A website. The decision follows a PGA Tour announcement in February last year that ithe U.S. circuit would finally be lifting its phone ban. No longer is it enough to simply watch the action, devoted fans are now demanding a blow-by-blow account, interactive maps and player profiles all in the palm of their hands. For young fans especially, such apps have become the must-have accessories -- and British golfing bosses have finally caught on.
