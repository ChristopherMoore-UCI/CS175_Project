And although the main demographic for video games is young men, Santiago said, there is another audience. Santiago's games stand out, he said, because they differ so greatly from what many think of when they think video games. And although she says she doesn't think it's dangerous for children to play violent video games, Santiago does see danger in doing so without having recognition of the violence. It was while completing a master's in fine arts at the Interactive Media program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts that Santiago realized she could marry her love of the arts with video game creation. "One of the questions we always get is, are we always going to make emotional games," Santiago said.
