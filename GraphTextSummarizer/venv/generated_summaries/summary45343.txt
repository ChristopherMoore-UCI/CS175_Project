Although a Clinton spokesperson argues that the fee will go straight to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, the former first lady's appearance in Las Vegas on Monday was possibly the most controversial and widely talked about paid speech Clinton was set to give this year. "In keeping with Secretary Clinton's long-standing history of advocating for students in higher education, we as student government leaders are asking that she charitably donate part or all of the $225,000 speaking fee she is reportedly making for this fundraising speech back to the UNLV Foundation of UNLV as a whole," Elias Benjelloun, the UNLV student body president, and Daniel Waqar, the student government's public relations director, wrote in a letter addressed to Clinton's foundation. "This would be an incredible opportunity for Secretary Clinton to remain true to her commitment to higher education," they write. Republicans used fees like that from UNLV to constantly remind people of Clinton's wealth and inarticulate comments for much of the summer. Republicans looking to fault Hillary Clinton hope the few hours the former secretary of state will spend in Las Vegas on Monday will remind voters of her less-than-perfect book roll-out and high-dollar speaking fees.
