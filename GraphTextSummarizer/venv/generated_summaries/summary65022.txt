" Politicians in Europe and beyond have been harshly criticized and, in some cases, forced out of office in the wake of a wave of economic woes, including governments and banks' role in contributing to debt and other crises. And last month, after a judge had thrown out two additional charges, his trial began on four counts: failing to ensure that a financial stability group delivered the required results, failing to take action to reduce the size of Iceland's banking system, failing to verify the move of accounts from Landsbanki bank's Icesave program, and failing to focus more Cabinet meetings on the crisis. In fact, the IMF has forecast economic growth of 2.5% for the island nation in 2012, and the ratings agency Fitch has raised Iceland's long-term debt back to investment grade. Those two nation's governments came up with more than $5 billion to bail out its citizens who'd put their money in Iceland-based banks. "In many ways, we are ahead of the curve," Haarde said, comparing Iceland with Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, which also received bailouts.
