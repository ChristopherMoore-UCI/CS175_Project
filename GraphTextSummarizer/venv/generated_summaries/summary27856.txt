The lab was contracted with George Washington University Hospital to handle blood testing, and did Reagan's blood work and testing. "Dried blood residue from President Reagan ... can be seen clearly in the vial with a quarter-inch ring of blood residue at the end of the inserted rubber stopper," the listing says. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting, which also wounded then-press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police officer Thomas Delahanty. Reagan was rushed to George Washington University Hospital for emergency surgery. A form also being sold with the vial contains Reagan's patient ID number at George Washington Hospital, the seller said.
