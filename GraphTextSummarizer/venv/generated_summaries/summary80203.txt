Grain prices are low compared with last season, when record prices helped some farmers make a good profit in Kansas and across the country. As of this week, wheat was selling for $5.39 a bushel at a local grain elevator in Bucklin, in southwestern Kansas. According to the Kansas State University agricultural extension office, Kansas wheat sold for an average of $10.50 a bushel at its peak in 2008 -- largely a result of changing supply and demand. By the time prices hit $11, few farmers had any wheat left to sell. Recent years have been good to the Sellards and other farmers.
