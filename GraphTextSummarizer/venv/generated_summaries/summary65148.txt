Over the years, I've watched Cui Jian -- "CJ" or "Lao Cui" (Old Cui) to friends -- perform in concerts, big and small, often belting out songs with a symbolic red band tied over his eyes. " Such music, like Cui's, would have been unthinkable during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), when foreign culture was branded as "spiritual pollution. Cui Jian burst onto the music scene in China 26 years ago with his signature number, "Nothing To My Name." In the early 1980s, however, he began listening to western rock n' roll on cassette tapes he bought or borrowed from foreign friends. " Sometimes amusing, sometimes plaintive but often overtly political, Cui's songs challenged conventional Chinese ideas and attitudes.
