-- CNN photojournalist Khalil Abdallah was having breakfast Saturday in a Tripoli hotel that houses foreign press when a woman burst into the restaurant, screaming that she had been raped and beaten for days by Moammar Gadhafi's brigades. Postscript: The Libyan woman who stormed into the Tripoli hotel Saturday to tell foreign reporters that government troops raped her has been released, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim told reporters at a news conference Sunday. He knew that minders -- the men Libya's government assigns to foreign journalists to monitor their every move -- were nearby. Some of them were wearing their distinctive red badges, Abdallah said, while others were in plain clothes. Abdallah recounted Sunday for CNN.com.
