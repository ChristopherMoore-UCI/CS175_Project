And these new bombings come as Boko Haram has also caused outrage around the  world with its indiscriminate massacre of innocent men, women and children in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga. When earlier in the year they invaded the northern village of Izghe, Boko Haram militants went door-to-door, killing any man, woman or child they came across. It was in response to the news that children, fearful of further terrorist attacks,â€‹ had been staying away from school. These new initiatives are backed by the Safe School Guidelines, passed by the United Nations to stop the use of schools as military targets and to ensure that they are havens free from exploitation by terrorist groups. With all this in mind, I am urging the international community to step up its pursuit, exposure and surveillance of Boko Haram and to do more to coordinate action against their cross-border incursions into Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and other countries.
