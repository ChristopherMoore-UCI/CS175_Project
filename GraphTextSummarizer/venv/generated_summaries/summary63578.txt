-- Russia's use of strategic bombers and ballistic missiles against Georgia's civilians outside of the South Ossetian conflict is "far disproportionate" to Georgia's alleged attack on Russian peacekeepers, a senior U.S. official said Saturday. Watch President Bush comment on conflict Â» Still, Georgia bears some of the blame for the fighting over South Ossetia, the official said. NATO rejected Georgia's membership bid in April despite strong lobbying from U.S. President Bush, though the alliance promised that Georgia could join at a later date. The EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were sending envoys to Georgia to secure a cease-fire, but a senior U.S. State Department official said the United States would send only a representative after a cease-fire is in place. "For the life of me, I can't image that being a proportionate response to the charge that Georgia has attacked Russian peacekeepers," the official said.
