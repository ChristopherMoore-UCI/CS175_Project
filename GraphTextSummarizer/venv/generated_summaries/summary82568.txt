The Pentagon denied Thursday it has approved sending the aircraft carrier USS George Washington to the Yellow Sea off the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea allegedly sank a South Korean warship in March. The carrier deployment would come as the U.S. Navy and Republic of Korea warships are scheduled to conduct a joint naval exercise that the two nations vowed to undertake in response to the alleged North Korean attack on the South Korean ship. Two U.S. military officials said U.S. Forces Korea was expected to make the announcement Thursday. North Korea is blamed for a torpedo attack on a South Korean navy vessel, the Cheonan. But the move is considered to be sending a signal to North Korea about the U.S. commitment to defending South Korea.
