An IDF strike west of Gaza City killed a militant and wounded four, one of whom is in critical condition, according to security sources with Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007. Four Palestinians were killed and more than 20 wounded when Israeli tank fire hit a building east of Gaza City where hundreds of mourners were gathered for a funeral, Palestinian medical sources said. The IDF also said it targeted a rocket launching squad in the northern Gaza Strip after it fired rockets toward Israel. More than 30 rockets fired from Gaza hit southern Israel, the IDF said. In a separate incident, Palestinian medical sources in Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip, said an Israeli artillery shell hit a civilian house and injured a couple and their two children.
