By 2060, the government projects women will live until 90.93 years and men 84.19 years. The group, called the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, provides a 50-year demographic forecast every five years. The institute also projects that people age 65 and older will account for 39.9% of the total population in 2060. But the institute expects the upward trend for life expectancy to continue. The country's average life expectancy dipped in 2011 after the March earthquake and tsunami, which killed approximately 19,000 people.
