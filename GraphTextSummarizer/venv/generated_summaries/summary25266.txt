It's got shipwrecks, the remoteness of the Arctic, putting the might of English industrialism against Mother Nature," says Harris. One hundred and sixty years of searching -- one attempt as recent as last month -- have failed to find "HMS Erebus" and her sister ship, the somewhat appropriately named "HMS Terror" -- the two vessels lost in the Arctic. But having said that, Harris is determined the search will go on until the "Erebus" and the "Terror" are found.

"Why did this fail when all the others didn't," asks author William Battersby.
