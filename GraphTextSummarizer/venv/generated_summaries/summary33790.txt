An FBI official noted that investigators have received "dozens and dozens" of calls about Sherry Arnold, agency spokeswoman Deborah Bertram said Thursday by e-mail. Sidney police Chief Frank DiFonzo said earlier this week that teams had been using dogs and aircraft and have gotten help from National Guard members as well as volunteers. "Our thoughts are focused on her, we want her to return, we want to get her back," her husband, Gary Arnold, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Thursday. On Thursday, the FBI put out a poster of Arnold and added her to its "kidnapping and missing persons" website. The low temperature Thursday night in Sidney was expected to dip to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, with daytime highs over the next two days forecast to be in the 30s, according to the National Weather Service.
