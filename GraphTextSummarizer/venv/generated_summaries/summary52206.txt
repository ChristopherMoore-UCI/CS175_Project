Reports: Tibetans take their lives in protest of Chinese rule More than 30 of them took place in the last year in China, Tibetan advocacy groups say. They follow an increase in security measures by the Chinese authorities in response to unrest among Tibetans in western areas of China in recent months. The 27-year-old man was admitted to hospital in New Delhi Monday with 90% burns to his body, but doctors could not save him and he died on Wednesday, said L.K. Makhija, the head of the burns ward at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. Self-immolation is a common form of protest for Tibetans who want genuine autonomy from China and accuse Beijing of repression. Dramatic pictures showed the man, named by the London-based Free Tibet group as Jampa Yeshi, running along the street in flames as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Indian parliament to protest against Chinese rule in Tibet.
