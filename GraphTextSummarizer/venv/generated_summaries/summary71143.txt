While Delta is gaining momentum in North America, procuring slots at Heathrow has proved arduous for the airline, according to George Ferguson, senior airline and aerospace analyst at Bloomberg Industries. For the deluge of passengers that fly Delta and Virgin across the pond, the partnership could ideally result in cheaper fares. "I see them being able to give corporate customers much more options, and I see them really being able to kick off some extensive routes with above-average yields," says Ferguson, who adds that in the airline industry, fuller planes usually results in cheaper tickets. All that is set to change, thanks to a pivotal partnership between Delta Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. "I think the spirit of our company will be very attractive to the U.S.-based customers that Delta currently serves," says Craig Kreeger, CEO of Virgin Atlantic Airways.
