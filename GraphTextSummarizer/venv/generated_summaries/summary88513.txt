Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. Campbell said Wednesday that McCullough was en route to Illinois from Washington state to face murder charges in Ridulph's death. The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend.
