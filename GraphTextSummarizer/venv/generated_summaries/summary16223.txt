Grimm, R-New York, pleaded not guilty on Monday in federal court in Brooklyn to 20 counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, filing false tax returns, hiring unauthorized aliens and perjury. -- U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm failed to report more than $1 million in sales and wages at a Manhattan restaurant he once ran, using unreported cash to pay workers "off the books" to "evade taxes and keep more money for himself," a federal prosecutor said. Grimm calls case 'political witch hunt' Grimm also is charged with conspiring to commit health care fraud and obstructing an official proceeding. Grimm, as an accountant, attorney, former Marine and ex-FBI agent, "was poised for success as a small business owner," but "made the choice to go from upholding the law to breaking it," Lynch said in a written statement. The restaurant, in which Grimm had a 45% partnership interest, didn't report some of the cash as income, Lynch's office said.
