Palin sought about $450 million in earmarks during her first two years in state office, according to federal records. But her lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell, said Palin has reversed her support for earmarked spending projects because "I think she saw what they were." "As you're in office longer, you see the cumulative effect from Wasilla to Pensacola, and you see the corruption that can come from those," Parnell said, referring to earmarks. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin campaigns in Lee's Summit, Missouri, with Sen. John McCain Monday. McCain and running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have criticized such spending as a central part of their campaign for the White House. But when Palin served as mayor of her hometown of Wasilla, outside Anchorage, she obtained about $27 million in federal "earmarks" during her last four years in office, according to the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense.
