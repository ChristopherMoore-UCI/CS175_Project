-- A British tourist in the United States for his 41st wedding anniversary was killed in the crash of a vintage World War II-era plane in the waters off of Galveston, Texas, authorities said Thursday. The crash between Chocolate Bay and Galveston Bay was reported to the Coast Guard by the captain of a charter fishing boat shortly before noon. In recent years, it was painted with the "Galveston Gal" markings and was used to give people a flight experience for about $2,000 a flight.
