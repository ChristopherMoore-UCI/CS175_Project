The family lives on the Canada-Michigan border, and they took Joseph to a Michigan hospital a few miles from Windsor, Ontario, in June. Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to sign consent when Canadian health officials determined their son Joseph, who suffers from a progressive degenerative neurological disease and was in a persistent vegetative state, should be removed from life support. On February 17, they decided Joseph should be removed from life support. Suzanne Vitadamo, spokesperson for the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network and Terri's sister, issued the following statement: "It is unacceptable for Canadian Health Allocation Officials and/or the Canadian Government to make decisions for Joseph that will end his life and deny the wishes of his loving parents. Joseph is being treated at the London Health Sciences Centre in Ontario.
