"Bringing in a Republican like Romney to talk about you is not what you want to do when you're running as a perceived independent in Massachusetts," said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Jim Merrill, a GOP strategist who led Romney's New Hampshire campaign, said "it's natural" for the two men to want to "link arms" this cycle. Now Brown is mounting his own challenge, trying to take down incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in neighboring New Hampshire, a more politically mixed state. Romney, who's perhaps more popular than ever at the moment, is practically an adopted son of New Hampshire. -- When Scott Brown was fighting to keep his Senate seat in Massachusetts two years ago, he was forced to keep his distance from a former colleague who also happened to be his party's top gun at the time, Mitt Romney.
