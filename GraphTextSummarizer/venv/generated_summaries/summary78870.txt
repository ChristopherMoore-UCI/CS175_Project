"It appears to be the result of a domestic dispute," said Rhode Island Airport Police Chief Leo Messier. -- A man traveling with his 4-year-old son claims he didn't know that the three stuffed animals his little boy put on a conveyor belt at T. F. Green International Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, contained parts that could be assembled into a loaded handgun, the Transportation Security Administration says. A TSA officer watched as a carry-on bag containing a stuffed teddy bear, a bunny rabbit and a Mickey Mouse toy went through a checkpoint X-ray machine Monday. The TSA says law enforcement officers interviewed the man, who stated he was unaware that there were gun parts inside the toys. An investigation by the airport police, state police and FBI determined there was no threat at any time to air safety, Messier said.
