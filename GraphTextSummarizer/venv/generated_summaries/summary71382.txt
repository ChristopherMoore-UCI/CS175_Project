"We merged our voice with the prosecutor's closing arguments from last week's hearing and demanded the death sentence to Mubarak, his former interior minister Habib El Adly, and four of his aides for killing hundreds of protesters and injuring thousands more," attorney Khalid Abu Bakr told CNN. Civil rights lawyers demanded the death penalty for former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Monday, joining prosecutor's calls for him to be executed. Mubarak is accused of corruption and ordering protesters killed during the country's uprising last year. Lawyers familiar with the case said it is unlikely Mubarak and his fellow defendants will receive the death penalty. "We have proof Mubarak is directly responsible for the killings along with El Adly and his aides." Abu Bakr said Mubarak deserved to die for violating Egypt's criminal law 77.
