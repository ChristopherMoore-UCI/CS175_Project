Casey Anthony made allegations of sex abuse against her father and brother in a letter from jail last year. Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. said Friday that it is imperative to seat a jury as quickly as possible. Besides the "history of sexual abuse," the defense also hinted again Friday that Anthony's "dysfunctional family" might be proposed as a "mitigating circumstance" if she is convicted of murder, as might be "a lack of impulse control or brain development." Prosecutors have said they plan to show Casey Anthony lied repeatedly about her daughter's fate, contending she used "a substance" to kill her daughter. Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
