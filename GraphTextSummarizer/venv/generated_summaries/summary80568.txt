When Morgan asked Clooney if he was considering following in the footsteps of other Hollywood A-listers who ventured into the political arena, the actor dashed any hopes of a President George Clooney: "Honestly, my job is as good as they get. When Morgan asked whether Clooney gets angry when people say he's wasting his time in Sudan and that his charity work is for "self-aggrandizing reasons," Clooney told Morgan, "I don't need to be more famous." "I've got all the attention I need," Clooney continued, "and I'm just trying to use that attention on other people. Clooney also said his dad taught him that he has an inherent responsibility to share his luck and good fortune with others. Clooney also told Morgan he contracted malaria while in Sudan, but said he's no longer infected with the disease, and even made light of the situation, saying, "Even with malaria, it's just good fun." Clooney was a firsthand witness to the voting process that will most likely lead to independence for Southern Sudan.
