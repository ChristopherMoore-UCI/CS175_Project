John and Linda came to live with Didi Sohus during the time Gerhartsreiter lived in the guest quarters. A jury in April convicted German-born Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter of first-degree murder in the killing of John Sohus, 27. Before the sentence was imposed, John Sohus' sister, Ellen, told the court there was no closure for the family. At the time of Sohus' disappearance, Gerhartsreiter had been renting a guesthouse from Sohus' mother, authorities said. He settled in San Marino, a wealthy community near Pasadena, where he lived under the name Christopher Chichester from 1983 to 1985.
