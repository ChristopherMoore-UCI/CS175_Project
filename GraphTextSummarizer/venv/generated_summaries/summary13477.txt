Amla ended the day on 115, his eighth century in his 42 Test, having come to the crease after India's left-arm quick bowler Zaheer Khan had Ashwell Prince caught behind by wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni for a duck, fending off a short ball. India, who have taken South Africa's top ranking of the nine Test-playing nations, struck again soon after when Zaheer clean bowled Proteas captain Graeme Smith for six. Only India's Sachin Tendulkar, who will seek to add to his record tally of 45 centuries in this match, and Australia captain Ricky Ponting (39) have passed three figures more times than that trio. -- Jacques Kallis moved into joint third place on cricket's all-time Test century list as he helped South Africa recover from a disastrous start to the opening match of the series against top-ranked India in Nagpur on Saturday. The 34-year-old right-hander reached the milestone in his 136th match, five more than West Indian Lara and 11 more than India's Gavaskar.
