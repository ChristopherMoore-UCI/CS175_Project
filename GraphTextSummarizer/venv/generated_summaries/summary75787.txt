Breland and another young man, Daquan Wright, were apprehended Friday morning by New York detectives and U.S. marshals at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, apartment according to New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly. Breland is on parole for a felony assault in upstate New York, according to police. Wright, a 19-year-old from Brooklyn, was charged Saturday with criminal possession of a weapon. Jackson said Saturday that he personally hadn't yet spoken with Anthony Hennis, though his hope was that he'd be cooperative. Both men have some kind of relationship with the young boy's father, 21-year-old Anthony Hennis, who as of Friday had declined to be interviewed, according to Kelly.
