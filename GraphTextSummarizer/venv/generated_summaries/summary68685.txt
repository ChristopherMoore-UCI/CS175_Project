-- World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko knocked out U.S. challenger Eddie Chambers with five seconds remaining in the 12th and final round to defend his IBF, WBO and IBO titles. The Saturday bout in Duesseldorf, Germany, was the 33-year-old Ukrainian's fifth defense of his WBO and IBF titles. The 8-to-1 favorite Klitschko's win is his 12th straight successful title defense. Chambers went down for at least two minutes after receiving Klitschko's left hook to the right temple, according to CNNSI's Bryan Armen Graham round-by-round blog of the fight. Early in the fight Chambers -- at 209 pounds (94.8 kg), 36 pounds (16.3 kg) lighter than Klitschko's 245 (111.1 kg)-- lifted his opponent into the air twice, dumping him onto the canvas.
