Our columns over the next several days will include pieces by John Sutter, who finds that America has a state-by-state patchwork of rules on marriage, employment and legal protections applying to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans and calls for changes. President Barack Obama, who said during his 2008 campaign that marriage was "between a man and a woman," in May declared his support for same-sex marriage, and the administration has now put its weight behind supporters of gay marriage before the Supreme Court. But while same-sex marriage grabs the headlines, there are many other issues relating to gay rights. In 2008, a CNN poll found that 53% of Americans believed marriages between gay and lesbian couples should not be recognized by the law as valid. Last year, a similar CNN poll found that 54% now favor such marriages.
