Neither Diggs nor Menzel have specified what led to their breakup, although Menzel was frank about the challenges of marriage when speaking with People magazine in April 2013. "I'd be lying if I said there weren't times when I thought, 'Oh, man, people are going to trip out (if we split),' " the 43-year-old actor told Redbook magazine. Taye Diggs and Idina Menzel had a relationship that fans fell in love with. So when the actor pair announced in December that they were separating after 10 years of marriage, Diggs was fully prepared for the public's shocked reaction. The couple welcomed a son, Walker, in 2009, and since their separation have focused on balancing their co-parenting with their busy careers.
