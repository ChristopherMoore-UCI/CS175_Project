Before that, the Bush administration's years-long policy of complete isolation allowed North Korea to produce plutonium, fashion it into bombs and test two of them. More ominously, Tuesday brought news of direct artillery barrages between North and South Korea, heightening tensions and costing lives. Remember that North Korea succeeded in acquiring or building these new facilities during a time when sanctions were extreme and U.S. engagement was absent. He detailed how the new facilities, while potentially capable of producing material for bombs, are hardly the quickest route for North Korea to do so. It does not have the capability to deliver these devices by aircraft or missile and its plutonium program remains frozen or perhaps even further eroded, as described in a report by Dr. Sig Hecker, who visited the North's nuclear facilities two weeks ago.
