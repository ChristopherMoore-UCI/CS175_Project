-- One day after a court in eastern China sentenced him to life in prison for corruption, former Communist Party official Bo Xilai appealed his verdict and sentencing, a source with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. Bo -- a former rising political star who fell from power amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery -- was convicted Sunday of bribe-taking, embezzlement and abuse of power. Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise.
