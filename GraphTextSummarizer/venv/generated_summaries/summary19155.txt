" Death penalty opponents say Louisiana is the only state to actively pursue lethal injection for child rapists, and argue, among other things, that it could give attackers a reason to murder their victims. "If they're going to face the death penalty for raping a child, why would they leave a living witness?" said Judy Benitez, executive director of the Louisiana Foundation against Sexual Assaults. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether Louisiana can use capital punishment in child rape cases. The justices will no doubt consider loneliness of Louisiana's aggressive position when deciding whether a national consensus now exists to allow a broader range of crimes to become subject to capital punishment. Texas enacted its version in June, but no defendant has yet been designated death-eligible for child rape in any state but Louisiana. The New Orleans native faces that reality as he sits on death row at Louisiana's maximum security prison, the largest prison in the nation.
