-- Some skygazers along the East Coast of North America witnessed a spectacular solar eclipse Sunday morning. The eclipse was visible for a few minutes from parts of North America, South America, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. That means for part of its path, it was an annular eclipse -- where a thin ring of sunlight is visible around the moon's shadow -- and for another part, it was a total eclipse. When he woke up Sunday morning, he realized the eclipse would be happening in 20 minutes. Greg Hogan said he only saw the partial eclipse for a few short minutes.
