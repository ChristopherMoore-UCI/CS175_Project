Morgan agreed to fly back to Nashville this week to meet with members of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to deliver a face-to-face apology to people who were in the Ryman Auditorium and to work with the Tennessee Equality Project, GLAAD said. Rogers' blog was picked up by Jezebel magazine, triggering a controversy that led to Morgan's contrition. Morgan said that if his own son told him he was gay, he would "pull out a knife and stab" him, Rogers wrote. Rogers sat next to Morgan Tuesday morning as he publicly apologized. " Roger wrote in his blog post that Morgan "mentioned that gay was something kids learn from the media and programming, and that bullied kids should just bust some ass and beat those other little f**kers that bully them, not whine about it."
