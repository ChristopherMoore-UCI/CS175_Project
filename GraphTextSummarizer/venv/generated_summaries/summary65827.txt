In an exclusive interview with CNN, Slimane talks about falling in love with photography; his book, "Anthology of a Decade," which follows his journey through fashion, music and the art world; and how the attacks of 9/11 are forever imprinted on to his mind. Music defines decades, and quite clearly shapes the rhythm, vitality of fashion, attitude and social behaviors. In 2007, Slimane turned his back on fashion, leaving Dior, and returning to photography to take melancholic androgynous images heavily influenced by the British music scene. The anthology, just like most of my work, from photography to fashion design, is about and around music. HS: Music, since the 1950s and the birth of the concept of the "youth" as a social group, has always been a laboratory for new ideas and sub-cultures.
