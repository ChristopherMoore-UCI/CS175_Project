According to the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) provisional status report, issued at the United Nations climate talks in Durban, 2011 was the 10th warmest year on record and warmer than any other year with a La Nina event. Final figures for 2011's weather will be published by the WMO in March next year. The general warming trend -- 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the 15 years since 1997 -- was highlighted by summer sea ice melt in the Arctic. But such was their intensity -- Wajir, northeast Kenya received more rain in six weeks (402 millimeters) than the annual average -- it led to crop damage, says the WMO. Among the other more notable extremes of weather in 2011, says Trewin, were the huge weather disparities experienced in the U.S. The WMO reported 14 separate climate events this year in the U.S. which they estimate caused losses upwards of $1 billion.
