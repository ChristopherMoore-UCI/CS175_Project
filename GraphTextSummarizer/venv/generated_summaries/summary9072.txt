Last month, Egyptian authorities detained four Al Jazeera employees. "Hassan told AP by phone that he was arrested after police saw his footage being broadcast live on Al Jazeera Television's Egyptian affiliate and wrongly concluded that he was an Al Jazeera employee," the AP report said. Calling the arrests arbitrary, Al Jazeera has said the network "has been subject to harassment by Egyptian security forces," including having its equipment confiscated and offices raided, despite the network not being banned from working in Egypt. Nearly 40 correspondents and editors representing 29 international media organizations sent a letter to Egyptian authorities on Monday, demanding the journalists' immediate release and accusing authorities of detaining them arbitrarily. "We are pleased that Mr. Hassan has been released on bail, and we hope that any remaining legal questions can be resolved quickly," said John Daniszewski, AP's senior managing editor for international news.
