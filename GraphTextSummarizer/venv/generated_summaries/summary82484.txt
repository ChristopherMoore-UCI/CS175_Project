" Under a normal functioning market, food insecurity and increased demand might have been addressed, the report says, but border closures that link the newly independent South Sudan to Sudan have disrupted the usual supply of food commodities to South Sudan's markets. Sudan and South Sudan will also be entering another round of talks this week to settle a bitter dispute over oil that seems to be edging the two countries toward more conflict. The report released Wednesday by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) says that fighting in the northern border region and ethnic clashes in many other parts of South Sudan has created a level of food insecurity that could nearly double in the next year. -- Less than a week after the United Nations declared an end to the famine in Somalia, a new report from the world body says millions of people in South Sudan will now face hunger if urgent action is not taken. "The situation is dire," said Chris Nikoi, WFP's country director in South Sudan.
