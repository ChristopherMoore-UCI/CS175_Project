"Who can provide jobs for moderately skilled workers like high school graduates or less educated workers?" asks Norio Usui, Senior Country Economist at the Asian Development Bank. While the Philippines has struggled to grow other industries such as manufacturing or tourism, the country has found it is uniquely positioned to excel in the call center business. "You'd be hard pressed to find families that don't have one person in their families employed in the call center industry," says Eppie Titong, senior site director at VXi's Manila office. For Tan Dejos, whose wife also works at VXi, the work is stressful at times but it allows them to comfortably support their three children. "The Philippines has plenty of such workers also."
