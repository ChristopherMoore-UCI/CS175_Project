-- Sri Lanka opened their 2011 Cricket World Cup with a thumping 210-run win over Group A outsiders Canada in front of a home crowd in Hambantota. But Angelo Mathews and Thilan Samaraweera chipped in with useful runs at the death to steer Sri Lanka past 300. Canada's theoretical run-chase got off to the worst of starts as opener John Davison was out to the seventh ball of the innings, bowled by Thisara Perera. Kenya won the toss and elected to bat and made a respectable if somewhat slow start to their innings, scoring 33 runs in the first ten overs for the loss of one wicket -- opener Alex Obanda falling to Tim Southee in the seventh over. The pair shared a third wicket partnership of 179 as Canada's bowling attack toiled after earlier restricting Sri Lanka to 92 for two from the first 20 overs.
