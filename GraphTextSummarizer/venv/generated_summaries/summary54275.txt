The project was called "Quiet: We Live in Public" and the man behind it, described as the "Warhol of the web," was extreme visionary and dotcom entrepreneur, Josh Harris. But, according to Timoner -- who won the Grand Jury prize at Sundance once before for "DiG!", another cautionary tale about the rise and fall of front men from American rock bands Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols --Harris' story is a universal one - and heralds a future where privacy is a distant memory from the past. Now, almost 10 years later, the cameras are back on, and this time Harris himself is under the spotlight. Ondi Timoner which chronicles the rise and fall of Harris, "the greatest Internet pioneer you've never heard of." Harris was one of the crop of highly publicized wunderkind entrepreneurs splashed across magazine covers, making millions of dollars during the mid-1990s dotcom bubble.
