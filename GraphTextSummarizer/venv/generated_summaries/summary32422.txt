It's just a lake that has methane gas and needs degassing," says Olivier Ntirushwa, the manager at Kibuye Power Plant in northwest Rwanda. What these tourists may not know, however, is that because of the area's volcanoes and anaerobic bacteria in the water, Lake Kivu is a storehouse for 60 billion cubic meters of methane gas, and susceptible to underwater eruptions. In 2008, Rwanda launched a pilot project to extract methane gas from the lake and use it as a power source. While the project is still in the early stages (the plant currently extracts a mere 2.4 megawatts of power), Ntirushwa sees an enormous amount of potential. "When people finish visiting mountain gorillas, or other national parks around Rwanda, this is a good place to come and relax," he adds.
