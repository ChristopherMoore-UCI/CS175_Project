"Competition between ethnic groups over scarce resources has escalated in South Sudan," said Chris Chapman, MRG's head of conflict prevention, in a statement posted on the group's website. He appealed to the commissioners of Uror and Pibor counties to cooperate with the government to ensure the return of the abducted children and property of Lou Nuer and Murle communities. In a statement posted Thursday by the independent News Agency of South Sudan, Marial was quoted as saying the Lou Nuer should vacate Murle territory so that the government can deliver relief services there. The attack on Pibor followed reports last week that Lou Nuer fighters raided Lukangol, burning it to the ground and forcing thousands to flee toward Pibor. The United Nations sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, which is home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol.
