Samsung, unlike some of its competitors -- for example, the Motorola Xoom  -- won't try to compete with the iPad at a higher price point just because some of the hardware of its tablet looks better on paper and that, in our opinion, is the right approach. In a refreshingly honest statement, Samsung's mobile division VP Lee Don-Joo admitted that the iPad 2 made some parts of Samsung's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab look "inadequate," and the iPad 2's pricing might force Samsung to lower the price of its tablet. We feel that a bit of information might have gotten lost in translation from Korean to English, as we definitely don't expect Samsung to pull the 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab from the market and release a thinner version. It's more likely that Samsung simply sees the iPad 2's thinness as a big challenge for its future tablet models. We will have to improve the parts that are inadequate," Lee Don-Joo told Yonhap News Agency.
