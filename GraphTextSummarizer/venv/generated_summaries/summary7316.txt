Defending champion Martin Kaymer says that being back on The Old Course at St Andrews is "paradise," while Hugh Grant likens the opportunity to compete as "dying and going to golfing heaven." This year, amateurs making a star turn include former Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff, cricketer Shane Warne from Australia and Hollywood greats Andy Garcia and Michael Douglas. Former England cricketer Ian Botham will play alongside John Daly, while 2005 winner Colin Montgomerie will once again pair Michael Douglas, who returns to play in the event after his much-publicized illness. The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship is a tournament like no other on the European Tour where the world's top golfers rub shoulders with acting and sporting legends in a four-day pro-am played over three Scottish links -- St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns. This is just a magical place and when we get a week like we are getting now, it's going to be great," Michael Douglas said.
