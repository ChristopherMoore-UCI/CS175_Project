Robertson told GQ that he considers homosexual behavior, among other things, to be sinful. -- If there's one thing we can all agree on when it comes to "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson and the fallout from his interview with GQ, it's that everyone has an opinion. In the 24 hours since GQ released its January profile of Robertson and his family, who draw millions to A&E with their reality show "Duck Dynasty," social media has seen more than its typical overuse of exclamation points and excessive capitalization. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal issued a statement in defense of Robertson and his family, calling them "great citizens of the State of Louisiana." "I don't agree with quite a bit of stuff I read in magazine interviews or see on TV. But to be fair, this roiling debate is so addictive because the news here -- that Robertson shared viewpoints and beliefs that many, including A&E, found offensive, and was suspended indefinitely as a result -- gets to the heart of conversations many of us care about.
