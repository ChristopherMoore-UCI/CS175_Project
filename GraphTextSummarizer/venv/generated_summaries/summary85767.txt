Waking up Tuesday to the news that my good friend and former team mate Phil Hughes was in a critical state in hospital after a blow to the head in a state cricket match made me instantly realize how fragile life can be. This is a bloke who lives life to the full. He seemed so fearless and full of life. Phil was a breath of fresh air and it was only a few months later that we were sharing an apartment in England while he ripped up county cricket during his first stint playing for Middlesex. Pushing yourself to the limit, there is often more apprehension in training than there is in match play.
