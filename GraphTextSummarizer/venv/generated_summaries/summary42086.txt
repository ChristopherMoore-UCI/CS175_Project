Disney water parks came in first and second place for attendance among North American water parks on the 2013 Theme Index, which tracks theme park and water park attendance around the globe. On the global list, Chimelong Waterpark in Guangzhou, China, ranked No. 1 in the world for water park attendance, followed by two Disney World parks in second and third places. The index, released this month as part of the TEA/AECOM Global Attractions Attendance Report, tracks water park attendance in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and the Middle East. Parks in South Korea, Brazil and Australia joined other Orlando, Florida, parks to round out the top 10 most visited parks globally. The top 10 water parks in the United States have waves, reefs, tubing and water slides.
