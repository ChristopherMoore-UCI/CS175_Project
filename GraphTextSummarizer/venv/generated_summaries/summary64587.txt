Aidan and the children had always been told during school drills and by his parents to run if he saw somebody with a gun. Nick and Laura Phelps also are struggling with what to tell their two children, a first-grader and a third-grader. He worries the man in black fatigues and military-style vest who opened fire Friday on his Sandy Hook Elementary School classroom -- hitting his teacher and his fellow students -- has found him. Aidan doesn't know that his teacher, Victoria Soto, is among the dead. As this south New England town of 27,000 prepares to mourn the 20 children and six adults killed in the school shooting, parents of the youngest survivors are struggling to cope with the aftermath of a massacre that will require many of them to break the news to their child of the death of a teacher or a friend.
