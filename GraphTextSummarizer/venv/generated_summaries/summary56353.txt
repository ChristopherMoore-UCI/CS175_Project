-- All 21 people aboard a military plane that went missing off Chile's Pacific coast, near the Juan Fernandez islands, are dead, Defense Minister Andres Allamand said Saturday. "This is a tough blow to our country, but it is precisely these moments of anguish and uncertainty that require the unity and solidarity of all Chileans," CNN Chile reported the president said Friday. Two of the bodies recovered were female and two were male, government spokesman Andres Chadwick told reporters. The plane tried to land twice before losing contact, Allamand told reporters Friday. Chile's TVN Executive Director Mauro Valdes said five of the passengers were employees of the television station, including Felipe Camiroaga, a well-known and popular TV personality.
