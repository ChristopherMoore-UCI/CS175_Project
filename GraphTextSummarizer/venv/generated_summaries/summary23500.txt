Frank Schaefer, 51, the pastor at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in Lebanon, had already been suspended for 30 days in November after a jury of 13 clergy members found him guilty of officiating a same-sex wedding and being disobedient to the discipline and order of the church, according to Cathy Husid-Shamir, a Schaefer family spokeswoman. During his 30-day suspension, Schaefer was to decide whether his advocacy on behalf of the LGBT community would prevent him from fully complying with church law in the future, according to a statement from Bishop Peggy Johnson of the United Methodist Church. Schaefer was asked to immediately surrender his credentials, but he refused, forcing church officials to defrock him, the statement said. Schaefer told the Board of Ordained Ministry Thursday that he could not uphold the church's Book of Discipline in its entirety because it discriminates against gay people. -- A Pennsylvania minister was defrocked on Thursday after he was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, according to church officials.
