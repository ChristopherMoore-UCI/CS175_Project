Oberst brings it all back home by recording in his native Omaha with Bright Eyes' other two permanent members -- multi-instrumentalist Nate Walcott and producer Mike Mogis -- plus local pals from Cursive and the Faint. On "Haile Selassie," through a haze of epic images, the supernatural force "calling me home like Haile Selassie" ends up being a girl: "I was swimming with you in that cenote the heavens made with black fire. Oberst says he loves reggae's symbolism and anti-imperialist spirit, and throughout "People's Key" he uses Rasta vibrations as an emotional power source. It's especially shrewd because "The People's Key" contains some of his most weighty songwriting -- the head-clearing clamor of "Haile Selassie" or the somber "Approximate Sunlight," where Oberst ruefully sings, "It's been said we're post-everything."
