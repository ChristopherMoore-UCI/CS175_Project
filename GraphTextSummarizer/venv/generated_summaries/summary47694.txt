To get a clearer sense of the benefits (and potential risks) of exercise for heart failure patients, Flynn -- along with Christopher M. O'Connor, M.D., director of the Heart Center at Duke, as well as colleagues from several centers across the country -- randomly assigned 2,331 men and women with heart failure to one of two groups: standard medical care plus aerobic exercise training or standard care only. Moderate exercise can help patients with failing hearts feel better -- and it's safe, according to the largest-ever study of exercise in people with chronic heart failure, published as two articles in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Because his analysis suggests that patients with the most severe heart failure benefit the most from exercise, he says, it's likely that insurers will pay for exercise training for these patients who will offer them the "biggest bang for the buck." "I think this study really helps to show that when you look across a lot of different people, exercise is a good thing," Flynn says, noting that past studies have included far fewer women and older people. Patients in the exercise group were given exercise training and either a treadmill or an exercise bike.
