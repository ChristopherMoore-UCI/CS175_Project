Jarreau was admitted to an intensive care unit after he arrived in the resort town of Barcelonette in the southern French Alps, the publicist said in a written statement. -- Singer Al Jarreau "became weak from the altitude" in the French Alps and was hospitalized Wednesday, forcing the jazz singer to cancel several shows in France, Germany and Azerbaijan over the next week, his publicist said. In addition to missing the Barcelenette show, the illness forced cancellation of shows in Osnabruck and Braunschweig, Germany and Qabala, Azerbaijan. Jarreau could return to the concert stage next Thursday in Nuremberg, Germany, it said. "He is now awake and his first question was to enquire about his wife, Susan, and his second question was to ask about his tour dates," the statement said.
