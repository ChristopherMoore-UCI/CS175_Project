("You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again," Romney senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN this week.) Sure, the metaphor has a perfection all its own, given Romney's penchant for redrawing policy lines. And tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, stops short of endorsing Romney but grudgingly allows that "I think we all need to look at this presidential primary and encourage the candidates to do a little self-reflection here -- what's good for our country." Party organizations can't deliver them anymore, and Romney isn't exactly the guy they were wishing for when the tea party came on the scene in 2010. Consider this: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush endorses Romney, but there's no rally, huge photo op or choreographed endorsement tour.
