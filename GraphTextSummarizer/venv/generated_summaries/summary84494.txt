LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit. The presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond. NASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The moon "is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system. An announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier: There's water on the moon.
