Jol was sacked by Tottenham Hotspur in 2007 before going on to successful spells at Hamburg and Ajax, returning to the EPL with Fulham in 2011. "Our poor form and results this season are undeniable and Fulham supporters deserve better," said Fulham chairman Shahid Khan. Tottenham's next match will be at Fulham Wednesday night, an early test for Meulensteen, as part of a full EPL midweek program. The draw left United in eighth place in the standings, nine points behind leaders Arsenal, with Tottenham a point further back in ninth. Current Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas is reportedly under pressure for his job after disappointing recent results, but he may be breathing a little easier after his side fought to a 2-2 draw against reigning champions Manchester United in the early kickoff Sunday.
