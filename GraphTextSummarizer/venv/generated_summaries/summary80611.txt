"There were some issues with the identity, but our main concern was about the safety of the baby," said Chester police Chief Kenneth J Coalson. Police said they searched Ferguson's house Wednesday where they discovered a purple chair with remains of duct tape still attached to it. Caira Ferguson, 21, revealed the photo as part of her claim that someone had stolen her identity, according to a Chester Township Police statement. -- A Pennsylvania woman was arrested and charged Wednesday with endangering the welfare of a child after showing police a photo of her 2-year-old child duct-taped to a chair. It shows Ferguson smiling next to the child, whose hands are bound and mouth is duct-taped shut.
