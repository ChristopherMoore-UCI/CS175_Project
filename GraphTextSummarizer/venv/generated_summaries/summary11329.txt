Still, given the power and timing of the storm, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said late Sunday afternoon that she believes it is "remarkable that we didn't have more loss of life in Woodward. Compounding the fact it struck at such a late hour, the high winds "took out" the transmitter for the public siren and tornado notification system, and "we lost our manual override" when the electricity was knocked out, City Manager Alan Riffel said -- meaning there was no warning system. While the powerful system hit a hospital, blew truckers off highways and shredded buildings in several states, Woodward was the only place where fatalities were reported over the weekend. And yet Sunday, the Woodward, Oklahoma, resident was all about giving thanks. Following an earlier bout of severe weather, the tornado barreled through Woodward just after midnight Sunday.
