After unsuccessfully challenging his dismissal in court, police say, the renegade officer launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the LAPD, targeting numerous officers involved in his case and their families. "After a thorough review of all the available information, my analysis concludes that the discharge of Christopher Dorner was justified," Gerald Chaleff, LAPD special assistant for constitutional policing, said in a statement. Dorner, 33, apparently took his own life during a police shootout in February after he was cornered in a mountain cabin in San Bernardino County, California, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. -- The Los Angeles Police Department was "factually and legally" proper in 2009 when it fired Christopher Dorner, who killed four people and wounded three others in a rampage this year, an internal department report said Friday. A second department report will be published later this year on issues raised by Dorner and others about alleged corruption in the department's disciplinary process and about the state of employee relations.
