This seems to be part of ISIS's first moves into Afghanistan, a bid to bolster their ranks for the fight in Iraq and Syria by vacuuming up disgruntled former Taliban fighters -- or even just students looking for a cause. When asked why ISIS might be on the rise here, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: "The reason it's happening is because (the) collapse of Yemen, Syria, Iraq has created an environment where instead of one weak link in the interrelated system of states, now there are wider spaces." Ghani added: "They have -- it's one of the most well-endowed finance -- well-financed organizations. "The Christians and Jews have not only attacked Afghanistan, but they have also attacked Muslims in Syria, Iraq and Palestine. While these recruiters seek to attract fighters to Syria, their presence in Afghanistan at this pivotal time will fuel fears that the country remains vulnerable to being used as a sanctuary for a new wave of extremists. Yet ISIS experts say some of Khorasan's militants have defected to join ISIS, and those defectors in turn sent recruiters to Afghanistan to try to bolster their ranks.
