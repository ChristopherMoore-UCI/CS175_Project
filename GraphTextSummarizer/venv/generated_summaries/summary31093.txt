-- Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is calling on Muslims to kidnap Westerners, citing the success in the abduction of American aid worker Warren Weinstein in Pakistan. In May, al Qaeda released a video of the 71-year-old Weinstein pleading with President Barack Obama to meet the demands. One of the FBI's most wanted terrorists, al-Zawahiri has played a defining role in al Qaeda. In a two-part, more than two-hour video posted on jihadist websites, al-Zawahiri called for the abductions as part of a vow not to "spare any efforts" to free Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. " U.S. officials have said Washington will not bargain with al Qaeda.
