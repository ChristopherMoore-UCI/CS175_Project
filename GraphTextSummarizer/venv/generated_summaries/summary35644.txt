With China surpassing Japan as the world's second largest movie market last year, studios that successfully appeal to Chinese audiences can reap sizeable profits. Iron Man passes $300 million internationally When "Red Dawn" was released in China last year, a scene showing an invasion by Chinese forces was changed to the North Korean army, and a shoot-out scene set in Chinatown in "Men in Black 3" was cut entirely. Robert Downey Jr. spoke of his fascination with Chinese culture during a promotional tour for the film in Beijing last month. The extra four minutes of footage feature product placement for a Chinese-branded milk drink and two new characters, Dr Wu and his assistant, played by top Chinese actors Wang Xueqi and Fan Bingbing, respectively. But the inclusion of the scenes, he said, gave the film access to the Chinese market that other Hollywood studios lack.
