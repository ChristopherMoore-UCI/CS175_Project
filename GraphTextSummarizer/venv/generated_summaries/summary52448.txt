Riots flared in Marseille, where youths of Algerian origin set fire to boats and cars; Algiers was rocked when Egyptian businesses were ransacked by angry fans. "They let them do it," defender Antar Yahia told Algerian state radio, accusing Egyptian security guards of standing back and allowing the attack to happen. The Algerian embassy was the scene of another riot, this time by Egyptian fans angry at the pictures they had seen emerge from Sudan. According to Egyptian football Web site Filgoal.com, tearful fans had phoned Egyptian TV shows from Sudan claiming to be under attack from knife-wielding Algerians. Whilst most of the world's press agreed that the aftermath had passed relatively peacefully, Egyptian media saw things differently.
