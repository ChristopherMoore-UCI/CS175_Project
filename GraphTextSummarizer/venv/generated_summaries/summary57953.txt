UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups -- and that most will try to return, bringing their extremist views with them. "They have all been taken to police stations in central London and remain in custody," Metropolitan Police said. -- Four men were arrested Tuesday in London on suspicion of planning an act of terrorism, one that the city's police commissioner described as "quite a serious case." Those men, ages 22 to 51, were detained in London and elsewhere in the country on suspicion of being members of a banned organization, supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism. Armed police officers assisted in the arrests of the men -- two of whom are 20 years old, while the others are 21 -- according to London's Metropolitan Police.
