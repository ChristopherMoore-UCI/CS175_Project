There are rocks you must climb over, rocks that stick out from the ground to slam your toes into or trip over, irregular rocks that force you to use foot and leg muscles to maintain balance with each step and rocks covered with mud or muck that are as slick as ice. Last year some 6,200 volunteers, led by members of 31 official Appalachian Trail maintaining clubs, worked 210,000 hours repairing trails, painting blazes and maintaining shelters, privies and wells, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Still, it seems there are more rocks on the trail than off the trail. What's in an Appalachian Trail hiker's backpack? Hiking uphill carrying 20-30 pounds is strenuous, especially when it's a half-mile climb up large rocks.
