Trinkley and Little both say the potential historical importance of grave sites warrant investigation by local or state officials. " Other grave markers used in black burial cites throughout the Southeast include iron pipes, broken dishes, cups, bottles and live cedar trees, according to Chicora Foundation Executive Director Michael Trinkley. "The problem with preserving these types of sites is that African-American cemeteries are hard to find," Trinkley said. " Little says slave cemeteries in the area would have been marked with field stones, like the rocks at the site, or wooden stakes that burned down. Experts say that if slaves or former slaves are buried at the site, it would be a unique archeological find.
