The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- collectively known as the BRICS -- "agreed to examine in greater detail a proposal to set up a BRICS-led South-South Development Bank, funded and managed by the BRICS and other developing countries," said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. "The rapid recovery of the BRICS economies from the financial crisis highlighted their role as growth drivers of the global economy," Singh said. While some progress has been made in international financial institutions, there is lack of movement on the political side," Singh said. Finance ministers from the five countries have been directed to look into the idea of the development bank and report back at the next summit, Singh said. "We agreed that a lasting solution to the problems in Syria and Iran can only be found through dialogue," Singh said.
