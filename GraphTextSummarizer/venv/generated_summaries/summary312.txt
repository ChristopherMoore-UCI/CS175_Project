"Josh has a long road to recovery," Todd Hardy, Josh's father, told CNN in an e-mail Thursday. The Chimerix pharmaceutical company said Tuesday that Josh would receive medicine that doctors hope will help him. Josh's parents got what they'd been praying for this week: a chance to get medicine that could help their 7-year-old son survive. He still isn't taking any food or drink by mouth, and his 5-year-old brother, Jude, "is purposely torturing him by drinking carton after carton of chocolate milk that's available in the ICU break room," Hardy said. Josh's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old.
