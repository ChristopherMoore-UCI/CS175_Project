"This Saturday I brought Vahid Halilhodzic's contract to an end because one of the aims that was set for him was not reached and that was to win the 2010 African Nations Cup," Cote d'Ivoire football federation president Jacques Anouma reportedly said on national television. -- The Ivory Coast have reportedly sacked coach Vahid Halilhodzic despite the Bosnian having guided the African team to this year's World Cup finals. It said the 57-year-old Halihodzic, who took charge in 2008, had been axed after the Ivorians failed to live up to their favorite status at the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola last month and lost in the quarterfinals to Algeria. Russia coach Guus Hiddink is among the favorites to take over for football's showpiece tournament starting in June, according to a report from the British Press Association which was carried on the Web site of world ruling body FIFA on Saturday. The Dutchman was also linked with the vacant Nigeria coaching role, which subsequently went to former Sweden manager Lars Lagerback, who signed a five-month contract on Friday.
