A grand jury in Savannah, Georgia, handed up a two-count indictment Wednesday accusing Currington, 39, of threatening bodily harm against Charles Harvey Ferrelle last week. Ferrelle, a charter boat captain, was giving a boat tour around Tybee Island, Georgia, when he passed by Currington's property on April 15, the report said. A Savannah judge issued a bench warrant for Currington's arrest after the indictment was handed up by the Chatham County grand jury Wednesday, District Attorney Meg Heap said Wednesday. The police report, obtained by CNN affiliate WSAV, says Ferrelle filed a criminal complaint saying "he feared for his life" after Currington screamed at him and followed him in a boat. Although Currington resides primarily in Nashville, he is a native of Rincon, Georgia, which is about 35 miles inland from Tybee Island.
