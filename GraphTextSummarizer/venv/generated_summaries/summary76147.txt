In guidelines published on its Web site, the FDA said it has "some concern" about the safety of BPA, and supports efforts by industry to remove BPA from infant bottles and feeding cups. The new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program, which in its own 2008 report said there is "some concern" for BPA's effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. Other guidance includes: • Discarding scratched or worn bottles and cups, which aside from harboring germs might also release small amounts of BPA • Being careful when heating formula, as boiling or very hot liquid might cause the release of BPA into infant formula • At the news conference, Hamburg and Sharfstein urged parents to keep the risk in perspective, saying the benefits of nutritious infant formula outstrip any potential danger from BPA. According to Sharfstein, the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to BPA.
