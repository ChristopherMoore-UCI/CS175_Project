"The care that she received in South Africa was effectively misguided love," Monkey World Director Alison Cronin told CNN on Wednesday from the center in Wareham, England. "Oshine's care became a problem because she was effectively left on her own for long periods of time during the day when the family weren't there to entertain her, and so they simply tried to keep her busy and happy by feeding her a lot of junk food -- so a lot of candy, a lot of sweets, and processed food," Cronin said. The center has been working to bring Oshine to England since then, it said. "Because she was basically inactive and not flying around through trees and things, she put on an awful lot of weight, and now we have our work cut out for us here at Monkey World to get that weight off of her and to get her fit so that she, too, can become a breeding female and have a family of her own one day. -- A South African has become so fat on her diet of marshmallows that she's been taken to England to lose weight.
