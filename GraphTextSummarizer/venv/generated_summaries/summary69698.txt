Bomberg summed up the prosecution's largely circumstantial case, telling the jury that Hernandez and his associates killed Lloyd and then "took evidence with them and tried to and, in some cases, were successful in destroying evidence." Ward, who had twice walked out of court sobbing when photos of her son were shown, calmly recounted that Lloyd rode his bicycle 20 miles to a landscaping job, that he played semi-pro football for the Boston Bandits and that she last saw him alive on Father's Day 2013. "Yes, your honor," Ward replied during her brief appearance as a prosecution witness in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez. Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, a former semipro football player who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Before Ward took the stand, defense lawyer Michael Fee objected to admitting the photo of Lloyd as evidence and showing it to the victim's mother, saying it was "cruel and unnecessary" and aimed at eliciting emotion.
