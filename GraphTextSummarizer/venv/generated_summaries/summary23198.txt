(Mashable)  -- Sony has announced that it will drop the price of the PSP Go portable gaming system from $249 to $199 just in time for the holiday rush. The price cut is already effective -- just check out any online retailer like Gamestop or Amazon and you'll see the device selling at its new price point. Sony boasts that the PSP has moved 61 million units since it debuted in 2004, but the various DS models have sold more than 140 million units in roughly the same time period. It's a welcome change, and it makes the device more competitive with the Nintendo DSi ($149) and the iPod touch ($229 -- $399). The PSP targets the core gamer market, which is willing to pay a little bit more for impressive graphics than it would get on the DSi.
