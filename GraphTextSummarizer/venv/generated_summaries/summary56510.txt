"Dear Mom, Love Cher" will focus on the singer's family history and features interviews with Holt, her daughters Cher and Georganne LaPiere Bartylak, and grandchildren Chaz Bono and Elijah Blue Allman. The documentary also features a never-before-heard duet performance with Holt and Cher, along with the long-lost recordings Holt taped more than three decades ago that Cher has re-mastered for commercial release later this year. -- Lifetime will premiere an hour-long documentary that pays tribute to Cher's mom Georgia Holt on May 6. The documentary will begin with Holt's childhood in rural Arkansas and chronicle her six "tumultuous" marriages while she helped Cher to pursue a career. Like most things in my family, it was initiated by my sister Georganne, who asked me if I could update mom's album," said Cher in a statement.
