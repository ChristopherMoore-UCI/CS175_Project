-- Two people were killed and two others wounded Thursday in clashes in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces said. The city is a mix of Christians and Shiite and Sunni Muslims. Residents threw rocks and fired shots at security forces who were trying to stop the illegal construction of homes, the ISF said. The incident occurred in the southern port city of Tyre, and an investigation is under way into the incident. Palestinians live in refugee camps around the city.
