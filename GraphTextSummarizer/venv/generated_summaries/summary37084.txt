Guan will become the youngest player in Masters history when he tees off on Thursday, eclipsing the mark set by Italy's Matteo Manassero in 2010 And on Monday, the Chinese teenager -- aged 14 years, five months and 14 days -- was given a helping hand by Woods after the 14-time major winner invited Guan to take in the back nine of the fabled Augusta course. -- Chinese amateur golfer Guan Tianlang was not even born when Tiger Woods won the Masters for the first time in 1997. But the 2011 British Open champion has been forced to withdraw with the same hamstring injury which kept him out of last week's Valero Texas Open. It was the third time the teenager had played with world No. 1 Woods, with the pair joined on their Monday practice round by big-hitting American Dustin Johnson. Guan qualified for the year's first major by winning November's Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship, an event designed specifically to unearth global talent.
