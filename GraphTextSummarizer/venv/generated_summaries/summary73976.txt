Southampton won 3-1 at Crystal Palace to leapfrog West Ham into fourth spot, the defeat the last match in charge for home boss Neil Warnock. -- Jose Mourinho's Chelsea had the last laugh on London rival West Ham to keep up its relentless pace at the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 Boxing Day home win. Further goals might have followed with the table toppers in confident mood, although West Ham came close to cutting the deficit when substitute Morgan Amalfitano hit the post with a shot. It was the former England international's second goal in two games and his team might have been further ahead but for Adrian producing a fine save from Nemanja Matic and top scorer Costa shooting over. The pre-match build up had centered on Mourinho's remarks after the corresponding fixture last season -- when peeved by the West Ham defensive tactics in a 0-0 draw -- he said manager Sam Allardyce and the team had been playing "football from the 19th century" -- amid other sharp criticism.
