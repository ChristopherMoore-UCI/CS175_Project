Just this year alone, assisted suicide bills were rejected in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, and stalled in New Jersey, due to bipartisan, grassroots opposition from a broad coalition of groups spanning the political spectrum from left to right, including disability rights organizations, medical professionals and associations, palliative care specialists, hospice workers and faith-based organizations. Yet while I have every sympathy for her situation, it is important to remember that for every case such as this, there are hundreds -- or thousands -- more people who could be significantly harmed if assisted suicide is legal. Available data suggests that pain is rarely the reason why people choose assisted suicide. The legalization of assisted suicide always appears acceptable when the focus is solely on an individual. But the reality is that legalizing assisted suicide is a deadly mix with the broken, profit-driven health care system we have in the United States.
