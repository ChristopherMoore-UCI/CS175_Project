President Obama has said he would use whatever means necessary to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The United States seeks to ensure the program does not lead to Iran's development of nuclear weapons. Officials here and abroad have long asserted that Iran has been trying to move closer to the capability to develop nuclear weapons, despite years of passionate denials by its leaders. If talks come with the skepticism they deserve--and a tough timeline that doesn't let Iran use them as a stalling tactic to further develop weapons programs--they are a risk well worth taking. Iran, according to Rouhani, seeks to have the ability to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear power and nothing more.
