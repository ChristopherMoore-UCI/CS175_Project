Speaking Saturday at a bipartisan national security conference at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Gen. Joseph Dunford said, "Fifty percent of our units that are at home station today, they are at a degraded state of readiness." -- Half of all U.S. Marine Corps units at their home bases are below the levels of required readiness, according to the new commandant of the Marine Corps. Dunford said that includes "equipment shortfalls, or personnel shortfalls, and the reason is because of the high operational tempo we have today." He noted that about two years ago the Marine Corps had been making progress in improving readiness from its previous rate of 60% of units not being ready to deploy. They will be the units to respond to a major contingency and those units are not at the level of readiness that we want them to be today.
