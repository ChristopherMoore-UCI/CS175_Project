Muirfield remains as one of three courses on rotation to host the Open, along with Royal Troon and Royal St George's, which do not accept female members. Female golfers are already able to play on the famous links course on the east coast of Scotland but until now they were not allowed to enter the clubhouse as members or take any part in club decisions. "The membership has also acted to fast-track a significant initial number of women to become members in the coming months," added Dawson. "Society is changing, sport is changing, golf is changing," R&A chief executive Peter Dawson commented before the decision was announced. Welcoming female members ensures the Royal & Ancient remains relevant in an egalitarian, new future.
