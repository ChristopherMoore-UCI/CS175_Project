With an emphasis on early detection and treatment, much of autism research and support focuses on children, but Café Blends is just one of a number of new programs aimed at serving the needs of young adults. The café began when Nalley Lexus Roswell general manager Chris Dastou heard about a similar program at a company meeting. "I think ten years ago it was all about children, but now those children are growing up, and there has been a real recognition that autism is a lifespan disorder," says Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. "It's gone from a hope to an expectation." Chris Pavlak recognizes that autism is a reality for him, but he refuses to see it as a limitation. Chris Pavlak stands behind the coffee bar at a car dealership in Roswell, Georgia, ready to whip up specialty lattes for waiting customers.
