I was with Dr. King as he stood with workers, all African-American, all fighting years of labor repression and wages that relegated them to poverty. As tens of thousands prepare to commemorate our nation's progress toward racial justice, it's worth remembering a central meaning of that march: economic opportunity. He championed economic opportunity and jobs knowing that an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Were Dr. King here today, I have little doubt he would join with the striking workers of federally contracted companies, fast-food giants and Wal-Mart. Just as Dr. King looked toward leaders in the nation's capital to better living standards, so too can workers turn their attention toward Washington.
