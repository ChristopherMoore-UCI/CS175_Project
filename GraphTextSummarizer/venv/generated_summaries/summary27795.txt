-- When President Barack Obama meets with other world leaders, they usually swap gifts. The Sarkozys bestowed Obama a black Hermes golf accessory bag estimated at $7,750, a Louis Vuitton bag worth $2,300 and crystal table lamps for first lady Michelle Obama. Presidents, kings and prime ministers showered Obama and his family with a wide assortment of tokens and trinkets, including a bamboo bicycle, masks, liquor and a small sword. The State Department released a detailed list of gifts to the White House and other government officials in 2011, the latest year available. Obama is not the only leader of the free world to receive gifts.
