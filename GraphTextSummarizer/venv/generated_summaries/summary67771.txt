The first three courses -- each about 150 miles -- run across Chile's Atacama Desert, where it hasn't rained in 200 years; China's Gobi Desert, where the first dinosaur eggs were discovered; and North Africa's Sahara Desert,  where camels have been known to eat Racing the Planet's pink flag race markers. Despite blisters and 130-degree heat, Canadian Sandy McCallum pulls ahead on a grueling day in the desert. Sahara racers were asked: What happens if you're racing and stop seeing pink flags along the way? "Nothing has ever made more sense to me," said Jim Molaschi, a 46-year-old South Florida engineer, who escapes from his cubicle as often as possible to do adventure races that make "Survivor" contestants look like pageant queens. No one has been seriously hurt during past races.
