Hibernian have named former striker Mixu Paatelainen as their new manager in succession to John Collins -- who resigned last month in frustration at the lack of funds available to buy new players. The Finn, who enjoyed two playing spells with the Scottish Premier League club, joins from Finnish side TPS Turku. Capped 70 times by Finland, Paatelainen helped Turku finish third in the Veikkausliiga last year. His two playing stints with Hibernian were from 1998-2001 and 2002-2003, either side of a spell with French side Strasbourg. The 40-year-old, who also played for Dundee United, Aberdeen, St Johnstone and St Mirren in Scotland -- as well as Bolton and Wolverhampton in England, confirmed he is relishing the challenge of his new job.
