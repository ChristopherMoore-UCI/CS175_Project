The Lord's Resistance Army carried out the brutal campaign in northeastern Congo over four days, killing at least 321, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Dozens of other attacks against civilians have been carried out in other areas in recent months, Human Rights Watch said. In the Congo attack, gangs tied up villagers -- including women and children -- and hacked them to death, Human Rights Watch said. The United Nations cannot corroborate the number of deaths reported by Human Rights Watch, but has confirmed more than 100 killed so far, he said. The Lord's Resistance Army was initially based in Uganda, but now works near the borders of Central African Republic, Sudan and Congo.
