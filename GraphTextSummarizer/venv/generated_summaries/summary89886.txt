That publication's TV critic, Jeff Jensen, wrote, "Culminating a remarkable first season in fine, moving form, 'True Detective's' finale, titled 'Form and Void,' took us to the heart of darkness at the vortex center of its weird fiction -- as well as the final stage of its meta-commentary on the stories we tell ourselves, about ourselves, for better and worse." Time's James Poniewozik found some flaws in the ending even as he said, "True Detective was an artfully written, remarkably acted, stunningly visualized portrait of Marty and Rust trying to find the path in an overgrown world of decay." " 'True Detective' was the closest thing American TV has done in a while to the British model of drama, a story told in one season, from the keyboard of a single writer (and the lens of one director)," Poniewozik wrote. -- There is no mystery to the popularity of the HBO series "True Detective." Mario Lopez tweeted, "I can now say that True Detective had the best first season of any show I've ever seen..." The show attracted plenty of famous fans also. The Atlantic took the approach of having a "round table" of writers discuss the season finale.
