As to police danger, it shouldn't be overstated (police officers are paranoid enough as is), but the danger isn't just in the small though real risk of being attacked and killed. Despite the horrible assassinations of Liu and Ramos, we have not seen any sustained increase in violence directed toward New York City police officers. The last time New York had both a liberal mayor and contract negotiations, police actually rioted. But many police, especially in New York City, see themselves as a thin blue line besieged by both a liberal and criminal world, neither of which they particularly like or understand. -- "One of the unfortunate realities of policing," New York police Commissioner William Bratton said after the killings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, "is that you put that blue uniform on and you become part of the thin blue line between us and anarchy."
