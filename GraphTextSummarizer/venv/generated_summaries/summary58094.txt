Since then, breathalyzer tests have suggested Bieber was not too drunk to legally drive when he was pulled over by Miami Beach police early Thursday. It's not likely Bieber will be kicked out of the United States, immigration law experts say. After his arrest in Florida last week, Bieber "made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol, and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication," Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said. Immigration lawyers say convictions on those charges wouldn't generally lead to deportation for someone like Bieber, who has a visa allowing him to legally live in the United States because of his "extraordinary ability" in the arts. "It's a very complex area of immigration law," said Annaluisa Padilla, a California immigration lawyer.
