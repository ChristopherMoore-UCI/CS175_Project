In an emotional open letter to the person responsible for her daughter's disappearance, the mother of missing Indiana University student Lauren Spierer pledges to never give up searching for answers. "If you think for a minute her father and I are going to disappear, think again," Charlene Spierer writes in the letter, written on the three-month anniversary of Lauren Spierer's disappearance and released Saturday on the family's "Find Lauren" web site. " Lauren Spierer, a 20-year-old sophomore, was last seen early June 3 after leaving a Bloomington, Indiana, sports bar with a male student. Always, Mom." Lauren Spierer was last seen wearing black pants and a white tank top with a white shirt, according to her family's web site. Police searched a landfill outside of Bloomington last month in connection with Spierer's disappearance.
