The investigation concluded that since Deputy Erick Gelhaus "honestly and reasonably believed" his life was in danger, the shooting of Andy Lopez was "lawful self-defense," said Sonoma County, California, District Attorney Jill Ravitch. Justice Coalition for Andy Lopez, which was formed in the wake of the shooting, called for supporters to gather in Santa Rosa on Monday afternoon to protest the decision. Family friend Gabriel Roque said in an interview with CNN affiliate KGO last October that Lopez "was a 13-year-old boy who was no harm to anybody." -- A sheriff's deputy who shot and killed a 13-year-old California boy last year when he mistook a toy gun for a real rifle did not break the law, a prosecutor said Monday. Gelhaus said that when he yelled at the boy, whose back was turned to him, to put the weapon down, the boy turned toward him, according to a sheriff's statement issued after the October 22, 2013, shooting in Santa Rosa, California.
