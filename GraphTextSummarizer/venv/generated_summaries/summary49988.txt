China thinks Hong Kong is "confused" Beijing, in a policy document released in June, said that Hong Kong does not enjoy "full autonomy" and residents are "confused or lopsided in their understanding" of "One Country, Two Systems." The government says Hong Kong should accept deal on offer The Hong Kong government says its people should accept the deal on electoral reform offered by Beijing. When the city was returned to China in 1997 a deal was struck promising "a high degree of autonomy" to Hong Kong under a formula dubbed "One Country, Two Systems." The city's Basic Law or "mini-constitution" has allowed the city to carry on with its own legal and financial system and Hong Kong enjoys civil liberties unseen in mainland China such as an independent judiciary, freedom of the press and the right to protest. Supporters want to force discussions, and even concessions, over Beijing's influence on Hong Kong.
