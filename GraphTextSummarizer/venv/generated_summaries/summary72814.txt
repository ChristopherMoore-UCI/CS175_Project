Beyond Virginia Tech, Thursday's incident had ripple effects elsewhere in western Virginia. Several Virginia Tech administrators -- including the head of campus police, Wendell Flinchum, and the emergency management director, Michael Mulhare -- were in Washington on Thursday at a federal court hearing on the 2007 shooting on the school's campus, according to U.S. Department of Education officials. In April, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli called the 2007 case against Virginia Tech "Monday-morning quarterbacking at its very worst. "In light of the turmoil and the trauma and the tragedy suffered by this campus by guns, I can only say that words don't describe our feelings and they are most elusive at this point in time," Virginia Tech President Charles Steger told reporters Thursday. Soon thereafter, police "dispatch was unable to make contact with the officer," Virginia Tech Deputy Police Chief Gene Deisinger said.
