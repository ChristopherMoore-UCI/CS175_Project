Tibetans had staged an uprising against Chinese rule and the security forces reacted with force. "But we are I think (the) most fortunate and successful refugee community because of (the) government of India's care and support." When India took in the exiles, it told the Tibetans to refrain from political activity, certainly of the anti-China kind. A half century later, the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people recounted to CNN that day and the subsequent journey to India. The Dalai Lama says he is grateful for the care and support he has received from India.
