-- The question of whether there should be American boots on the ground to fight ISIS in Iraq came up again Sunday after President Barack Obama said that despite his earlier vow not to commit U.S. combat forces there, he wasn't ruling out the possibility if confronted with the worst-possible situation. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, however, thought Obama was wrong in ruling out sending U.S. ground troops, saying on CBS' "Face the Nation," "You don't tell the enemy exactly what you plan on doing or what you won't do. The comments -- along with the release Sunday of an ISIS video depicting the aftermath of the beheading of American hostage Peter Kassig -- reignited the debate on the Sunday morning talk shows. "There are always circumstances in which the United States might need to deploy ground troops," Obama said at the G20 Summit in Australia. "If we discovered that ISIL had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon, and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes, you can anticipate that not only would [Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin] Dempsey recommend me sending U.S. ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it."
