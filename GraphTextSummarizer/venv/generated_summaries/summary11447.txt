-- Francesca Schiavone returned "home" to the scene of her French Open triumph last year with an emphatic victory in her opener against 19-year-old American Melanie Oudin Monday. Another pre-tournament favorite, Russian third seed Vera Zvonareva, also reached the second round by beating Spanish veteran Lourdes Dominguez Lino 6-3 6-3 on Court Suzanne Lenglen. " Top seed Caroline Wozniacki later made light work of Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm in their first round match, winning for the loss of just two games. Zvonareva was a losing finalist at both Wimbledon and the U.S Open last year. Her fellow Russian and 26th seed Nadia Petrova was a first day casualty, going down 6-7 6-3 6-4 to Australia's Anastasia Rodionova.
