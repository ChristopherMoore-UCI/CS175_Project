"I think when you do things that are just slightly out of the norm, it not only affects your experience of what just happened -- of the event -- but affects the way you view the possibilities of your own actions going forward in your life." "Like, to me, the railroad tour that we did with Old Crow and with Mumford and Sons was a culmination of all of the sort of childhood sort of ideals of being with a crew -- with a band of sort of brothers and sisters, and all playing music together, on a train going who knows where." That freewheeling feeling permeates the band's music, and its mythology. But people who want to see what it's like on the road with the Zeros can check out the new DVD "Big Easy Express," which documents their April 2011 tour from Oakland, California, to New Orleans by vintage train, along with Old Crow Medicine Show and Mumford & Sons. ," says Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros frontman Alex Ebert. "So, I think when we all come together, it offers not just one school of thought, or one approach to playing or learning music, but everyone kind of throws in a different color into the pot." Ebert, who says he's spiritual, while "not so fond of" religious order and dogma, says ultimately, the music creates itself. Ebert says that from the band's beginning, he told its manager he'd like to perform at unconventional venues.
