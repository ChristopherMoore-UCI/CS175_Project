American John Hopkins and Italian Marco Melandri were due to ride for Kawasaki next season. -- MotoGP is the latest branch of motorsport to be hit by the global economic downturn as Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki ended a week of speculation by withdrawing their team. While the sums of money in MotoGP are much smaller compared to Formula One, it is believed Kawasaki spent upwards of $40 million per year in running a Dutch-based team. Kawasaki are following the trend set by Honda announcing last month they were quitting Formula One and Subaru and Suzuki withdrawing from the world rally championship. Kawasaki were founder members when the former 500cc world championship was rebranded as MotoGP in 2002, but have never topped the podium.
