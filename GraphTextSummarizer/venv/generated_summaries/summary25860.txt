The nearly 42-year rule of Gadhafi appeared on the verge of collapse early Monday, with rebel supporters making it to the same Tripoli square where regime loyalists had congregated for months. Addahoumi's son, Sammi, sent CNN an iReport from Benghazi that showed video of large, boisterous crowds in the city's Freedom Square as developments played on a large screen. He said Libyans have the resources they need to build the country and that they will do it, piece by piece. -- Hassan Addahoumi fled Libya in the late 1970s, driven from his homeland by the hard-line tactics of Moammar Gadhafi. Over the years, Addahoumi said he has returned to Libya from time to time and that he wishes he could be there now.
