Within the context of Iran's intra-regime struggle, the hikers' conviction on charges of illegal entry and espionage by a judiciary under cleric Sadeq Larijani emerges as yet another attempt by xenophobic mullahs to thwart Ahmadinejad's albeit fumbling attempts to re-engage the United States. Islam pales when compared to those achievements and so does the theocratic state of modern Iran, they insist. Khamenei conceded recently that "the supreme Islamic jurist cannot act solely according to his inclination." Ahmadinejad, although rightly abhorred on the world stage for his bad words and deeds, is far from politically impotent and will likely continue to press an increasingly secularist vision of government upon the mullahs, knowing his new stances make him one of the three most popular politicians, none of them fundamentalists, within Iran.
