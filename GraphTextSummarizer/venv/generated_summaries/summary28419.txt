Dorner has allegedly written a manifesto pledging "asymmetrical warfare" on officers in and out of uniform, particularly LAPD officers, but the sheriff's deputies were taking the threat to include them, too. One victim was the daughter of retired Los Angeles Police Officer Randal Quan, who handled the appeal of Dorner's termination and, according to the manifesto, bungled it. "These types of events band officers and departments together, and I guess his trying to bring the fight to officers, well, he knows better," added Lee, a 10-year veteran. That rail line runs through the heart of the southwest division of the Los Angeles Police Department, the district where Dorner, a former LAPD officer, had been assigned for patrol duty while on the force. Dorner appealed the case to a Los Angeles court, where a judge ruled against him in 2011, according to court records.
