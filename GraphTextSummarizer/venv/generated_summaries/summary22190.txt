UKIP is an anti-European Union, British party and it finds itself on the same side as Sinn Fein, the anti-British, nationalist party. He said he volunteered to hand out leaflets because he says last year the pro-Lisbon Treaty lobby took a "yes" for granted. Lisbon is the plan to modernize the EU's structure after it expanded to 27 members, with most of the new member states coming from Eastern Europe. The EU has made assurances to Ireland that the Lisbon Treaty will not affect the country's abortion laws or its neutrality and that Ireland will keep a European Commissioner. "When I see the UK Independence Party join up with Sinn Fein and religious extremists, I must be on the right side," laughed Michael Wall, a "yes" campaigner.
