The meals are cooked and served by actual prisoners at restaurants located inside prison walls as part of a training and qualification program to help them prepare for life on the outside. "This, and the money from people dining in the restaurant and the purchasing of Clink products, helps to reduce the deficit." High Down Prison is a category B prison (in the UK, category A prisons are most secure, category D facilities are "open prisons"), and as such requires special measures. The venue is the third to open under the scheme, joining enterprises at Cardiff Prison in Wales and High Down Prison in Surrey. The Clink Charity opened its third restaurant this week inside Brixton Prison in south London.
