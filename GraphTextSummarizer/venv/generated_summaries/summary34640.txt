In Sunday's Premier League fixtures, third-placed Manchester City host Fulham and sixth-placed Liverpool travel to bottom side West Ham. Wolverhampton Wanderers moved out of the relegation zone on goal difference above West Brom with a 4-0 win against Blackpool. Mick McCarthy's team took the lead thanks to Matt Jarvis' curling shot after two minutes, and it got worse for Blackpool -- who beat fourth-placed Tottenham 3-1 on Tuesday -- when striker DJ Campbell was sent off for a push on Richard Stearman. Aston Villa moved away from the relegation zone courtesy of a convincing 4-1 defeat of Blackburn Rovers at Villa Park which moved the home team up to 12th -- a point above their opponents. Two goals from Jermaine Beckford secured a 2-0 home success for Everton over Sunderland, who dropped below Bolton on goal difference.
