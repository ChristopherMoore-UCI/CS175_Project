Play began at 7 a.m. local time on the Royal Liverpool Golf Club at Hoylake, but gusts of wind up to 60 mph soon made conditions unplayable with balls falling off tees and moving on the greens. It was also agreed that the halfway cut will be reduced from the top 65 and ties to the top 50 and ties. Co-overnight leader Ryu So-Yeon from South Korea was one of the 36 players who started their second rounds before play was stopped. "It was fairly sheltered by the tents when we set off but by the time we got to the 12th it was clearly unplayable," added Wie, who started at the 10th hole on Friday. Strong winds curtailed action at the Women's British Open after just over an hour's play on Friday.
