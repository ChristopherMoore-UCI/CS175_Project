At the other end of the spectrum, the Analina Rooms offers tastefully modernist brown-and-white interiors and breakfast next door at Maestro Churrero, a café famous for the quintessential Spanish snack, chocolate con churros (doubles from €65 ($102)). Thanks to a vibrant design culture and growing tourism industry, Spain now has some of the best boutique hotels on the continent -- including a recent wave of hotel chains that's making chic accommodations affordable. Near major museums, the hotel's light-filled, airy rooms are stylish without going overboard on showy design elements. Visiting creative types head for fashionable Chueca and check in to Colors Host, decorated in a chromatic riot of shades. Each property, named after an imagined roommate, has its own personality, as interpreted by a crew of hot young interior designers.
