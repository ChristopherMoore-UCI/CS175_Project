While low and middle income workers might be quietly shuffled out of city centers in the spring, summer, and fall, Malka's work turns French cities' housing crisis into a living, breathing billboard year-round. Architect and former graffiti artist St√©phane Malka seeks out these neglected armpits of cities' public space and transforms them into light, flexible, emergency housing. Still, Malka hopes his project inspires other architects to work on more community-minded projects that take advantage of public space. "In France, there's a rule saying in wintertime, you can't take someone out of housing," Malka explains. We'll be facing in the years to come more climate refugees, more political refugees, and the city will have to stand massive amounts of people coming.
