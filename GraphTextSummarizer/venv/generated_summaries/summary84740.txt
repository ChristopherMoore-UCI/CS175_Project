I put in long hours. More than two decades later, thanks to the 2008 recession and the erosion of union power, entry-level unionized autoworkers were paid between $14 and $17 an hour, while veteran workers earned between $28 and $38 an hour. College costs actually just started to rise in 1980, the year I entered Kent State University. Back in the day, manufacturing jobs were plentiful, and they paid well, as did many traditional middle-class jobs. Since I went to school, college costs have risen at twice and sometimes three times the Consumer Price Index.
