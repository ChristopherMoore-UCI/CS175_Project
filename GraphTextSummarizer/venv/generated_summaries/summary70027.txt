During the fourth hour of NBC's morning show on Monday, co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford were talking with E! correspondent Jason Kennedy about Aretha Franklin wanting to be a judge on "American Idol," a story which CNN first reported. A few hours later, Franklin responded in an e-mail, exclusively obtained by CNN. Then, Kennedy poured more cold water on the idea of Franklin doing the show, saying she doesn't like to fly and that will make it hard for her to travel across the country for auditions. "If they are looking for a younger demographic, there are a lot of kids out there (who) actually don't know who Aretha Franklin is. Gifford emphatically said today's generation of music lovers don't know who the 18-time Grammy Award winner is.
