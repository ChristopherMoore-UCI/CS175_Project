Pedrosa, who won last weekend's German round of the championship, clocked one minute 47.284 seconds on the Mugello circuit to edge out compatriot Jorge Lorenzo on his Yamaha. Pedrosa was delighted with his performance, but warned that he faced tough opposition from Lorenzo in particular on race day. It was the 26-year-old Pedrosa's 21st pole in MotoGP and he benefited from a mechanical problem with Lorenzo's bike at the end of the session. Reigning champion Casey Stoner, who crashed out in Germany on the last lap when in second place, could only manage fifth place behind teammate Pedrosa. "I had engine problems in the final corners and I had to stop," said Lorenzo, who leads Pedrosa by 26 points in the title standings.
