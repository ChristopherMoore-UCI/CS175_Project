At Tele Atlas headquarters in New Hampshire, analysts pore over the data for updates and inconsistencies: changes in roads, speed limits and even how many lanes are on a highway. Once confirmed, the changes make their way into Tele Atlas software and eventually to cell phones, navigation systems and home computers. One gets sent to awaiting Tele Atlas cartographers and analysts; the other stays with the driver as a backup. Each orange Tele Atlas mapping van has six cameras, two side-sweeping lasers and a GPS on its roof. But Tele Atlas is constantly updating pre-existing maps to include new roads, traffic signals and buildings.
