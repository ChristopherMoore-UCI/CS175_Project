According to a recent CNN Money report on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, minimum wage jobs are on the decline. They've tied minimum wage to inflation in two states including Oregon, where the rate is approaching $9. An estimated 4.7% of those hourly workers make minimum wage or less, down from 5.2%, a year earlier -- the lowest rate since 2008. Fast food workers striking for higher wages in seven cities Monday are bound to be disappointed. In a major speech last week, President Barack Obama renewed his call to up the current $7.25 minimum wage for wage earners who don't get tips to $9.00 per hour.
