On Sunday, a witness there described especially intense shelling by government forces in the country's third-largest city and speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports of the death of Gadhafi's son. "The disproportional use of force, all the more so, beyond the mandate of U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1973, which in no way stipulates the replacement of the Libyan leadership, is leading to harmful consequences and the death of civilians," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official RIA Novosti news agency. In April 1986, his adopted daughter, Hanna Gadhafi, was killed when U.S. forces launched an airstrike that targeted his residential compound. Gadhafi and his wife were in their son's house when it was targeted, but they are in good health, government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists. The commander of the NATO operation, Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, said NATO was aware of "unconfirmed media reports" that members of Gadhafi's family had been killed in an airstrike.
