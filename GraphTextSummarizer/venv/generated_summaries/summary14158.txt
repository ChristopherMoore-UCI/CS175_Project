But a scheme at The Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University aims to provides business training for U.S. war veterans that will make that transition easier. The EBV has three stages -- an online module where students get up to speed with business fundamentals, an intensive nine-day "bootcamp" at a university, and a year-long mentorship from the EBV and successful local entrepreneurs. Elaine Hagan, executive director of Harold Price Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at UCLA Anderson School of Management, told CNN that veterans possess many of the qualities the school tries to instill in their MBA students, such as leadership, discipline and teamwork. The Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities (EBV) teaches valuable skills that enable veterans to become self-employed and make their business ideas viable. Since then the EBV Consortium of Schools has been launched and UCLA Anderson, Florida State University's College of Business, Mays Business School at Texas A&M University and Purdue University all run the EBV program developed by Syracuse.
