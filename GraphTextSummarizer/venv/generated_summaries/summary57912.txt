South African farms export fresh fruit and vegetables to Europe, so do not worry about getting sick from dirty germs that plague some travelers in developing countries. South African mielies are sweet and crunchy, so look out for them at a braai or when you go food shopping. That said, except for Cape Town and the surrounding areas in the winelands which have sophisticated restaurant scene, most South African food is simple and not fancy. You should be able to find at least one of these eateries in most South African towns. Of course, the food is washed down with copious amounts of South African beer.
