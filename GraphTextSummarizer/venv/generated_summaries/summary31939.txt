In September 2009, when Obama delivered a major speech on health care to a joint session, Louisiana Republican Rep Charles Boustany, a heart surgeon, was picked to present the GOP health care plan. In the past GOP leaders have chosen rising political stars in their party including Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana to respond to the president's speech. In January Republicans tapped House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to give the official GOP response to the president's State of the Union speech. "Republicans are, and have been, entirely focused on job creation," said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, on Tuesday. -- The Republican Party will not provide a formal response to President Barack Obama's speech on jobs, a senior GOP aide said Tuesday.
