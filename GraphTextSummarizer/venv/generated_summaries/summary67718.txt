Future first lady Michelle Obama hugs one of her favorite designers, Maria Pinto. " Many speculate Pinto is designing Obama's inaugural gown, a big honor because inaugural dresses are put on permanent display in the Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection. Whatever dress Obama chooses to wear, many hope she won't suffer the same fashion embarrassment that first lady Laura Bush almost faced at a White House event in December 2007. As she coupled chic designer splurges with off-the-rack goodies from J. Crew, H&M, White House/Black Market and Target, fashion spectators say her ability to make a strong statement on a budget sends an important message during tough economic times. Especially working women and mothers don't have a lot of time to pay attention to how they're wardrobing themselves ... but there's a certain amount of time we need to give ourselves as women, because it's an expression of who we are.
