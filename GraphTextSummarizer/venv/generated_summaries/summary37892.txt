-- Three Japanese lawmakers were denied entry at a South Korean airport Monday after they announced they would attempt a visit to an island near disputed territory in what Korea calls the East Sea and Japan calls the Sea of Japan. Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul said all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945. The islets in the sea to the east of Korea, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, have been a prickly issue for both countries. The trio is expected to return to Japan on a later flight, but details were not yet available, the Ministry of Justice said. Korean Air had conducted a test flight over the islets twice to celebrate the launching of its new aircraft in June.
