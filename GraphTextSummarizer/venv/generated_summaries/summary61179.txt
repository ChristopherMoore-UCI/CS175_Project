This comes as government troops have been battling pro-reform protesters across the country over the past month and a half, and clashes between security forces and protesters have intensified on Friday after weekly Muslim prayers. The White House press secretary Friday condemned the Syrian government's use of violence and mass arrests and saluted "the courage of Syrian protesters for insisting on their right to express themselves and we regret the loss of life on all sides." A human rights activist told CNN at least 21 civilians died in two Syrian cities when security forces opened fire on civilians Friday. So many people were arrested that the central stadium in Daraa has been transformed into a makeshift prison by the army and Syrian security forces. Demonstrations broke out across many provinces and cities in Syria, with security forces relying heavily on the army and the regime's guard to disperse demonstrations.
