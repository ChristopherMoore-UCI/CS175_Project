According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, more than 270 products or business names among active federal trademarks use "ISIS." The most common reaction from business owners is option "A," dropping the ISIS reference. But what I really hope happens is that more businesses follow the lead of the California company, ISIS Pharmaceuticals, which is keeping its name. Businesses across the United States are facing this very dilemma because the word "ISIS" is part of their corporate name or product. Over the weekend, the show's creator, Adam Reed, announced that the series would no longer use "ISIS" as the acronym for the spy agency "International Secret Intelligence Service," which employs the show's main characters.
