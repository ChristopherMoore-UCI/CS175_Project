The royal couple has had a busy year since their marriage almost one year ago. Looking at ease, Prince William gazed adoringly at three-week-old Hugo Eric Scott as he spoke to his father, Sgt Paul 'Vic' Vicary, a serviceman who had taken part in an expedition to the South Pole. While Kate becomes used to life as a member of the royal family, joining the Queen for special events, Prince William has been kept busy by his RAF commitments. After meeting the royal couple, Hugo's father said the second-in-line to the throne seemed like a natural and joked that he might call on Prince William if he ever needs a babysitter. Vicary's wife Hanna asked the Duke if he would like to hold the baby and William happily obliged, calmly cradling the newborn dressed in a 'superbaby' outfit.
