Most recently, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported that a journalist for Newsweek magazine who was arrested in Tehran confessed to doing the bidding of Western governments, though CNN could not verify the report. Because international journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran, CNN has not been able to confirm the news report. Fars reported that the Canadian-Iranian reporter, who had worked for the BBC and England's Channel 4 network, admitted having filed false reports for Newsweek during the elections. News from Internet users has been important as Iran's government began kicking out some reporters from traditional media outlets, arresting others and restricting the movements of those who remained. Iran's judicial chief reportedly has ordered the prosecution of people who "collaborate" with satellite TV networks.
