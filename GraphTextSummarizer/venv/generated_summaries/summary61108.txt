-- To robust applause from the gathered faithful, Pope Francis called Sunday for a day of prayer and fasting over the violence in Syria. While Francis did not mention any of those efforts specifically, he called on the "international community to make every effort to promote clear proposals for peace in that country without further delay, a peace based on dialogue and negotiation. In recent days the United States, Britain and France have had high profile debates about the merits of military intervention in Syria. Devoting the totality of his weekly remarks in St. Peter's Square to the civil war in Syria, Francis invited "all men of good will" to join with Catholics on September 7 to take part in the prayer and fast. "Never has the use of violence brought peace in its wake."
