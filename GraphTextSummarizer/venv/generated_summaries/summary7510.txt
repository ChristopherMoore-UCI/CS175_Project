-- An Oklahoma death row inmate received a drug commonly used to euthanize animals Thursday because of a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental, the drug usually used as the sedative in its three-drug execution cocktail. John David Duty was convicted and sentenced to die for strangling his 22-year-old cellmate, Curtis Wise, with shoe laces in 2001. But an Oklahoma judge disagreed and last month approved its use in place of sodium thiopental. The sedative is the first drug in Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. Pentobarbital is used in a similar manner for animal euthanizations.
