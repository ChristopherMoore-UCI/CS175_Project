The Scottish government has sent 160,000 liters (42,000 gallons) of bottled water to Northern Ireland after supplies ran out. The Irish government said Thursday night most parts of the  country would see a resumption of normal water supply within the next two days,  but in the capital, Dublin, restrictions were expected to remain in place until January 10. Emergency supplies were being made available at locations across the province, including recreation centers where those without running water were being offered free showers. -- Someone must be held responsible for a "shambolic" response to a water crisis that has left thousands without running water, one of Northern Ireland's top politicians said Thursday. Speaking after an emergency meeting of power-sharing ministers in Belfast, First Minister Peter Robinson said the government water company's efforts to restore water supplies to tens of thousands of homes was "shambolic" and "ineffective."
