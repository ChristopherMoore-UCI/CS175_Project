Investigators believe Amanda Bennett, 30, shot her three children -- 14-year-old Jasmine Abbott, 9-year-old Katelynn Bennett and 4-year-old Ryan Bennett --  in their Austin, Indiana, home, set a small fire in the house and then turned the gun on herself. Goodin told CNN that authorities examined online content as part of their investigation, including a posting purportedly from Amanda Bennett that blamed her husband. Services were held at First Christian Church in nearby Scottsburg, Charlotte Bennett, the grandmother of two of the children, told CNN. A divorce petition filed two weeks before the deaths, obtained by CNN affiliate WAVE, said the two had been separated since October. Charlotte Bennett said she spoke with Amanda several hours before the bodies were found.
