The reference was to the day last year when John McCain announced that Palin, a 44-year-old mother of five who became Alaska's governor only in December 2006, would be his presidential running mate. By the following July, Palin's approval numbers had sunk to the mid-50th percentile, the coalition on which she governed had collapsed, and most of her time was spent combating a hostile media and frivolous ethics complaints. "Everything changed on August 29 in politics in Alaska," Sarah Palin told NBC's Andrea Mitchell this week. McCain's surprise pick altered the trajectory of the 2008 campaign -- for a few weeks, at least -- and launched Palin, until then an unknown political neophyte, on the path to global celebrity. The same McCain aides who championed Palin for vice president later turned on her and leaked damaging (and false) information to a press eager for any tidbit confirming its view that the governor was unqualified and reckless.
