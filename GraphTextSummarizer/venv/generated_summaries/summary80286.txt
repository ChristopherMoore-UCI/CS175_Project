It made me think about the interior lives of black men -- about how little anyone knows how black men feel when they're in agony or depression. There are even fewer examples of black men seeking help. The question is: Can we as a society become more sensitive to black men who need help? Even though suicide is the third leading cause of death for black males ages 10 to 24, I had no immediate image, no ready reference for a young black man hurting so badly he wanted to die or for a black man so sick he was driven to kill. Black man in pain is a story rarely told.
