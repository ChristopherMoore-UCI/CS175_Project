Dejan Stankovic celebrates scoring Inter's second goal in the superb 2-1 victory over city rivals AC Milan. Inter extended their lead at the top of Serie A to nine points after beating AC Milan 2-1 in a thrilling San Siro derby on Sunday, dealing a fatal blow to their city rivals' Serie A title hopes in the process. The longer the game went on, Pato began to have more influence, and the teenager nearly levelled for Milan in the 78th minute Ronaldinho produced some Brazilian magic to lay a delightful ball through for Marek Jankulovski on the left -- and the Czech layed a simple pass square for Alexander Pato to find the corner of the net. The visitors took a 10th minute lead when Giampaolo Pazzini was left unmarked to score from a pass from Antonio Cassano.
