The senselessness of the killing caused outrage in Australia and the U.S., with former Australian deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer calling for a boycott on travel to the U.S. in response, and President Barack Obama expressing his condolences to Lane's family. The autopsy report, released Tuesday, showed Lane, a student at Oklahoma's East Central University, was killed by a single bullet that hit his back, penetrated both lungs, his aorta and pulmonary artery, and fractured two ribs. She had attended a tribute game Sunday with Lane's family and friends at Melbourne's Essendon Baseball Club, where Lane had been a member. Hundreds of mourners packed Melbourne's St Therese's Church Wednesday for the funeral of Christopher Lane, who was studying in the United States on a baseball scholarship when he was allegedly gunned down at random on August 16. Opinion: When racial cliches drive murder stories Lane's American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, was among the mourners at the funeral, having accompanied his body home to Australia on Saturday.
