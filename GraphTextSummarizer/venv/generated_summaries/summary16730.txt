So, Pope Francis, with Valentine's Day upon us, please instruct the Vatican bureaucrats to elevate more witnesses, flesh-and-blood saintly icons of married love from centuries past! Or, they may note that Catholicism considers all those in heaven to be saints (regardless of whether they have been formally canonized), or point out that married couples were surely among martyrs the church remembers in groups like the 120 martyr saints of China, or the 124 Korean martyrs). In fact, if an exemplary life of heroic virtue is the criterion, married couple saints must surely abound. Mary and Joseph, the parents of Jesus, attained sanctity as a couple; so did Mary's parents, John the Baptist's parents, and a handful of other couples. A change could not be timelier: Pope Francis has launched the Synod on the Family, a yearlong reflection on the joys and struggles of married couples and their loved ones.
