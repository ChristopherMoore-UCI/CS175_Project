-- Adly Mansour, Egypt's interim president, is reviewing a proposed protest law approved by the Cabinet that has drawn the ire of human rights groups and political factions. Tamarod, the grass-roots political faction responsible for organizing the petition campaign that led to the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy in July by the Egyptian military, reacted to the draft law on Facebook: "Any law that limits the right of peaceful demonstration which Egyptians won in the January 25th and June 30th revolutions is an unjust law. The April 6th movement, an influential political force deeply involved in Egypt's 2011 revolution, equated the draft law with Hosni Mubarak-era repressions, calling it "one of the worst repressive laws constraining freedoms in Third World countries and military dictatorships." Dealing with non-peaceful protest must be done without a law that is used to restrict or narrow peaceful protests." "The protest law is dangerous and sensitive and should be preceded by a community dialogue or at least dialogue with political forces.
