Just last Sunday, power went out during a professional hockey game at Joe Louis Arena. The mayor said there had been no spike in police or fire calls while power was out. "We are back at full power at Joe Louis Arena," he said. Speaking at a press conference, Duggan said power had been restored to about one third of the customers by 2 p.m. ET and that power probably will be restored to all by the end of the day. The city website said 740 traffic signals were knocked out, but power was not lost for the 911 system.
