" "They're interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well," he said during a discussion of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb. -- George Steinbrenner was a "cracker who made a lot of African-American millionaires," conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said Tuesday of the New York Yankees owner who died earlier in the day from a heart attack. Limbaugh has frequently lambasted celebratory dances performed by National Football League players after scoring touchdowns ("a cultural problem ... that has resulted in a total lack of class") and assailed the game itself for its aggressive nature. " "For the last 20 years I have known George Steinbrenner, and we have quarrelled over diversity and community programs, but I always found him fair, direct, and genuinely prone to do what he felt was right," Sharpton said, adding that Limbaugh owed the Steinbrenner family an apology "that the first day of their mourning to have to be subjected to this type of rhetoric. " Premiere Radio Networks, which broadcast Limbaugh's show, has not responded to requests for comment.
