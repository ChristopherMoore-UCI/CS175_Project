In recent years, social games have become increasingly prevalent on mobile devices, providing entertainment, yes, but also a way to maintain contact with family and friends. She said she hopes more social games will embrace the Voice Over program so she can enjoy them with her family and friends. Fisher said "Hanging With Friends" specifically works with Voice Over and lets her "see" what's going on and chat with her family and friends who are playing. Fisher said there are other games that are Voice Over compatible, but they don't allow for the social interaction that "Hanging With Friends" does. " 'Hanging With Friends' really wasn't my type of game until I started playing it," she said.
