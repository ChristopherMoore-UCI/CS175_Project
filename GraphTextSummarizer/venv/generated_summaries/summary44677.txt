-- Nearly a month after false rumors on Twitter about school attacks caused car crashes when parents panicked on the streets of Veracruz, Mexico, state lawmakers there approved new regulations Tuesday making disturbing the peace a crime. A lawyer representing suspects Maria de la Luz Bravo Pagola and Gilberto Martinez Vera said his clients would not use the new provision in Veracruz state's penal code to defend themselves. State laws allow for a punishment of up to 30 years in prison for those convicted of terrorism. Authorities say two suspects are behind false statements on Twitter and Facebook that fueled a chaotic scene in the Mexican port city of Veracruz last month. The new law could mean that imprisoned suspects previously accused of "terrorism" for their online posts could face significantly less time behind bars.
