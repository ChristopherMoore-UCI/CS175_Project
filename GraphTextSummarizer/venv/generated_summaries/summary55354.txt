"The killings may amount to extrajudicial executions under human rights law as well as willful killings under international humanitarian law, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Friday. "Our office has repeatedly raised its concerns about the excessive use of force by Israeli security forces and the lack of accountability for such incident," the statement said. "During that demonstration that was extremely violent, the Israeli Defense Force used crowd-control methods and riot-dispersal means to prevent and control the overflow of the violence," Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. Two Palestinian teens killed in the West Bank presented no direct threat when they were shot last week, the United Nations said Friday in a preliminary report. "We also urge Israel to make public the findings of this investigation and any steps regarding accountability that are taken."
