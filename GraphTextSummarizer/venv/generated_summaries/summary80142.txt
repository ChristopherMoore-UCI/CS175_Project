The government bases that assumption on the fact that Italy paid for David to be moved from its original spot, in central Florence's Palazzo Vecchio, to L'Accademia, according to Renzi's press officer. It's mainly about the bottom line -- some 8 million euros a year in ticket sales at Florence's La Galleria dell'Accademia, also simply known as L'Accademia or the Accademia Gallery, where David is displayed. Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi recently asked that David's earnings go to Florence instead, because "after all, the David is ours,"' said one of his press officers. He said he would work with Florence representatives in such a manner, with a goal of avoiding controversy. Renzi told the Florence daily newspaper Il Corriere Fiorentino "with all due respect to the Roman lawyers, the incontestable documents held in possession by the state administration are clear: the David belongs to the city of Florence."
