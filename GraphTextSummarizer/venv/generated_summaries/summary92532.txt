With the announcement of Helman's termination, VA Secretary Robert McDonald said in a statement "lack of oversight and misconduct by VA leaders runs counter to our mission of serving Veterans, and VA will not tolerate it." At a congressional hearing in September, the VA inspector general Richard Griffin said long wait times at the Phoenix VA, some of which were hidden from VA headquarters, contributed to patient deaths.

Sharon Helman was in charge of the Phoenix VA Health Care System and the facility at the center of the VA scandal; she was put on administrative leave following a CNN interview in April, in which she denied the existence of a secret list used to cover up delays in patient care. "Sharon Helman's removal is a positive step, but there are still many more VA scandal figures who also must be purged from the department's payroll in order for veterans and families to receive the closure they deserve," Miller said.
