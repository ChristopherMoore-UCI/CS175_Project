Incidents such as the bin Laden raid and continued U.S. drone strikes within Pakistan's borders have also raised questions of U.S. violations of Pakistani sovereignty. New questions are being raised about strained ties between the United States and Pakistan in the wake of a Pakistani commission's recommendation of treason charges this week against a Pakistani doctor who helped U.S. intelligence officials track bin Laden to a compound in Abbottabad. Some analysts, however, draw parallels between Pakistan's possible decision to prosecute Afridi for treason and an earlier U.S. decision to prosecute former U.S. Navy intelligence official Jonathan Pollard on the same charge. The vaccination campaign, a senior U.S. official told CNN, occurred shortly before U.S. forces raided the compound and killed bin Laden on May 2. For their part, U.S. officials have expressed concern over the alleged infiltration of Pakistan's intelligence services by Islamic extremists, as well as growing anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, among other things.
