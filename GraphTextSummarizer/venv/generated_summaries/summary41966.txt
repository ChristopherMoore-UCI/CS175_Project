"The focus is on trying to reacquire the acoustic signal they had 24 hours ago," said Commodore Peter Leavy, who is coordinating military contributions to the search. "There are many steps yet before these detections can be positively verified as being from missing Flight MH370," Angus Houston, the head of the Australian agency coordinating search operations, said Monday. Houston said officials are looking into what other vehicles could be deployed, if needed. Australian officials leading the search said the signals picked up Sunday were consistent with those transmitted by an aircraft's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. The vehicle, also from the United States, is able to generate maps of the bottom of the ocean and "determine if there's something unusual on the seafloor, like aircraft wreckage," said Houston.
