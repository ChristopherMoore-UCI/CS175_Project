Earlier this year, Lynette Rowe's lawyers lodged previously secret Gruenenthal records with an Australian court, revealing that for at least two years before the drug was removed from the market in late 1961, German medical professionals had told the company's staff they believed women who had taken thalidomide during pregnancy, had given birth to children with deformities. In March 1961 the board could have sensibly decided to withdraw thalidomide from the market in light of claims of birth defects and nerve damage to people taking it. Although the settlement was achieved at the expense of the British and Australian successor company to the distributor of thalidomide, Diageo, Gruenenthal was also named in proceedings. We believe the drug had its origins in the Nazi death camps in Poland -- as uncovered by two solicitors working on behalf of survivors of thalidomide. It is also a matter of record that Gruenenthal's board in the 1950s included a prominent and convicted Nazi war criminal, Otto Ambros.
