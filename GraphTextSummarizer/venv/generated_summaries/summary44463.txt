According to Kay Ceille, the managing director at AvisBudget UK, it is partly because times are tough that luxury car rentals have become more popular. Car companies have been toying with flashy cars for a few years now. Yet, while a personal Maserati or Lamborghini is out of reach for all but the most well remunerated, car rental companies are increasingly adding high-end vehicles to their lots to cater to those who want more cachet from their hired wheels. Consumers proved ravenous, spurring Hertz to add more posh models in more locales. Nowadays, high-end status symbols like luxury cars are sought after by those seeking a profile boost.
