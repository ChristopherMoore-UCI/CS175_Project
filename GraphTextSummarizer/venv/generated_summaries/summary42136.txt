To allow health insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions? Health insurance comes out of employee wages, plain and simple. Yet free-market economists from Milton Friedman onward have identified employer-provided care as the original sin of American health care.

For the cause they purport to represent, however, the "Waterloo" threatened by GOP Sen. Jim DeMint last year regarding Obama and health care has finally arrived all right: Only it turns out to be our own.
