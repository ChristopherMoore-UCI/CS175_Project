The region is a stronghold for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party that fought a war with Israel in 2006. Hezbollah officials had no comment Monday. Ammunition stored there caused the blast due to the high temperature and humidity, Lebanese officials said. The explosion took place Tuesday in Khirbet Salim, in what Lebanese authorities said was an uninhabited house. Hezbollah has carried out attacks against civilians, and the United States and Israel list the group as a terrorist organization.
