That hike corresponded to an increase in crude oil prices amid unrest in more than a dozen countries in the Middle East and north Africa, six of which are OPEC members, Lundberg said. The latest spike suggests that the dramatic price increases are slowing down, said publisher Trilby Lundberg. It is too soon to know what impact events in Libya will have on gasoline prices, Lundberg said Sunday. The new jump in prices at the pump comes despite a drop in crude oil prices over the past two weeks. Lundberg described that as "follow-through" from the previous spike in oil prices.
