PGA Tour testing is administered by The National Center for Drug Free Sport every week of the season, with all samples analyzed by WADA-accredited laboratories. Barron, who turned professional in 1992, was a PGA Tour regular for eight seasons, with his best finish a tie for third at the Byron Nelson Classic in 2006. "I would like to apologize for any negative perception of the Tour and its players resulting from my suspension," Barron said in a statement on the PGA Tour official Web site www.pgatour.com. Golf bowed to pressure from WADA to introduce drug testing in the sport last year. Unheralded American Doug Barron has become the first player to be banned by the PGA Tour for taking performance-enhancing drugs.
