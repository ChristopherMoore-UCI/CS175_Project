Valdes said the issue is important because illegal mining has negative consequences such as child slavery, deforestation, drug trafficking and mistreatment of workers. The government blamed the protesters' actions for igniting the clashes that led to the deaths of Carlos Lanci Yumbato, 46; Julio Ticona Medina, 31; and Francisco Areque Jipa, 35. Miners in the country's Madre de Dios region have been demonstrating ahead of the enforcement of several decrees aimed at cracking down on illegal mining. "The government of Peru rejects the acts of violence by the illegal miners in Madre de Dios and asks the regional authorities and the general public to support the work of the police to re-establish order and peace in that jurisdiction," the government said in a statement. The new decrees would impose sentences of as much as 10 years for operating illegal mines.
