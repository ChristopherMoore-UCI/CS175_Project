Shumaker, a longtime Clinton supporter who was with Bill Clinton when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991, added: "As I caution all presidential candidate in New Hampshire, taking New Hampshire for granted is very dangerous. The stated purpose for a meeting of pro-Hillary Clinton Democrats in New York on Friday was simple: Recap the last year and discuss 2014 lessons that will apply in 2016's presidential election. But other than that, very few Democrats are lining up to take on Clinton and that was evident in the fact that many Clinton advisers on Friday looked more towards the general election than they did a Democratic primary. But Clinton supporters were also buoyed on Friday by that fact that the Democratic field has been partially frozen for the last year because of their actions. " Potential Clinton campaign staffers also lined the speakers list and hallways of Friday's event.
