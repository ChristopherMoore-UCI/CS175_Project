-- Professional ballet dancer Michaela DePrince was just three years old when she saw a ballerina for the first time. "I'm still trying to change the way people see black dancers, that we can become delicate dancers, that we can be a ballerina. She remembers being called "the devil's child" and being ill-treated by the orphanage's carers because she had vitiligo -- a skin condition that causes blotches of lightening skin. Graced with talent and strength, DePrince says she has had to work even harder to get accepted into the rarefied world of ballet dancing -- a predominantly white preserve. " DePrince also says she'd like to start an art school in Sierra Leone.
