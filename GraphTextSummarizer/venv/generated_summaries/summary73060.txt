The vast majority of the immigrants detained Tuesday were from Guatemala, and all 410 of them had been handed over to Guatemalan police by Wednesday afternoon, according to Mexico's National Migration Institute. The immigrants who hailed from the Dominican Republic, India, Nepal, China and Japan awaited their fate Wednesday in Tapachula, Chiapas, at the recently renovated 21st Century Migration Station, Mexico's largest immigrant detention center. Experts say the passage of Central American immigrants through Mexico on their way to the United States is hardly a 21st century phenomenon. "One, because Mexico has been trying to make a case that the country is secure, and that they're doing their part on terrorism and on illegal immigration; but also, in part, because Mexico is very concerned about crime on the southern border." That hasn't stopped immigrants from embarking on the journey, despite the dangers. The case drew national attention in Mexico, where the country's interior minister announced he would begin following the "migrant's route" through Mexico on Wednesday.
