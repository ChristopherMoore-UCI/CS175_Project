Church spokesman Tommy Davis said it was Rathbun's physical abuse of other church officials that led to him being removed from his job. Rathbun was once a senior official of the Church of Scientology, reporting directly to church leader David Miscavige. "The thing Mr. Miscavige is known for, and has been from the very beginning, is he cleans house," Davis said. " "He's alleging that when he left in 2004, it was because he witnessed Mr. Miscavige beating somebody up or whatever. Other former members support his accusation, telling stories about Miscavige kicking, punching and choking members of the Sea Organization, a religious order that is the church's international leadership team.
