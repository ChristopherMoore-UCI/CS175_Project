But a couple of days later, the principal got a call from Shannon's father, who convinced her to help Student Hearts for Haiti. But if her kid-run organization wanted to continue, Shannon thought, it should provide a way for kids in the Chicago area to directly help the kids in Haiti. They also settled on a name for their group: Student Hearts for Haiti. By the end of the first day, Student Hearts for Haiti had made $3,200. That amount was doubled when Student Hearts for Haiti got a matching grant, which meant that St. Francis Xavier's effort was enough to build and furnish one classroom in Haiti.
