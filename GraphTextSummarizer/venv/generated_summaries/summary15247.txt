We did five movies together including both Ghostbusters." EW: 'Ghostbusters' co-star Dan Aykroyd, director Ivan Reitman on Harold Ramis' death He also confirmed that script hold ups over the years were partially due to trouble contacting Bill Murray. They eventually started over without a role for Murray, and, Reitman said, they have a draft from Etan Cohen, with some assistance from Dan Aykroyd, that they are happy with. After producing and directing the previous two films and staying with the third project for years, Reitman will produce and help Sony find a new director for the film, which is eyeing an early 2015 shoot in New York. Reitman told Deadline that his decision to step down from the director's post was in part due to the death of Harold Ramis.
