Not only are we all supposed to rejoice that Â£9 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent tarting up part of east London that I have never visited and now have even less reason to go there, we must all celebrate and cry uncontrollably when sports men and women win events that I have never even heard of. I wouldn't have minded if there were real sports in the Olympics -- crazy golf, kite-flying, staring contests to name just three of my favorites -- but many of the events that really took place are just crazy. We'd got the dates wrong, and it's actually taking place next year. Commentators opined on page after page that Britain had entered a new era in which adults were able to discuss the hitherto taboo issue of emotions in public. Where has our natural suspicion of organized fun gone, our disdain for overt displays of emotion, our celebration of hapless failures.
