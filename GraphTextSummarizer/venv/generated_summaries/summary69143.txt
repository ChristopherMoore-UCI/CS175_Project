Bloomberg challenges Obama, Romney to take action on guns He has a point -- gun policy is a back burner debate these days, largely because Democrats who had pushed for tighter gun laws concluded it's bad politics. Because gun issues are not at the forefront of the political debate, the NRA's clout isn't talked about as much as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, when gun policy was a hot topic. "When we're done speaking out, sir, gun owners will have made the difference in key precincts in battleground states," NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the organization's meeting in April. In the wake of the Colorado movie massacre, the NRA issued a statement steering clear of gun politics. But the NRA is still active and not afraid to throw its weight around on topics that even tangentially involve gun policy.
