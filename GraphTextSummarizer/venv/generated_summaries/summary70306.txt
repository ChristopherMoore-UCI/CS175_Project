-- The powerful but compact Hurricane Raymond drifted toward southern Mexico's Pacific coast Monday evening as it dumped heavy rains north of Acapulco, forecasters reported. A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning was posted from Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana, meaning hurricane conditions are possible within two days, and winds of 39 mph or higher are expected within 36 hours. A hurricane warning was posted for about 140 miles of coast, from the city of Lazaro Cardenas to Tecpan de Galeana, about 65 miles north of Acapulco. On the other side of the continent, meanwhile, a tropical depression in the Atlantic Ocean has become Tropical Storm Lorenzo, the hurricane center said Monday. Lorenzo was expected to start fading Wednesday without reaching hurricane strength, forecasters projected.
