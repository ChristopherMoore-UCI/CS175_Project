Crew members aboard a Delta Air Lines flight on October 3 became suspicious of their child passenger and then found that he had no ticket or boarding pass. A 9-year-old boy who hopped a flight from Minnesota to Las Vegas this month was ordered Wednesday to undergo therapy and to live apart from his parents, for now. He's got a behavioral problem' The Transportation Security Administration has said the boy went through security at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although it has not explained how he did so without a boarding pass.
