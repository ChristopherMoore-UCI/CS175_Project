"The Lance story is a sad one, with our emotional connection with that athlete," Oakley chief executive Colin Baden told CNN. Many people who once backed Armstrong, following years of allegations about his potentially being a drug user, have now expressed their anger at his apparent duplicity but Baden said there was no point in recriminations. " Baden said there had been no question of Oakley dropping Armstrong until he was officially stripped of his titles. Texas company SCA Promotions is also seeking the return of $12 million it paid Armstrong, but Baden said Oakley would not be following suit. Premier sports eyewear firm Oakley was one of several companies -- including Nike, Trek and Anheuser-Busch -- to end lucrative deals with the American when he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after refusing to answer charges of systematic drug use.
