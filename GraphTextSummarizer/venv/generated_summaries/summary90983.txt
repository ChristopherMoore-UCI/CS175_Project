Watch Lafave's ex-husband discuss the allegations Â» The teenager told the officers that Lafave discussed "non-work related issues such as family problems, friends, high school, personal life, boyfriend issues and sexual issues in both private one-on-one conversations" with her and in group settings, according to the report. Lafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation. "I can only characterize this as somewhat of a bizarre and unusual violation," said Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons. She was arrested after corrections officers interviewed a 17-year-old girl, who worked at a restaurant where Lafave had been employed since January 2006, according to the violation report from Florida's Corrections Department. Lafave was also required to register as a sex offender and abide by numerous conditions.
