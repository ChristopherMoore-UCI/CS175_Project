In Uganda, homosexual acts were punishable by 14 years to life in prison even before the controversial bill was signed into law. Homosexual acts are already illegal in Uganda, and Museveni had gone back and forth recently about whether he would sign the controversial bill in the face of vocal opposition from the West. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law a bill that toughens penalties against gay people and defines some homosexual acts as crimes punishable by life in prison. At the public signing of the bill Monday, a defiant Museveni declared that he would not allow the West to impose its values on Uganda. On Monday, Museveni rejected the suggestion that the new laws were a step back for Uganda and said he wasn't concerned about the West's perception of his country.
