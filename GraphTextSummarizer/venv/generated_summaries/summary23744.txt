She heard about Awakening Joy after taking Baraz's meditation classes at Spirit Rock. A series of exercises, lectures, and meditations stretched over 10 months, Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people's lives. Those are among the suggestions given in Awakening Joy, a class taught by James Baraz, a meditation instructor and founding teacher of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California. Word of mouth about the course that could make people happier began to spread: The first round of Awakening Joy meetings consisted of about 40 members. "The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being," says Baraz.
