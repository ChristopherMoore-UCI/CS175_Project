A spokesman for the New York Police Department was not aware of the incident and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, referred CNN to the FAA. The FAA has been working to setup new rules and to safely integrate the use of unmanned aircraft into the national air space, and last year opened an "unmanned aircraft systems integration" office. Unmanned aerial systems, sometimes called drones, and other remote-controlled planes could pose a risk to larger passenger aircraft if they collided or were sucked into an engine. The crew of Alitalia Flight 608 approaching John F. Kennedy airport on Monday reported the sighting. " Air traffic controllers warned other planes approaching the JFK runway of the drone report, but at least two other pilots radioed they did not see it.
