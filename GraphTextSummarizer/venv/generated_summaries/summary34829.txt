"Clearly, he is a creature of the Senate," said Ted Kaufman, Biden's former chief of staff who filled in as Delaware senator when his boss became vice president. Given his affinity for the Senate, it must gall Biden that he is among only 12 of 47 vice presidents not to have cast one of the 244 tie breaking votes, according to Senate historians. But White House insiders say Obama values Biden's loyalty and owes him one for steadying the re-election campaign after his own first disastrous debate with Mitt Romney. "The United States Senate has been my life â€” and that is not hyperbole," Biden said in his farewell address, summing up a career of melodramatic confirmation hearings, personal tragedy, health scares and failed presidential campaigns. Vice presidential scholar Joel Goldstein said Biden's influence can be measured in how often Obama reaches into his inner circle for staffers, notably Tom Donilon, Jay Carney and new Ebola czar Ron Klain.
