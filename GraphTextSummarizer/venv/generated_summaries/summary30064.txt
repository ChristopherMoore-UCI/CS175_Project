The illness was instead confirmed to be an influenza infection, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said and not a case of novel coronavirus -- which belongs to the same family of viruses that caused the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). It said it was investigating the possibility of transmission from animals but, unlike SARS, there is no evidence yet that the novel coronavirus has been transmitted from person to person. The outbreak of SARS, which killed 299 people in Hong Kong and 800 worldwide, also dealt a severe economic blow, emptying the normally bustling city's shopping malls, restaurants and schools. A Hong Kong University researcher, Yuen Kwok-yung said last month that the new virus is closely related to two bat viruses found a few years ago in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post. The boy arrived in Hong Kong from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with his father on October 3 and was admitted to the emergency room of Ruttonjee Hospital on Sunday with a fever, cough and vomiting.
