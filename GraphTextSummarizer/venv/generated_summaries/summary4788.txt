"Also in the incident are a number of empty hazardous materials cars." One freight train rear-ended another Friday afternoon, sending debris into a passing third train, authorities in Porter County, Indiana, said. A second train, with two engines and 60 cars, hit it from behind, LaFlower told CNN. Two crew members on the train that struck the back of the other suffered non-life threatening injuries, officials told CNN. Firefighters put out flames among the jumble of derailed cars.
