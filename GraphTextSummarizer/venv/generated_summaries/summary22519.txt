When Transportation Security Administration screeners found the device, they  were examining the bag because it was to be placed on a connecting flight. Officials gave conflicting accounts of the man's travel arrangements, with one early report saying he arrived from Brazil, while later reports said the bag originated in Saudi Arabia, and traveled via London, England to Miami, Florida and that its final destination was Dominica via San Juan, Puerto Rico. Investigators said the container is used to transport dead bacteria  samples. -- Miami International Airport was shut down for several hours Friday after screeners spotted a canister inside the luggage of a scientist that eventually turned out to be "a legitimate experiment." Airport roads were also closed "to ensure public safety," the statement said.
