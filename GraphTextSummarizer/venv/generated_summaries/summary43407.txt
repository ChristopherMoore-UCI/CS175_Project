Like today's soldiers recovering from injuries, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or haunted by images of fallen friends, he soon learned after returning home that he couldn't explain war to a civilian. Mostly, they were about men who simply wanted to do their job and go home, but found themselves subject to the deadly coin toss of war. He was lucky in war. This was the case with my father, who saw lots of action as an artilleryman in the Philippines during World War II. The problem for families trying to understand those experiences, on Veterans Day and every day, is that they won't hear much about them.
