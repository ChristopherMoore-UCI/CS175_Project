The United States has implemented three entirely different approaches in Egypt, Libya and Syria. The debate over a military strike in Syria cannot be a knee jerk reaction to the president's failed "new beginning" with the Arab worldâ€”including failures of diplomacy in Libya and Egypt. Rather, a strike on Syria must consider the greater strategic implications of military action and should be about one thing: the best strategic interests of the United States. Some say that projecting strength and showing a willingness to act against leaders who commit abuses are important enough reasons to strike Syria. There is no question that the horrific atrocities perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria are nothing short of appalling and deserve international condemnation.
