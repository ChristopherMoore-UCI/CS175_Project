The reason they feel disconnected, according to women in both North Carolina and Louisiana, is that the people who represent them in Washington are of little concern to them because those politicians could never fathom their daily struggle. Upwards of $80 million has been spent in the race between Thom Tillis and Kay Hagan in North Carolina. "Probably the night before," said another North Carolina woman, on when she looks up information on candidates. "Once they go home to the farm, it isn't a dirty farm," she said of when lawmakers leave North Carolina and go to Washington. In North Carolina, most of the mothers recalled very little about Hagan or Tillis.
