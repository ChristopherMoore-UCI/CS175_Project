The Microsoft announcement serves as a counter, allowing the same kind of back-and-forth for the larger number of users who are already familiar with Office, considered by many the gold standard of productivity software. "When we launched Office 365 earlier this year, we committed to delivering regular updates and new capabilities to Office 365 subscribers," Julia White, general manager of Microsoft's Office division, said in a blog post. "Office Mobile for iPhone is another great example of the value of subscribing to Office 365." The company said users can work with documents on their phones, and the updates will be transferred to those documents on PC versions. The feature is available free in Apple's App Store for subscribers to Office 365, the cloud-based version of Office's business-like tools for home users.
