The mailer could have an impact on the crucial Senate election in Alaska next week, where Republican Dan Sullivan is looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, especially in a midterm elections when voter turnout slumps. Liberal groups like MoveOn, the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and America Votes have also pressured voters with voting records. The mailer came from the conservative Opportunity Alliance PAC, which is using public voter rolls to shame or peer pressure voters into casting a vote this election, the Alaska Dispatch News reported Monday. Voters in Alaska received a letter this weekend from the "Alaska State Voter Program," which told the recipient whether 11 of their friends and acquaintances had voted in the last three elections and asked a bold question: "WHAT IF YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS, AND YOUR COMMUNITY KNEW WHETHER YOU VOTED?" Despite the official-looking letterhead, the "Alaska State Voter Program" isn't a government initiative. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group backed by the Koch brothers, sent voters in Virginia a "report card" last year that judged their turnout history at the ballot box-- and their next-door neighbor's.
