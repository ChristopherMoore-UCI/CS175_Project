Alamuddin's profile on the site The Legal 500 says she "specialises in international law, human rights, criminal law and extradition." The Doughty Street law firm is clearly excited about the news and released a statement that began, "The barristers and staff of Doughty Street Chambers offer their best wishes and congratulations to Ms Amal Alamuddin, a member of Chambers, and Mr George Clooney on their engagement to be married. Some of her clients have included the Royal Court of Bahrain and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Clooney, who was married from 1989 until 1993 to "No Strings Attached" actress Talia Balsam, has long been outspoken about the fact that he has had no desire to wed again. In a recent Esquire interview, Clooney said, "I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever," about becoming a husband and father.
