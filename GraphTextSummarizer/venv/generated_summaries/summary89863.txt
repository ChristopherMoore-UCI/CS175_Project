Whether the rise of HTML5 will lead mobile users to start spending more time with their browsers than native apps remains to be seen -- but for many mobile users, and for many apps, that distinction may start to become irrelevant. But the mobile Web, mobile browsers, and the nature of mobile apps are changing fast. This company sells mobile application analytics and an advertising platform that can be incorporated into mobile apps. That's a powerful financial incentive for app developers, digital publishers, and online services to start deploying more Web apps. Now mobile users now spend an average of 94 minutes per day using apps, but just 72 minutes browsing the mobile Web, according to Flurry's report, which was released earlier this month on the company's blog.
