-- Seventy-two police officers were killed in an attack early Tuesday by suspected Maoists in eastern India, authorities said. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, conceded last year that the nation's fight with the Maoists had fallen short of objectives. Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among youth and the intelligentsia, officials suspect. "We have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace," Singh said last September. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call "class enemies," the rebels are also believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.
