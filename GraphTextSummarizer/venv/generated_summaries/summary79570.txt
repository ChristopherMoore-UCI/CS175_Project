For instance, a search for "movies" yields Roger Ebert, Judd Apatow, Jon Favreau and the iTunes Trailer account under the "People results for movies" sidebar. In the movies example, further results include Tom Hanks, Disney-Pixar and Kevin Smith. Now, when you search for a given topic on the microblogging site, you'll get suggestions of people and accounts that tweet about that topic. You can get further suggestions by clicking on the "People" tab on the left-hand side search results where you can also browse recent tweets about the queried topic. Previously, people results used a far simpler algorithm, showing people and accounts to follow based on keywords, the company said in a blog post.
