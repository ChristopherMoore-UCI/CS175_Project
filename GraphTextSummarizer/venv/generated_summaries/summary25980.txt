-- Britain's Andy Murray gained revenge for his Wimbledon singles defeat to Roger Federer by demolishing the world No. 1 to claim Olympic gold for Team GB. Federer said: "He was better, much better than I was today but I'm happy with silver. But he seized his opportunity to avenge his painful defeat at the same venue less than a month ago with some blistering ground stokes to take Britain's first Olympic singles gold since Josiah Ritchie in 1908. Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro took the silver medal, beating Novak Djokovic 7-5 6-4, after he was defeated by Federer in the semifinal. It was the first time ever the 25-year-old had beaten Federer in a best of five set match and marked his first major tennis title, albeit outside the four major championships.
