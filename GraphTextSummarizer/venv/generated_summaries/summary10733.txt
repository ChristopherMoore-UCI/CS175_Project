"It's like they're trying to literally bury this place before the Games," said Frisch, a recent graduate of Columbia University in the United States, with a major in history and Chinese language. -- Walking through a maze of narrow streets south of Tiananmen Square, Nick Frisch appeared unfazed by the sight of drastic changes -- traditional courtyard houses that once lined up these hutongs, or alleys, now in different stages of being knocked down. Since then, Frisch has discovered other shelters linked to the network -- many of them turned to cheap hostels -- on busy streets. "It's more than just propaganda posters down there -- it really is a parallel universe, with street signs stenciled on the wall," Frisch said. "I sometimes wish I was born earlier to witness the Cold War unfold -- and the tunnels have given me a unique vantage point to look into that period of history," Frisch said.
