"We think that's crazy." Instead of a Facebook-like standalone network, Google+ works to make all of the Google universe social, he said That didn't stop him taking a thinly veiled jab at Facebook when asked about allowing developers to create third-party content on Google+ (Think FarmVille, Spotify or Pinterest). But when pressed by Kawasaki for a definition, he said that's people who log in to Google+, then use one of Google's many other products within a month. Gundotra, a senior vice-president for engineering at Google, also used his "fireside chat" with tech writer and Alltop.com co-founder Guy Kawasaki to defend the success of Google+.

But all of that data, from tools like Gmail, Google search, YouTube and Android mobile devices, is now compiled into a single profile of each user's habits.
