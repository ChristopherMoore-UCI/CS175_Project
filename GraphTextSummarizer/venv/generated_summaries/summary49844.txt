In a statement Sunday, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar noted that a memorial in King's honor is under construction on the National Mall in Washington. -- Events are scheduled around the United States to commemorate civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as the nation marks the 25th anniversary of a holiday in his honor. "I encourage every American to observe this holiday in honor of Dr. King's selfless legacy by volunteering in their own communities and by dedicating time each day to bettering the lives of those around us." The Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network said it planned to mark the day with a breakfast in Washington and a public policy forum in New York. King's son, Martin Luther King III, is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at a memorial service at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church.
