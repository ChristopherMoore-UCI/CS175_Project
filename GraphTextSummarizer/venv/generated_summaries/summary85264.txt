New Zealand rugby player Dan Carter is on course to be the country's top points scorer. Having been courted by numerous British club sides for years, he's now taking the opportunity to play on pastures new, but with French club Perpignan. He's set to earn an estimated $50,000 per game, which in a sport that lags far behind football or American sports in terms of finance is big money. It led his opposite number, English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, who won the World Cup with England in 2003, to call Carter the most complete player in that position, combining great natural talent with an excellent work ethic. -- When opposition rugby teams line up against the New Zealand All Blacks, there's a common game plan: Get Carter.
