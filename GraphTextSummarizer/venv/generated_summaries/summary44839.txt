-- Israel's prime minister on Saturday gave security forces the OK to use "all measures" at their disposal to find and free three teenagers believed kidnapped in an area of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. To that point, Netanyahu said he's asked the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas "to do everything to help bring them back in peace." Netanyahu said he's given security force leaders orders to locate the teenagers and prevent them from being moved to Gaza or any other place. "(They were) kidnapped by a terror organization, there is no doubt about that," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a nationally televised address Saturday. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported at least 12 people had been arrested in West Bank. The highly contentious issue of Israeli construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for a future state, has hurt peace efforts.
