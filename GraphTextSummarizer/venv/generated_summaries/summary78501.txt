Starting Wednesday, workers moved it 55 feet from temporary piers to permanent refurbished piers. On Thursday, workers in Indiana and Kentucky finished sliding a new nearly half-mile-long, 30 million-pound bridge from one set of piers to another, making it the "longest bridge in North America -- and perhaps the world" -- to slide laterally into place, according to the Indiana Department of Transportation. Then, they pulled the bridge from the temporary piers to the refurbished piers with steel cables and eight computer-controlled hydraulic jacks. Here's how they did it: Workers placed polished steel sliding plates on top of the refurbished piers. A report released last year by Transportation for America labeled the bridge "structurally deficient."
