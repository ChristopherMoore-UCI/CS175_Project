If burying power lines prevented power outages during the hotter summers ahead, the decision could save many lives. The industry rule of thumb is that it costs about 10 times as much to bury wire as to string wire overhead: up to $1 million per mile, industry representatives claim. There's reason to think that industry estimates of the cost of burying wires are inflated. As the climate warms, storms and power outages are becoming more common. The sweltering heat wave that roasted the eastern United States was accompanied by terrible storms that have knocked out power lines up and down the seaboard.
