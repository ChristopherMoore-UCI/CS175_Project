Carsten Lueb of NTV said some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. The numbers are disputed by police, who say the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 and at no time was it filled to capacity. -- A 25-year-old woman who was injured in last week's stampede at the Love Parade music festival in Duisburg, Germany, died Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 21, prosecutors there said. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people they opened an additional event site. The deadly crush happened Saturday in an underpass between the main event site and an expansion area.
