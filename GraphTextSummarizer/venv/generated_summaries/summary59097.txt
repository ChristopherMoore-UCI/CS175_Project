The shooting shook many around the college town like Sam Malchar, who called his classmate and teammate Lane "a charming guy, genuinely good person, with great character and ... a love for life." As the teenagers sped away, Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told CNN affiliate KSWO that "there were some people that saw (Lane) stagger across the road, go to a kneeling position and collapse on the side of the road." Police say the teenagers shot Lane -- who was attending East Central University on a baseball scholarship -- last August as he was jogging in Duncan, a town of about 23,000 people located some 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Former Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer characterized the slaying as "another example of murder mayhem on Main Street." Among those in attendance was Sarah Harper, the girlfriend of the victim, Christopher Lane.
