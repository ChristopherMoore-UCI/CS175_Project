In North Carolina, wild boar may be hunted year round during normal hunting hours. Jett Webb killed the massive animal last month in eastern North Carolina. "They can't believe something that big is running around the woods of eastern North Carolina." Webb, a firefighter in Conetoe, said the gigantic pig provided so much meat that it filled up his deep freezer. Michael Mansell, president of the hunting club, told North Carolina Sportsman magazine that he was there when the giant porker was weighed. Wild boar are not native to the United States -- they may have come with Christopher Columbus -- and didn't appear in North Carolina until 1912, the state's Department of Wildlife website says.
