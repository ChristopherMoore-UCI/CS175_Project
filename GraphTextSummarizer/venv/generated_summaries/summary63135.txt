During previous parliamentary elections, Khan's party failed to win any seats; many within the country have referred to him as a man who changes positions. Standing with him amid party banners and Pakistani flags were career politicians who recently switched to Khan's party. -- Thousands of supporters rallied Sunday behind cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan, who said he wanted to root out corruption and ensure rich and poor alike prosper in Pakistan. Speaking in cricket terms, Khan said, "One more wicket fell today -- as Pakistan People's Party member Sardar Assef Ahmed has joined the PTI." Khan, who led the country's cricket team to the 1992 World Cup trophy, founded the Movement for Justice party in 1996 and served in parliament from 2002 to 2007.
