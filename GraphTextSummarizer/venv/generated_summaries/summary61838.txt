Republican U.S. Rep Bill Cassidy is running against Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. The debate over Keystone has become a central issue in the Louisiana Senate runoff election, which is scheduled for Dec. 6. Landrieu has also been pushing for approval of the pipeline, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure Tuesday. Landrieu, meanwhile, has insisted that the Senate has at least 60 votes to approve the pipeline -- and is taking credit for the legislation's sudden movement. Senate Democrats who had previously ignored the bill are now moving toward giving it a vote in the lame duck session, knowing that Republicans are likely to force the issue after their newly-elected majority is sworn into office in January.
