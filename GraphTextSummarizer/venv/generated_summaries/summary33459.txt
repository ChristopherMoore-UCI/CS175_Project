Mombasa, the second-largest city and a major tourist spot for the East African nation, is one of various cities targeted by a series of grenade attacks in recent months. Kenyan forces invaded southern Somalia in October to battle Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, which it blamed for attacks and kidnappings of foreigners in the nation. The terror group has threatened Kenya with retaliatory attacks, saying it considers the forces' incursion an affront to Somalia's sovereignty. The embassy has issued other warnings of potential attacks in the country since Kenya sent its troops to Somalia. Since the invasion, Kenya has been targeted by a series of grenade attacks blamed on the terror group or its supporters.
