And the Air Force has combat controllers: a lesser known special ops ground force sometimes referred to as "ground pounders." Maj. Charlie Hodges, who served with CCTs in Iraq and Afghanistan, spent a few minutes on the phone with CNN Wednesday to offer an inside perspective on these highly trained, elite squads. Let's not forget that at the beginning of the Afghanistan war in 2001, ground controllers teamed up with Northern Alliance fighters to help U.S. pilots target and smash the Taliban. Controllers also have access to special airborne surveillance assets that give them "eyes in the sky" for U.S. ground troops who need to know "what's on the other side of that building," as Hodges put it. The camaraderie you might expect between pilots and combat controllers is strong, Hodges says. These kinds of special forces could be useful on the ground in Iraq, military analysts say, in the event of U.S. airstrikes against Islamic extremists.
