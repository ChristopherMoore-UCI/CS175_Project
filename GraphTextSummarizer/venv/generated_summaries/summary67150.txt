-- Karin Kubacki no longer buys clothing or toys for her 7-year-old son, Max. "We have been frugal people, and we have tried to save as much as we can, and that is one of the reasons why I have been able to stay home with Max," said Chris, who builds wooden toys for his son. Chris concedes he has felt internal pressure to get a job, but the couple agrees that for now, they prefer to avoid that to be able to spend as much time together and have Chris available for Max. Even though neither Karin nor Chris now hold jobs, they are still giving 10 percent of Karin's unemployment check to their church. Karin and Chris Kubacki are cutting back to make her severance and unemployment pay last a year.
