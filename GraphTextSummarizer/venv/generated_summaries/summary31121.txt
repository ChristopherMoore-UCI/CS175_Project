-- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has conceded the London club's bid to win a first English Premier League title since 2004 is over following Sunday's 1-0 defeat at table-topping Manchester City. A second-half goal from Spain midfielder David Silva was enough to send City back above arch-rivals Manchester United at the summit, 12 points ahead of Arsenal in fifth position. The way we played is encouraging, but at the moment we need encouragement and points, and we only got encouragement." Arsenal faced a defensive injury crisis ahead of Sunday's match as injuries to the Andre Santos, Kieran Gibbs, Bacary Sagna and Carl Jenkinson left Wenger without a fit fullback. " Arsenal will look to bounce back from Sunday's loss in Wednesday's trip to Aston Villa, while Manchester City host Stoke. It followed a disastrous start to the season which saw the 13-time English champions hammered 8-2 by United in addition to suffering defeats to Blackburn, Liverpool and north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in their first seven games.
