The transfer of these workers was drawn up on multiple lists, collectively known as "Schindler's List," according to Steven Luckert, curator of permanent exhibitions at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The major significance of this list "goes beyond the inaccuracies" depicted to a certain degree in novels and movies about Schindler, such as the belief that there is only one list, according to Peter Black, senior historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Two lists are at Yad Vashem, a Holocaust memorial in Israel, and one is at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Zimet says. Silber did not know that a list even existed until years later when historians began talking with Schindler survivors while researching for books and movies.
