In Israel, a desperate Yazidi father Khairy al-Shingari is among the many Yazidis around the world with family members who fled to Mount Sinjar. Jamal Jamir, a 23-year-old university student from Sinjar, told CNN his family fled to the barren and windswept Mount Sinjar more than a week ago after ISIS captured their town. In an exodus of almost biblical proportions, thousands trudge across a river to escape killers belonging to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. While U.S. airstrikes have helped the fight against ISIS in Iraq, the United States has not taken such action over ISIS-controlled areas in Syria. It's unclear what lies ahead for those who managed to escape ISIS and Mount Sinjar.
