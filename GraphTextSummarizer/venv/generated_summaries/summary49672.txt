The restaurant, Per Se, was slammed by health inspectors after racking up 42 violation points during its inspection on February 19, city health department records showed. Keller oversaw the cuisine Sunday night at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, where guests enjoyed chicken pot pie and truffle lasagna, according to a menu that Keller tweeted. Violations listed in the latest health inspection included no hand-washing facility or soap in the food-prep area, hot and cold items held in improper temperatures, and eating or drinking in the food-prep area and tobacco use, all of which qualify as "critical" violations, according to the records. In a statement, Per Se's chef, Thomas Keller, said: "We look forward to the opportunity to address the allegations with the Department of Health in the upcoming Oath Tribunal. Per Se is considered the East Coast interpretation of Keller's French Laundry restaurant in Northern California.
