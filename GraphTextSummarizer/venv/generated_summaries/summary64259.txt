That's how family members and friends have described Eddie Ray Routh, the man on trial for the slayings of Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film "American Sniper," and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a Texas firing range two years ago. Jodi Routh said she had asked Kyle to help, telling him that her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. " The small arsenal of weapons Kyle brought to the range that day was shown to the jury, which included five long rifles and several handguns, including one of Kyle's rifles labeled "American Sniper." According to defense attorneys, Routh, in his psychotic state, thought he was walking into a showdown on the range. Routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history, with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy.
