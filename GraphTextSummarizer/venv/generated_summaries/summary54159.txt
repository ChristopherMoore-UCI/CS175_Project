KGTV in San Diego reported that authorities found Killgore's body based on leads stemming from Lopez's arrest. Luis Ray Perez, 45, was arraigned on a suspicion of murder charge in San Diego County, California, in the death of Brittany Killgore, 22. Investigators on April 17 found Killgore's body in a rural part of neighboring Riverside County. He was charged last week with two felonies unrelated to Killgore's death, receiving stolen property and possession of an assault weapon, and he has pleaded not guilty, authorities said. Authorities last week charged Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, with first-degree murder in connection with Killgore's death.
