-- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said South Sudan President Salva Kiir will meet rebel leader Riek Machar next week for talks. Thousands of people have died in South Sudan because of drought and political violence. "I fear that South Sudan's leaders are locked in a purely personal power struggle, with little or no regard for the appalling suffering that it inflicts on their people," said Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. South Sudan celebrated its independence from Sudan three years ago after an internationally brokered referendum. Machar had indicated a willingness to meet through Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, Kerry said.
