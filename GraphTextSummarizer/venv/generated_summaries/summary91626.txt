-- I have suffered from debilitating panic attacks since 1986. I am proud of that work, but still feel a huge sense of failure every time I let panic attacks get the best of me. In the late '80s and early '90s panic attacks came on to one degree or another almost daily, and of course the deal with myself was violated all too often. If you tune in, you won't see me collapse in a fit of panic. " I remember taking a writing test at CNN in 1989 and having three punishing panic attacks that were so bad I almost got up and walked out of the building.
