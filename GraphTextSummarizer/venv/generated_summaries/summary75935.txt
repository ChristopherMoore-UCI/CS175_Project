-- U.S. government experts trying to construct a model of radiation plumes emanating from Japan's Fukushima Daiichi power plant are being hampered by a "paucity of good data," a senior administration official told CNN. U.S. officials as well as industry officials and critics say radiation from Fukushima Daiichi will not pose a significant health threat to the United States. Officials have been drawing on a variety of sources for information, including both official and personal contacts in Japan, and open-source material, such as public statements from the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power Company web sites. From the first hours of the incident, the president's chief Homeland Security adviser, John Brennan, along with personnel from the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other agencies have been maintaining close contacts "as best we could" with people on the ground in Japan, the official said. U.S. officials also still do not know what caused the fire in Reactor 4 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.
