The 5S has been frequently sold out at various locations, even though Apple reported shipping 9 million iPhone 5S and 5C models in the first weekend alone. First Best Buy rolled out a promotion on Thursday to offer the Apple iPhone 5C for $50, and now RadioShack and Walmart have announced similar price cuts on the new device. Analysts speculated that the 5C would not do as well as the high-end 5S, which costs $199 with a contract and features a fingerprint sensor, better camera and faster processor. On Friday, Walmart â€” which was already selling the phone for $79 â€” slashed its price to $45 through the holiday season, while RadioShack plans to give customers $50 gift cards to apply towards the iPhone 5C phone through Nov. 2. -- A little more than two weeks after it first went on sale for $99, Apple's colorful new iPhone 5c is already on the bargain racks.
