Russia's Foreign Ministry demanded an investigation and criticized Ukraine for its shelling of Ukrainian cities like Donetsk, which are controlled or at least full of pro-Russian separatists. "We have more than 9,000 Russian troops who -- so-called -- lost the way, crossing our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops," Poroshenko told CNN. Rebels captured 16 wounded Ukrainian soldiers after fighting at Donetsk's airport, Kiev's military said, according to Ukrinform. "It is clear that Russia has to stop supporting the separatists and respect international law," said Danish Gen. Knud Bartels -- chairman of the military committee for NATO, which doesn't include Ukraine but is working to further its "military-to-military cooperation" with Kiev. At least seven civilians died after shells slammed into a transit stop Thursday in the volatile eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, the latest notable attack in a months-long conflict that has seen plenty of bloodshed, blame-sharing and intermittent negotiations but few signs of easing.
