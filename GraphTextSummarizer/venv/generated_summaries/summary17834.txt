" NASA said the SLS is set to be "the most powerful rocket in history for deep space missions," with hopes of eventually going to Mars. It acknowledges that NASA metrics indicate the program is on track in terms of design goals, which demonstrate the capability of the system. "Without identifying a range of mission possibilities and their required funding, the program is at risk of making uninformed decisions and pursuing development paths that may not make the most efficient use of limited resources in the near term and could negatively impact longer term affordability," the report states. The GAO reports the space agency's Space Launch System program lacks funding and long term focus. A report by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimates that NASA may need an additional $400 million to meet the December 2017 deadline for launch.
