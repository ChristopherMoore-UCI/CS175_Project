Another film from five years ago that opened on a Tuesday, "Transformers," earned $8.8 million on Monday night sneaks and took in $155.4 million through Sunday night. Comparisons are somewhat difficult given "The Amazing Spider-Man's" unconventional Tuesday release â€” "Spider-Man 3" earned $7.5 million during its Friday midnight debut on the way to a $151 million opening weekend, although that film was not presented in price-jacking 3-D/IMAX, and midnight screenings were less popular five years ago than they are today. Sony's reboot "The Amazing Spider-Man" earned $7.5 million from midnight shows during its U.S. premiere last night â€” $1.2 million of which came from 300 IMAX screens.
