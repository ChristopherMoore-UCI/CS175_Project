Mounds of snow are piled high throughout New York state and New England Albany got at least 12 inches, the weather service said; the storm left another 16 inches in Biddeford, Maine. Residents may have cleared their walkways from West Virginia to Maine Sunday, but slush should freeze overnight in many places, leaving slippery patches. The storm spared major metropolitan areas like Boston and New York City, but some areas in Maine and along the U.S.-Canada border saw significant snow, the weather service said. -- The storm that whipped the Northeast over the weekend with six to 16 inches of snow has blown off to Canada, but more snow is on its way -- maybe just enough to bring out some of that holiday spirit. For those who like the sight, expect it to last a few days, especially in the northernmost regions, as deep freeze temperatures settle in and aren't expected to relent until mid-week.
