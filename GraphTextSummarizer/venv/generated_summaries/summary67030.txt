-- An Indian court in the western state of Gujarat has convicted 31 of the 94 people charged with conspiracy and murder for setting fire to a passenger train in 2002 which triggered widespread religious violence, resulting in the death of more than 1,000 people. The Hindu pilgrims were returning from the north Indian town of Ayodhya where they had been demanding that the government build a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque. A suspected Muslim mob attacked the Sabarmati Express near the town of Godhra on 27 February, 2002, killing more than 50 people, most of whom were Hindu pilgrims. Indian authorities have also imposed restrictions on broadcasting video or photographs of the original carnage on the day of the verdict. The train fire sparked days of rioting in which more than a thousand people, mostly Muslims, were killed.
