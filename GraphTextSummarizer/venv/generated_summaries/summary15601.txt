Last year, a South Korean warship fired on and reportedly damaged a North Korean vessel that was alleged to have crossed the Northern Limit Line, leading Pyongyang to condemn what it called "a grave armed provocation." North Korea has subsequently proposed a different line -- one that would roughly extend the DMZ southwest out into the Yellow Sea, rather than hug the North Korean shoreline. For North Korean fishermen especially, the blue crab season between June and September is an important source of income. That put five islands close to the coast under South Korean control. The island of Yeonpyeong, the target of a North Korean artillery barrage this week that killed four people, is in the same area.
