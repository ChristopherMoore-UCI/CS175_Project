At least 49 dead as throngs commemorate revolution At least 49 people were killed and 247 wounded in violence Saturday marking the third anniversary of the January 25 revolution that brought down longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian state media said. Parliamentary elections were supposed to be held first under a timetable agreed to after Egypt's army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July following mass protests against his rule. Dozens more people were wounded in clashes throughout the country on Saturday between anti-government protesters and security forces. On Sunday, three Egyptian soldiers were killed and 11 others wounded when unknown armed men attacked their bus in the Sinai, a military official told Egyptian state news agency MENA. "In this light, I have taken the decision to amend the road map for the future, so that presidential elections are held first, and are followed by parliamentary elections.
