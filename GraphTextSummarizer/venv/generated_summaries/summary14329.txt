"He was working hard and he took his chance great -- but obviously, it's a pity that the penalty didn't go in for him," said Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech. Russian clubs had a mixed night with Rubin Kazan winning 2-0 at home against Levante, but only after extra-time, while Zenit St Petersburg went out against Basel, beaten 2-1 on aggregate after Roman Shirokov failed to score an 86th-minute penalty that would have taken the game into extra-time. The victory capped a productive night for English clubs as Chelsea, Tottenham and Newcastle managed to partly atone for the failure of their Premier League counterparts in the Champions League -- none of whom made it into the last eight. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg in the Romanian capital, Rafa Benitez's side leveled matters as Juan Mata squeezed the ball home after 33 minutes -- but Vlad Chiriches' equalizer (and away goal) on the stroke of half time gave the game a very different complexion. Spurs were involved in the day's most dramatic game as they took a 3-0 lead to Inter Milan -- only to find themselves level on aggregate after 90 minutes as the rampant Italians scored through the lively Antonio Cassano, Rodrigo Palacio and a William Gallas own goal.
