Said Hanke: "On social media, and even in the real world, people started doing that and walking up to other people and saying, 'You're playing 'Ingress,' aren't you?' While encouraging fierce competition, "Ingress" has organically evolved during its beta run into an app that brings people together socially and creates connections between players beyond the game. You have to work with other people and we've all become good friends, no matter what side you're on. The idea, according to John Hanke, vice president of product development for Niantic Labs, was to get people moving, exploring, and having fun during the normally stationary act of playing on their phones. Hanke said his original plan was to create an MMO (massively multiplayer online) game where people all over the world could play in their own time toward a common goal.
