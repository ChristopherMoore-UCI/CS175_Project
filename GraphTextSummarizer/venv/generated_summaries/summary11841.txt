While there are literally hundreds of games playable at the festival, the following five games made their world premieres this week and are worth checking out when they hit a console near you over the coming year. Although he's appeared in video games like "Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2" and "Marvel vs. Capcom 3" before, the comic book antihero Deadpool has never stood on his own. Using the PS Vita's rear touch pad, players can see their hand enter the game world. The struggling PS Vita needs more killer apps like this, which could lure more gamers to this portable player. Which one you follow is completely up to you, but expect a funny, gory ride that's nothing like other comic book games.
