-- Ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak is depressed and refusing to eat as he awaits trial on charges of ordering police to kill anti-government protesters, a state news agency reported Tuesday. Prosecutors have said Mubarak suffers from depression, fatigue, repeated irregular heartbeats, low blood pressure that could lead to fainting and an increased risk of heart attack. Mubarak is consuming only liquids and juices, is weak and has lost a lot of weight, Mohammed Fathallah, the head of the hospital where the ex-president is being held, told the state-run EgyptNews. On July 18, hospital officials reported that Mubarak had fallen into a coma, but one "that did not last long," Fathallah told CNN. The 83-year-old Mubarak ruled Egypt for more than 29 years before a popular uprising drove him from office in February.
