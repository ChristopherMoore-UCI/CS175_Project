The decision to increase U.S. troop deployments to Iraq isn't a sign the U.S. strategy against ISIS is failing, but rather a signal the campaign is entering a new phase, President Barack Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS news program "Face the Nation." U.S. forces will not go into combat, Obama said, reiterating previous promises that there won't be a U.S. ground role in the fighting. The additional 1,500 troops are being sent to help train Iraqi army soldiers and militia fighters to battle ISIS on the ground after weeks of U.S. and allied airstrikes. "Now what we need is ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, that can start pushing them back." But, he said, the United States will provide local troops with "close air support" once they are ready to go on the offensive against ISIS.
