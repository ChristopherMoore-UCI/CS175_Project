The murder of rapper Dolla reverberated throughout the music industry on Tuesday as police sought a motive for the brazen killing. Police later arrested Aubrey Louis Berry, 23, at Los Angeles International Airport, a Los Angeles Police statement said. According to his official MySpace page, Dolla was born in Chicago, Illinois, and his family relocated to Los Angeles soon after. "[Dolla] was minding his business, in Los Angeles trying to record his music and this happens," Ali said. The aspiring Southern hip-hop artist, whose real name was Roderick Anthony Burton II, was gunned down in the busy parking lot of the upscale Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles, California, on Monday afternoon.
