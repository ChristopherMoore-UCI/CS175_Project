The company's factory became operational earlier this year, producing four different kinds of products: baby diapers, paper towels, napkins and toilet paper. Trawally's business grew steadily and by 2005 the self-made businessman owned three retail stores selling items such as paper products and cosmetics imported from all over the world. -- He started his first business venture as a street vendor with capital of just $200 but two decades later Fomba Trawally has become one of Liberia's most prominent businessmen. Like many in his country, Trawally fled Liberia in 1989 to escape the West African country's ruinous civil war. " "One supermarket in Liberia, Harbel supermarket, they are the number one customer to me -- they don't buy tissue from anyone beside me," adds Trawally.
