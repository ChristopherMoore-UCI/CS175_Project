Conclusion: Comparing only Pentagon expenditures, two weeks of military operations in Iraq generally appear to have been more expensive than the U.S. military role in the seven-month Libya operation. But, the CRS's report says that "average obligations for a fiscal year are a good indicator of ongoing operational costs." -- President Barack Obama asserted during Monday's presidential debate that it cost the United States less to help oust Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi than it did to run two weeks of the 2003-2011 war in Iraq Obama, debating former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, made the comment while touting his decision to involve the United States in a NATO no-fly-zone operation that helped rebels overthrow Gadhafi over seven months in 2011. The cost of initial operations through March 28, 2011, was estimated at $550 million, according to the CRS. In fiscal 2004 -- the first full fiscal year of the war -- the department's Iraq obligations averaged $2.21 billion every two weeks, according to the CRS.
