Tracking social media is big business, and the news that Twitter is set to enter the ring with a free product of its own may strike fear in the hearts of market leaders. When using a free product, customers have low expectations about the level of personal service they expect to receive. But few businesses are aware such services exist. Given the choice between paying for Twitter stats or using Facebook Insights for free, perhaps some businesses would choose Facebook as their social platform of choice. Customer service concerns may also have swayed Twitter's thinking.
