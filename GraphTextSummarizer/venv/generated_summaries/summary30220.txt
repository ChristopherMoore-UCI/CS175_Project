Hampered by knee, hamstring and back injuries in past losses in Melbourne, 14-time grand slam winner Nadal felt dizzy and was close to exiting in the second round against American qualifier Tim Smyczek. There didn't appear to be anything amiss with Nadal after he won the first set in routine fashion against Smyczek on Wednesday, but things took a turn for the worse for him in the middle of the second. Holding a 16-5 record in fifth sets, the numbers favored Nadal in the decider. Nadal hasn't played much tennis the past six months. Last year at the Australian Open, Li Na survived a match point in the third round against Lucie Safarova and then went on to win her second grand slam title.
