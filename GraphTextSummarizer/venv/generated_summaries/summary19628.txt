Battles in Iraq continue As Kurdish fighters keep battling ISIS in Syria, the militant group continues its offensive in Iraq. Even though local defenders control some 70% of the city, Kobani is cut off, and ISIS forces have been shelling it with mortars from the east and south, local government official Anwar Muslim said this week. More than 100,000 refugees have fled to Turkey amid weeks of intense fighting by Kurdish forces for full control of Kobani, a border town that's one of the last in the region to resist falling to ISIS. Officials: Denver girls played hooky from school, tried to join ISIS Fighting in Kobani continued Wednesday, with six Kurdish defenders killed and the bodies of 10 ISIS fighters recovered, a Kurdish fighter there said. U.S. airplanes are dropping medical supplies and weapons into this Kurdish city as defenders try to beat back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.
