LONDON, England -- Friedel and Robert Borisewitz have led extraordinary lives. What is most remarkable is that at the age of 92 and 97 respectively, Friedel and Robert are as dynamic and full of life as people 30 years their junior. But with Friedel in charge of the cooking, Robert has had little choice but to eat healthy ingredients. Long lives: Friedel, 92, and Robert Borisewitz, 97 still lead an active life. Except for one lapse, Friedel has always maintained healthy eating habits.
