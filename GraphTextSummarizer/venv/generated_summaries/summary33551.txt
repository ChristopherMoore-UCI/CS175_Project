" It meant Falla missed the chance to become the first Colombian to win an ATP Tour title since Mauricio Hadad in 1995 -- Roger Federer tuned up in perfect style ahead of Wimbledon with a straight sets victory over Alejandro Falla to claim his seventh title at Halle. Federer's seventh title means only at Wimbledon has he had as much success, though he'll be hoping to bag an eighth crown in London later this month. " At Queen's, Grigor Dimitrov -- known as 'Baby Federer' -- claimed his first grass court crown after defeating Spain's Feliciano Lopez in the final at Queen's club. "In the past, when I have played well at Halle I have usually played well at Wimbledon," added Federer.
