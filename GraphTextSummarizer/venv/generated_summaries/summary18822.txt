Alba, prosecutors said, set up false bank accounts and claimed she was collecting for a "funeral fund" set up on behalf of Noah Pozner, one of the 20 children killed in the December attacks. Alba plead guilty in June to wire fraud and lying to FBI agents, federal prosecutors in Connecticut said. The U.S. Attorney's office said FBI agents contacted Alba after seeing the CNN report and that she told the agents the same thing she told CNN. Donors sent $240 to a PayPal account between December 14 and 20, federal prosecutors in New York said earlier this year. Alba denied being involved in a scam during an appearance on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" in December.
