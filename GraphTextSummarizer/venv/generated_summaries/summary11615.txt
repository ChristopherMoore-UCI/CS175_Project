Kwik Trip drops Ryan Braun Read more: MLB can sue Florida clinic that allegedly gave players PEDs CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report. -- The shoe company Nike has terminated its contract with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, the company said Friday, nearly two weeks after the five-time All Star was suspended for violating Major League Baseball's drug policy. He'd faced a 50-game suspension last fall after a drug test showed high levels of testosterone in his body. Nike did not provide a statement explaining its decision to drop Braun, the 2011 National League MVP. Still, the decision isn't altogether surprising given Commissioner Bud Selig's announcement on July 22 that it was suspending Braun without pay for 65 days -- which worked out to the rest of the 2013 season.
