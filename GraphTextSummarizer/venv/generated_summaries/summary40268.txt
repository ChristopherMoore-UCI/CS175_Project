"The bushes had eyes," West German border guard Ernst Wackernagel told us, describing the creepy job of patrolling a few yards from the binoculars and guns of their East German counterparts. A couple of years before, the former West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt had advised me tartly to quit asking whether Germany would ever be reunited. "We couldn't think about the wall, so we didn't," said the mayor of a West German village standing right on the border, when we talked to him in 1990. Very few of the people we taxpayers paid to know about such things had any idea how close the collapse was. During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, I was flying back and forth over the North Atlantic in a Navy patrol plane for 15 hours a day, not knowing what the hell was going on, trying not to dwell on the orders that could send us on a one-way mining trip to Murmansk Harbor if the balloon went up.
