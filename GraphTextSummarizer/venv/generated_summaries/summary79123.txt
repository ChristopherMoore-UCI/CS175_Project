-- An auction that included works by Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet raked in 152.6 million pounds (US$226.5 million) Wednesday night, setting a record for highest total ever realized in an British art auction, according to Christie's. Matisse's "Nu à la Chaise Longue," from 1923, had not been seen in public since the year after it was painted and was offered at auction for the first time, Christie's said. "Global bidders competed at this evening's auction and demonstrated that the art market continues to attract significant levels of spending, particularly for the rarest and most exceptional works of art," said Giovanna Bertazzoni, director of Christie's Impressionist and Modern Art division. "We are particularly pleased that Picasso's portrait of Angel Fernández de Soto realized over 34 million pounds with proceeds to benefit arts culture and heritage in the UK, and that for the first time an auction inLondon has broken the 150 million pound barrier." The Picasso didn't bring in top dollar, but did fall into Christie's expectations, between 30 and 40 million pounds ($44.7 and $59.5 million).
