-- Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan and a co-defendant lost another legal round at the Supreme Court on Tuesday and will remain in prison on federal racketeering and fraud convictions. Justice John Paul Stevens refused last fall to grant bail for the 74-year-old Ryan, a move that would have kept him out of jail to file more appeals. Ryan and businessman Larry Warner claimed they did not receive a fair trial, but the justices, without comment, refused to intervene in the case. Ex-Gov. George Ryan walks out of a Chicago, Illinois, courthouse after his April 2006 conviction. The men were convicted in April 2006 for fraud in a case stemming from bribes paid for various state licenses.
