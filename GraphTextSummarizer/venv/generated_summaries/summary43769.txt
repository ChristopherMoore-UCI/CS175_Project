Former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur will contest the Kremlin Cup final against Romanian fifth seed Simona Halep. "There's still a chance, but obviously I will have to play extremely well next week and also in Paris, maybe even win Paris," said the 35-year-old, who made his debut in the Vienna event in 1997 and won the title in 2001. The Australian, who won the Osaka title last weekend, beat two-time grand slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-2 6-4 while Halep defeated another Russian, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, 6-2 6-1. I just have to keep fighting and trying to win matches." World No. 63 Haase, who won the Austrian Open clay event in 2011 and 2012, will take on German veteran Tommy Haas in the final of the indoor hard-court tournament on Sunday. Victory will put Gasquet above Tsonga in the ATP standings ahead of next week's events in Valencia and Basel, with the Paris Masters closing the regular season the following week.
