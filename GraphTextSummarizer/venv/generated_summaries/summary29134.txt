More than 75% of the former prisoners who reported staff sexual misconduct were male inmates who said they had interaction with female staff, the report said. Female prisoners were more than three times as likely to be victims of sexual abuse as male prisoners. "The standards we establish today reflect the fact that sexual assault crimes committed within our correctional facilities can have devastating consequences for individual victims and for communities far beyond our jails and prisons," Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement. In response, the Justice Department announced it is establishing rules "to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse in confinement facilities" The steps include screening inmates for risk of being sexually abused or sexually abusive, and training prison employees. The officials found that most of the victims had been abused while they were in state prisons, but a small percentage were molested in local jails or halfway houses.
