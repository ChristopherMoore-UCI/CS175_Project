"We have reached an agreement with the principal owner of Formula One that Sochi would host the Russian Grand Prix from 2014 to 2020," former President Putin told Russian business leaders, as quoted by state news agency RIA Novosti. "The signing of the agreement to stage a Grand Prix in Sochi will help put a Russian team in F1," he told RIA Novosti. " Russian motorsport commentator Alexei Popov has hailed hosting a grand prix as one of the biggest events in sport. The 26-year-old, who signed a one-year deal with the option of two more, is 13th in the drivers' standings on 19 points -- 95 behind Polish teammate Robert Kubica. " The sport has been keen to expand into new regions in recent years, with Korea making its F1 debut later this month and India being added to the racing calendar for the 2011 season.
