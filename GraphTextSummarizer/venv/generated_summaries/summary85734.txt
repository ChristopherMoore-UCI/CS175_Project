The embassy did not offer details on who might carry out such an attack but said it had limited official U.S. government visits and urged citizens to consider deferring travel to Kenya. Kenya has been on edge since it sent troops across the border into Somalia to pursue militants with Al-Shabaab, an Islamist group that the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization. Kenya sent troops into Somalia after the recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. Al-Shabaab has threatened to attack Kenya if it does not withdraw its forces from Somalia. -- Separate blasts rocked the capital of Kenya on Monday, killing at least one person and injuring 20, officials said.
