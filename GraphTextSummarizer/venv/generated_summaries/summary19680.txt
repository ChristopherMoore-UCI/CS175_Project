The incident started Thursday afternoon when the bus stopped to let students out, said Atlanta police officer James Polite. -- An angry, naked man commandeered a school bus full of teenage students Thursday in Atlanta, police said. Students fled the bus, many using the back door emergency exit, and onlookers subdued the man until police arrived. The man drove the bus for less than a mile before a student confronted him and the bus crashed into a wall off the road, according to police. Arris Pitmon, 23, darted toward the bus and hoisted himself in through an open window, Polite said.
