The "9 hours down" refers to the time it took the MIT freshman to fly Saturday from El Cajon, California, to Aberdeen, South Dakota, the first leg of his odyssey. The "150 to go" marks the remaining hours he plans to fly over the next six weeks on a plan that will take the South Dakota native through Athens, Greece; Cairo; Bangkok, Thailand; Honolulu, Hawaii, and more. On Wednesday, Guthmiller plans to fly from Teterboro, New Jersey, just outside of New York City to St. John's in Newfoundland, Canada according to the flight itinerary he posted. If all goes as planned, Guthmiller will land his 1981 prop powered Beechcraft Bonanza back in Aberdeen on July 12 -- just 42 days after beginning the trip. If successful, Guthmiller will replace Jack Wiegand of Fresno, California, as the youngest American pilot to circumnavigate the globe alone.
