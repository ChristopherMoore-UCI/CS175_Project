The Germanwings aircraft that crashed earlier this week was deliberately brought down by a co-pilot who had managed to lock himself in the cockpit as he set the plane on a course for destruction, according to officials. First, we have seen that there is a real risk of pilots bringing down planes. Perhaps airlines will need to guarantee that pilots who seek counseling will not be unjustly punished. This is obviously terrorism in the general sense to elicit fear in a general population, but whether it was done for some political or ideological reason (in the absence of any group taking credit, it does not fit the model of most major airline terror attacks) we still do not know. It may be that we are in an era when we don't have the right words to describe the threats we face from loners with the capacity for mass casualties.
