"I scared my kids because I was jumping up and down in the house," she said, beaming on Monday after North Carolina lottery officials handed over a giant check with her name on it as confetti rained down from the ceiling. " Holmes has supported her children in the past with jobs at Walmart, Food Lion supermarket, KFC, McDonald's and Subway, lottery officials said. The other two winning tickets of this month's Powerball jackpot were purchased in Texas and Puerto Rico, and the three winners split a jackpot listed by lottery officials at $564 million. " Holmes is from the coastal town of Shallotte, North Carolina. Holmes' win is the largest in North Carolina's history, officials said.
