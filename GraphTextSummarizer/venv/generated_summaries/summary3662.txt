A 3-0 victory over Liverpool, inspired by Ronaldo, ensured Real Madrid made it nine points out of nine in Group B. A 70th Champions League strike means he is just one behind the all-time leading scorer, Raul, the man so revered by all at Real. "The first 22 minutes of the game we were excellent but from the first goal to halftime, Real Madrid showed their real quality," Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, told Sky Sports. In the end, Ronaldo had to settle for a solitary strike and an early exit as he was replaced with 15 minutes remaining as Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid coach, began to look towards Saturday's clash with Barcelona. While Liverpool, so inconsistent following the success of last season and the departure of Luis Suarez, has struggled in recent weeks, Real has been on cruise control. Ronaldo should have added a fourth midway through the second half after the visiting side had cut through the Liverpool defense with embarrassing ease, but for once, the Portuguese forward was unable to find a way past goalkeeper Simon Mignolet.
