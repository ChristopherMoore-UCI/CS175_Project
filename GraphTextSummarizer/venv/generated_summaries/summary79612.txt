"We believe it's truly an experimental way to capture people's attention in a relevant way," said Sally Jenkins, Norton's vice president of worldwide consumer marketing. Sponsored by online security company Norton, the experimental project lets Facebook users volunteer their profiles. If selected, a post from their page will be acted out during the event, which began Wednesday morning at a Chicago theater and is streaming live on Norton's Facebook page. "Stuff Theater," happening live until 9 a.m. Thursday, is taking the magical, mundane and sometimes mystifying world of Facebook posts to the stage in a 24-hour performance. They were hoping to work in 1,000 skits by Thursday morning.
