The alert began around 11:30 a.m. Friday, after a letter sent to a College of Mount St. Joseph administrator threatened violence at the Cincinnati school, according to Delhi Township Police Lt. Darryl Haussler and college spokeswoman Betheny Herr. The Delhi Township Police Department was among the agencies -- along with the Green Township Police Department and Hamilton County Police Association -- working with the College of Mount St. Joseph police to investigate the threat, escort people off campus and secure the campus, Haussler said. " "Safety is the very first priority," said Herr, adding that there was no evidence of violence or injuries found on the campus. -- A lockdown at an Ohio college was lifted Friday evening, hours after school officials received a "threat of violence," the college's website said. The College of Mount St. Joseph is a Catholic liberal arts institution for 2,400 students -- 1,200 undergraduates and the rest in professional education programs -- located in Cincinnati, in southern Ohio.
