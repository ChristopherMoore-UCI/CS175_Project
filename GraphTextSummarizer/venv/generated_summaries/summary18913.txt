When drug companies develop a drug, the Food and Drug Administration usually grants them exclusive rights to market the drug for a set period of time. When those rights expire, other companies can make same drug. While it is not known how much cheaper the generic version of the cholesterol-lowering drug will be, Pfizer is working with pharmacy benefit companies to lower co-payments to hold on to as many customers as possible.
