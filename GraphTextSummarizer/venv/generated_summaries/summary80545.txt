As dozens of Myanmar nationals representing many segments and sectors of society told me recently, corruption often succeeds where law fails. Less talked about is the glass ceiling in Myanmar that is preventing legal reform from becoming full-fledged rule of law: endemic corruption. While last week Myanmar took a notable step in that direction by finally ratifying the U.N. Convention against Corruption, it has not revised its 65-year-old domestic legislation on corruption. Legal reform itself has a role to play in breaking through the glass ceiling of corruption toward achieving the rule of law. It is not by accident that the four nations whose public sectors were rated more corrupt than Myanmar's are the Sudan, Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia; human rights violations, poverty, and corruption mutually enforce one another.
