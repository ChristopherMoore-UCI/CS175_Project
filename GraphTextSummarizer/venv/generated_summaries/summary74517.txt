" Former Chief Executive Officer Khalilullah Ferozi was sentenced to five years and ordered to pay $530 million to a recovery fund to help the fraud victims, prosecutor Nasrrullah Hemad said Tuesday. -- Two former Kabul Bank executives accused in a scheme that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars now face years in prison and massive fines. Former Kabul Bank Chairman Sherkhan Farnood was also sentenced to five years and must pay $278 million to the fund. The bank was meant to provide a transparent way for Afghan government employees -- soldiers, teachers and police officers -- to receive and retain their salaries without the age-old fear of corrupt superiors confiscating the money. Nineteen others face sentences of between six months and four years, Hemad said Tuesday.
