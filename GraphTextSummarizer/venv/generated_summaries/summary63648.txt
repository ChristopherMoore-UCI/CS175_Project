Civil police in the northeast Brazilian city of Recife arrested Ricardo Sergio Freire de Barros after he tried to open a bank account using a fake ID with a picture of Jack Nicholson. To his credit, Barros didn't use Nicholson's name, instead signing the card Joao Pedro dos Santos. When Barros was arrested, he had six different IDs and various checkbooks and credit cards, police said. Before his arrest on Tuesday, police had been tracking Barros for three months, following multiple reports of fraudulent activity, police Chief Erivaldo Guerra said. He's charged with use of false documents and falsification of a public document.
