The charges were a result of the McDonnell family accepting about $177,000 in gifts and loans from Richmond businessman Williams. Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell is vowing to keep fighting the bribery accusations that on Tuesday landed him a two-year prison sentence. When McDonnell left, his wife, Maureen McDonnell, who could face a similar sentence herself, remained in the courtroom, sobbing. "We believe that these things were kept from Mr. McDonnell -- at least the source who paid for them," he said. " "While Mrs. McDonnell may have allowed the serpent into the mansion, the governor knowingly let him into his personal and business affairs," the judge said.
