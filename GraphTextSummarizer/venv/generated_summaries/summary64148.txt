Israeli, Palestinian accusations In November, Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of continuing to incite distrust of Israel and perpetuating an "artificial crisis" to avoid a real peace deal. We are not going to discuss these further publicly, but I will say that the goal here for everybody is a viable Palestinian state with the Palestinian people living side by side in peace with the state of Israel and with the people of Israel. In public remarks after his private meeting with Netanyahu, Kerry said the United States remains committed to Israel's security. "Today, we discussed at great length issues of security in the region, security for the state of Israel, security for a future Palestine," Kerry said. "I can't emphasize enough that Israel's security in this negotiation is at the top of our agenda," Kerry said, according to pool reports.
