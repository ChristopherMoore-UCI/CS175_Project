The Daily Express and Daily Star, both owned by Express Newspapers, printed an apology on the front page of their Wednesday editions apologizing to Kate and Gerry McCann for suggesting the couple was responsible for the death of their daughter. The parents of missing Madeleine McCann have accepted £550,000 ($1.1 million) libel damages and an apology over stories published in two British newspapers that alleged they were involved in the disappearance or death of the girl. "As part of our settlement, Express Newspapers have also agreed to pay damages, by way of a donation of £550,000, to the Fund that was established to help find Madeleine. At the time, they were on a family vacation at a resort in Praia da Luz, in southern Portugal. "I think when people realize that more than 100 stories have been complained about as being grossly defamatory, it will annihilate the Express' readers sense of trust and credibility in their newspaper." Madeleine's parents reported her missing last May 3, just days before her fourth birthday.
