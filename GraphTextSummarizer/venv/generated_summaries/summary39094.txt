That's because Facebook is designed to connect you with people you already know, not introduce you to new people. While more than 5 percent of Facebook users are Indonesian, it's unlikely that you're friends with any of them, unless you have Indonesian friends in the offline world. It's my fond hope that social networks such as Facebook will help users broaden their perspectives by listening to a different set of people than they encounter in their daily life. Like the Internet itself, Facebook is one of the most powerful technologies ever built to increase connection between people separated by borders of nation, language, religion and culture. But I fear services such as Facebook may be turning us into imaginary cosmopolitans.
