A similar letter circulated last month offered a truce for the month of December, though that didn't mean the the month was without violence. Authorities described a scene of heavy gunfire where cartel members set trucks and buses on fire on highways to block police from arriving. -- A statement purportedly released by a violent Mexican drug cartel promises a one-month extension to a truce it called for in December. The truce will be extended another month "to continue demonstrating to the authorities, federal government and above all the Michoacan residents that the Familia Michoacana is not guilty of all of the criminal acts that the authorities and federal government make public through the media," the statement says. The Mexican government continued its operations against the cartel, killing one of its leaders, Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, after two days of armed confrontations.
