There have been reports of skirmishes between pirates and naval forces, but the military presence does not concern pirate leader Boyah. Boyah said it is unlikely the Puntland regional government would ever crack down on piracy because government officials are involved in financing the piracy and collect a cut of the ransoms. Pirate Boyah said he is unimpressed with the arrests by Puntland authorities. While Boyah may have been outspoken about the government's ineffectiveness, he did not allow interviewers to show his face, an indication that even in this lawless country, pirates still have some fear. The Puntland government said two unidentified Western journalists were taken hostage Wednesday as they attempted to report on pirate activity.
