Next week will see the release of "Mi Mandela," a tribute to Mandela made up of songs written and produced by Elba himself, and performed by a mixture of South African and British talent, including Mumford & Sons, the Mahotella Queens and Maverick Sabre. In this respect, "Mi Mandela" is as much about his own journey as it is about Mandela's. " A link to his father For Elba, playing Mandela had personal resonance as well, as filming for the role coincided with the death of his father.
