"Over the long term, wearable computing is inevitable for Apple; devices are diversifying, and the human body is a rich canvas for the computer," said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst who specializes in mobile technology.

An Apple TV has been in the rumor stages for years now, and while many observers still expect one to surface eventually, there have been no signs yet.
