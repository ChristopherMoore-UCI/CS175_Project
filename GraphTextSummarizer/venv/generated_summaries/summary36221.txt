The only stain on a good night for Inter was a punch thrown by Romanian defender Christian Chivu at opponent Marco Rossi. It was their fifth win in the last six games since former AC Milan coach Leonardo took over from Rafael Benitez. First Pazzini scored his third goal in two games since his $16m move from Sampdoria -- his shot squirmed under Bari goalkeeper Jean Francois Gillet in injury time. Inter Milan moved into third place in Italy's Serie A after inflicting yet more misery on bottom-placed Bari with a 3-0 win. Late goals from Houssine Kharja, Giampaolo Pazzini and Wesley Sneijder sealed three points for the Nerazzurri, who are now seven points behind city rivals and league leaders AC Milan with a game in hand.
