Another motivation for Lewinsky to write the piece:  A young man named Tyler Clementi. "When I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the next wave of paparazzi, the next wave of 'Where is she now?' stories, the next reference to me in Fox News' coverage of the primaries," Lewinsky says in her essay. At times, she had "suicidal temptations." Lewinsky's story is, for better or for worse, part of America's political history. Lewinsky devotes considerable ink to her various forays into the job market.
