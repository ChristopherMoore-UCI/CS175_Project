Four servicemen -- Souter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot, and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel. We were taking fire pretty much the entire day," he said in the Defense Department interview. So we were pretty much at one building and the rest was just a shadow of what it used to be," Shrode said in the Defense Department interview. He said the morning battle was "significant," but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons. The United States says about 200 insurgents -- mostly local fighters, with some Taliban organizers and leaders -- had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains.
