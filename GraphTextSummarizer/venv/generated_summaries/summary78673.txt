With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available. So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way," ten Hoopen said. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken. "This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people," ten Hoopen said. Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.
