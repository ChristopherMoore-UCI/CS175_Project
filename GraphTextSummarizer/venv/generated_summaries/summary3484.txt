" Riding says Parker's expedition has echoes of Moran's journey, which came shortly after Turner's death in 1851 at the age of 76. "Turner was a great traveler," says Christine Riding, head of art at London's Royal Museums Greenwich. While Parker is "not really a sailor," Turner had sea legs. And while Turner set off to sea to sketch, Parker will travel the 1,000 or so miles to the various ports and harbors. Moran's subsequent work, paintings such as "The Shipwreck," were very Turner-esque in their use of bold colors and glowing, turbulent skies, as boats were tossed in different directions amid stormy seas.
