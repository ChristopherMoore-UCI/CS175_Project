Defectors who have made it to South Korea say anyone sent back faces a long term of imprisonment in a brutal labor camp or even execution.

Ignoring international protests, China may have repatriated around 30 North Korean defectors who had been caught while trying to escape their homeland, a South Korean official said Friday.
