See the rest of Tokyo Rising at VICE.com What was exciting to witness amid the organized efforts at recovery and general collective response, was how the events of March 11 have spurred Japanese youth to an interrogation of traditional society. Three months after the earthquake, we set out for Tokyo with Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter and producer Pharrell Williams, who has a strong affinity for Japanese culture and has been strongly involved in Japan's music and fashion scenes for the last decade. Through art, creativity, entrepreneurship or protest, Tokyo's youth have begun asserting an active and individualistic will that runs counter to much of traditional Japanese thinking. The rolling blackouts and voluntary power outages to conserve energy added to an atmosphere of nervous desolation already fostered by the flight of foreigners to their home countries and native Japanese further south, as worried Tokyo residents tried to come to terms with the scope of the disaster and fear of the very air around them. The threat of calamity and exposure to the violence of nature is part of the daily fabric of Japanese life.
