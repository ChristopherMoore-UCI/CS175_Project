"We will go one step further with school superintendents by emailing them weather condition updates, so that they have the most up-to-date information when determining whether to close schools." The exodus of drivers from Atlanta clogged the highways, stranding thousands of students in schools and forcing numerous commuters to spend extra hours inside their cars on icy roads. The public lashed out at Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed for not acting quickly enough. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal has named a 32-member "severe weather warning and preparedness task force" that will recommend how the state can better respond to storms like the one that paralyzed Atlanta last week. "Effective immediately, a storm warning will trigger a message to cell phones in targeted areas, as in the Amber Alert system, and advise against road travel," Deal said Monday.
