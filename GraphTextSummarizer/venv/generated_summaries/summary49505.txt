I started a non-governmental organization, Pink Cross, to provide counseling for Ebola survivors facing stigmatization and to conduct public awareness campaigns. We are looking for a partner to help us build post-Ebola drop-in centers for Ebola survivors to come for counseling, support and training. After surviving, I returned to work in the same hospital ward where I worked before, treating Ebola patients and giving them hope. And I would like to further my education, so that I can pursue a career in my country helping people prevent and survive diseases like Ebola. I want to help Ebola survivors.
