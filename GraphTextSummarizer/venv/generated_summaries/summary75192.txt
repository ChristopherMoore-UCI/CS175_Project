-- Researchers  at Qatar  University's engineering  school have come up with a novel way to cool the stadiums ahead of the 2022  World Cup... giant flying saucers! Ghani  believes that the technology could also be useful in security and  communications. That's a  big deal in a country where temperatures in summer regularly soar into  triple-digits Fahrenheit -- the very time the 2022 tournament is expected to take  place. Radio and camera transmitters could help facilitate wireless  communication and provide an eye-in-the-sky for broadcasters or security  forces. Dr. Saud  Ghani, head of a Mechanical and Industrial Engineering group at Qatar University, tells CNN that the artificial robotic cloud could potentially drop the  temperatures on the pitch by 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
