While the French team was trying to rescue that person, their excavation machine, which resembles a bulldozer, tipped into a hole and caused a further collapse, said Lt. Col. Christophe Renou of French Civil Protection. -- Search-and-rescue efforts at a supermarket in Haiti's capital have ended after teams determined no one else was alive beneath the rubble, an official told CNN Wednesday. But at 11 p.m. Tuesday, the teams determined there was no one else alive under the rubble, and they called off the rescue mission, Renou told CNN Wednesday. Caribbean Supermarket was the scene of a number of rescues after the earthquake, including the rescue of five people in one weekend. The U.S. team brought more radar and lifting devices to try to extract the known survivor and reach any others, said Norman Skjelbreia, an incident commander from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
