Daniels said he is cautiously optimistic about the latest developments, although the Schaus swallowtail faces daunting challenges. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued an emergency directive in 2012 to collect females in Biscayne National Park and raise their eggs. In their climate-controlled environment, the Schaus swallowtail caterpillars munch voraciously on wild lime. Alvear said volunteers at the national park are helping to plant wild lime and torchwood, both food sources for the Schaus swallowtail. Schaus swallowtails generally live only two weeks in the wild, perhaps 30 to 40 days in captivity.
