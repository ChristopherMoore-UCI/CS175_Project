In Britain, some journalists went too far and breached the Editors' Code, the ethical standard on press reporting that states that "when reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive detail about the method used." When a media report describes clear details of unusual methods of suicide and essentially gives a "how to" guide -- the danger is it can make suicide seem like a more accessible action to take. We know that around 6,000 people take their own life every year in the UK, and thousands more will attempt suicide, seriously contemplate it and battle mental health problems. Media coverage of mental health and suicide has come a long way over the last few years however, on this occasion; many newspapers got it badly wrong. We believe we can work collaboratively with the media to make mental health and suicide reporting safe.
