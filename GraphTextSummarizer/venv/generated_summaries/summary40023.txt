-- UK authorities faced growing questions Saturday after passengers arriving at London's Heathrow Airport faced long lines at passport control. He said European Union passport holders were waiting just under an hour to get through immigration control, while non-EU passport holders were queuing for as long as three hours. The British Airports Authority (BAA), which runs Heathrow, said recent delays had been unacceptable but that it had no control over passport control. He told CNN was yelled at by Heathrow security staff to "get to the end the queue" and when he questioned what was going on was told "we don't know. " His experience at Heathrow compared very badly to the efficiency he saw at Berlin, Windebank said, and "will kill business for Britain unless it is fixed." Alastair Campbell, the former Downing Street communications chief under Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, tweeted Thursday: "If this is what Heathrow T5 border queue is like on an average Thursday Olympic athletes should think about coming soon."
