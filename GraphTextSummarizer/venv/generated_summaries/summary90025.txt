Francesca Hilton, 64, is Gabor's only child, the product of her second marriage to hotel magnate Conrad Hilton. Gabor's husband, meanwhile, told CNN that she "went into shock" Saturday morning, delaying her release from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center that had been planned for this weekend. "She is no different than she was from yesterday or the day before," Francesca Hilton, who was at her mother's hospital bedside, said Saturday. -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's recovery from hip replacement surgery last month has been slower than predicted, but her daughter disputed a report that the actress "suffered a setback" Saturday. Gabor, who suffered a broken hip in a fall from her bed July 17, underwent surgery July 19.
