NBA Senior Vice President Vicky Picca said Tuesday that Collins' No. 98 Brooklyn Nets uniform is the top-seller on NBA.com, besting the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin. "I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment," said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver after Collins' signing last Sunday. But for now, Collins -- the first openly gay, active player in the United States' four big sports leagues -- is, by jersey sales, the NBA's most popular player. Still, whether or not he's a go-to player, Collins has very much become a symbol for the gay rights movement since disclosing his sexuality in an April column in Sports Illustrated magazine. The interest is coming from the fans Collins has earned since announcing last year, when he was still unemployed, that he was gay.
