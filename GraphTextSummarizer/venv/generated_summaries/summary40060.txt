U.S. airstrikes helped clear a path for thousands of Yazidis to escape the mountain into neighboring Syria and to Iraqi Kurdish territory. Yassir arrived in September, shortly after ISIS's initial attack on Yazidis left thousands stranded on the mountain without food, water or medical care. Kurdish forces airdrop food and weapons. Yet the nightmare continues for thousands who remain on the mountain, surrounded by ISIS forces intent on eradicating anyone in their path. Yazidis captured by ISIS have been forced to convert to Islam.
