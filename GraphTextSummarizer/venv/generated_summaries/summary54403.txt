The reason for all of these "I like it on" status updates is simple: October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of women are using this meme as a rallying cry to raise awareness for cancer research. It's all part of a new Internet meme that has gone viral on Facebook to raise awareness for breast cancer. In January bra color status updates started dominating newsfeeds worldwide, again to raise awareness for breast cancer. Still, we can't forget that this is a disease that will kill 10 million women in the next 25 years, so we also implore you to donate to breast cancer research if you can. Like any social platform, Facebook is susceptible to rapidly spreading memes.
