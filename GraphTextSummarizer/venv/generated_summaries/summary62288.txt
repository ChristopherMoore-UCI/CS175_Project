-- A British aid worker who died during an operation to rescue her from kidnappers in Afghanistan may have been killed by a grenade thrown by American forces trying to free her, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday. But Cameron said Monday that statements made about Norgrove's death over the weekend were "highly likely to have been incorrect," although they were made "in good faith. The British government aims to share as much of the final report as possible with lawmakers, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday. Petraeus also will meet with British Defense Secretary Liam Fox to talk about Afghanistan, it said. Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, will launch an investigation into the failed attempt to rescue Linda Norgrove, 36, Cameron said.
