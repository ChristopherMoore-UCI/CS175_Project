McPherron said both of these sites are known to be the stomping grounds of Neanderthals because other fossils and tools characteristic of their species have been found there, and artifacts and bones from modern humans have not been uncovered there. Archaeologists had established that Neanderthals would take bones and remove flakes to make scrapers, notch tools and hand axes, McPherron said. Scientists have uncovered evidence that Neanderthals were making specialized bone tools before modern humans arrived in Europe. "It opens the possibility that in this case, maybe they" -- modern humans in Europe -- "learned this tool type from Neanderthals," said Shannon McPherron, co-author of the study and an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. If that's the case, that means modern humans were in Europe earlier than previously believed, McPherron said.
