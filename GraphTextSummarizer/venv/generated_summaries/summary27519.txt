This bill aims to eliminate tax disparities between different tobacco products, reduce illegal tobacco trade and increase the federal excise tax on tobacco products. New York and Providence, Rhode Island, have enacted city-wide ordinances prohibiting the sale of flavored tobacco products, including flavored little cigars. In 2011, among middle school and high school students who currently smoke cigars, more than one in three reported using flavored little cigars. Six states -- Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Wisconsin -- have youth cigar smoking rates the same as or higher than those of youth cigarette smoking. Based on decades of evidence, the 2012 surgeon general's report on tobacco use among youth and young adults concluded that tobacco industry marketing causes youths to smoke, and nicotine addiction keeps them smoking.
