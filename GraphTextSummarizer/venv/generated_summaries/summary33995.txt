For more than two decades, New Jersey investigators had not been able to solve the homicide of 5-year-old Timothy Wiltsey. The grand jury charged that Lodzinski "did purposely or knowingly kill Timothy Wiltsey, or did purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily injury upon Timothy Wiltsey, resulting in his death," according to the prosecutor's office. Less than a year after he was reported missing, Timmy's partial remains were found in a remote section of an industrial park in nearby Edison, New Jersey. In the end, a routine cold-case review sparked a new investigation into the death, according to prosecutors in Middlesex County. Speaking about the woman's fake kidnapping story, Alan Rockoff, the Middlesex County prosecutor at the time of Timmy's disappearance, told the newspaper, "It confirmed to me what we already knew; she was the suspect."
