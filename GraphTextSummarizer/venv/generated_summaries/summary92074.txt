The attorney tried more than 300 cases in 21 states, his family said, before retiring from his litigation practice in 2009 to focus full-time on his mediation and arbitration practice. -- William Ginsburg, an attorney who represented former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, died Monday at age 70, his family confirmed to CNN. The attorney was known for being one of the first people to appear on all five major Sunday news talk shows on a single day during the Lewinsky scandal in the late 1990s, after the intern admitted to sexual activities with then-President Bill Clinton. The lives they lived CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this report. Ginsburg was a national board member and president and trustee of the American Board of Trial Advocates Foundation, which provides education concerning the history and value of the right to trial by jury, his family said.
