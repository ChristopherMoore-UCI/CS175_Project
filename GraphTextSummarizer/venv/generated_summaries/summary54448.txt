More Muslims protest inflammatory film, cartoons The trailer for "Innocence of Muslims" was posted online to YouTube in July, but it wasn't until earlier this month that it gained attention in the Muslim world and stirred tens of thousands of protest in more than 20 nations. Demonstrators in the South Asian nation -- which has one of the world's largest Muslim populations -- torched a police van and damaged police cars, and several protesters and protest leaders were arrested, the spokesman said. -- A leading figure in the Sunni Islam world called for fellow believers to respond to recent controversial portrayals of Mohammed -- which he said "spread hatred" -- just like the prophet himself would, "through patience and wisdom." Among them: -- Thousands of Shiite Muslims protested in the Nigerian city of Kano, with the crowd shouting "God is great" and "Death to America," resident Sani isa Mohammed told CNN. And there were more protests Saturday, in which Muslims once again derided the film and, in many cases, the United States.
