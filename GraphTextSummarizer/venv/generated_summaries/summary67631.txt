Westmoreland County Public Safety spokesman Dan Stevens said skies were clear when the aircraft "just spun in its own axis" and hit the Saltsburg area house, sparking a fire that consumed the plane and the house. Yanko's wife was not at home at the time, Stevens said. -- Two people aboard a twin-engine airplane were killed Saturday when it crashed into a house in western Pennsylvania, sending the homeowner fleeing with his dog, officials said. The plane took off from Arnold Palmer Regional Airport outside Latrobe, about 50 miles from the crash scene, Stevens said. "There was somebody on his shoulder this morning," Stevens said of Yanko, who told him he was only about 15 feet away from the plane's impact.
