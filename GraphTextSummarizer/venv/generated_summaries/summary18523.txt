His conversion to Islam didn't alarm his relatives, according to uncle Ken McCain, though Facebook posts in support of ISIS did. The group showed a video of him, and U.S. officials later confirmed, taking part in a suicide bombing earlier this year in northern Syria. They took on ISIS forces last weekend in and around Aleppo -- which is where McCain was killed. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki added that U.S. authorities knew about McCain's ties to ISIS. "(McCain) is a reminder of the growing concern that the United States has, that many countries in the world have, about the thousands of foreign fighters from 50 nations who are engaged in Syria and who are affiliating themselves with ... extremist groups.
