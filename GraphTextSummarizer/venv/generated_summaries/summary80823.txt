New Zealand maxi Alfa Romeo eased to victory in the 65th annual Sydney to Hobart ocean yacht race on Monday. Australian maxi Wild Oats XI finished 16 nautical miles behind in second place with British yacht ICAP Leopard a further 24 miles behind in third. " Wild Oats, who set the race record in 2005, was bidding for a fifth win, but trailed Alfa Romeo out of Sydney Harbor in the traditional Boxing Day start and was never able to get on terms with the leader. Skippered by Neville Crichton, Alfa Romeo crossed the finish of the 628-mile race ahead of favorite Australian maxi Wild Oats XI. Alfa Romeo had led since they left Sydney Harbor on Saturday and was not threatened during its two days, nine hours and two minutes at sea.
