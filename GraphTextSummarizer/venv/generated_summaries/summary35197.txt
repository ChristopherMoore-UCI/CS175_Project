"Jeffs argues that the instruction erroneously focused the jury on Jeffs' actions and position of special trust, rather than on Steed's, for the purpose of determining whether Wall consented," the opinion said. Jeffs will be transferred, however, from the Utah State Prison just south of Salt Lake City to Washington County in southern Utah -- closer to the FLDS communities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, Bugden said. Defense attorney Wally Bugden said Tuesday that he expects the Washington County, Utah, district attorney to decide quickly on whether Jeffs will be retried. The first count of rape as an accomplice against Jeffs was alleged to have occurred shortly after Wall and Steed were married, when the two first had sex, the Utah Supreme Court opinion said. "We conclude that the state's interpretation is erroneous." Also, the jurors should have been instructed that in order to convict, they must find that Jeffs intended that Steed would sexually assault Wall as a result of his conduct.
