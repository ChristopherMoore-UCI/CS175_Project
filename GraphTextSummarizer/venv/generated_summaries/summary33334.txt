April to June is prime time for school field trips to Jeju Island, say Korea Tourism officials. -- The ferry that capsized on April 16 with 459 passengers onboard off the coast of South Korea was headed to Jeju Island, the country's biggest island and one of South Korea's nine provinces. In September 2013, Jeju Island was in the news after a Chinese luxury cruise ship was detained for issues related to a legal proceeding over outstanding lease payments. In 2007, UNESCO inscribed "Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes" onto its list of World Heritage Sites, highlighting Geomunoreum, "regarded as the finest lava tube system of caves anywhere, with its multicoloured carbonate roofs and floors, and dark-coloured lava walls. In 2013, more than 10 million tourists visited Jeju according to government statistics.
