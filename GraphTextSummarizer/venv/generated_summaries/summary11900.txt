Despite such concerns, the trend toward modification of insects for disease control is gathering pace as other solutions fail and regulators are favorable. "We need more field trials to show the impact on disease transmission... If we could reduce, even in some countries, the burden of diseases like dengue...that would be fantastic. "The reduction figures from their trials cannot be verified and they have not proved a positive impact on disease. "I hope that it will become a major part of control of major pest insects.
