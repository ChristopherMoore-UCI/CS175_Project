"Recent developments in the David Letterman extortion controversy have raised serious issues about the abuse of power leading to an inappropriate, if not hostile, workplace environment for women and employees," NOW said in Tuesday's statement. "The latest Letterman controversy sheds new light on the widespread objectification of women in the workplace," NOW said in a statement Tuesday. CBS airs "Late Show With David Letterman," which Letterman's company, Worldwide Pants Inc., produces. David Letterman's behavior with employees has created "a toxic environment" in the workplace, NOW says. The National Organization for Women has sharply criticized comedian David Letterman, accusing him of promoting a hostile, uncomfortable work environment.
