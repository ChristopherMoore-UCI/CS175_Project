A military official in Iran has said the world can thank his country that ISIS has not been able to assault Baghdad. "The (ISIS) terrorists sought to surround Baghdad, but they failed in reaching their ominous goals thanks to Iran's supports," Brig. The United States and Iran may be bombing a common enemy in Iraq, one whom they both despise -- ISIS. Yet ISIS is one of few issues that Iran and the United States agree on; both countries want to quash the terror group that has been taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Recent media reports from the region claim Iran's military conducted air raids in eastern Iraq, and on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Pentagon said the reports might be true.
