Let's face it, more Republican voters filed and submitted absentee ballots than Democrats, and more turned out on Election Day. Republicans accused Democrats of $716 billion in Medicare cuts. After all, the Republican in charge of electing Republicans to Congress said before the election, "special elections aren't too predictive for either side going forward." But the "be afraid" message works well for Republicans, in part because the Democrats don't counter it. Democrats believe that when more people vote, it's not just good for our party, it's good for democracy.
