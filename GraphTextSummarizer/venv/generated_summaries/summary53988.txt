He made an initial appearance at the Randolph County Courthouse on Monday on one count of solicitation of murder for hire and one count of solicitation of murder. Drew Peterson, the imprisoned former Chicago-area police sergeant found guilty of murdering his ex-wife, was charged Monday on two counts of murder solicitation. Between September 2013 and December 2014, Peterson allegedly hired someone to try to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, the prosecutor who won a conviction in 2012 that sent Peterson away for 38 years, according to the Illinois Attorney General's Office. Glasgow remains the state's attorney in Will County. However, in no way will a threat to my personal safety deter me from the important work I perform as the State's Attorney on behalf of the citizens of Will County," said Glasgow.
