On "Bachelor Pad," Kahl and Girardi quickly became the power couple to beat, though they lost the competition to on-again-off-again couple Holly Durst and Michael Stagliano in the show's finale. It's another "Bachelor" break-up: Vienna Girardi and Kasey Kahl have called it quits. Girardi and Kahl didn't give up on love or on reality TV. Kahl wooed Ali Fedotowsky on "The Bachelorette" with song, and his catch phrase, "guard and protect your heart," ended up tattooed on his wrist. but we will always remain friends," Girardi, 25, posted to her account.
