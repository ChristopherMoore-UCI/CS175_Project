-- Controversial fashion designer John Galliano -- fired and convicted over anti-Semitic comments in 2011 -- is heading to a New York design classroom this spring. Galliano was fired from the fashion giant in March 2011 after making anti-Semitic remarks in Paris. He added: "I only have myself to blame and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion." Abraham Foxman, national director for the Anti-Defamation League, said Tuesday in a statement, "I think it's time that John Galliano be evaluated on his skills." "He apologized, he repaired, he reached out. Galliano apologized, saying, "Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society." Parsons acknowledged the controversy in its statement, saying, "We believe that over the past two years, Mr. Galliano has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions.
