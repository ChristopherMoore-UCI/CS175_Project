Americans who follow the gun-control debate have stopped expecting change in the wake of events like today's shooting for the simple reason of precedent: If Aurora, Oak Creek, Tuscon and Columbine haven't changed the politics of gun control, why should we believe the tragedy in Newtown will have a different outcome? There were almost no spikes of popular interest in gun control after "smaller" mass shootings, like that in Oak Creek. It's also filled with friends demanding that America take action on gun control. The NRA's most powerful weapon against gun control isn't postcard campaigns, primary battles or political advertising. So long as we assume gun control is impossible, we don't talk about gun control.
