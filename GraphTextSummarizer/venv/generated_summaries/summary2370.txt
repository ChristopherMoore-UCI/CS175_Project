Manchester City's mercurial talent Mario Balotelli was a constant threat to England and saw a close range effort blocked by Hart, before Wayne Rooney set up his Manchester United teammate Danny Welbeck, only to see him to fire over from a good position. England also went close when Buffon was forced to claw away a Glen Johnson effort. Italy ended the half the stronger team -- Antonio Cassano had a snap shot parried by Hart, while Balotelli ballooned over from close range. In extra time, Diamanti saw his intended cross deceive Hart and hit the outside of the post, as the Italians continued to dominate possession. Man of the match Andrea Pirlo then pulled Italy level at 2-2 with an impudent chip over Joe Hart, before Ashley Cole saw his effort saved by Gianluigi Buffon.
