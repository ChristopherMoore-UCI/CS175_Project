Samson was known for enormous physical strength and his fighting prowess against the Philistines, the enemy of the Israelites. She said the only other images of Samson in synagogues are at one nearby place in the Galilee known as Wadi Hamam, where Samson is seen "smiting" the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass. Magness said the mosaic scene shows Samson putting torches between the tails of foxes. Jodi Magness, a professor of early Judaism in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the building was found in a recent excavation. Samson is also depicted in early Christian art, she said.
