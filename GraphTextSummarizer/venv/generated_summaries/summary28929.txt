The Defense Ministry told Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency that both missiles have "high penetration and destructive powers. On Friday, Iran's foreign minister said he believes a solution will be reached over a proposed deal to export uranium for enrichment abroad, a demand of Western nations that worry that Tehran plans to use its program to build nuclear weapons. The West suspects Iran of trying to build nuclear bombs, but Iran says its program is for peaceful power generation. "The discussions are still being conducted, and we will inform the nation of any final agreements," said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, on Wednesday according to the state-run Iranian Labour News Agency. Earlier this week, Iran's atomic energy chief said no deal had been struck to export uranium for enrichment.
