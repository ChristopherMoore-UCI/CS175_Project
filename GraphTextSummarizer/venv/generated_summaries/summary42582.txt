As of Sunday, NTC troops were patrolling areas south of Sirte to try to cut off supplies to pro-Gadhafi forces still controlling the town. Al-Rai, which is based in Syria, has been pro-Gadhafi. " In response to the latest Amnesty International report alleging Gadhafi forces committed crimes against humanity, he said, "Most of those international organizations have no legitimacy and they have ... pro-imperialist and pro-colonization" agendas. The troops were sweeping nearby areas to prevent other pro-Gadhafi towns from offering Sirte aid. Meanwhile, al-Rai TV aired what it called a live phone call from Musa Ibrahim, a spokesman for ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
