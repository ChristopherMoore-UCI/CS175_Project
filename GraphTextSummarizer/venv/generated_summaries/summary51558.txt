On Saturday, a senior Iranian official said an attack on Syria would be regarded as a strike against Iran and its allies, according to Iran's semi-official Mehr News Agency. Forty-four of the deaths were in Aleppo province, 40 in Damascus and its suburbs, and 18 in Homs province. NATO foreign ministers decided in December to deploy the batteries after Syria launched Scud missiles near the Turkish border. At least 129 people were killed across the country Saturday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. The group also said 13 unidentified civilians had been killed "by regime forces' gunfire" around Daraya, the Damascus suburb where opposition activists had reported at least 245 people found dead over one August weekend.
