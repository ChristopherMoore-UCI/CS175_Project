The United States and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile, a charge the rebels have denied. MH17 was en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 17 when it was apparently shot down by a missile as it flew over Ukraine. Amirah Prawira Kusuma, who will be buried in the Netherlands at the request of her family, according to a statement from Malaysian Transport Minister Dato' Sri Liow Tiong Lai. The last Malaysian identified was Allahyarhamah Puan Sri Siti A preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board in September supported that theory, saying the plane was hit by "high-energy objects," but it did not cast blame.
