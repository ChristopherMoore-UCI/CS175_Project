"Houghton's book is now the only known book at Harvard bound in human skin," said the library, the college's main repository for rare books and manuscripts. "Termed anthropodermic bibliopegy, the binding of books in human skin has occurred at least since the 16th century," it said. Experts at Harvard said this week that they have confirmed that a 19th-century book housed in one of the university's libraries is bound in human skin. The Crimson, Harvard's college newspaper, reported in 2006 that there were at least three books in the university's vast collection that were bound in human skin. But Houghton Library said that testing of the other two volumes, at the Harvard Law School Library and the Harvard Medical School's Countway Library, established that they were actually wrapped in sheepskin.
