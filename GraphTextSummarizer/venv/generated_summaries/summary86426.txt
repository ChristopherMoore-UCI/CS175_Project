State sites seemed to fare better As of Friday afternoon, at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans. While 36 states are using Healthcare.gov as the gateway to sign up new insurance customers, 14 states and the District of Columbia are running their own sign-up sites. CNN reached its sign-up figures by combining what states report as "enrolled," and what they're calling "almost enrolled." The law's impact varies widely state to state.
