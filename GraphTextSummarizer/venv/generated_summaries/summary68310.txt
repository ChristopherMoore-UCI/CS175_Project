In Barboursville, West Virginia, Brett Walker said, "the scene at Chick-fil-A seemed like a massive silent protest." Walker told iReport he chose to eat at the restaurant Wednesday "in support of free speech" and waited 40 minutes to receive his order. Wendy Neill of Searcy, Arkansas, told iReport she brought her two daughters, ages 12 and 14, with her to Chick-fil-A on Wednesday. Throngs of people weighed in on the Chick-fil-A debate at stores across the United States on Wednesday, buying chicken sandwiches to show their support for the restaurant chain and its president's opposition to same-sex marriage. In the Atlanta area, CNN affiliate WSB warned of traffic delays around Chick-fil-As. Proponents of same-sex marriage organized a simple counterprotest for Wednesday, asking people to donate the approximate cost of a Chick-fil-A meal, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups, according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, known as GLAAD.
