Negotiating teams from Sudan and South Sudan have agreed to end a dispute on oil payments to allow the resumption of southern oil exports through Sudan's territories, Sudan's state-run Ashorooq TV reported early Saturday, citing official sources. The South Sudan state of Upper Nile has been flooded with refugees crossing the border from Sudan. Sudan's economy has suffered since the separation of South Sudan last year, which took with it nearly 75% of the country's oil wealth. In total, aid agencies estimate that at least 150,000 refugees from Sudan are currently in South Sudan. South Sudan halted oil production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $815 million worth of its crude.
