According to KernGoldenEmpire.com, the clown's appearances -- and subsequent social media postings -- in the San Joaquin Valley city are part of a photography project launched by a husband and wife team who wish to remain anonymous. The Los Angeles Times said Bakersfield police arrested a teen in another incident in which he allegedly dressed as a clown and pursued other teens, scaring them. "We've had multiple (sightings) of these clown sightings all over town," Bakersfield police Lt. Jason Matson told the publication. Coulrophobia is the formal term for the fear of clowns. But copycat clowns have arrived on the scene, including one who was reportedly armed.
