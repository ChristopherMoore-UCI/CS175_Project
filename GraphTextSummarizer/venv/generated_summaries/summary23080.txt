"The Club was founded in 1886 by a group of women who had studied at university (but at that time were not allowed to graduate) and found that there were no facilities for educated women in London at that time," says chairman Ann Hallam who is a consultant at a city law firm. But it's a pretty exclusive place, women thinking of becoming members must be proposed and seconded by two existing members, those applicants who do not know a member will be invited to see the premises and to meet some of the members informally. Mary Aitken, founder and CEO of Verity explained that women have until now, "existed in a work/home rut" with no physical place to go, unlike their male counterparts who had clubs. "There's been a paradigm shift which means that increasingly women are seeking out other women's company. Not content with just gaining entry to these clubs, women are starting to create their exclusive spaces, but they are a far cry from the old cigar infused billiard rooms of old.
