At the time, the state of Texas provided automatic admission to its flagship university for in-state students finishing in the top 10% of their high schools. The issue now before an arguably more conservative high court is whether the Texas policies should be re-evaluated, as states have had nearly a decade to put such diversity considerations into place. Despite that high court ruling, some states, including California, do not allow race considerations in college admissions. In a statement issued after the high court agreed to hear the case, the University of Texas defended its admissions process, saying "it is vital for the university to weigh a multitude of factors when making admissions decisions about the balance of students who will make up each entering class. "Using race in admissions decisions, to achieve diversity, amounts to stereotyping people by their race," said Joshua Thompson of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which filed a legal brief in support of Fisher.
