"Ms. Paviglianiti was not terminated from her employment, she presently is on maternity leave and she has the right to return to work upon the conclusion of her leave. "My client declines to comment on pending legal action except to say it considers that Ms. Paviglianiti allegations are without merit," attorney Robert F. Milman said in a statement. In this case, that means Paviglianiti would have had to be hired as a "model and a bartender" and get a written agreement to this -- as is done in the casino industry, Bond said on HLN Prime News with Mike Galanos. When asked by Galanos if she signed any paperwork of that sort, Paviglianiti said, "not at all ... nothing." Due to the tough economy, Paviglianiti says she needed this specific bartending job and feared she'd soon be out of work.
