Last October, The Unseen's designers -- founder Lauren Bowker, Christa Leask and Jess Smith -- moved base from a cluttered studio in the vaults under Somerset House to a room in the building's new wing. This was the public's formal introduction to The Unseen, a trio of London fashion designers using chemistry, digital technology and exquisite tailoring to create fashion magic. The three sculptural leather jackets are infused with dye formulas that change color in response to different stimuli: friction, the temperature and humidity of the room, and intense heat. A bejeweled headdress, created with Swarovski's gemstones division, changes color based on the heat generated by the wearer's neural activity, thanks to hyper-conductive stones and heat-sensitive ink. "For me, it's more of an exploration house," says Bowker.
