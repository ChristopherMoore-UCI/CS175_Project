Roth is perhaps best known for his outings with famed director Quentin Tarantino. -- Actor Tim Roth is in an abandoned building near downtown Los Angeles, and he's about to mix things up. "I'm breaking into the interrogation to get information out of him using the sort of techniques that my character espouses as opposed to pressuring him." Roth, who plays Dr. Cal Lightman on the hit Fox series "Lie to Me," is shooting scenes for the season finale, which will air May 13. His character is based on Dr. Paul Ekman, a specialist who reads clues embedded in the human face, body and voice to expose the truth in criminal investigations. "This is a scene where the FBI is interrogating a suspect," Roth said.
