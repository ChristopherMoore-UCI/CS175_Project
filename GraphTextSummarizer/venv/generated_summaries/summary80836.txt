Ross allegedly sent the bank the Crime Stoppers cash reward list that included legitimate code words as well as tip numbers and code words for tips that Ross had allegedly altered, Jacks said. -- A 26-year police veteran who headed the Dallas Crime Stoppers has been indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the tipster-based crime fighting program, U.S. Attorney James T. Jacks of the Northern District of Texas said Thursday. Crime Stoppers is a nationwide program that offers cash rewards for information from anonymous callers as long as the tip leads to the arrest and indictment of criminals, Jacks said. Once the NTCC gave its approval, the anonymous tipster could call Crime Stoppers with a previously assigned tip number and would be given a tip number and code word, Jacks said. The tip numbers and code words were emailed to JP Morgan Chase Bank, where the anonymous tipster was required to present the tip number and code word to collect the reward, Jacks said.
