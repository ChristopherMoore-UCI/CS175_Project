Watch a panel discuss Jackson's death Â» Based on interviews, visits to Jackson's home as well as records and documents gathered during the investigation, the affidavit provides the following account of Jackson's last days: In May, Jackson hired Murray, a cardiologist. So Murray finally administered 25 milligrams of propofol diluted with lidocaine via Jackson's IV drip. Yet it also opens a window into Jackson's final hours, revealing information about the singer's treatment and the drugs given him by Dr. Conrad Murray, his personal physician, before his death. Three days before Jackson's death -- on June 22 -- Murray gave the singer a combination of drugs that he hoped gradually would move the singer off propofol. Jackson was already familiar with propofol, a powerful anesthetic, Murray said.
