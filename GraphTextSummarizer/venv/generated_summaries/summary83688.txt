Redundant phone boxes in Sydney, New York and other cities are being turned into free Wi-Fi hotspots, while several villages in England have equipped theirs with defibrillators. The Solarbox is not the only unused phone box to be transformed into a new creation -- there are phone box libraries, sofas and even shower booths. It was designed by London School of Economics graduates Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenney, in response to a competition run by the Mayor of London. "By using solar power and repurposing old phone boxes we have been able to provide a real solution in an environmentally friendly way," she said. One of London's famous red telephone boxes has been painted green and transformed into a solar-powered charging station, as part of a design competition.
