But on Tuesday, like everyone else in the mountainous California country known as Big Bear Lake, they were thinking about fugitive ex-cop Christopher Dorner. But before the first officer had time to warn his colleagues or pick up the radio, Dorner rolled down his window and pumped multiple pistol rounds into the second Fish and Wildlife truck as the two vehicles passed on narrow, twisty Glass Road. Two house cleaners told police earlier in the day that a man they thought was Dorner tied them up and took their Nissan. Next, Dorner ditched Heltebrake's truck, ran into the woods and barricaded himself inside a cabin owned by Candy Martin. One officer got out of the second vehicle and fired multiple rounds from his AR-15 rifle at Dorner's vehicle.
