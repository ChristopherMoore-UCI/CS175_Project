And the other thing, too, that I really felt bad about is that Daniel Murphy and Tori Murphy were dragged into a conversation, and their whole life was exposed. During a conversation on his radio show with co-host Craig Carton, Esiason, a father of two, said he would never have done what Murphy did. " Esiason said he tried to reach out to Murphy to apologize personally, but it does not appear that they connected. "That's the choice of parents that they get to make," Murphy said on Thursday, before Esiason's public apology. Esiason made his comments during an exchange with his co-host, who thought Murphy should have gotten back to work once the baby was born instead of taking an additional day of paternity leave.
