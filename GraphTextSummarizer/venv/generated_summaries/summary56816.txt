After Monday's 1-1 draw at The Hawthorns -- a result which left West Brom 13th in the English Premier League table -- Anelka took to his official Twitter account to thank the club for its backing. However, new West Brom manager Pepe Mel showed his support for Anelka by selecting him for his first game in charge against Everton -- and the club said Tuesday he would remain available for selection until the FA makes its ruling. -- Controversial French soccer star Nicolas Anelka faces a possible five-match suspension after being charged by the English Football Association (FA) Tuesday for making a "quenelle" gesture last month. "Zoopla has been reviewing its position over the past few weeks in light of the actions of striker, Nicolas Anelka, during the match against West Ham over the Christmas period, and has decided to focus its attention on other marketing activities after this season," the company said in a statement. After making the gesture against West Ham, Anelka agreed to his club's request that he would not repeat it.
