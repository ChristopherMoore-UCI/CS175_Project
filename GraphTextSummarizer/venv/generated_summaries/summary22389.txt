South Korean prosecutors are seeking an arrest warrant for the former Korean Air executive Heather Cho who sparked outrage by kicking a flight attendant off a plane for serving macadamia nuts the wrong way. 'Violent language Testimonies of crew members and passengers confirm that Cho used "violent language in a loud voice," which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said last week. Because of that, the airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight, the ministry said last week. The office said that prosecutors had raided the office and residence of a government official at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport who was suspected of leaking information on the investigation into the case to Yeo. Cho, whose Korean name is Cho Hyun-ah, said she accepted "full responsibility" for what happened.
