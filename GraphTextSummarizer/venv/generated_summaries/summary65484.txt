In his homily, the 82-year-old pontiff asked parishioners to consider the possible effect of an ecological crisis on the stability and peace of the world -- a world in which there is increasing competition for the "fruitfulness of the Earth." "Can we remain impassive in the face of actual and potential conflicts involving access to natural resources?" Pope Benedict XVI challenged the faithful to be good stewards of what "God has given us," suggesting that peace with the Earth will lead to peace on Earth. In his address, called "If You Want to Cultivate Peace, Protect Creation," the pope said peace with the natural environment is the beginning of peace with all of God's creation, including people. The papal message of peace comes a week after the traditional Christmas address known as "Urbi et Orbi" -- Latin for "To the City and the World" -- a message of hope for the world's afflicted. "For this reason, it is imperative that mankind renew and strengthen that covenant between human beings and the environment, which should mirror the creative love of God, from whom we come and toward whom we are journeying," he said.
