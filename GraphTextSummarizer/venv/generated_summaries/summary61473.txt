When it comes to abortion, minors are supposed to enjoy the same constitutional right of privacy as adults, free from undue state interference. It's not surprising that court procedures vary wildly, and that sooner or later, a state like Alabama would experiment with state abortion law. State courts and legislatures are not completely to blame; after all, the law of minors and juveniles is always going to be about some difficult but arbitrary line-drawing. Whether the boundary lines of judicial bypass ebb toward the autonomy of minors, or back toward the state interest in the fetus, the broader social "findings" of judicial bypass proceedings will always remain the same: It's all very sad. While the bypass is a common feature of abortion laws in other states, this Alabama law may have gone too far.
