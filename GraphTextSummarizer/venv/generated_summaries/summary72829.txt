She has the White House staff at her disposal, but that didn't stop first lady Michelle Obama from making a Target run in a Virginia suburb of Washington Thursday. White House officials declined to provide any details of Thursday's outing, saying to protect her privacy they don't release information about the first lady's personal activities. Dressed casually in a gray Nike hat, loose floral blouse, black pants and red flats, the first lady was seen pushing a cart and carrying several bags from the mega-retailer at a Target in Alexandria, Virginia. In an interview with CNN, the manager of the Target where Obama shopped said the first lady went unrecognized while she was in the store. When she left we thought 'Oh, that's what that was!'" In May, Michelle Obama told Oprah Winfey that casual shopping trips were one of the things she missed from her life before the White House.
