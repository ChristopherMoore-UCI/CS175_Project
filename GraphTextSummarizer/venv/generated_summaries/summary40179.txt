A decision on what NATO officials are calling "no-fly plus" could come as early as Sunday after a meeting of NATO ambassadors. "In the course of a single week NATO allies have launched both the arms embargo and the no-fly zone operations," said NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu. The tone of mission, however, already seems to have shifted, with NATO commanders attempting to enforce the U.N. resolution to the letter of the law. After days of acrimonious discussion, NATO officials hailed their decision to take command as swift and historic and vowed a "seamless" transition of leadership from the United States to NATO, which could happen as early as Sunday. The main question, the officials said, is whether NATO forces should attack Gadhafi's military as part of the mission to protect civilians.
