Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton confirmed in a news conference Monday that Michigan authorities have been in contact with police in Virginia, saying "there are some similarities" between the assaults in both states. Leyton confirmed Michigan authorities are in touch with police in Toledo, but declined to definitively link that attack, saying "it is very fresh and we just obtained the information." The Toledo Police Department's Wauford said the method of attack in the Ohio case matched the Michigan incidents. The suspect is described by Michigan authorities as a white man in his late 20s to early 30s. Virginia authorities provided a similar description: an older model 1995-2000 Chevy S-10 Blazer with a dark green upper and a lighter tan or beige color on the lower panels.
