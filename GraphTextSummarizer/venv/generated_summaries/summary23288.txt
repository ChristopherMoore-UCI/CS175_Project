The highlight of my Paralympic games was the crowd tonight! -- South African "blade runner" Oscar Pistorius smashed a Paralympic record to win the men's 400m T44 in the final athletics event of the 2012 Games. Opinion: Pistorius, an inspiration and a question It was Pistorius' only individual gold medal win of the Paralympic Games. From the side of the track, Pistorius described their blades as being "unbelievably long." "You can't compete on stride length," he said. Pistorius, who suffered a shock defeat in the 200m to Brazilian Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira, covered the 400m in the record time of 46.68 seconds.
