-- With hundreds of communities nationwide forced to slash budgets and layoff police officers, the disclosure Thursday of which cities would receive federal grants to fund police positions had been eagerly awaited. Federal funds will go for new police hires in those areas, except for Sacramento, which will use the funds to re-hire officers furloughed, officials said. "The officers that we will get through this program, through this grant, will be men and women to help us keep the city safe," declared Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt. "There is almost nothing more effective in keeping the public safe than cops on the beat who have the equipment and resources they need," said Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli. Officials acknowledge there remains a continuing hunger for federal assistance among state, county, and local law enforcement agencies.
