The so-called after-action review is taking a look at how officers from the Ferguson and St. Louis County police departments and the Missouri State Police handled everything from crowd control to arrests to interaction with the media, according to a Justice Department official. A new Justice Department panel is reviewing the police response to 16 days of protests and disturbances after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer. The first test of the new federal COPS training is expected soon, when a St. Louis County grand jury decides whether to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for shooting Brown. The team started its assessment last week with a visit to Ferguson, conducting interviews with police officials and people who interacted with the police during the 16 days in August. Ronald Davis, who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, has led efforts to train St. Louis area police to improve how they respond to protests.
