-- An honest taxi driver and forgetful passenger have left Hong Kong police trying to sort out who has a rightful claim on more than $250,000 in cash left in the back of a cab. Hong Kong law dictates that after three months, the police may return Hong Kong property to the finder. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, police are seeking legal advice over the case which began in the middle of last year. Huen Wong of the Law Society in Hong Kong believes in the end the owner will have a better claim to the money than taxi driver. He could also say exactly where and when he boarded and left the cab and other details," a police officer told the SCMP.
