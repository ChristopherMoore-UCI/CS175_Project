-- Under fire after veterans died waiting for appointments at VA hospitals, Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki will say Thursday that he is "angered and saddened" but won't be providing much detail about how his department is correcting the problems, according to prepared congressional testimony obtained by CNN. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list Since November, CNN has uncovered delays in care at VA facilities across the country where numerous VA staffers have stepped forward to allege dangerously long wait times and efforts by VA officials to cover them up. The VA has previously admitted that 23 veterans passed away because of delays, and 53 others had adverse health effects at VA facilities across the country. Sources now tell CNN the Office of Inspector General is investigating in six states, including Arizona. President Barack Obama has appointed Rob Nabors, his deputy chief of staff, to assist Veterans Affairs officials conduct the review.
