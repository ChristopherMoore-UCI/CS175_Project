Last summer, an NRC task force reviewed the Fukushima accident and came up with a dozen recommendations to reduce U.S. reactor vulnerability. The Fukushima and U.S. reactors also lack control-room instruments that would monitor spent fuel pool water levels and temperature. Immediately after the accident, some argued that U.S. reactors are not as vulnerable. The NRC is downplaying its task force's most important recommendation and potentially undermining efforts to improve U.S. reactor safety. For example, the General Electric Mark I reactors at Fukushima, like the 23 Mark I reactors in the United States, had hardened vents to release heat and relieve pressure from their containment buildings during an accident.
