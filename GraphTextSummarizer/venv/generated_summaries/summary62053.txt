Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. China was outraged, as were groups of its citizens who protested violently in several Chinese cities, calling for boycotts of Japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back. It's the second time this month that Japan has launched fighter jets, alleging Chinese planes appeared to be closing in on its air space. Japan's defense ministry said two Chinese planes came within miles of its airspace, prompting authorities to scramble Japanese fighter jets. Protests erupted in China after Japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private Japanese owners.
