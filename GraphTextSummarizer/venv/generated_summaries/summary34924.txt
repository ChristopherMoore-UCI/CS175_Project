The men worked for a company called Upgrade, according to Erica Dumas, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The men were identified as Juan Lizama, 41, of New Jersey, and Juan Lopez, 33, of the Bronx, according to 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents about 600 window cleaners in New York City. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said emergency personnel from the NYPD, the New York Fire Department and Port Authority police practiced a rescue from such a rig 10 days ago. A Twitter photo from the fire department showed the rig as seen from inside the tower, with New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. In the 2013 incident, two workers were rescued more than 550 feet above the streets of midtown Manhattan after their scaffolding buckled near the top of the tower, fire officials said.
