Bolt was making his first appearance in the competition this season after a hamstring injury kept him out of previous events in Qatar and Oregon. -- Six-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt was beaten into second place by Justin Gatlin in the 100 meters at the Diamond League's Rome meeting. "You can never count out Usain, he lost both races at his nationals last year and came back and was Olympic champion in both races. "I got the perfect start that I wanted, then about five steps in I stumbled a little bit and that kind of threw my game off," Bolt told the BBC. "Usain Bolt is a great competitor and great champion so to come out here and have a victory it just stands that I'm having a good season.
