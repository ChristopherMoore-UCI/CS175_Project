-- Investigators suspect arson in a fire that heavily damaged a small post office in rural western Nevada Sunday morning, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman said. "It's pretty bad," said David Rupert, describing the damage to the Verdi, Nevada, post office, which is located about 10 miles from Reno. The fire began outside of the building, which houses postal boxes for about 800 residents, but water sprayed by firefighters soaked the mail inside, Rupert said. The wet but unburned mail was taken to a postal facility in Reno to be resorted and delivered to customers, he said. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and investigators from the U.S. Postal Inspector's office are conducting the probe, he said.
