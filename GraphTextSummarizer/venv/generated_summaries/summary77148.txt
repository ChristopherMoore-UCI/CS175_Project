Somalia's Al-Shabaab rebel movement has tightened its ties to the al Qaeda terror network, with its leader pledging loyalty to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. But in an audio message posted on Al-Shabaab's website Thursday, the Somali group's leader, Mukhtar Abu al-Zubair, tells al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri that his followers "will march with you as loyal soldiers. " Al-Zawahiri took command of al Qaeda after U.S. commandos killed the movement's founder, Osama bin Laden, last May. The Islamist militants control much of southern Somalia and have long been affiliated with al Qaeda. AU and government forces drove Al-Shabaab fighters from the center of the Somali capital  Mogadishu last year, while Kenyan troops crossed into southern Somalia in October to hit back for a rash of kidnappings it blamed on the group.
