-- Two Minnesota state lawmakers said Friday that they have reached a deal to compensate victims of the Interstate 35 bridge collapse that killed 13 people in Minneapolis last year. State Sen. Ron Latz and state Rep. Ryan Winkler told CNN Radio that the deal totals $38 million and will be presented to the Legislature for approval. Thirteen people were killed and dozens were injured in last year's collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Winkler said victims will be able to collect up to $400,000 and people whose damages exceed $400,000 will be able to pull from a supplemental pool of more than $12 million. The plan addresses a key sticking point in negotiations: preserving a state liability cap on awards to individual victims, Latz said.
