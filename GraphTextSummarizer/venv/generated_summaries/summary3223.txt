" Ironically it was Nadal that refused to be drawn on the issue of the blue clay after he had comfortably beaten Russia's Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets 6-2 6-2 on Wednesday. "I never was in control of the match, I didn't know how to win a point,"  Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed. The shock defeat will reopen the debate about the Madrid Open's use of blue clay. Considered arguably the greatest player to ever set foot on clay, Nadal had recently won in Monte Carlo -- a record eighth title -- before clinching his seventh tournament victory in Barcelona. The loss was the first defeat of the clay court season for the six-time French  Open champion.
