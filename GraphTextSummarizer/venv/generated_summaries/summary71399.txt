-- Wildlife researchers using hidden cameras have captured rare images of snow leopards in a remote mountainous region of Tajikistan -- including shots of a cub stealing one of the cameras. "This survey has revealed an unusually high number of snow leopards in the Wakhan Mountains, which indicates that this could be a key region for snow leopard conservation." "Snow leopards have low population densities, which means that large areas need to be protected in order to conserve this species effectively," said Dr. Alex Diment of the FFI. When researchers went to the sites in the Zorkul nature reserve to retrieve their cameras, which have motion detectors on them to trigger the shutter, they found images showing at least five of the rare cats, including a family with two cubs, FFI said in a statement last week. A research team sponsored by the conservation groups Fauna and Flora International (FFI) and Panthera set up 11 camera stations in the rugged Wakhan valley near the Afghan border and left them for three months to record what passed by.
