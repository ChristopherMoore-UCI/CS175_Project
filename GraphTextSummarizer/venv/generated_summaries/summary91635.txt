The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that Ivey exploited a defect in the line of cards used by the casino to increase his chances of winning in multiple sessions of the card game Baccarat. The Borgata claims that Ivey used a technique called "edge sorting" to identify cards by memorizing the unique markings on the back of the card. During play, Ivey and card player Cheng Yin Sun fixated on pattern flaws on the backs of the cards. "Ivey's true motive, intention, and purpose in negotiating these playing arrangements was to create a situation in which he could surreptitiously manipulate what he knew to be a defect in the playing cards in order to gain an unfair advantage over Borgata," according to court papers. Ivey represents other elite high-stakes poker players on his own "Team Ivey."
