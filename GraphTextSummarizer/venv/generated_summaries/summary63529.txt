Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. issued his ruling on Friday afternoon, two days after a hearing in response to Orlando TV station WKMG's July motion to unseal the footage. In his ruling, Perry found that "the jail video does not constitute a medical record or other form of health care data relating to the evaluation or treatment of Ms. Anthony's physical or mental health condition." Video showing Casey Anthony rocking and hunched over upon hearing remains had been found in the search for her 2-year-old daughter was released Friday, after a Florida judge overturned a decision to seal the footage because it was considered inflammatory. After a few minutes, law enforcement officers talk to Anthony and take her to another room. "The reason for sealing (the video) -- Ms. Anthony's right to a fair trial -- is no longer applicable because the trial has been completed and she has been acquitted of all charges other than lying to law enforcement officers," wrote Perry, before ordering the state attorney's office to release the video.
