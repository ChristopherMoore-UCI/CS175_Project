Mercado also suffered 12 stab wounds in the stomach, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Friday. Cesar Mercado, the consul of Nicaragua in New York, was found with his throat slashed in his apartment in the Bronx last week. "We are asking for an investigation in the United States as soon as possible, to be able bring our fallen brother back to his birthplace ... for a Christian burial," President Daniel Ortega said at an event in Nicaragua's capital Saturday. His body was found just inside the door of a small, sixth-floor studio apartment in the Bronx on Thursday morning by a driver who had taken him to the United Nations the day before, Kelly said. Kelly described a "hesitation wound" in Mercado's neck, one that was not delivered in a single motion.
