A delegation of twelve South Korean government officials and businessmen crossed the border into North Korea's Kumgang tourist resort to try to resolve a dispute over South Korean assets there. North Korea told the South to "go back" according to Lee Jong-Joo, a spokeswoman for South Korea's Unification Ministry, insisting they would not talk with anyone from the government itself. Seoul suspended tours in 2008 after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier after walking into an off-limit area. The joint project was started in 1998 to boost reconciliation and give North Korea a chance to earn money. The last discussion at the Mount Kumgang resort was in April 2010 but that did not include government officials.
