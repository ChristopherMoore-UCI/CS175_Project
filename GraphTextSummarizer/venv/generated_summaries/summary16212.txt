-- UEFA president Michel Platini is confident German Chancellor Angela Merkel would attend the final of Euro 2012 in Ukraine -- if Germany reach the tournament's showpiece in Kiev on July 1. "I'm not worried about the situation," Platini told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of Saturday's Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the German city. Looking ahead to Saturday's showpiece event between Chelsea and Bayern, Platini insisted that that best two teams had reached the final, despite the widely held view that their respective semifinal opponents -- Barcelona and Real Madrid -- are Europe's strongest teams. " As well as dealing with the political fall-out from Ukraine's strained relationship with the West, UEFA is implementing a set of financial regulations -- Financial Fair Play (FFP) - that are designed to compel most teams to live within their means. I didn't see Barcelona be better than Chelsea and I didn't see Real Madrid be better than Bayern in these games," said the UEFA president.
