Talks between the United States and Iran on the Tehran's nuclear program will resume in Geneva on Friday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said. Iran insists that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zari and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are scheduled to join the talks in Geneva on Sunday and Monday, Araqchi said. "At the end of the four days of bilateral talks between Iranian and US nuclear delegations, discussions will possibly continue with participation of all members of the Group 5+1," Araqchi said. Speaking to Iran's IRNA news agency, Araqchi said the talks will be at the deputy ministerial level, followed by a meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers.
