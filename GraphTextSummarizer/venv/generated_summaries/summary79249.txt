"When you spend the whole day at some place like a theme park or zoo, you want everyone in your family to enjoy it -- young and old," said Travis Katz, CEO and co-founder of travel planning site Gogobot. The 15 best attractions in the U.S. for kids, announced Tuesday as part of Gogobot's Travelers' Favorites awards, were selected based on Gogobot user recommendations and the number of visits from the site's 3.7 million users. That's what the site's favorite spots for kids have in common, Katz said. Plus, there's an evening event for adults only on the first Thursday of each month, with a cash bar and film screenings in addition to the exhibits. "The slogan at the entrance says 'Touch Everything,' making it more like a giant playground than a museum," Katz said.
