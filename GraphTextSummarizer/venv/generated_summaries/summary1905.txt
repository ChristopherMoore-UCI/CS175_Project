Last season there was shock among fans when singer Jesse Campbell, one of the favorites to win the title, was eliminated by coach Christina Aguilera. Cee Lo Green, Blake Shelton, Adam Levine and Christina Aguilera -- all four coaches of "The Voice" -- joined producer Mark Burnett, host Carson Daly and the show's social media maven Christina Milian for a press conference Sunday night at Burnett's Malibu home. "Over time we see how each of us react as coaches, giving such heartfelt advice and attention to these up-and-coming young fresh talents and it's so nice to see," she said. The new components add another element to what Levine, Aguilera and Shelton call "the best season yet." Looking out at the panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean, Levine quipped, "So this is what reality TV buys you." That, or maybe just knowing what makes for good TV.
