-- A day and a half after he was arrested on a drunk-driving charge, FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt co-piloted a government jet to North Carolina as part of a proficiency flight, Federal Aviation Administration officials confirmed Wednesday. "Randy Babbitt served as a licensed pilot and maintained qualifications to fly FAA airplanes on official business," the FAA said. On Monday, Babbitt went on a proficiency flight in an FAA aircraft, departing Reagan National Airport near Washington, flying to Hickory, North Carolina, and then on to Charlotte, where the plane landed for fuel before returning to Washington. The FAA said administrators with pilot's licenses are permitted to fly FAA aircraft. FAA officials said Babbitt had no official duties over the weekend.
