"Some people in my family are more into flat racing (his father owns one of the most important thoroughbred racing operations in the world), some are more into endurance racing. Many of these animals are ex-racehorses, gradually trained and brought up to fitness to compete in endurance races. Today, the horses will complete laps of a 30 km (18.6 miles) course, stopping for checks at the end of each lap. Although the sport is ancient in its origins, today's races are as professional as they are competitive, with horses conditioned to the peak of fitness and subject to rigorous veterinary inspections both during and after the race. The enduring appeal of such a sport is easy to understand; physically and strategically demanding, it is also an expression of the extreme respect with which horses -- particularly Arabian ones -- are treated in this part of the world.
