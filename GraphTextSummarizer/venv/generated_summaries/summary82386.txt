On Tuesday, Berlusconi won a parliamentary vote approving a new budget that includes austerity measures sought by international lenders, but lost his majority in parliament. But Italian lawmakers, for their part, could approve the new austerity measures as early as Saturday, officials say, compelling Berlusconi to resign shortly thereafter. -- Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said Wednesday that his country will adopt a series of austerity measures promised to the European Union, as officials try to allay investor fears and head off a eurozone debt crisis. The bond yields -- which represent the level of risk of lending Italy money -- surged to their highest levels since the euro was launched in 1999. Berlusconi told Italian newspaper La Stampa that his decision gives him freedom.
