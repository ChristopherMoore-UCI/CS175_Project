The Saturday night encounter came the same day Florida wildlife officials warned that black bears and their cubs have started moving around in search of food after winter. "Now is the time to expect bears to show up looking for food," Dave Telesco, the head of the wildlife commission's bear management program, said in Saturday's advisory. The agency urges residents to use bear-resistant trash cans to prevent incidents like the one on Saturday night. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Greg Workman said initial reports that several bears had attacked the woman were wrong. Jeff Hudson said the woman had an "encounter with a black bear" but could not confirm the reports of multiple bears being involved in the incident.
