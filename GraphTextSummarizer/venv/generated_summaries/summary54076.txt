Justice John Paul Stevens dissented in the case, noting, "Accidents happen, but they seldom give rise to criminal liability. The court nevertheless holds that petitioner is subject to a mandatory additional sentence -- a species of criminal liability -- for an accident that caused no harm." But in his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said federal law "does not require that the discharge be done knowingly or intentionally." He openly called Dean the "bungling bank robber" and quoted one patron's reaction to the bank gunshot: "Melissa in the lobby popped up and said, 'Oh, my God, has he shot Nora?' " "Those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for an inadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm, handle it with care during the underlying violent or drug trafficking crime, leave the gun at home, or -- best yet -- avoid committing the felony in the first place," Roberts wrote That brought barely contained laughter in the audience of several hundred gathered in the courtroom.
