The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game pits members of Congress against a media team to raise money for young women in their fight against breast cancer. Wasserman Schultz, who battled breast cancer, agreed during the joint interview at an early rainy morning practice. But on the diamond, Capito and Wasserman Schultz insist politics is put aside as they focus on two common goals: beating the press and cancer. After numerous easily won congressional contests in West Virginia's second district, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito is vying for the open senate seat in her state. But for the sake of beating the media team, which they've done one in five games, and for raising money for young cancer survivors, they maintain that the field is a "refuge" for the 20 members who can put their smart phones down, pick up a bat and enjoy the early morning turf field.
