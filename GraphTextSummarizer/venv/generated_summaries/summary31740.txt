Rescue and recovery crews have been combing through damaged buildings since the quake struck three days ago -- toppling buildings, buckling streets and ripping the facades of iconic churches, including the Christchurch Cathedral and the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. The death toll from the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that demolished parts of Christchurch, New Zealand, last week has climbed to 147, authorities said Sunday. Southern New Zealand has been hit by a series of quakes since September 4 when a 7.1-magnitude temblor struck the area. She jumped on her bike and pedaled down to the fallen building to see if she could find her husband in the mess of mangled steel and rubble. There were no deaths from that quake, which struck deeper below ground and farther away from Christchurch.
