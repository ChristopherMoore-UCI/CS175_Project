Mandatory evacuation orders had grown from 1,600 homes to more than 2,200 homes by late Saturday afternoon. At least nine large fires have scorched 407,883 acres across Idaho, which is experiencing the most wildland fire activity of any state, according to the Boise-based National Interagency Fire Center. -- Cloud cover and higher humidity slowed the growth of a wildfire burning in central Idaho this weekend, but officials warned they're not out of the woods yet. "As some of the other large fires in Idaho such as the Elk Fire have ramped down, we have been able to transfer a lot of resources from there to the Beaver Creek Fire," said Jennifer Mislivy, a fire spokeswoman. The fire, located northwest of Hailey and some six miles south of Ketchum, has forced nearby residents to flee.
