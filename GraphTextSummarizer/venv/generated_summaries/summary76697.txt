Smith traveled to Bolivia this week to meet with Ostreicher in prison and to accompany him to a hearing Monday. " Smith this month wrote a letter to Roberta Jacobson, assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, asking her to publicly advocate on Ostreicher's behalf during the General Assembly of the Organization of American States which took place in Bolivia last week. Jacob Ostreicher, a 53-year-old flooring contractor from Brooklyn, New York, has been held at the notorious Palmasola prison in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, since June 2011 on suspicions of money laundering. Bolivian prosecutors have accused Ostreicher of money laundering, though formal charges are yet to be filed. The case is now getting more attention in Washington, as U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, has become a vocal advocate for him.
