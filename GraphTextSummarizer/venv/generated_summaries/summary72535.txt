Pending the outcome of her case, Casimir has been suspended without pay by her employer, Watson Services, which provides food services at West Point, Ferraro said. Casimir has been charged with stealing from the mess hall at the famed military academy in West Point, New York, on January 30. Attempts to contact the military police at West Point, Watson Services and Casimir were unsuccessful. Estelle Casimir pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in White Plains, New York, this month, according to her attorney. According to a signed affidavit, the operations manager on duty at West Point, spotted Casimir trying to hide a black bag with her hand and asked her what it was.
