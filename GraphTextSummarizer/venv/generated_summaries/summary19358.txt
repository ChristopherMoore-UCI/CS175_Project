" ReVille was arrested in October on charges of molesting at least five children in alleged incidents in the Charleston area, unrelated to The Citadel accusations. The Citadel is now facing questions about why it didn't bring the allegations against him to police at the time the former camper's family approached school officials with his story. -- A troubled youth who reported inappropriate sexual conduct by a counselor at The Citadel's now-defunct summer camp told a school lawyer that several other campers had similar encounters, documents released by the military college show. The former camper said his life had gone into a downward spiral after his encounter with ReVille -- but at the time of his interview, he had earned a high-school diploma, was working a steady job and was considering joining the military. The Citadel has said a review of ReVille's records in 2007 revealed no other complaints, and his file included a clean background check.
