"Since Somalia's security forces have committed so many violent abuses against civilians, efforts to strengthen them also need to make them more accountable," said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director for Human Rights Watch. Not only do civilians need emergency aid, they also need protection from military abuses, aid groups said. Two years ago, a cargo ship and crew delivering U.N. aid to Somalia were held and released after 40 days. Ships with aid supplies destined for countries in the region, including Somalia, also have been hijacked in the Indian Ocean. An estimated one-third of Somalia's population desperately needs emergency aid, the international agency Oxfam said, as donors to Somalia met in Brussels, Belgium.
