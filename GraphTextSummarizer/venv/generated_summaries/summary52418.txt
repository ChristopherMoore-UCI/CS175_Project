Six hundred miles away from the snows of Davos, in rainy London members of the Occupy movement are celebrating 100 days since they set up camp outside St Paul's Cathedral, hoping to find solutions to some of the same problems. Instead they pitched their tents around the steps of St Paul's, one of the most famous landmarks in the city: A symbol of London's endurance during the dark days of the Blitz, and a site of celebration, as the venue for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. " Colvin insists, though, that any shift away from the original site will not signify the end of Occupy London -- quite the contrary: Whether or not the St Paul's camp survives, she says, the movement itself will continue to make its presence felt in the coming weeks, months and years. But Jack insists that Occupy is far more relevant to ordinary people than the World Economic Forum, which he says welcomes only the global elite. "By occupying part of the City of London, we have found out a lot, we have raised a lot of issues: The lack of transparency, the lack of accountability, but we don't need to be outside St Paul's to do that any more.
