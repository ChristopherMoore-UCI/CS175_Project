Ju Geng, a second-hand shop in Shanghai's chic French concession, has shelves packed with new or barely used Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermès bags. They range in price from Rmb2,000 ($320) for the cheapest Gucci to Rmb400,000 for a crocodile Birkin from Hermès. But Shanghai shoppers "prefer to be more low profile," she says, noting that their favourite brands are Bottega Veneta, Prada, Céline and Hermès. But as the Chinese market, which many luxury goods companies have come to rely on for growth in recent years, matures, a new brand of luxury shopper is emerging in China: the kind that loves a bargain more than a logo. At one branch of Japanese second-hand chain Brand Off in Shanghai's French concession, a Hermès Birkin with a child's drawing in black marker filling one entire side was priced at Rmb90,000.
