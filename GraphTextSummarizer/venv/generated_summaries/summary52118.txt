While most of us are familiar with the word "meme" as the 21st century's buzzword for the latest trends and multi-media conversations in social media, Internet memes actually have been in active circulation for decades. While the site first began as a humble monument to an awesomely awkward quote uttered by Sean Connery's character in the 2000 drama "Finding Forrester," it inadvertently grew into a major creative hub for mash-ups and parodies of all things pop culture, like "The Picard Song" or "Lindsay Lohan's Unchanging Facial Expressions." Anonymous (2003) The word may nowadays ring a bell with headlines about hacktivism, DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks and Internet vigilantes, but the movement actually started back in 2003 as a far less political group of users on 4chan's /b/ board who would occasionally pull mass pranks on other online communities for their own entertainment under the collective pseudonym "Anonymous" -- a label that was designated to every user on /b/ by default.

FAIL (2003) Yet another classic genre of Internet humor that emerged at the turn of the century, this catch-all term quickly rose to favor in the early 2000s as people on the Internet began coming to terms with the fact that we love to laugh when others fail, a psychological behavior also known by the German word "schadenfreude." In addition to making cats ever so popular, LOLcats also put the Impact font on the map as the standard typeface of Internet humor.
