Marwan greets the situation with aggression -- "if I don't play drums, I'd kill someone" -- and a growing anger at those who have allowed the situation in Baghdad to arise; Firas conceals his feelings behind bravado and laughter; while singer Faisal becomes increasingly withdrawn and introspective. Firas, Tony, Marwan and Faisal, who have all lost friends or family members, know too well that Baghdad is no playground. They claim to be Iraq's only heavy metal band, and the documentary film "Heavy Metal in Baghdad," which premiered at this year's Berlin Film Festival, gives a harrowing glimpse of their everyday life in a city torn apart by war. The crux of the film sees Acrassicauda's members faced with a hard choice: stay in Baghdad and risk getting sucked into the conflict, or flee, abandoning their homes and families, for a slim chance at survival in neighboring Syria. "You have to deal with death and fear every day," adds singer Faisal.
