"Any same-sex couple that satisfies all the requirements for marriage under Missouri law, other than being of different sexes, is legally  entitled to a marriage license," wrote Burlison, a St. Louis circuit judge. Shortly after the ruling, couples marched to St. Louis City Hall to apply for licenses, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. The ruling follows an incident in June, when St. Louis issued marriage licenses to four same-sex couples. "The constitutional challenge to Missouri's historically recognized right to define marriage must be presented to and resolved by the state's highest court," state Attorney General Chris Koster said in a statement. Koster has said that while a lot of state residents have changed their minds and support marriage equality, the constitution has not changed.
