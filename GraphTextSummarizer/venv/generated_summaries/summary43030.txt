-- Australian airline Qantas is shedding another 500 jobs as it seeks to cut costs after a massive fall in net profit in the first half of the financial year. Net profit dived 83% to $45 million (A$42M) in the six months to December due to rising fuel prices and flight cancellations during an industrial dispute in October. Union officials have accused the airline of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs and of putting profits first. " "Improvements in operating cash flow, revenue, yield and unit costs, and record results for Jetstar and Qantas Frequent Flyer, helped offset the financial effect on the Group," he said. Qantas, which has its headquarters in Sydney, is the second-oldest airline in the world and marked its 90th anniversary last year.
