Despite the inclusion on list of foreign policy advisors released by his camp of Republican gurus James Baker and George Schultz, Bush had little in common with the subtle internationalism of his father George H.W. Bush. Jeb Bush revealed his strategy for dealing with the polarizing foreign policy legacy of his brother: Make a quick declaration of independence then pivot to a searing attack on the failings abroad of President Barack Obama. " Bush did little to deviate from Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. Bush is a more cerebral, cautious character than his brother and his speech lacked the bristling rhetoric of George W. Bush which Democrats often decried as a symptom of cowboy diplomacy. Bush made a case that Obama's politics had tipped the world into chaos, played to the GOP's base and avoided unveiling new policies that could get ripped to shreds in the long months on the campaign trail.
