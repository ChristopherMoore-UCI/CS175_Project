Homeland Security investigators have been more involved in child pornography cases in recent years because they often involve the transmission of sexually explicit images of children from outside the United States, Hayes said. Brian Fanelli, 54, was arrested at his home in upstate Mahopac after a months-long investigation by federal officials, said James Hayes, Jr., special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York. -- The police chief of Mount Pleasant, New York, was arrested Thursday on charges of possession of child pornography, authorities said. The chief allegedly used a peer-to-peer file sharing program to download more than 120 images and videos of child pornography, prosecutors said. As police executed a search warrant at his home Thursday, Fanelli voluntarily told investigators that he began viewing child pornography about one year ago.
