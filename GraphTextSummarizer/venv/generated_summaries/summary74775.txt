Those boats were carrying Rohingya, members of Myanmar's long-suffering Muslim minority, Thailand-based U.N. official Kirsten Mildren said at the time.

Last month, at least 68 people died when a packed double-decker ferry sank while on the Padma River north of neighboring Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, officials said.
