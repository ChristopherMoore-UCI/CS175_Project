That will be a day before the anticipated release of the couple's joint memoir, co-written by Wall Street Journal columnist Jeffrey Zaslow and titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope." Giffords' spokesman, Mark Kimble, said Monday that the Arizona Democrat "has not yet decided whether she will participate in an on-camera interview. -- Eight months after being shot in the head outside an Arizona supermarket, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is considering doing her first post-tragedy TV news interview this fall on ABC, her spokesman said Monday. Giffords was among 13 people wounded, in addition to six killed, in a shooting rampage on January 8 in a Safeway parking lot in her hometown, Tucson, Arizona. Her husband, Mark Kelly, "will do an on-camera interview with Diane Sawyer," the spokesman added. ABC, in announcing the special program, said Giffords and Kelly "will share their remarkable story for the first time since the tragic shootings."
