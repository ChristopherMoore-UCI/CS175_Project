Heather Mack, 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21, have been detained as suspects in the death of Mack's mother, Sheila von Weise Mack, and "it appears that the motive for the killing was because she was against Schaefer's relationship with Heather," Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto told CNN. The couple initially told police they had been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Sheila Mack, but they escaped, CNN affiliate Trans TV reported. What exactly happened in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort and the exact role Heather Mack has is still under investigation, said Denpasar police Chief Djoko Hari Utomo. A Chicago man confessed to killing his girlfriend's mother, whose body was found last month in a suitcase outside a hotel in Indonesia, police in Bali tell CNN. Authorities at the South Kuta station in Bali opened the case and found the body, police said.
