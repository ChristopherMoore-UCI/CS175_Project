While giant fighting space robots may be a while off -- although engineers are reportedly planning a moving, 60 ft tall Gundam -- Japan is betting big that robots will have a greater place in our lives in the years to come. Androids -- humanoid robots --  may also one day soon act as companions and helpers to the elderly as Japan looks at its current demographic crisis and uses technology in inventive ways to combat a shrinking, aging population. So it really is no surprise that the country is on the leading edge of robot technology, and a visit to the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, known as Miraikan (Future Hall) in Tokyo really drives home the point. For many Japanese people, robots were a staple of pop culture growing up. How we view robots -- and the inevitable robotics revolution that we've been promised for so long -- depends largely on our background.
