Author and artist Alexandra Penney says she lost her life savings investing with financier Bernard Madoff. Watch Penney call Madoff 'loathesome' Â» Best known for the 1982 best-seller "How to Make Love to a Man" and as a former editor of Self magazine, Penney and her friend Evelyn Lauder were the first to use pink ribbons as a symbol for breast cancer awareness. Penney thought she had weathered the bear market just fine, since Madoff put her money in super-safe Treasuries. "She said, 'I hope this is a rumor, but I've just heard Bernie Madoff's been arrested,' " Penney recalls. About a decade ago, when Penney was in her late 40s, she shared her fears with a good friend, who steered her to Madoff, where she thought her money would always be safe.
