Djokovic and former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic were beaten in the deciding mixed doubles 6-4 7-5 by Fernando Verdasco and Anna Medina Garrigues as Spain won the final 2-1 to claim the trophy at the mixed team event in Perth. Djokovic beat Verdasco in the opening rubber 6-3 7-5 but Ivanovic suffered a surprise 6-4 6-7 6-2 defeat to veteran baseliner Garrigues in their singles tussle as Spain drew level. Djokovic's family has run the Serbia Open tournament, which was scheduled to take place from April 29 to May 5 in Belgrade, since 2009. He was also beaten by Bernard Tomic in his singles rubber in the match against hosts Australia, but against Verdasco in the final he showed the form which has kept him at the top of the world rankings for the past two seasons. A statement by Djokovic's Family Sport company, the tournament organizers, was posted on the official ATP Tour website to confirm the decision, but without giving any reasons.
