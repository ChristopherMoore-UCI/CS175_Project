-- Afghan politician Abdullah Abdullah withdrew Sunday from the upcoming runoff election, saying he believes that the second round would be as fraudulent as the first. " "We hope to see an Afghan government emerge that responds to the will of the people, that reaches out to all parts of Afghan society and that is ready to take strong action to meet the challenges that Afghanistan faces," Brown's statement said. Abdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff. "I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people," Abdullah said. In a statement, a representative for the U.N. group credited Abdullah with having "acted in a statesmanlike and dignified way and put forward a number of constructive proposals for reform which I hope will be part of the political agenda for Afghanistan's future.
