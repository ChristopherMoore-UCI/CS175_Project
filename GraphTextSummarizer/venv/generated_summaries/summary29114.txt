Feigley's Neo American Church, which authorities have called a sex cult, operated a school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that police said was a front for sexual activity. George Feigley, who was released from prison Friday, is the subject of community protests. The church's manifesto says, "We hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity," according to community activist Scott Portzline, who has researched Feigley's history and that of the group. In 1983, two members of the Neo American Church drowned in what authorities believe was an attempt to break Feigley out of prison. Authorities said he was attempting to direct sexual activity involving children by telephone from prison.
