Following an interview with Matt Lauer on Today -- and in preparation for her hosting gig on this weekend's "Saturday Night Live" -- Lohan swung by Thursday's episode of "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. If there was one awkward note in the interview, it came when Lohan asked Fallon -- apparently out of the blue -- if he'd be interested in swinging by "SNL" this weekend. From there, Fallon lightly skipped over the last eight years of Lohan's career, guiding the conversation into an mutual reminiscence about the very first "Debbie Downer" sketch back in 2004. Lohan claimed that she'd been pestering "SNL" czar Lorne Michaels for a return trip to "SNL" for a long time. (Fallon seemed nonplussed, and Lohan admitted she didn't know exactly what his role would be.)
