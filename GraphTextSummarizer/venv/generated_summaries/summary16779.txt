Officials expect more cases as more individuals are tested, particularly because it can take up to three months for HIV to appear in a person's system after initial infection. Pence issued an order in March for Scott County, which then had 79 confirmed cases of HIV since mid-December. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence issued an executive order Monday to extend a public health emergency in his state in response to a rampant HIV outbreak that first began in mid-December. Law enforcement, emergency agencies and health officials are working together. It calls on multiple state agencies to coordinate a response to the unprecedented outbreak and provides additional resources.
