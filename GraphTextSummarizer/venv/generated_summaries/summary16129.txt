The former England captain will play Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy after deciding to bring an end to his 17 years at Anfield. While he never managed to win the English Premier League trophy, Gerrard did win eight trophies during his time at Anfield. "I'm very excited to begin the next chapter of my career in the United States with LA Galaxy," Gerrard told the American' club's website. "The Galaxy are the most successful club in Major League Soccer history and I am looking forward to competing for more championships in the years to come. "There was more than one moment that has made me come to this decision, but I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team," Gerrard said.
