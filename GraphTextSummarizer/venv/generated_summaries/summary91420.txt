-- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho claims Barcelona's "obsession" with winning the Champions League on the ground of their arch-rivals Real Madrid will hinder their chances of beating his side in their semifinal second showdown. " Inter will be without the suspended Dejan Stankovic but Mourinho indicated that he would likely take a gamble on key midfielder Wesley Sneijder, who has a slight hamstring strain. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said his team were merely focused on earning a final clash against Bayern Munich, who beat Lyon 4-0 on aggregate in the first semifinal. Barca achieved a dream winning the Champions League in Paris and Rome last year but this time it is more about Madrid and playing at the Santiago Bernabeu, this is an obsession. Schalke's Magath set to work a new miracle "For Barca it is an obsession," added Mourinho, who was accompanied by tight security as he returned to the club where he began his coaching career under Bobby Robson.
