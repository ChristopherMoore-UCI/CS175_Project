Goldman thought he was getting his son back, but a Brazilian family court judge granted custody of Sean to Bruna's new husband. David Goldman's legal battle to gain custody of his son has drawn the attention of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In 2004, David Goldman dropped off his wife, Bruna, and then-4-year-old son, Sean, at the airport for a two-week vacation in Brazil. Mr. Goldman never had any interest on actually going down to Brazil, even to visit. And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so.
