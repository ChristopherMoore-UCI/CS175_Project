The freshman comedy, about a successful African-American family man's struggle with cultural identity, made its debut on the network Wednesday night to impressive ratings. Written by Kenya Barris and starring Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross and Laurence Fishburne, "Black-ish" centers on an African-American family living a comfortable life in the suburbs. But while Dre's fretting could (and does) raise more serious conversations about race, class and identity, "Black-ish" is still a comedy, and critics have praised it for knowing just how to leverage its complex subject for laughs. As one of the few comedies on a major network with a predominantly African-American cast, it has to navigate the issue of race in America. "I'm grateful that 'Black-ish' exists, first and foremost because it's funny," said The Huffington Post's Maureen Ryan.
