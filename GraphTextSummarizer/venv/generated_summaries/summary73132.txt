England took a big step towards a Six Nations Grand Slam with a 17-9 win over defending champions France at Twickenham on Saturday, in which Jonny Wilkinson regained the record for the most points in international rugby. Replacement fly-half Jonny Wilkinson then gave England an unassailable eight-point lead with a 51st-minute penalty that took the 31-year-old Toulon player back above New Zealand's Dan Carter on 1190 overall. Defeat for France ended coach Marc Lievremont's hopes of achieving a second successive Grand Slam. Unbeaten England next play host to Scotland on March 12, and victory at Twickenham will see the team able to clinch a first Grand Slam crown since 2003 in the closing match in Ireland. The hosts started well and went ahead in the fourth minute when center Gonzalo Canale went over, before Warren Gatland's side responded with two tries from winger Morgan Stoddart and flanker Sam Warburton.
