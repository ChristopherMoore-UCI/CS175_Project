" Chelsea return to the Etihad in just under two weeks to face City in the fifth round of the FA Cup, where they will look to inflict a third defeat on Pellegrini's side this season following tonight's win and their 2-1 league win at Stamford Bridge in October last year. It was a lead that Chelsea deserved after limiting City to few chances in the first half while operating nimbly on the break. Silva forced Petr Cech into a fine save from a 73rd-minute free kick and substitute Stevan Jovetic (on for Alvaro Negredo) also went close in injury time, but Chelsea held firm to record a vital win in the title race. -- Chelsea ended Manchester City's 100% home record in the English Premier League with a 1-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening. It was also the first time they had failed to score at home since a 0-0 draw against Birmingham City way back in November 2010 -- a sequence stretching back 61 games.
