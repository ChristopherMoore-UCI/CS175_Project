Politics still divide the countries, but many families touched by Operation Peter Pan have started to reach out to people and places they thought they had lost. Others say the clandestine program put many kids at unnecessary risk, with a few suffering abuse in foster homes and orphanages. Last year, President Obama lifted restrictions on allowing Cuban-Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and made it easier for them to send money to relatives. It was backed by Washington and coordinated by the Catholic Church, which helped Cuban children get U.S. visas and once in America, find a family or go to foster homes or orphanages. The clandestine program came to be known as Operation Peter Pan.
