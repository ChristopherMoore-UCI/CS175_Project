All are examples of extreme weather caused by climate change, according to a new study from NASA scientist James Hansen. "Our analysis shows that it is no longer enough to say that global warming will increase the likelihood of extreme weather and to repeat the caveat that no individual weather event can be directly linked to climate change. Phenomena like La Nina have always been around, but large areas of extreme warming have only come about with climate change, the study said. Hansen directs research at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and is a longtime environmental activist. " The study, which was published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, looks at the past six decades of global temperatures and finds what Hansen described as a "stunning" rise in the frequency of extremely hot summers.
