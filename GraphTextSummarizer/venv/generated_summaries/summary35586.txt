The 38 male inmates are part of the Maricopa County jail system, which is under the control of controversial sheriff Joe Arpaio. The flags are part of a push for patriotism in county jail cells that includes listening to the "Star-Spangled Banner" every morning and "God Bless America" every night over the intercom system. Arpaio implemented the American flag jailhouse initiative in November. His office has a history of targeting vehicles with occupants of Latino heritage, scrutinizing them more strictly and detaining them more often, U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled. He was elected to his sixth term as sheriff for the Phoenix area in November 2012.
