This is what concerns many Americans, along with the irritant that the undocumented would be carrying around a type of ID that is identical to those of U.S. citizens. Otherwise, the document would look just like the ones held by U.S. citizens. Last week, in a letter to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, officials with the Department of Homeland Security wrote that the state needs to put the disclaimer on the front of the license and also use "a unique design or color" to distinguish these special licenses from documents carried by U.S. citizens. But when the issue is driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, it makes a grab for power that belongs somewhere else. -- When it comes to giving driver's license to illegal immigrants, California has spent nearly two decades embroiled in a never-ending saga.
