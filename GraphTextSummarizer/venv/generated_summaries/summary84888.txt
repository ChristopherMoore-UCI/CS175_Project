For people who aren't keen on crowds or traffic, though, the Holy Grail of shopping days -- Black Friday -- can be intimidating, as the event is often rife with stress and overall chaos. "People understand physical stress, but emotional stress is just as taxing on the body," says upwave reviewer and happiness expert Mary Steinhardt. But it is possible to banish stress from your Black Friday experience, if you have the right mindset. Best: Don't lose perspective The holidays are supposed to be about (among other things) love, generosity and goodwill towards men, but on Black Friday these principles often get exchanged for stress and panic. If you're planning to hit Black Friday sales, make sure to rejuvenate your body by resting or finding another way to decompress, like taking a long bubble bath.
