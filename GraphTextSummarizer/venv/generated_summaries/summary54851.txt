Indeed, the infinite blackness of space, and indistinct white uniforms worn by Bullock and co-star George Clooney, create a unique environment not just free from gravity -- but traditional gender cues. Moving to New York and supporting herself with various hospitality jobs, Bullock was the ripe old age of 30 --practically over-the-hill for a woman starting out in Hollywood -- when she starred in breakthrough film "Speed." It's quite literally a world away from some of Bullock's best known roles -- the love interest of terrorist-busting cop Keanu Reeves in 1994 thriller "Speed," the tom boy FBI agent turned bombshell in 2000 chick flick "Miss Congeniality," or the executive trying to marry her assistant in 2009 rom-com "The Proposal." Yet the day before she scored the highest accolade in cinema, Bullock was picking up the Golden Raspberry Award for worst actress in 2010 comedy "All About Steve." For 49-year-old Bullock, playing the lead role of Dr Ryan Stone in the thriller which premieres in Britain this week, this is not a female action film -- it's a "human action film."
