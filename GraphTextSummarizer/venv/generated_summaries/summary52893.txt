" Goodwin describes 10 key presidential and vice presidential debates that made a difference: 1960 -- Kennedy vs. Nixon: First TV debate Just having Kennedy on the same stage as an experienced vice president made a difference for JFK because he could hold his own with Nixon. Dukakis vs. George H.W. Bush: 'If your wife, Kitty Dukakis, were raped and murdered?' Opinion: The mistakes candidates make in debates 1992 -- George H.W. Bush looks at his watch It looked like he was bored, that he didn't care about the debate and that underscored the feeling that he wasn't connected to the problems of the people and the country. And people just reacted to that image of a vigorous, young Kennedy, and an almost sick-looking Nixon. -- Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin says that even though a lot of modern debates are programmed, there are still moments that no one expected.
