-- Hours after being released from jail, a man walked through an emergency door at San Diego International Airport, onto the tarmac and sat down on a United Express plane Tuesday, according to San Diego authorities. "He completely bypassed TSA screening," San Diego Harbor Police Chief John Bolduc said. He allegedly boarded a 30-seat United Express aircraft operated by SkyWest, which was heading to Los Angeles, according to airline spokesman Wes Horrocks. "We have multiple layers of security built into our airports, as you know, and the backup systems were able to catch this guy." "Security of airports is a shared responsibility, and airports and airlines are required to adhere to TSA-approved security standards." The Harbor Police chief said they will examine this incident and find out where to make security improvements.
