Italy already hosts one F1 race in the northern city of Monza, but Rome officials had hoped the historic city would have its own date on the elite motorsport's calendar from the 2013 season onwards. Monza has a contract to host a grand prix until 2016, and Alemanno said the Rome will now concentrate its efforts on a bid for the 2020 Olympic Games. Rome's mayor has given up hope of hosting a Formula One race in the Italian capital, and announced on Friday that he will instead focus on winning the rights to stage the summer Olympics. "Today we're definitively and formally renouncing the plan for Formula One in Rome," Gianni Alemanno told reporters at a news conference. Rome has hosted the summer Games on one previous occasion in 1960, and has never staged the Italian Grand Prix.
