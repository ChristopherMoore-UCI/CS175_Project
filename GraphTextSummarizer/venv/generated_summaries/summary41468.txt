Feldman said 343 Industries wanted to make a big splash with their game and had been impressed by Web videos that had been produced for other gaming titles. The protagonist of the games' fictional universe is Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced human soldier encased in green armor. The video story fits in to the overall storylines featured in "Halo 4" and is a literal bridge between "Halo 3" and the new video game. " Antonini and Feldman brought in people who could stay true to both the "Halo" feel and 343's vision of the franchise. "For the hardcore fans that have played the games, read the books, read the comics, have the consumer products, and are fully intending to dive into 'Halo 4,' this is very much an additive experience," Feldman said.
