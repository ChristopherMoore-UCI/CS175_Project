One labeled "final requests" was found in Kramer's vehicle outside the FedEx facility, and the other is a three-page note titled "My final thoughts on paper" that was in his house in nearby Acworth. -- Geddy Kramer said he suffered from mental instability, frustration and depression. In the message later found in his car, Kramer said that his "first choice for my massacre would start with anyone who sold me drugs and a few others." These and other jarring statements attributed to Kramer, and released Friday to CNN, do not offer a specific reason why Kramer shot and wounded six people late last month at a FedEx package and delivery facility in Kennesaw, before turning a gun on himself. They do, however, help paint a picture of a man who felt isolated, did drugs and had mental issues.
