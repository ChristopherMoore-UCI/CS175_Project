This gives an advantage to big brewer beer brands over small brands created by America's independent craft brewers. Both members of the duopoly have wholly owned brands like Shock Top and Goose Island that are presented as craft brands. Large brewers also have control over some retail sales of beer. There is concern that these brands would get greater attention from wholesalers than independent craft brands, like mine. Adding Modelo's Corona beer and other brands would give it another 6%.
