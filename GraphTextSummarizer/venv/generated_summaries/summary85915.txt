-- As Dennis Rodman readies for his "basketball diplomacy" trip to North Korea, CNN has learned exclusively from Rodman's sponsor Paddy Power that Rodman and his documentary crew will arrive in Pyongyang on December 19 and train a team of North Korean basketball players through December 23. The names of the former NBA players and "high-profile" NBA coach will be announced before Rodman leaves next week for North Korea. Opinion: Is Dennis Rodman smart on North Korea? The North Korean basketball players are being trained for a game against a team of former NBA players, called Dennis' Dream Team, in Pyongyang on January 8, Kim's birthday. The spokesman added that Rodman has no definite plans to meet with "the Marshal Kim Jong Un," but because Rodman and the President are friends, they could very likely meet again.
