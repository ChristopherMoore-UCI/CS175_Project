It bans same-sex marriages and civil unions, and includes sentences of up to 14 years in prison for gay couples. The group said police arrested the men in Anambra, Enugu, Imo and Oyo states. Police detained men in various states and have dozens of pending arrests based on perceived sexual orientation, according to Amnesty International. -- Nigerian authorities arrested 10 people believed to be gay men under a bill signed this week that bans same-sex marriages, a human rights group said.
