After weeks of inactivity because of injury, Anelka celebrated his first English Premier League (EPL) goals of the season, against West Ham, by making a gesture that many believe is a Nazi salute in reverse. -- West Bromwich Albion may have thought they had done smart business when signing Nicolas Anelka on a free transfer last year, but he cost them dear on Monday. After making the gesture at an EPL match in London on December 28, Anelka agreed to a West Brom request to avoid any repetition of the gesture. "Zoopla has been reviewing its position over the past few weeks in light of the actions of striker, Nicolas Anelka, during the match against West Ham over the Christmas period and has decided to focus its attention on other marketing activities after this season," the company said in a statement. Anelka has insisted that the gesture, which involves pointing the right arm straight down and touching that arm with the left hand, was a dedication to his friend -- controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, with whom the move is widely associated.
