His father, Joe Jackson, made a brief appearance after being introduced by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. " Fans have flocked to Jackson's boyhood home in the days following his death in Los Angeles, California, on June 25. The tribute at The Steel Yard baseball park in Gary was full of children dancing and singing to Jackson's music, including a performance of "Thriller" complete with the cemetery scene that became so iconic. Jackson's first music teacher, Anita Hill, spoke of teaching Jackson to sing "Climb Every Mountain," and remembered him as a "very energetic and wonderful student."
