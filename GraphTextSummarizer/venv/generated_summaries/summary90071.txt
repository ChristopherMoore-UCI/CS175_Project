-- A rash of bank robberies in New York has the city's police commissioner worried that criminals have turned banks into "virtual cash machines" and some wondering whether tough economic times are fueling the trend. "As it stands now, they've turned [banks] into virtual cash machines," New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. In fact, bank robbers have simply handed tellers a note in a vast majority of hold-ups in New York. Bank robberies in New York have risen 54 percent compared with last year, with criminals committing more than 430  in the past 12 months, according to the New York police department. Some officials say the modern, customer-friendly design of banks -- with easy access to tellers and cash -- is too tempting for robbers.
