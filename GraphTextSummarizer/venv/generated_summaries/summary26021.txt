Just before Cosby thrilled the crowd with his famous story-telling delivery, he was presented with a Navy uniform, which he put on, and set of Navy anchor pins that were pinned on by Mabus and the most senior enlisted member of the branch, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Rick West. Cosby, who was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1960, said the one of the greatest moments in his life was graduating from Navy boot camp. I don't want to be in the Marine Corp because you die before you get out of there," Cosby told the laughing crowd filled with Navy personnel. "I want to welcome you to the ranks of the people that run the Navy, people that make the ships sail on time, the aircraft fly, the hospitals work," said Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, who received the same honor last year. The 73-year-old star recalled that finishing Navy boot camp was the first time his mother saw him graduate from anything.
