-- White House Ebola czar Ron Klain on Tuesday downplayed the chances of Ebola being used as a biological weapon after a scare in New Zealand. Klain touted the overall U.S. response to Ebola cases here and to the outbreak in West Africa, saying health officials have "tried to learn the lessons from Dallas," where the first case was diagnosed in the United States, by increasing training, preparation and protective gear at health facilities nationwide. "My role isn't to give medical advice, it's to coordinate this massive response that President Obama has marshaled here at home and in Africa," Klain said. He said U.S. officials are "always watching intelligence traffic and other indicators" to see if terror groups are using Ebola or other diseases as biological weapons, but that "we're not aware of any credible threat" and that the odds of that happening are low. Klain said he was briefed Tuesday after a small vial supposedly sent by jihadis and containing Ebola was sent to the offices of the New Zealand Herald newspaper.
