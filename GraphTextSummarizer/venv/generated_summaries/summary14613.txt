The lawsuit says the NYPD program violates the U.S. and New York State Constitutions, New York common law and the federal Fair Housing Act, according to the court complaint provided by the NYCLU. -- The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class action lawsuit Wednesday against the city of New York and several members of the New York Police Department, including Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, challenging the department's "Operation Clean Halls" program, the NYCLU announced. "Operation Clean Halls has placed hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, mostly black and Latino, under siege in their own homes," said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman in a press release Wednesday. " The city-sponsored program offers police patrols in residential buildings in an attempt to prevent the use and sale of drugs, according to the official New York City website. It's really shrouded in secrecy and that's one of the problems about it," said Jen Carnig, NYCLU director of communications.
