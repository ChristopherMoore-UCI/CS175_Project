On the other side of the country, the Ohio family of Chris Bachus, a decorated Marine who died in his sleep from an accidental drug overdose, also says military doctors are writing too many prescriptions. But he blames government doctors for loading him up on pills. Navy veteran Keith blames multiple tours in the Persian Gulf, on board the USS Kitty Hawk, for a variety of ailments including post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Meanwhile, Jerry Bachus keeps asking why doctors, commanders and even fellow Marines didn't raise the alarm. New prescriptions may carry a time limit, with no refills without a new examination.
