Six weeks after Tracy and Matt Keil married in 2007, he was hit by a sniper fire while serving in Iraq. After a year-long tour of duty in Iraq, Keil returned home to Colorado, where he met a young woman named Tracy who lived in the same apartment complex. Tracy and her mother would bring Keil house-hunting. At the time, the enemy in Iraq was growing stronger, and Keil's unit was headed to Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province and a violent insurgent stronghold. Tracy was abruptly informed of his condition while Keil was heavily sedated.
