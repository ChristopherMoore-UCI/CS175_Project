-- A Japanese coast guard crew member has confessed to leaking a video of a boat collision that sparked a recent diplomatic battle between China and Japan, officials said Wednesday. Though the leaking of the video has alarmed Japanese officials, officials in China have questioned its accuracy. Japan initially accused the captain of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. "The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government," Hiroshi Kawauchi, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan, said last week. China calls the islands the Diaoyu; Japan calls them the Senkaku.
