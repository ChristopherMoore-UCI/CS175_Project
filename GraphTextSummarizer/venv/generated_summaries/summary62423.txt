-- Five U.S. soldiers facing murder charges in the deaths of three Afghan civilians earlier this year have now been charged with "conspiracy to commit premeditated murder," and seven more soldiers have been charged in connection with the probe into the incidents. Charges were also filed against seven other soldiers from the 5th Stryker Brigade, the military said Wednesday, but none involve murder or conspiracy to commit murder. Jones was charged with conspiracy to commit assault and battery and conspiracy to commt aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon. On Wednesday, the military added conspiracy and other additional charges against the five. Stevens was charged with wrongfully and wantonly engaging in conduct likely to cause death or bodily harm to other soldiers.
