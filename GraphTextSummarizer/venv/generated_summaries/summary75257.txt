Khedira's fellow Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil made it 2-0 in the 32nd minute with his sixth La Liga goal this season, sidefooting a powerful left-foot effort from Marcelino's left-wing cutback that Atletico keeper David de Gea could only help into the net. In Saturday's other game, Lazio moved back into fourth place with a 1-0 win at home to struggling Cesena thanks to a second-minute goal from striker Mauro Zarate. The lead at times flattered Real, who needed a string of fine saves from goalkeeper Iker Casillas to keep Atletico at bay. Striker Sergio Aguero finally scored a deserved goal in the 86th minute after a well-worked one-two with Koke inside the penalty area, but Atletico did not seriously threaten again in the three minutes of time added on. With Barca coasting, Getafe gave the home fans a late scare when Manu del Moral volleyed home a cross in the 87th minute.
