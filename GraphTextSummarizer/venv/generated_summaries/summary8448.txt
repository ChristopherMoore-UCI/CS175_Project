On Friday, Twinkie producer Hostess Brands Inc. announced it would be closing down, thus ending its product line.

The upside to these chemicals is that Twinkies never seem to grow old -- they're the Dorian Gray of snack foods. At White's trial, his attorneys argued that his diet of sugary snack foods, such as Twinkies, had damaged his mental capacity.
