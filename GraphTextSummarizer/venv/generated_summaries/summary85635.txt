Instead, he said Afghanistan's government is likely to bear the brunt of criticism for failing to anticipate or prevent the escape, especially after previous escapes at this and other prisons. A gun and rocket battle followed, lasting several hours and ending with militants rushing into the prison on motorcycles to free prisoners, according to Taliban accounts of the attack. Although the Taliban said some of the escapees were military commanders, it's unlikely the escape will have a significant impact on military operations in Afghanistan, said Thomas E. Gouttierre, director of the Center of Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. After attacks on the country's ministry of defense, the assassination of the police chief and now Monday's prison break, Kandahar resident Kari Ghar said it's "impossible to call this system a government." "This is the worst possible weakness of the Afghan government that almost every single political prisoners escape from the central jail in Kandahar," Ghar said. In 2008, as many as 1,000 prisoners -- nearly half of them Taliban members -- escaped after militants detonated a truck bomb against the side of the prison compound.
