Dean said Wednesday that officials were also concerned because, after twice detecting pings April 5, searchers had difficulty reacquiring the pings the next day. Signals still being studied "Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound," Dean explained. When asked whether other countries involved in the search had reached the same conclusions, Dean said, "yes." Underwater search for MH370 postponed for at least 2 months "Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator," Dean said. Officials zeroed in on that zone after acoustic pings originally thought to be from the black boxes of the missing plane were detected in early April. Authorities now almost universally believe that the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders but instead from some other manmade source unrelated to the jetliner that disappeared March 8, according to Michael Dean, the Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering.
