Hupke says the centers will provide important counseling about abortion and offer alternatives "so that women get the information so that they can make an informed decision, a voluntary decision." Language at the beginning of the bill states that it establishes "certain procedures to better insure that [abortion] decisions are voluntary, uncoerced, and informed, and to revise certain causes of action for professional negligence relating to performance of an abortion. "I think everyone agrees with the goal of reducing abortion by encouraging consideration of other alternatives," Daugaard. Twenty-five of those states also require women to wait a specified amount of time -- usually 24 hours-- between the counseling and the abortion procedure, the group says. The Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based research center for sexual and reproductive health, says that 34 states require that women receive counseling before an abortion is performed.
