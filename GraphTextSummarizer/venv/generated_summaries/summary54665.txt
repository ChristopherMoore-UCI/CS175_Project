New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is calling for calm amid a back-and-forth of finger-pointing between activists, police leaders and elected officials following the execution-style murder of two New York City police officers this weekend. " Those reforms would build off of concerns he said he's heard that range from grand jury secrecy to survivors' benefits for police officers and whether police car windows should be bulletproof. " Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani tied the police murders to "intense, anti-police hatred" among leaders and activists reacting to the non-indictment of two white police officers who killed two unarmed black men in separate instances this summer. And the leader of the city's largest police union directly blamed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for the murders, saying the officers' blood is "on many hands," starting "on the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor." When asked if de Blasio had the governor's full support, Cuomo said the mayor, union leaders and community activists have his "full support."
