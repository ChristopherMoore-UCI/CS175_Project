Meghan McCain said she was surprised, and now pleased, by her father's pick of Sarah Palin as running mate. Meghan McCain: I just thought it would be a really great way to make my father's story accessible to children. King: You have blogged in support of Bristol Palin, who is with child, as we know. McCain: I think to a degree everyone was surprised because [Sarah Palin] was an unknown. McCain: I don't think necessarily criticizing any candidate is sexism, but I do think that sexism has played a role with the governor and with Senator Clinton as well in this election.
