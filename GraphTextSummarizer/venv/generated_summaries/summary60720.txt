-- When Black Caviar lines up at Morphetville, Adelaide, on Sunday in front of an anticipated crowd of 30,000, the Australian wonder horse will carry the weight not only of jockey Luke Nolen but the expectations of an entire nation. Both horses are huge (Black Caviar stands at 16.2 HH while Zenyatta stood at a carthorse-like 17.2 HH), and their hulking frames meant they were each only lightly raced in their early years (larger horses usually take longer to develop). The Black Caviar phenomenon has gripped a sports-mad Australian public. A match race seems unlikely since the two horses prefer to race over different distances: sprints of 1,000 -1,200 meters for Black Caviar; the mile and upwards for Frankel. Such is the aura of invincibility surrounding Black Caviar, she typically races against just a handful of other runners.
