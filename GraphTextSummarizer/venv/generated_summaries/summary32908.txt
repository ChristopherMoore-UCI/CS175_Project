Should we get him for having sex?" Jeanne, Amy, Nikki and Desiree say that when they lived in Alamo's Arkansas compound, he controlled every facet of his followers' lives, and threatened violence and eternal damnation if they dared to disobey him. In the 1980s, Alamo, a self-proclaimed prophet of God, had thousands of devoted followers in the United States, including the parents of Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki. Nikki says that in 1999, after she realized she would become Alamo's next spiritual wife, she took action. A former polygamist speaks out Jeanne says that when she was 15 years old Alamo, who was 59 years old and her pastor at the time, forced her to become his spiritual wife and have sex with him. In 1966, Alamo married Susan Lipowitz and established the Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foundation.
