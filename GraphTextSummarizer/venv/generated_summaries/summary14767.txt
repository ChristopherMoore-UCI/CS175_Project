Weddings are inspirational events, evoking notions of summer evenings, blushing brides, silly pranks by younger brothers and pretty bridesmaids all in a row. We scoured weddings sites as though our very lives depended on finding the perfect location -- would people prefer the view of a mountain or a beautiful garden? -- and went to Napa Valley to taste wines. People do crazy stuff in Wedding World. I have the best husband a woman could ask for, but it turned out that leaving Wedding World was not so easy. Despite the stomach knots, obsessive thoughts and money squandering, Wedding World is ultimately a difficult place to leave.
