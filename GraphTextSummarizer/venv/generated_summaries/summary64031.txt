-- Greece's economic turmoil threatens to topple the eurozone, shake the global financial markets and bring down the protagonist in the political drama: embattled Prime Minister George Papandreou. In a letter in the 1972 edition of the University of Minnesota alumni news magazine, Margaret Chant Papandreou explained how her family left the United States in 1959 and settled into "political life" in Greece. Papandreou has been at the center of the financial storm in Europe, with his political future on the line after a turbulent day of political wrangling between the government and opposition. The son and grandson of former leaders, Papandreou is a product of Greece's political establishment. During his first run for Greece's top job in 2004, Papandreou did not shy away from touting his family legacy.
