Married to rock star David Bowie and now residing in New York, Iman was born in Somalia in 1955. After facing numerous challenges being a black model, she launched Iman Cosmetics in 1994, designed for models no matter the color of their skin. -- "The moment I got into the modeling industry, I knew I had to be an entrepreneur," says former supermodel Iman. One of the most recognized models of the 1970s and '80s, Iman has used her entrepreneurial skills to great effect in the fashion industry, with her own cosmetics business and in her charitable fund-raising work.
