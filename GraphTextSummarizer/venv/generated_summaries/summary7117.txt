It happened Thursday in the city of Guangzhou as Chen Fuchao threatened to jump off Haizhu Bridge, China's Xinhua news agency reported. -- A passerby pushed a would-be suicide jumper off a bridge in southern China because he was angry at the jumper's "selfish activity," Chinese media reported Saturday. Lian Jiansheng, 66, who was passing by the bridge, offered to talk Chen down, Xinhua said. Lian greeted Chen with a handshake, then pushed him off the bridge, Xinhua said. Traffic was held up for nearly five hours and a crowd gathered as Chen sat on the bridge, threatening to jump, Xinhua reported.
