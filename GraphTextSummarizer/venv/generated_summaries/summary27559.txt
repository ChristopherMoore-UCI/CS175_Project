At one point, authorities in Portugal had named the girl's parents as suspects, as well as a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. -- Four years after the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a British toddler who went missing in Portugal, her parents have written a book detailing their account of that horrible night. News of the missing wide-eyed girl grabbed headlines across the globe and moved celebrities such as soccer star David Beckham to make public pleas for her safe return. But a spokesman for the Portuguese prosecutor's office said in July 2008 that authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and they were no longer considered suspects. "I suppose there's always been the urge to -- to get the truth out there," Kate McCann, the missing girl's mother, told CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview.
