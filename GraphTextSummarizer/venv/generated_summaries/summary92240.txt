"Our investigators believe this was likely Frein," Bivens said at a news conference in Barrett Township. Investigators believe a woman saw Eric Matthew Frein in a wooded area near the eastern Pennsylvania town of Swiftwater on Friday night, State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters. Asked whether authorities believed Frein was injured, Bivens said that they would have a better idea once testing is complete. Frein is familiar with the Swiftwater area, having attended the high school and having worked summers at a camp just to the west, Bivens said. Bivens said Frein also might have been sighted south of the Canadensis area earlier this week.
