-- Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti has admitted he is resigned to manager Jose Mourinho leaving the club to join Real Madrid. Meanwhile, former Inter player and coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has quit as coach of Catania, fueling speculation he could be in line to replace Mourinho at the San Siro. Former France midfielder Tigana, who has previously coached Fulham in the English Premier League, replaces Laurent Blanc, who is taking over as France coach after the World Cup in South Africa. Moratti invited Mourinho to dinner at his house on Monday night and tried to convince the Portuguese coach to stay in Italy. Mourinho, who previously coached Porto and English champions Chelsea, declined to comment on his future following the meeting with Moratti.
