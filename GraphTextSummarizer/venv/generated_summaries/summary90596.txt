It's a neurological disorder that causes involuntary movements and noises -- known as tics -- but for leading goalkeeper Tim Howard, Tourette's syndrome was the making of him. The longtime Everton custodian sat down with CNN.com at the club's training ground last week to discuss family life, relationships and living with Tourette's. I look forward to getting home, being closer to my children and retiring, really, being able to do the day-to-day things -- going to school, picking them up from baseball practice and soccer practice. Howard didn't mince words when he called his marriage a "failure," waxed lyrical about his children, nine-year-old Jacob -- who is a keeper, too -- and seven-year-old Alivia, and said if he had a choice, he probably wouldn't live his life without Tourette's. Q: Concerning life on the pitch, you talked about Tourette's syndrome helping you in aspects of goalkeeping.
