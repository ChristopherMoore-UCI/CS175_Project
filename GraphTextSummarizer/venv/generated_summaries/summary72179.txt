Winn was believed to be the oldest living African-American when she died Friday afternoon in Shreveport, Louisiana, at 113. Born in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, on March 31, 1897, Winn moved with her family to Shreveport after her father died in 1908. But Winn "never discussed it," said her great-niece Mary C. Hollins of Shreveport. Winn had a child who died at age 2, Hollins said. "We have declared March 31 as Ms. Mississippi Winn Day since her 110th birthday," he wrote in an e-mail.
