In other words, seeking to navigate around these two key stumbling blocks -- the question about the size of Iran's enrichment program and a timetable for removal of sanctions -- continues to keep the negotiating parties apart. In other words, there is still no agreement on two key issues: The scope of Iran's enrichment program and how and when to end sanctions on Iran as part of a deal. However, this is not considered by the West to amount to a concession by Iran, as it ultimately does not reduce the amount of enriched uranium Tehran will continue to have at its disposal. By all accounts, the P5+1 states themselves do not appear to have agreed on a target for Iran to meet, which means Tehran has been able to continue maneuvering around the issue. Tehran's counter-offer has been to suggest swapping Iran's older-generation centrifuges for more advanced ones that produce more enriched uranium at a faster rate.
