Demand Progress was instrumental in fighting the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act, two bills that would have expanded government oversight in fighting Internet piracy and copyright violations at the possible expense of the free flow of information. One of Swartz's desires was to make public information truly public -- that is, free and easily available. Later, Swartz founded Demand Progress, a group devoted to Internet activism. By the time SOPA and PIPA were shot down last year, Swartz had become entangled in another legal thicket surrounding free access to online data. But what Swartz also helped create was a philosophy of the Internet, one that remains the subject of great controversy almost 20 years into its life: the libertarian idea that information wants to be free.
