ESPN reporter Erin Andrews was allegedly stalked by a man who posted nude videos of her on the Internet. " "The e-mail (sent to TMZ) was linked to Barrett through a number of methods," the statement from Los Angeles prosecutors said. Investigators found other videos on a Web site, apparently posted by a person using the same username as the person who posted the Andrews videos. Barrett, an insurance company employee from Westmont, Illinois, is accused of taping Andrews, an ESPN reporter, while she was nude in two hotel rooms. Investigators found in hotel records that Barrett had requested and received a room adjacent to Andrews' and used his home address to register for it.
