Australia: MH370 may have turned south earlier than previously thought Hard areas found in search zone unlikely to be man-made The latest analysis of the data indicates that southern areas of the huge search grid may be of high interest, Australian officials have said, suggesting that the zone is likely to be further adjusted. Job cuts at airline The loss of MH370 and the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in July have contributed to 6,000 people at the airline losing their jobs because of heavy financial losses. But the airline was in big financial trouble before the twin disasters of Flight 370 and Flight 17 claimed the lives of 537 people. Authorities are convinced the plane crashed March 8 in the southern Indian Ocean.
