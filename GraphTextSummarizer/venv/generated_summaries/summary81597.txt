The sworn affidavits by an ex-Marine who joined Blackwater and another employee -- listed in the documents as "John Doe No. 1" and "John Doe No. 2" -- are part of a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Virginia against Prince on behalf of Iraqi families who say they lost loved ones at the hands of his company. -- Two former Blackwater employees have made statements against Blackwater Worldwide and its founder Erik Prince, accusing the security company and its former CEO of murder and other serious crimes in Iraq, according to court documents filed this week. Second, Mr. Prince is motivated by greed," says John Doe No. 2. The decision did not affect other contracts Blackwater has with the State Department, a senior State department official told CNN earlier this year. He says he's heard of similar instances of excessive or deadly force from other Blackwater employees.
