Amid news that the Seattle-based company's fourth-quarter sales had been "disappointing," Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz revealed on Thursday that the coffee chain will roll out a delivery option in the latter half of 2015 to loyalty-program members in select markets. Although Schultz did not provide the nitty-gritty on how the company plans to implement the delivery program (Matt Ryan, Starbucks' global chief strategy officer, said on the call that the program is in its "early days"), here are some thoughts on how it could -- and could not -- flip consumers' lids: How it could deliver: 1. Next month, Starbucks customers in Portland, Oregon, will have access to a mobile ordering app that lets them order and pay for their beverages ahead of time and skip the line for pickup. It might seem like there's a Starbucks on every corner, but the company's executives still want to get those tall, grande and venti pumpkin spice lattes into more hands, more easily. With time for delivery, an iced drink could arrive watered down, and a hot one could arrive lukewarm.
