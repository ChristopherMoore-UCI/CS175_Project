An undercover Israeli police investigation in collaboration with the FBI led to the suspect, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The stolen material included "songs that haven't yet been released, sketches of songs, photos and other personal material," Tamir Afori, Madonna's attorney in Israel, told Haaretz. "The Tel Aviv resident, born in 1976, was believed to have stolen work from a number of artists and sold it online," Samri said. Madonna says Israeli police have arrested a hacker who stole unfinished versions of her newest songs and leaked them online. After the songs leaked in December, a photo of broken iPod appeared on Madonna's Instagram feed.
