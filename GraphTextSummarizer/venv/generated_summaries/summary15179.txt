A statement from the clinic said the doctors were "extremely upset and deeply regret the death of patient C.W." and that they are giving "full and complete support" to investigators. The 23-year-old woman, identified only as "Sexy Cora," fell into a coma during the surgery at the Alster Clinic in Hamburg on January 11, according to Wilhelm Moellers, the spokesman for the Hamburg state prosecutor. An autopsy will take place next week and the cause of death "is still unclear," Moellers said. Doctors who responded to an emergency call to the clinic called police and filed charges that started the investigation of the clinic, Moellers said. -- Two doctors who performed breast enlargement surgery on a German porn actress have been charged with negligent manslaughter after the woman's death, a prosecutor's spokesman said.
