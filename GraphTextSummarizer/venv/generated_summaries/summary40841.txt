Inefficiencies in health care are a problem, but they persist because existing subsidies mean health care providers face limited incentives to control costs. Increased efficiency in health care is indeed possible, but assuring "high quality, affordable care for every American," as the administration seeks to do, is not. Indeed, the report suggests that improved efficiency can not only slow the growth of health expenditure but also fund government health insurance for the 46 million uninsured Americans. Rolling back subsidies for health insurance is not pleasant medicine, but past improvements in health technology mean that even low-cost care is superior to the state-of-the-art a few decades ago. Government spending on health care is growing at an alarming rate.
