"The reports of rampant anti-Semitic harassment and physical assaults at Pine Bush schools, if true, are deeply disturbing," Cuomo said in a statement to the state education commissioner. The incidents reportedly occurred at Pine Bush Elementary School, Crispell Middle School and Pine Bush High School, all within the Pine Bush Central School District. "We share the governor's revulsion at the reports of heinous anti-Semitic acts at the Pine Bush Central School District," said Elizabeth R. Berlin, the executive deputy commissioner. -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed state police and the Division of Human Rights on Friday to investigate allegations of anti-Semitic harassment in a New York state school district. His statement follows claims and a subsequent lawsuit from five students who attended school in the Pine Bush Central School District and were bullied and harassed, according to their lawyer Ilann M. Maazel.
