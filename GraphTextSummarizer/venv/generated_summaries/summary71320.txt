People are afraid to express themselves politically, and even in their home -- I remember the way we grew up, I didn't look my father in the eye until I was 22; you call your father "Sir, Sir, Sir" -- apparently it's a form of respect, OK, but respect should not be mistaken with fear. I was afraid and that's the thing, that's the colonial mentality: we mistake fear for respect. Everyone's living in a cage and then you bring your child into that kind of society, where your child is forced to live in fear. Beyonce would definitely draw more crowd than [Nigerian president] Goodluck Jonathan if she was going to hold a speech -- if Beyonce is going to talk about Boko Haram, many people are going to listen, and if she had something to tell Nigerians about love or whatever, many people are going to listen. Yes, that's just easier said than done, but we also need ourselves to take more things into our own hands -- so if we want change, we have to show that we want change, peacefully -- I love Malcolm X
