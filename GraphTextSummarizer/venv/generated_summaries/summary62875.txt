Yingluck Shinawatra is the youngest sister of the charismatic and deeply polarizing former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who led the country for five years before the military removed him from power in 2006. At Government House in Thailand, I recently interviewed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- a woman who has heard those questions -- and more -- before. The public dissent -- which has seen thousands march through Bangkok's streets -- stems from the fact that the period specified in the bill includes the time her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was in power, reports the Bangkok Post. But Yingluck has also used the media to advance her own platform, including the launch of "Smart Lady Thailand" -- a reality TV show out to empower young women. While Vejjajiva later said the remark was not directed at a particular person, and not intended as an insult to women, Yingluck supporters called it sexist.
