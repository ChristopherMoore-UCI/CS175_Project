President Hassan Rouhani made a series of overtures ahead of his trip to New York this week in an effort to end Iran's nuclear row with the West. In an interview with NBC news last week, Rouhani stressed that Iran would never "build weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons" and announced that he had "complete authority" to make a deal with the West. Iranians are reasonably optimistic this time that President Rouhani can ease the sanctions and lift some of political pressures at home. Khamenei backed Rouhani's diplomatic efforts this month during a meeting with members of the Revolutionary Guards Corps -- a hard-line military force that has historically opposed engagement with the West Khamenei also urged the force not to interfere in politics, a shift from previous years that would be crucial to avoid derailing Rouhani's efforts. For the first time in its 34-year history, the Islamic Republic of Iran is approaching the West with a unified voice to save its sanction-afflicted economy.
