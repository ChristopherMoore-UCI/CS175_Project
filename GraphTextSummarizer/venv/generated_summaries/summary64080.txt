"It is a fantastic testimony to the international fame of the Beatles that -- more than 40 years on -- this crossing continues to attract thousands of visitors each year, trying to mimic their iconic 'Abbey Road' album cover," British heritage minister John Penrose said. First, the Beatles made it famous by walking across it on the cover of their "Abbey Road" album, prompting millions of imitators. John Lennon was shot and killed in 1980, and George Harrison died of cancer in 2001. Paul McCartney, who appears barefoot on the album cover, said he and the Beatles had had a great year and that the designation of the crosswalk was "icing on the cake." -- A striped crosswalk in London entered the history books Wednesday for a second time.
