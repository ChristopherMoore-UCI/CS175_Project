Brown was the fourth person to say they were targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race this year, and the second to accuse Macy's of racial profiling. -- Civil rights leaders met with retail chain representatives and agreed to create a customer bill of rights -- to be posted in department stores in the coming days -- in response to allegations of racial profiling in multiple retail chains. The one-page document is also expected to be posted to the department store websites, which will include Macy's, Barneys New York, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, according to a press conference on Monday. "Profiling is an unacceptable practice and will not be tolerated," the document states, drafted by the Retail Council of New York State, along with National Action Network and Reverend Al Sharpton. The groups first met on November 20 after several black shoppers alleged they were racially profiled at Macy's and Barneys New York earlier this year.
