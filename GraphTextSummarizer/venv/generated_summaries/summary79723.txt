It used to be the case that after I told people about my origins, I would invariably hear a wish to visit the pyramids or be asked my thoughts regarding certain Anne Rice novels. Yes, there are people around today trying to start that fire, but I'm confident they are a few in an increasingly complex nation of over 300 million people, each of us with multiple identities. Today, identity is too easily turned into a rallying cry for purity and violence. What often follows next is that the person asking me the question either congratulates me on speaking English well or, confused by my answers, looks at me like I don't understand English. Likewise, the anti-Muslim chorus led by people like Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who calls Islam a "retarded culture," want to pigeonhole us into diametrically opposing identities that necessarily have to careen into conflict with each other.
