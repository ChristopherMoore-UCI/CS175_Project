On one day in March, the state Department of Transportation inspected 14 buses and found violations in every case -- either vehicle violations, which took the buses out of service, or driver violations or both, said agency spokeswoman Deborah Sturm Rausch. "March's bus crash was a tragedy for New York, but these passengers did not have to die in vain," Schumer said in a statement Sunday. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered an investigation into how the driver in the crash, Ophadell Williams, got a commercial license despite having a poor driving record and previous convictions of grand larceny and manslaughter. His license was suspended on March 17 after the Department of Motor Vehicles turned over to investigators driver license applications that allegedly contained false statements. Records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website showed that the bus line involved -- World Wide Travel -- was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in another.
