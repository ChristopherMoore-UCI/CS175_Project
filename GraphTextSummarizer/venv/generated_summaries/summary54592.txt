Nadim Houry, deputy director of Human Rights Watch for Middle East/North Africa tweeted: "I would have thought 2013 would have been a year for soul searching at OPCW not accolades." And Blake Hounshell, deputy editor of Politico magazine, made a dig at the expense of U.S. President Barack Obama, a previous Peace Prize laureate: "OPCW owes this prize to the use of chemical weapons and the 2009 winner's subsequent threat to bomb Syria." Tawakkol Karman, a Yemeni human rights activist who won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, described how the award inspired her battle against injustice. Aside from its work on disarmament, the OPCW aims to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons through the inspection of chemical production facilities and monitoring of transfers of toxic chemicals and their precursors. The need to rid the world of chemical weapons was underlined by events in Libya, said CNN's Nic Robertson. According to the treaty's wording, signatories are "determined for the sake of all mankind, to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons, through the implementation of the provisions of this Convention. The OPCW's experts have monitored the cataloguing and destruction of chemical weapons in countries ranging from the U.S. and Russia to Libya.
