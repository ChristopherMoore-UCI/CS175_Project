The trigger came Friday, when a car bomb exploded in central Beirut, killing Lebanon's top intelligence official, Brig. Sunnis are in the majority in northern Lebanon, where they have clashed with a small but strong enclave of pro-al-Assad Alawites. Syria ended its military occupation of Lebanon in 2005, bowing to international pressure after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Lawmakers who are most opposed to Syria's influence inside Lebanon -- mostly through its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah -- are now calling for the government's resignation. Lebanon has always struggled to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects, and the current tensions mirror those in Syria: In both countries, the Shiite and Alawite Muslim sects (al-Assad is an Alawite) tend to support the Syrian regime, while support is growing among Sunni Muslims for Syrian rebels.
