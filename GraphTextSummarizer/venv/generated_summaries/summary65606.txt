Lane Snow didn't know trooper Fox, but he told local station WDBJ7 he did it because "I was sorry that Andrew Fox died." Nine-year-old Lane Snow salutes the two-mile funeral procession Thursday for Virginia State Police Trooper Andrew Fox. At Snow's Cub Scout meeting Monday night, 10 officers from various agencies -- some of whom knew Fox personally -- showed up to thank Snow in person, said Cub Master Darrell Lineberry. Lane Snow told the local station that he wants to be a policeman when he grows up, "just like Andrew Fox." Everyone who saw it was touched, including Fox's widow, who saw Snow saluting as her car passed, WDBJ reported.
