"Sending money, person to person, is free," PayPal Senior Product Marketing Manager JB Coutinho said. PayPal has unveiled a Facebook app that lets you send money to friends. And because it's a peer-to-peer transaction, there is no transaction fee, though PayPal's regular limits and international fees still apply. While there are several ways to pay with PayPal via Facebook (Payvment comes to mind), this is the first app to enable peer-to-peer payments via Facebook and PayPal. "The PayPal and Facebook infrastructure have now merged," PayPal's Anuj Nayar says.
