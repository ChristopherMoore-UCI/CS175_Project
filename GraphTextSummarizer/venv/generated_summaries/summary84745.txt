Precedent also requires states to make a "good faith effort" to achieve equality in voting districts, but that those districts need not be drawn with "precise mathematical equality." West Virginia's plan was approved by large margins in the state Senate and the House of Delegates, then signed into law by Democratic Gov. Earl Tomblin. Decades old Supreme Court precedent has solidified the "one person, one vote" standard to ensure equal voting districts. The justices said in an unsigned opinion on Tuesday that a divided three-judge federal district court panel had "misapplied the standards for evaluating" challenges to voting maps drawn by the state legislature. West Virginia state officials told the Supreme Court in their appeal that crafting a new map would be time-consuming, expensive, and cause "irreparable harm."
