Reporters working for Legal Defense Institute on Wednesday published a far-ranging interview with "Comrade Artemio," who said his real name is Jose Flores, though the government has disputed that. But the government has responded forcefully to the resurgent Shining Path, and the leader said that the time for armed conflict is over. "We don't have the smallest intention to brandish the weapons of war, of armed conflict. For now, the group's ideological fight will be political, he said, noting that it meant accepting, to a degree, participation within the confines of a democratic system that Shining Path opposes. Don't expect the Shining Path to field candidates for Congress, Artemio said, but there exists the possibility that other political organizations, representing its views, could participate in the system.
