Three years later, he put out "Metal Machine Music," described by "The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll" as "four sides of grating instrumental noise" and by rock critic (and frequent Reed sparring partner) He played a slick record producer in Paul Simon's 1980 film "One Trick Pony," and a Bob Dylan parody named Auden in the underrated 1983 comedy "Get Crazy," turning idle dialogue ("It's a deathbed request") into instant songs. The Velvets were precursors to punk rock, art rock, avant-garde rock, almost any kind of rock that veered from the status quo. Reed's songs were generally minimalist, sometimes self-consciously poetic, and usually delivered with a deadpan vocal that was all the more haunting, given the songs' subject matter. And, not to discount the contributions of John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker and the soon-to-depart Nico, but the voice of the band was Lou Reed.
