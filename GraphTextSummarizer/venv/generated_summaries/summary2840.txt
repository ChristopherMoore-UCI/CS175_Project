New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called Myls' death tragic and ordered a full report on what happened by the end of this week. "I'm letting you out to go give your son a proper burial," New Jersey Superior Court Judge Michael A. Donio said Thursday. -- The father of a 4-year-old boy tortured and beaten to death in New York will be freed from jail to attend his son's funeral, authorities said Thursday. Also on Wednesday, Myls' body was claimed from the morgue in New York. The boy's father, Okee Wade, 37, who has a lengthy arrest record, pleaded guilty in New Jersey Thursday to a charge of second-degree racketeering in connection with an elaborate bank fraud scheme.
