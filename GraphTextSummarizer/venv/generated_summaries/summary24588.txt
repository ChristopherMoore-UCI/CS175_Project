Since that time, 126 rockets and bombs -- with high explosives -- have been found on school property, along with other military debris. Watch the Army Corps blow up bombs Â» "It's incomprehensible," said Frank Kruppenbacher, the general counsel of the Orange County school board. "Chances are, it's not a problem," said Mike Ornella, the man leading the Army Corps cleanup. A 1994 report said the site "is a possible danger to the public," and a 1997 report cited "strafing, practice bombing, air-to-ground rocket firing, some high explosive bombing." Ornella said the Army Corps wasn't required to do more to inform anyone about the possible dangers, even though their records show they knew construction was coming. " The order specifically says that "project construction personnel shall be notified ... of the site's history of military use."
