The rest of the characters -- the music-loving Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), the drunken Mayor and Mother Sister (Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee), even the pot-stirring Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) -- were humans, not props. The Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, where the film takes place, was once considered rough -- now "the people who once considered Bed-Stuy a jungle lazily walk their tiny dogs past me," wrote Jason Reynolds in Gawker. The issues raised by the film -- gentrification, ethnic clashes, police presence, the impact of violence -- remain topical. Instead, what audiences found was a film more infused with sadness (and humor!) Look at the ever-present conflict between violence and nonviolence.
