President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up their Sunnyland summit Saturday with a late-morning stroll in the California desert. Obama gave the Chinese leader a parting gift: a bench made of California wood. During the summit, President Xi publicly invited Obama to visit China. Over two days, the two leaders met for a total of eight hours at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands, just outside Palm Springs in California. For the first time, China agreed to work with the United States to  limit the production of greenhouse gases.
