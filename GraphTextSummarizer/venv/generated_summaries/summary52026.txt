Don't forget that the other eight planets also have their differences: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are rocky; Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; and Uranus and Neptune are ice giants.

It was demoted to a dwarf planet, leaving our solar system with just eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. One person who never accepted Pluto's demotion is Alan Stern, principal investigator for the New Horizons spacecraft, the first spacecraft sent to Pluto. But the group's definitions -- and the public's attachment to tiny Pluto -- sparked lots of debate.
