The IAEA said in a November report that it has "serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions" to Iran's nuclear program. " Iran has denied such allegations, saying the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate electricity and operates under IAEA supervision. The United States and other Western nations have expressed concerns that Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology mean it is developing a nuclear program for military purposes. Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant is just weeks from operating at full capacity, the country's top nuclear official said Saturday. At 1,000 megawatts, Bushehr will be able to provide 2.5% of Iran's current electricity consumption, the IAEA said.
