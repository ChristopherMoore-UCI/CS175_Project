It's also worth noting that the FAA uses the term, near midair collision, for more serious events in which two airplanes come within 500 feet of one another, whereas near miss is a more subjective term. As a result of last month's near miss at Newark Liberty International Airport, the rules for takeoffs and landings at the New Jersey airport were changed. There was also a recent incident in Florida in which the FAA confirmed a commercial jet landing at Tallahassee Regional Airport nearly collided midair with a drone. There were 4,394 near misses in the year ending September 1, 2012, according to an FAA report. In that April 24 incident, an Embraer ERJ-145 operated by ExpressJet was cleared to take off on a runway at the same time United Flight 1243, a Boeing 737, was landing on the intersecting runway.
