-- Violence killed hundreds of Iraqi civilians in August, authorities said Wednesday, a day after President Barack Obama marked the end of the U.S. combat mission in the country. Before the speech, some Republicans urged Obama to acknowledge that the 2007 U.S. troop surge in Iraq ordered by then-President George W. Bush had worked. Roughly 50,000 U.S. troops will remain in Iraq until the end of 2011 to train, assist and advise Iraqi troops. Obama praised American troops for their sacrifices in Iraq and said the country is in position to shape its own future. "The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people," Obama said in an address from the Oval Office.
