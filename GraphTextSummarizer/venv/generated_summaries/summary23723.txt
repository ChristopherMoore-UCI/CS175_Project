The area where his body was found on the former Iron King Mine site is being treated as a crime scene, which the sheriff's office described as "common protocol." The body of Emmett Trapp was found by search and rescue personnel at 11:30 a.m. about one mile from his home, lying in a muddy pit once used to collect waste products from a former mining site. " Emmett was the second 2-year-old boy to go missing from Yavapai County in 10 days. Newnum said the door to the house was unlocked at the time of Emmett's disappearance, and it appears the boy walked as many four miles, crossing hilly, rough terrain, before he was found. Emmett was reported missing by his mother at 8 p.m. Monday, the sheriff's office said in a news release.
