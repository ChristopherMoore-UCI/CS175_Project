Two of the four inmates who escaped through the ceiling in the shower of the Caddo County Jail in Anadarko, Oklahoma, this weekend have been captured, Caddo County Sheriff Gene Cain told CNN on Monday. They broke a lock on the hatch above the shower head, Cain told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV, and then moved through a crawl space until they reached a wall, where they knocked out concrete block or two. The four inmates made a clean getaway Sunday after prying open a maintenance hatch in their shower -- the first escape from the 2-year-old Caddo County jail, Cain said. The men were spotted by Grady County District Attorney investigators as they were walking to a convenience store. Four orange inmate uniforms were found outside the jail, CNN affiliate KOCO-TV reported.
