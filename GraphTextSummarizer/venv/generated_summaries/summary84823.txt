Mohammed said two other simultaneous explosions took place at other military facilities. The Friday attacks came the same day suicide bombers suspected to belong to a militant Islamist group targeted a military base in nearby Maiduguri. Three suicide bombers drove a stolen black SUV toward a Joint Task Force headquarters, but could not get through the gate, military spokesman Lt. Col. Hassan Mohammed said. Saturday evening, a suicide bomber launched another attack in Maiduguri, Mohammed said. The Red Cross official said Boko Haram is suspected in the Damaturu attack as well.
