"In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds, scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere," the NASA statement said. "The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth's atmosphere, located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude." Normally, noctilucent clouds are not visible to the naked eye and can only be seen when illuminated by sunlight below the horizon. "Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation, evolution, and properties of noctilucent clouds, which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes. Natural noctilucent clouds, also called "polar mesospheric clouds," are "found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset," according to a NASA statement published earlier in September. Keith Koehler said the Black Brant XII Suborbital Sounding Rocket was launched to study the Earth's highest clouds.
