-- Doctors in Colorado spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with signs of a neurologic illness: limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter. Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. Dr. Mark Gorman said the patients, who ranged in age from 4 to 15, all suffered from a respiratory illness before being hospitalized with significant weakness in one or more of their limbs. One has tested negative for enterovirus D68.
