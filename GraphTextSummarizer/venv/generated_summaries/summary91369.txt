Long known to her radio fans for her outspoken nature and sometimes controversial interviews with celebrities, she is now navigating the switch from radio to television with "The Wendy Williams Show." Williams' mix of celeb guests, "Hot Topics" and straight-forward advice to audience members led Entertainment Weekly's critic-at-large Ken Tucker to headline a recent blog item "Are you watching 'The Wendy Williams Show'? Williams has also had several high-profile feuds with celebrities, notably Whitney Houston, who have been less than enthusiastic about her dishy gossip style and what they perceived as prying questions. "Wendy Williams has a really unique, honest personality who audiences really relate to," he said. But while Williams still asks the questions many fans want to know (and retains her catchphrase, "How you doin'?"), she said, her television show is different. That doesn't stop her from sharing everything from her love of wigs to information about her breast implants -- without which, she recently told viewers, she was "naturally a long, floppy A [cup]." Rob Dauber, executive producer of the show, said daytime television needs Williams' bluntness.
