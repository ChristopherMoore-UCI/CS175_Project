But the TVA and the federal Environmental Protection Agency have reported that air and drinking water in the area were safe and that the levels of toxic substances in the spill did not exceed federal standards. The mixture of water and ash was enough to fill nearly 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools, spreading across more than 300 acres of land and fouling the adjacent Emory River. " TVA spokesman David Boruff said that the fine was expected and that the utility would not challenge it. -- Tennessee state officials slapped the Tennessee Valley Authority with $11.5 million in fines Monday for a massive coal sludge spill in December 2008. About 60 percent of the 1.1 billion-gallon spill has been removed from the river in the first phase of cleanup, Boruff said.
