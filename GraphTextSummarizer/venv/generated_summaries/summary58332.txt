" The legislation -- Simplifying the Ambiguous Law, Keeping Everyone Reliably Safe Act, or STALKERS -- was introduced in the House last week by Reps. Loretta Sanchez, D-California, and Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina. Stalking laws have not caught up with emerging technology, she said, and the bill will bring the laws into the present "to give law enforcement the tools they need to combat stalking in the digital age." "The one thing that I think is very, very sad about the whole ordeal is, he's going to jail for a little over two years," said Andrews, who appeared with members of Congress on Tuesday in support of legislation to strengthen federal stalking laws. The man convicted of videotaping her through a hotel peephole was sentenced to two years in prison, ESPN reporter Erin Andrews said Tuesday, but in a way, she was sentenced to a lifetime of looking over her shoulder. Michael David Barrett, 49, pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in December after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of Andrews.
