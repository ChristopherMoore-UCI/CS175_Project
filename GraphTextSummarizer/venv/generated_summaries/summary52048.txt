Enter eHighway -- a bold new idea to adapt existing technology behind tram lines to electrify trucks on the highway. "Whenever you have trucks driving the same route shuttling goods back and forth all day, that is where we want to use this technology." But with road transport accounting for about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, there is a pressing need to find cleaner ways of hauling cargo. "Right now we only have electro mobility for cars, and with this project we want to develop the technology to drive trucks electrically," says Michael Lehmann, the technical project manager of the initiative. With that in mind, the eHighway project seeks to combine the efficiency of rail transport with the flexibility of trucks.
