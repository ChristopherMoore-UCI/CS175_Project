The aircraft, carrying 153 passengers and six crew members, was pulled back onto the taxiway and towed to the gate, according to Delta spokesman Anthony Black. Black said Delta and the airport will investigate to determine operating conditions at the time of the incident. "It was like a toboggan ride down the runway, and we just couldn't make the turn at the end, and we slid off the runway into the grass," passenger Steve Maranowski told CNN affiliate WDIV. -- Passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight experienced an unexpected bump Sunday when the plane rolled off the runway after landing in Detroit. It's not clear yet what caused the plane to slide off course, spokesman Scott Wintner said.
