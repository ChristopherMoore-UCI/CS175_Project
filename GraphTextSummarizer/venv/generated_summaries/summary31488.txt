Stroll down into the city through plazas shadowed by cathedrals and peppered with restaurants. -- Cartagena , the historic jewel of Colombia's Caribbean coast, is a secret that's getting out. Enjoy a michelada (a local favorite of beer with lime juice in a salt rimmed glass) and watch the sunset over the Caribbean. Everywhere you look in town there are fruit stands with tiny windows for taking juice orders. Protected by ancient stone walls that enclose its vibrant port, Cartagena is almost entirely surrounded by the Caribbean Sea.
