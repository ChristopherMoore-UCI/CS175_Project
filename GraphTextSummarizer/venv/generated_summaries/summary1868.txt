In unscheduled and unusually personal remarks, President Barack Obama tried Friday to explain why African-Americans were upset about last week's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin while lowering expectations for federal charges in the case. Protesters stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely here to stay To supporters of such laws, Obama said they should consider if the right to fight back with a gun would have applied to Martin. "We applaud the president's call to action to bring communities together to encourage an open and difficult dialogue." However, some conservative commentators criticized Obama for what they called divisiveness by speaking as an African American instead of representing the entire country. "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago," Obama told White House reporters in a surprise appearance at the daily briefing. " African-Americans feel the context of the Martin killing is little known or denied, "and that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different," Obama said.
