[Breaking news update 11:35 p.m.] Diana Nyad has broken swimmer Penny Palfrey's 2012 distance record in the Cuba to Florida swim, putting her closer to Key West than anyone has ever swum without a shark cage. "This is farther than she has gone in any previous attempt," team navigator John Bartlett wrote on Nyad's website. She's said it will be her last attempt at that mark, after previous attempts that were thwarted by dehydration, ocean currents and excruciating jellyfish stings to her tongue.
