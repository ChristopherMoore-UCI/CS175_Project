"If she cares about children with special needs, then why did she cut spending on them by 62 percent?" Actually, Palin almost tripled their funding in only three years from $26,900 per student to $73,840 per student. The Associated Press ran this headline about a speech she gave at her church: "Palin: Iraq war 'a task that is from God'" In the story, they omit the first part of the sentence they're quoting along with the entire previous sentence for good measure. "Sarah Palin believes God told her to go to war with Iraq!" While I'm sure those extra 133 days were filled with personal discovery, I can't imagine anyone seriously trying to make the case that Obama is experienced and Palin isn't. When Obama's campaign complains that Palin would be one heartbeat away from the presidency, they should consider that their candidate would be zero heartbeats away.
