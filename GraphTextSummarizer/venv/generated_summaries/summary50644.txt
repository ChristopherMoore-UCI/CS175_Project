While the President would "welcome" further congressional action, a senior administration official says, "we believe we have the authority that is necessary" to wage war against ISIS. The President can issue strong policy regulations and orders when it comes to health care and the environment, but he shouldn't act without Congress when it comes to war. But what about the larger issue of voting to authorize war against ISIS? "Right now we believe, as the President has stated, that he has the authority he needs," says House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Except for this: Republicans have recently made a fetish of complaining that President Barack Obama won't let them vote on things.
