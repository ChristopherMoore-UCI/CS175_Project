-- Somalia's transitional federal parliament has unanimously backed the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in the country after a vote over the issue was brought to parliamentarians Saturday. The new form of law would replace the traditional charter, which was not as strict as Sharia law. Alshabab previously declared that it would continue fighting until Sharia law is imposed in Somalia. The parliament's vote comes amid high tension in Mogadishu after the killings of key supporters of Ahmed's government in recent days. "Calling us anti-Islamic lawmakers is now over," said Osman Elmi Boqore, deputy speaker of the Somali parliament, after voting ended.
