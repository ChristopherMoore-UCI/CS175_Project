That would be consistent with launch patterns from Apple, which for the past several years has announced new iPhones in early fall. The new iPhones may also be part of a one-two punch from Apple, which has been under pressure to innovate and which has promised new products in 2014. For the previous six years, Apple had offered only a single, iconic phone even as competitors rolled out phones with many sizes, shapes and prices. Last year, Apple borrowed from the playbook of Samsung and other competitors by releasing the high-end iPhone 5S and the cheaper, more colorful 5C model. The phones will have display screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches across, when measured diagonally -- a major leap from the 4-inch displays on the iPhone 5S and 5C. Such a move would appear to be an effort to keep up with the competition.
