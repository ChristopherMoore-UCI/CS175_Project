Gregg Lohman, 36, was airlifted from the crash site Saturday with head and neck injuries, Master Trooper Norman Chaffins of Kentucky State Police told CNN affiliate WAVE. Lohman had slowed down for an earlier, fiery crash on the interstate when another driver failed to notice the slowed traffic and crashed into the back of Lohman's truck, police told WAVE. Lohman, who has also performed with Lady Antebellum and SHeDAISY, is also a percussion instructor at Tennessee State University. Pickler confirmed the crash on her Facebook page Sunday: "Yesterday, my drummer Gregg Lohman was in a horrific car accident and is currently in ICU," the "Red High Heels" singer wrote. -- A drummer for country music star Kellie Pickler was seriously injured in a pileup crash on Interstate 65 in Kentucky, officials said.
