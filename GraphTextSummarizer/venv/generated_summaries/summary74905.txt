Olympics are days away The shooting came as the global spotlight falls on Russia, which will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in four days. In a rare school shooting in Russia, the attacker entered his school in northern Moscow with a rifle and held students and a teacher hostage in a biology classroom, the Investigative Committee of Russia said. -- A Moscow high school student shot a teacher and a police officer dead and held about 20 other pupils hostage in a classroom Monday before he was disarmed and detained, Russian authorities said, just days before Russia hosts the Winter Olympics. "On his way to the class the shooter injured one of the teachers who died later," said the committee, Russia's federal intelligence agency. Russia is pouring resources into ensuring that the Olympic Games, seen as a flagship project of President Vladimir Putin, go off without problems.
