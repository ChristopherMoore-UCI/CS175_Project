-- Google has used its wealth of data to compile an interactive crisis map for massive storm Sandy, giving users up-to-date information about storm surges, power outages, shelters and evacuation routes. The storm continued to churn through the northeastern U.S. Tuesday morning, bringing extreme weather conditions in a broad path that stretched from north Georgia all the way to Canada. By toggling through various options, users can get information including: -- Tracking data from the National Hurricane Center -- Alerts, evacuation notices and other announcements from Weather.com and the U.S. Geological Survey -- Current radar and cloud images from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory -- Live cameras and YouTube videos of the storm being posted in specific areas Superstorm Sandy's wrath: Deaths, flooding, outages - and no end in sight Google also has created a New York City-specific map, powered by NYC Open Data, which compiles information from city agencies and other organizations. Sandy, which was then a hurricane, crashed ashore Monday night, leaving 16 people dead and millions without power in 10 states and the District of Columbia.
