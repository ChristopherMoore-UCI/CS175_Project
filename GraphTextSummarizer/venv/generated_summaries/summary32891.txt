Modernisme, or Catalan modernism, is a cultural movement that took hold in Barcelona in the late 1800s, encompassing Art Nouveau and other artistic styles. Gaudi was a pioneer of Catalan modernism. A study in contrasts A trip to Barcelona wouldn't be complete without visiting its array of churches.
