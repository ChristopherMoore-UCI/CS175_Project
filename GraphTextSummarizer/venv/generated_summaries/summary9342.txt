Harte was the daughter of one of the best-known figures in Irish sports, Tyrone Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte. Michaela Harte, a 27-year-old teacher, was found dead in her luxury hotel room on Monday by her husband of two weeks, John McAreavey. " On Monday evening, Harte also issued a joint statement with Bishop McAreavey. Harte asked the media to refrain from contacting his son-in-law, who's "isolated out there" in Mauritius, he said. "This is being viewed with much concern by the police and the government of Mauritius," Soopun said.
