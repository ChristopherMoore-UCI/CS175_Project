"The Price is Right" may be famous for Bob Barker (and now Drew Carey)'s lovely ladies, but now "The Price is Right" is holding a contest to find its first male model. In the game show's nearly 40-year history, the prizes have almost always been displayed by female models, but now one guy will get to try out the gig for a week on the CBS show, which is currently hosted by Drew Carey. CBS has announced that the search for a male model will air as a five-episode web series on "The Price is Right's" official website and on its YouTube channel in late September.
