While sparing much of New York and New Jersey, the much talked-about storm managed to wallop parts of New England on Tuesday. By then, travel bans in New Jersey and New York -- even places like Long Island's Islip, which got more than 20 inches of snow -- had been lifted, as some restrictions remained in effect in neighboring Connecticut. While residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts battled Tuesday's storm, others in the Northeast -- namely people in New York and New Jersey -- were breathing a sigh of relief. The National Weather Service has also reported about 16 inches of snow in Portland, Maine; over 21 inches in Hudson, New Hampshire; and 28Â½ inches in Orient on New York's Long Island. Seven states, from New Jersey to New Hampshire, declared states of emergency.
