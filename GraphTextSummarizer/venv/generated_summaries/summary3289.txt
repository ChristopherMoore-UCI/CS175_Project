The Colorado Office of Emergency Management says it is monitoring four other major fires in the state, two of which were contained as of Wednesday evening. The wildfire destroyed 346 homes, according to InciWeb, a website that gathers fire information from various U.S. agencies. As a result, no Independence Day fireworks are allowed on public lands, said Rick Barton, an information officer for the Pine Ridge Fire burning near Grand Junction. It called the fire the most destructive in state history. The most destructive fire in Colorado's history is now 90% contained, officials said Wednesday.
