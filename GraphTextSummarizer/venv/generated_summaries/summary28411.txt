To be a babysitter is to be part actor, part therapist, part housekeeper, part friend, part playmate, part athlete, part mom, part dad, part chef, part chauffeur, part waiter, and part saint, which I am not. "We were all slightly dreadful at first," author Chloe Caldwell said before a reading on the tour's last stop in Atlanta's Beep Beep Gallery. "We were joking that it could've been called the Combos and Rollos tour because of all the gas station food we ate," said 35-year-old Miller, a Michener Fellow at the University of Texas. "We're taking ourselves on tour, so to take ourselves too seriously would be kind of embarrassing," said Ellen, a co-editor of the Hobart literary journal and keeper of the Bulleit Bourbon bottle (which actually contained Maker's Mark) that was passed around before readings. The route from Texas to Georgia was based on a book tour that Ellen's husband did a few years ago and resulted from equal parts convenience and curiosity.
