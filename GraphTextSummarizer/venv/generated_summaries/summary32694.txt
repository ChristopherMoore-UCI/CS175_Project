Another of Gadhafi's sons, businessman Saadi Gadhafi, has offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels who, he said, cannot "build a new country without having us (at) the table." The European Union said Gadhafi forces had closed water-pumping stations in Jebel Hassouna along the route from Tripoli to Sabha while fleeing the capital. On Tuesday, the front line of the rebel forces was about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Sirte and about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Gadhafi forces. "We are also deeply concerned about reports that there are still thousands of people unaccounted for who were arrested or taken prisoner by Gadhafi security forces either earlier in the conflict or before it even started," said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Friday's visit by Moammar Gadhafi came as rebels were taking control of the capital and Gadhafi loyalists were preparing to flee, the teenager told a translator during an interview in a rebel compound.
