Here is a look at the top five jackpots in history, according to lottery officials: No. 1 -- In March 2012, lottery officials announced three winning tickets for the $656 million Mega Millions jackpot were sold in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland; No. 2 --  A Florida woman won the $590.5 million Powerball jackpot in May; No. 3 -- The $587.5 million Powerball jackpot was collected in November 2012 by a man in Arizona and a couple in Missouri; No. 4 -- A $448.4 million Powerball jackpot was split by two winners in New Jersey and one in Minnesota in August; No. 5 -- A single winner in South Carolina won the $399.4 million jackpot in September. The Mega Millions jackpot is juicy, but thanks to new, longer odds, it's entirely possible the payout could reach $1 billion by Christmas. If you're wondering how this stacks up against past prizes, it's the second-largest Mega Millions payout ever after the $656 million kitty collected in April 2012. That's because on October 22, Mega Millions made it more difficult to take home the big prize.
