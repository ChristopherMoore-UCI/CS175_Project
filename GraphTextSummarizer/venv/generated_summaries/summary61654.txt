Global media tycoon Rupert Murdoch spent hours Wednesday downplaying his political influence, even as British Prime Minister David Cameron said politicians in his country had been too close to Murdoch over the years. The younger Murdoch has already been called twice to testify before British lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at British subsidiaries of his father's media empire. "I think we all, on both sides of this house, did a bit too much cozying up to Mr. Murdoch," he told the House of Commons as his government was battered over testimony Murdoch's son had given the day before. Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch was having a bitter falling out with then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the elder Murdoch said Wednesday. Adam Smith, an aide to Hunt, resigned Wednesday, saying his contacts with Murdoch representatives had gone beyond what the culture secretary had authorized.
