Allowing only one spot per car shouldn't be a problem because the majority of Super Bowl XLVIII spectators are expected to use mass transit to get to the game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, McCarthy explained. The blueprint of New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on February 2, 2014, will look vastly different than it did in the regular season, according to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. The NFL expects nearly 80% of ticket holders to use mass transit that Sunday, which should leave enough parking spaces for the 16,000-20,000 fans who are expected to drive to the game, he said. But fans will not be allowed to take up multiple parking spots for their blacktop bashes, McCarthy said. Confining fans to the boundaries of their allotted parking spaces isn't new, McCarthy said.
