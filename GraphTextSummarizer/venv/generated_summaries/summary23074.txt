The movie star recently sat down with "Showbiz Tonight's" A.J. Hammer to talk about his latest project, the mob film "Killing Them Softly," and that nagging question of when he plans to marry partner Angelina Jolie. A.J. Hammer: Brad, we've got a mob movie and I believe the first one we've seen that has political campaign speeches throughout it. He finds this book about a crime syndicate, and he makes these comparisons to -- not politics, per se, or not just politics, but ... Hammer: I want to ask you specifically ... about an issue that's been at the forefront for you and Angelina, and that is the issue of marriage equality. Pitt: I think that guy did all right. Pitt: It's one of our last big issues of equality.
