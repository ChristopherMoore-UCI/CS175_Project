This yearÂ¹s October event is sold out, but Buono calls it "the best 40 bucks you could spend on beer." Put on by the Brewers Association, a national trade organization supporting craft beer, the festival has been going on since 1982. Beer and chocolate and beer and cheese pairing sessions are scheduled. It's a reflection of the "massively growing craft beer market" in the Tampa Bay area, said All About Beer beer and brewery manager Leigh Hambleton. Fortunately, there are beer festivals across the United States running parallel to the fest's official September 22-October 7 schedule. Beer festivals around town used to draw 100 people.
