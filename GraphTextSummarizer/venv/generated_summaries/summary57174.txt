"All 128 passengers were safely transported from the Coast Guard icebreaker, Amundsen, to the community of Kugluktuk" on Monday, said Theresa Nichols, a spokeswoman with the Canadian Coast Guard. Sunday, a Coast Guard icebreaker arrived to transport the people on board to land. -- The Canadian Coast Guard finished the job of ferrying passengers Monday from a cruise ship that ran aground on an unmapped rock. In addition to the passengers, 69 crew members also were on board, according to Nichols. Accommodations for the passengers have been arranged by the cruise ship company, said Nichols.
