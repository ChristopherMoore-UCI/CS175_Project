Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope.
