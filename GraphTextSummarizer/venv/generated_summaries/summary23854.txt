" FIFA said a total of 662 urine samples had been taken across different competitions last year, namely the FIFA U-20 women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 women's World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, Brazil 2014 qualifiers and men's and women's Olympic football tournaments. Now FIFA is taking steps to address any possible use of banned substances within football, announcing its plan to bring in biological profiles following discussions between president Sepp Blatter and his World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) counterpart John Fahey on Thursday. "To date, there has been one adverse analytical finding at a FIFA World Cup qualifier in October 2012," read the FIFA statement. -- Soccer stars will face a more systematic regime of drug testing following world governing body FIFA's decision to introduce biological profiles for players. "We have been testing this at the FIFA Club World Cup in 2011 and 2012, we will continue at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 with blood testing unannounced at training camps and games," said FIFA's Medical Committee chairman Dr. Michel D'Hooghe.
