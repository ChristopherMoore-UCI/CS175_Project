Yemeni security officials said that killing, which was carried out by men on a motorcycle, bore the hallmarks of al Qaeda. Yemen's security forces have been battling al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has been blamed for numerous attacks in the country. Al Qaeda gained strength last year after taking control of several towns in south Yemen. The diplomat, named as Khaled al-Onizi, and his assistant were shot dead in an attack on their vehicle near the Saudi official's residence in Bait Zabatan district, a suburb of the capital near Hadda district. In October, a security official with the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was shot dead in his car on his way to work in Sanaa.
