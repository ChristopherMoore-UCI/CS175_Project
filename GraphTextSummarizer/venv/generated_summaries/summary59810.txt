-- Novak Djokovic faces a race against time to be fit for this week's Monte Carlo Masters after revealing he is struggling to overcome an ankle injury. The World No.1 suffered the blow after rolling his right ankle during Serbia's Davis Cup victory over the U.S. last week. With the clay court season about to kick off, Djokovic is keen not to take any unnecessary risks ahead of the Masters events in Madrid and Rome before going into the French Open next month. The 25-year-old, who is based in Monte Carlo, is keen to compete in the tournament and will make a decision on Tuesday after being given a first round bye along with the other top seven players. Meanwhile, Spain's Tommy Robredo claimed his first title in two years after defeating South Africa's Kevin Anderson 7-6 4-6 6-3 in the final of the Grand Prix Hassan II in Morocco.
