Democratic sources familiar with the Clinton campaign plan say the former Secretary of State will help raise money and excitement for a number of vulnerable Democrats in the month before voters go to the polls in November. Clinton will also stump for a number of Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls, according to a source familiar with the planning. Clinton will headline her first public campaign rally next Thursday, when she travels to Philadelphia to stump for Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial nominee. The event is focused specifically on women supporting Wolf, a voting bloc that Democratic operatives hope Clinton can help turnout in November. Clinton will also headline events and fundraisers for Democratic senate candidates in Kentucky, Iowa, New Hampshire, Georgia, North Carolina and Colorado, according to a Democratic source.
