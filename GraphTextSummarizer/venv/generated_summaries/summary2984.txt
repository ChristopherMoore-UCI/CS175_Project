Among the sketches performed by the group were the Yorkshiremen, in which the four attempt to one-up each another in remembering horrible childhoods; "Crunchy Frog," in which John Cleese's inspector challenges Terry Jones' confectioner over some interesting chocolate creations; and, of course, the "Parrot Sketch," which was combined with the "Cheese Shop" sketch, allowing Cleese and Michael Palin to indulge in their fondness for synonyms and euphemisms. As the show came to a close, two frames came up on the O2's big screen: "Graham Chapman 1941-1989," in memory of the late Python member, and "Monty Python 1969-2014." There were a couple audio glitches at the beginning, but for the most part it was an enjoyable afternoon, with the show functioning more as a celebration of Python history than a demand for new material. Python has always been equal parts deadpan and silly, highbrow and low, and the "Monty Python Live (Mostly)" show -- which concluded Sunday at London's O2 Arena and was simulcast all over the world -- highlighted those distinctions. If there were any doubt that the members of the Monty Python troupe wouldn't be holding back in their farewell show, it came with a rousing version of "Every Sperm Is Sacred."
