The shortage of officers and the department's limited hours led to an incident in August that helped prompt state legislators to take action, CNN affiliate KOBI reported. "The state has an interest in maintaining a network of public safety throughout Oregon," said Amy Wojcicki, a spokesperson for the governor, in an e-mail statement to CNN. "It would have allowed us a calm breathing room to arrive a better funding source," County Commissioner Keith Heck told CNN. The measure would also impose a temporary income tax on residents of counties unable to pay for public safety workers due to budget cuts. But even if Kitzhaber and Oregon lawmakers pass the public safety emergency bill, local legislative leaders and the county's governing body would have to consent to it.
