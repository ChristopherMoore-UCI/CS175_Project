Abdel Magid Mattar, chairman of Red Sea Navigation, which owns the ship, said the company paid $1.45 million and Pakistani donors paid another $850,000, and the crew was released over the weekend. "The hijackers fed the sailors small amounts of rice," said Mohamed Sobhi, deputy chairman of the Red Sea Navigation Co. The Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, has been the site of numerous pirate attacks on merchant vessels. The pirates had threatened to kill the the hostages on several occasions if the ransom was not paid, and their deadlines were extended when they were told the payment was being arranged, Sobhi said. Ansar Burney, a Pakistani-based human rights activist, conducted the negotiations with the pirates and raised the ransom money from Karachi, Mattar said.
