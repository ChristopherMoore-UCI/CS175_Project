After all, Daryl-inspired GIFs and fan art abound online, and Reedus fans' perfect-for-a-T-shirt battle cry is "If Daryl Dies, We Riot." So watch out, Gov. Reedus barely appeared in the first season of the show, but by season two, the legions of zombie fans were infected with Daryl mania. Officially the coolest customer in the apocalypse, the crossbow-wielding Daryl takes out "walkers" with arrows, earning more fans every time. Last season, Daryl briefly reunited with his brother Merle. I didn't see zombie show or monster show, I just saw top quality A-list people and a script that was far better than all the other ones.
