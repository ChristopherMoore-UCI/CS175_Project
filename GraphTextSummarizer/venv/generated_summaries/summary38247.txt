Fidencio Rivera, chief deputy U.S. Marshal for Arizona, told CNN's "American Morning" that it's believed John McCluskey and Casslyn Mae Welch have left the Yellowstone National Park area where they initially were hiding out after McCluskey and two other men escaped from a prison in Arizona July 30. Rod Ostermiller, the acting U.S. Marshal in Montana, said Monday investigators were looking into whether the pair might have traveled to Montana's Glacier National Park, near the Canadian border. Renwick, 35, was arrested July 31 in Rifle, Colorado, after a shootout with police, and Province and McCluskey are suspected in the killings of a couple whose bodies were found Wednesday in New Mexico, Gonzales said. David Gonzales, the U.S. marshal for Arizona, warned Monday that McCluskey and Welch -- who authorities describe as McCluskey's cousin and fiancee -- "have nothing to lose" and may not surrender without a battle. Marshals arrested Province at 6:20 a.m. Monday, Gonzales said.
