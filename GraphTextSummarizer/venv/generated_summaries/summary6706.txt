Carrie Brownstein: First and foremost when we were going into season three we were thinking about other shows and what drew us to those shows and kept us coming back. The show has been very successful in luring a variety of stars to appear in cameo roles (several celebs including Jack White, Edward James Olmos, Selma Blair, Gus Van Sant and Sarah McLachlan have had bit parts). I think that in terms of the narrative landscape, really having place be distinct helps define shows. I feel like shows have a time and place. "We film only during the summer so it appears particularly sunny and bright, though I will tell you it is not that way always," co-creator and co-star of the show Carrie Brownstein told CNN.
