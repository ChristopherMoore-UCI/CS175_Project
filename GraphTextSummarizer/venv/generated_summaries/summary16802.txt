But not for the first time in Melbourne, an injury to Nadal early in an encounter hampered the Spaniard and Wawrinka opened his grand slam account with a stunning 6-3 6-2 3-6 6-3 victory. Courtesy of Wawrinka, the Big Four stranglehold at grand slams this decade is over. Nadal looked sharp in disposing of Roger Federer in the semifinals and not many thought he wouldn't complete the deal against the 17-time grand slam winner's fellow Swiss, even if Wawrinka upset three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. Nadal was thus deprived of a 14th major, which would have placed him joint second with Pete Sampras -- he was at Rod Laver Arena to present the trophies -- and three behind Federer on the men's all-time list.
