"The world must act to save a generation of traumatized, isolated and suffering syrian children from catastrophe," Angelina Jolie, UNHCR special envoy, who has worked to shine the spotlight on Syria's refugee crisis, said in a statement. In its first in-depth survey of Syrian refugee children since the conflict began in March 2011, UNHCR spoke to those now living in  Lebanon and Jordan. The report, entitled "The Future of Syria -- Refugee Children in Crisis," paints the picture of a painful life -- one of isolation, exclusion and insecurity for many refugee children. In such tough conditions, there are more Syrian child refugees out of school than in. These young boys, separated from loved ones, are among the many thousands of children who've escaped the shelling in their native Syria.
