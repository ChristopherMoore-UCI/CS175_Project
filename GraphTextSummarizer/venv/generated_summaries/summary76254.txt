Watch more on the report Â» Tobacco killed 100 million people in the world last century and will kill a billion in the 21st century, unless changes are made, said John R. Seffrin, chief executive officer at the American Cancer Society, Tuesday. In Africa, 518,000 people have died from cancer since the start of 2008 -- cervical cancer being the leading cancer killer among women, the report found. "Awareness of the global cancer burden pandemic and its causes will help establish and enforce policies, resources and programs to control cancer and tobacco, and to de-stigmatize cancer," according to the WHO report. Effective cancer treatment in developing countries, experts say, depends on prevention and more data. In addition, the rate of breast cancer has doubled or tripled in countries like Japan, Singapore and Korea, according to the report.
