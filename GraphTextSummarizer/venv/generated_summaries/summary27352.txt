" Twitter's expansion can also be explained by the proliferation of many of the world's top athletes equipping themselves with official Facebook pages and "verified" Twitter accounts as a way of interacting with their fans.. "Social media connects the world in real time and fosters a constant conversation about sports, which is exactly what sports fans crave," said Lowell Taub, head of sports endorsements at CAA Sports, which represents stars like David Beckham and Dwayne Wade.

No wonder then that 64 years after London staged the post-World War II "Austerity Games", this time around the Olympics has been dubbed the first "Social Media Games."
