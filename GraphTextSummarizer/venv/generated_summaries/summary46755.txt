Health Minute: More on West Nile virus risk Â» "People tend to discount this as a significant problem," Petersen said, "but more than 1.5 million people have been infected so far in the United States, and about 300,000 have had West Nile fever." Lyle Petersen,  a CDC expert who was infected with West Nile virus, says, "it will ruin your summer." In the time it took him to walk down his driveway in Fort Collins, Colorado, chat briefly with a neighbor and return to his house, Petersen got infected with a potentially serious mosquito-borne illness called West Nile virus. The incidence of West Nile virus has remained the same for the past four years, and Petersen says he doesn't expect this year to be any different. Petersen mentioned that some patients with West Nile virus can develop a severe neurological disease that can be fatal.
