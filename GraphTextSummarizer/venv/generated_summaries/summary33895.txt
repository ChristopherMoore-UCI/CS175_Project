But the Transportation Security Administration estimates that less than 3 percent of air travelers will receive enhanced pat-downs, which some travelers have called "groping" or worse. -- Dennis Gossard is fine with the enhanced security techniques at U.S. airports, and he said security agents are welcome to pat him down all they want if it keeps air travel safe. The TSA has said the ramped-up use of full-body scanning and pat-downs is needed to stop nonmetallic threats, including explosives, from getting aboard planes and are meant to head off attacks such as the one allegedly attempted by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab last Christmas. Forty-two percent said pat-downs didn't bother them. Gossard did go through a full-body scan at Los Angeles International Airport hours earlier but didn't get an enhanced pat-down.
