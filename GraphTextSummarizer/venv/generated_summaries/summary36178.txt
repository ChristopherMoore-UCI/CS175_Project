Jones wept as she and Gregory Mansfield -- her mother's father -- talked to CNN about the horror they felt seeing images on the Internet this week of a dead woman they are convinced is Nicole Mansfield. -- A few weeks ago, Nicole Mansfield called her daughter in Flint, Michigan. Nicole Mansfield had converted to Islam several years ago, her daughter told CNN Friday. Though it's unclear how the family knew to look on the Web to see the images, they say the FBI paid the Mansfield family a visit Thursday to ask them about reports that Mansfield was killed in Syria. CNN asked Gregory Mansfield why he thought his daughter going abroad was disturbing enough to warrant notifying the FBI.
