Gaming has outpaced other categories in its successful adoption of social networks, said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg during an October announcement of his support for a venture capital fund dedicated to social apps. But even at a time when Zynga Game Network, which makes the wildly popular "FarmVille," is valued higher than software giant Electronic Arts, social games don't have much street cred among hard-core gamers or industry veterans. For developers of social games, the challenge now is convincing skeptics that becoming Zynga is an honorable goal. But at the opposite end, creators of social games struggle to legitimize their work among their peers. Online games designed to be played on Facebook, called "social games" in industry jargon, have multiplied in the last few years, since the world's largest social network introduced a Web platform for friend-enhanced applications.
