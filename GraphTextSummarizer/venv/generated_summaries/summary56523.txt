Hughes said he was contacted 18 months ago by Joe, who expressed interest in his gold chassis iPhone handsets. According to Hughes' website, this iPhone includes 600 flawless white diamonds, a full solid gold dressing and 53 diamonds on the rear that make up the iconic Apple logo. The Chinese businessman, identified only as "Joe," contacted Hughes and asked to have a rare, black diamond incorporated into the iPhone. Hughes spent nine weeks creating the solid gold chassis of an iPhone 5 and then placed the black diamond as the home button. The appraisal Joe had done on the black diamond put its value at approximately $14.5 million, according to Hughes, who said he saw the certificate of authenticity.
