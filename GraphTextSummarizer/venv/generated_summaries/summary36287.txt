" Marcus Reid, assistant district attorney in Etowah County, called Savannah's death "one of the most serious cases we've ever had." "We've had too many children die because parents and stepparents and people responsible for them don't do what they should do," he said last month. At about 6:45 p.m. that day, Hardin called 911 and said Savannah had suffered a seizure and was unresponsive, Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin said in a news release. Authorities say Savannah Hardin died last month after her grandmother and stepmother forced her to run around the family's house for three hours as punishment for lying about taking a chocolate candy bar. Savannah died last month at Children's Hospital in Birmingham. Joyce Garrard, 46, is facing a capital murder charge in her granddaughter's death, said Heather Rickles, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office in Etowah County, Alabama.
