-- Chinese Internet users have come out in strong support of American data leaker Edward Snowden, with many calling on Hong Kong to refuse handing him over to the United States should an extradition request be made. But many observers believe Snowden has scant chance of avoiding U.S. authorities, citing an extradition treaty signed between the U.S. and Hong Kong in 1996, shortly before the colony was handed back to Beijing. Now he is in China, we should protect him," wrote Beijing-based user Xiaodong Wang, a view echoed by a user named Sunflower, from Suzhou. On the other hand, the user wrote, at least in a democracy "the media has the right to write about it and help to improve the system," adding that similar revelations could never be made in China. Users were typically supportive of the 29-year old, who is believed to still be in Hong Kong after having checked out of his hotel Monday, with many commending his courage in exposing the secret surveillance program.
