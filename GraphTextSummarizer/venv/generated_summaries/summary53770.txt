" WTNH.com coverage of Middletown explosion Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance told WTNH his agency has received "an immense amount of inquiries" from residents who heard or felt the explosion. "There is no present or continuing threat to anybody from either substances getting into the atmosphere or of a possible subsequent explosion," Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano said, adding terrorism has been ruled out. A center was being set up at Middletown's City Hall for relatives of plant workers, he said. Santostefano initially said about 50 people, most of them construction workers, were working at the time, but Giuliano said "we don't know that as a hard number right now." "What I've been told by the owners of the project is that there could be anywhere from 100 to 200 people working on the site on any given day," Giuliano said. But Santostefano later said the numbers Giuliano cited were weekday figures, and he repeated his estimate of 50 to 60 people at the site Sunday when the explosion occurred.
