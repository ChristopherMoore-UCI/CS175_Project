-- The Super Bowl XX champions Chicago Bears -- regarded as one of the most colorful teams in NFL history with players nicknamed "The Fridge," "Da Coach," "Sweetness," and a punk quarterback -- has been invited to the White House next month to make up for a visit that was canceled 25 years ago, a White House official told CNN Thursday. Considered a die-hard Bears fan, the president said it was difficult to host the Green Bay Packers at the White House in August to celebrate their Super Bowl victory last February. "What are you going to do, go to Ditka's house next?" The Bears lost to Green Bay in the NFC Championship game last season, and the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl. An attendee list wasn't immediately available, but the 1985 team roster included such prominent members as coach Mike Ditka, whose Midwest provincialism inspired a "Saturday Night Live" skit with catchphrases such as "Dit-Ka" and "Da Bears" delivered in ice-hard Chicago accents; Jim McMahon, often dubbed the "punk quarterback;" the 350-pound-plus lineman William "The Fridge" Perry; and erstwhile all-time NFL rushing leader Walter "Sweetness" Payton, who died of cancer in 1999. Bears vs. Packers is one of the NFL's most intense rivalries.
