In 1819, Bolivar founded Gran Colombia, a federation of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. A new $116 million mausoleum to house Bolivar's remains is under construction in Caracas, Venezuela's government said in a statement Tuesday. But the revolutionary leader's thick sideburns, bushy eyebrows and steely gaze popped out from behind picture frames Tuesday in new 3-D images unveiled by President Hugo Chavez. So did historical paintings, photos of restored uniforms Bolivar wore and images of middle-aged Venezuelans, officials said. Researchers used several software programs to reconstruct the face of the man who liberated Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela from the Spanish crown.
