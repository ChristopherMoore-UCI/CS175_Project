Rice said when Gadhafi showed her the video montage years ago in Libya, she tried to keep the conversation on business. Rice also weighed in on GOP presidential contender Herman Cain's claims that racism is behind the recent surfacing of old sexual harassment allegations against him. "Quite extraordinary, weird and a bit creepy, " Rice told CNN's Piers Morgan on Wednesday night about the scrapbook. In her new book, "No Higher Honor: A Memoir of My Years in Washington," Rice said the ruler once played her a video montage of herself set to a tune called "African Flower in the White House." Earlier this year, anti-Gadhafi fighters ransacking his compound in Tripoli found an album of photos of the former top Bush administration official.
