The dead included a woman and the injured included two women and two children from the the Al-Bureij neighborhood  in central Gaza, medics said. -- The executive director of the organization sending a Libyan-backed ship laden with humanitarian goods to Gaza -- in violation of an Israeli blockade -- said Tuesday that the ship's captain has no plans to alter course. Meanwhile, upheaval continued in Gaza on Tuesday evening, when the Israeli military fired at least one shell into a house in Gaza, Palestinian security and medics said. The Israel Defense Forces had said its navy earlier was making "preparations to stop" the ship from delivering aid directly to Gaza, in violation of an Israeli blockade. The new aid ship was launched by a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
