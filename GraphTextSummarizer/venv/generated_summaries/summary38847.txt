Dan Meridor, Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy, said on Israeli army radio Friday: "Turkey said that Israel is not above international law, she needs to understand that she is not either." He added: "In accordance with Turkey, an international committee was appointed by the U.N., and it determined that the blockade on Gaza is legal." Turkey's prime minister says the country will follow aid ships to Gaza in an effort to stop incidents like last year's raid by Israeli commandos that killed eight Turks and one Turkish-American. The humanitarian workers and activists were shot dead by Israeli commandos in a botched raid on an aid convoy that was trying to break Israel's sea blockade of Gaza. Turkey declared last week it was downgrading relations with Israel, suspending all military agreements between the two countries and giving the three senior Israeli diplomats less than a week to leave Turkish territory. A United Nations investigation into the violent maritime event released a week ago found that the Israeli blockade of Gaza is a "legitimate security measure" in compliance with international law, but it said that Israel had used "excessive and unreasonable" force in the takeover of the ship.
