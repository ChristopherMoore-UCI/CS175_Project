On Thursday, UK Minister for Europe David Lidington raised "strong concern about the illegal and unacceptable abduction of an Estonian Security Service officer from Estonian territory by Russian Security Services" in a meeting with the Russian ambassador to London, the UK Foreign Office said. Security officer Eston Kohver is currently in a detention center in Moscow, lawyer Mark Feygin told CNN over the phone. Only last week, U.S. President Barack Obama visited Estonia, where he promised that fellow NATO members would protect the Baltic nation against Russian aggression. The Estonian officer "had a Taurus handgun, an amount of â‚¬5,000 in cash, equipment for covert audio recording, and materials indicative of an intelligence mission," Itar-Tass reported, citing Russia's security service, the FSB. Russian officials say the Estonian was detained in Russia's northwest Pskov region, where they allege he was carrying out an undercover operation, according to a report from state-run news agency Itar-Tass.
