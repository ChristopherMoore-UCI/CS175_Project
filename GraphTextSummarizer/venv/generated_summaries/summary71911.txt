By showing students as young as six how robots can solve real-world problems, Fundi Bots founder Solomon King Benge wants young people to develop a creative skill set they can apply to solve issues specific to their lives. "Fundi Bots is based in Uganda, but our five year mandate is to build a presence in five African countries by the end of 2020," explains King Benge. As well as presentations and video-based learning, Fundi Bots also offers hands-on robotics training and helps keen students form weekly Robotics Clubs. As the Ugandan students learn new ways to build robots, King Benge says there's no limit to what could emerge from the workshops and retreats. "We have a team in northern Uganda building an automated farming program," explains 32 year-old King Benge.
