The involvement of multiple nations raises concern about the level of computer security measures the partner countries have, officials said. -- Thousands of confidential files on the U.S. military's most technologically advanced fighter aircraft have been compromised by unknown computer hackers over the past two years, according to senior defense officials. The Wall Street Journal reported that the attacks appeared to originate in China, citing "former U.S. officials." Companies contracting with the Department of Defense now have to prove that they are using the proper computer security before a contract can be awarded, Pentagon officials said. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's self-diagnostic system was compromised by hackers, officials say.
