A Vicksburg resident, Walter Cook, died after being pulled from floodwater in Warren County, Mississippi, the county coroner said Thursday. -- The overflowing Mississippi River dealt anguish to its namesake state Thursday, reaching a historic height at Vicksburg, sending backwater up the Yazoo River, which has swallowed a home owned by the governor, and claiming the life of a 69-year-old man. Although recovery is a while off for areas that have already seen the worst of the floods, Tunica, Mississippi -- about 180 miles north of Vicksburg -- saw another step forward Thursday, with the return of a key economic driver for the region. The house is on a lake in central Mississippi near the backwater-flooded Yazoo River. The Mississippi is more than 14 feet above flood stage at Vicksburg and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927.
