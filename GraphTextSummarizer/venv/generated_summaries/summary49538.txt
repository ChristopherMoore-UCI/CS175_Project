-- The body of Sen. Robert C. Byrd arrived at the Capitol on Thursday, a rare honor for a man who rose from the poverty of Depression-era West Virginia to become the longest-serving member of Congress in history. His body will be transported to Charleston, West Virginia, Thursday evening, where it will remain at the state capitol overnight. Byrd will be buried Tuesday after a funeral service in Arlington, Virginia. "When I am dead and am opened they will find West Virginia written on my heart." Byrd, who died Monday at the age of 92, will lie in repose in the Senate chamber until 3:45 p.m. Thursday.
