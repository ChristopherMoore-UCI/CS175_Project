From barefoot tomboy to fashion supernova, fearless pop renegade Rihanna lives to bust all the rules. The other day I wore a black T-shirt, black Nobody jeans, a brown leopard-print belt by Dolce & Gabbana, and brown Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and it looked awesome. I love things like canopy beds, printed fabrics and Spanish touches. I do that onstage, matching red lipstick to a bright red jacket or neon-pink eye shadow to a pink jumpsuit. "I love the heavy chain over this pretty dress -- it's exactly the way I would do it," says Rihanna.
