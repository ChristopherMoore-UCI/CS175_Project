Photos: Deadly Hong Kong ferry crash "I thought we'd hit a rock or a lighthouse," said Chris Head, a teacher who was on the passenger ferry. The collision involved a passenger ferry traveling from Hong Kong Island to Lamma Island and a vessel owned by the Hong Kong Electric Company, which was carrying company employees and their families to watch the scheduled fireworks display. I don't know where my two kids are." Residents on Lamma, a lightly populated island southwest of Hong Kong Island, reported being awakened in the middle of the night by the massive rescue operation going on offshore. Hong Kong is home to more than 200 outlying Islands, including Lamma. The narrow sea lanes leading into Hong Kong's main deepwater harbor are some of the busiest in Asia, with giant commercial freighters, ocean liners, passenger ferries and private boats of all sizes sharing the waters.
