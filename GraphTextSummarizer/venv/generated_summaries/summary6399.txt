One of Detroit's top tourist attractions, the project was recently featured by CNN's Anthony Bourdain on "Parts Unknown: Detroit." -- A suspicious fire early Thanksgiving morning destroyed another home in Detroit's popular Heidelberg Project, an internationally known art installation plagued by six suspected acts of arson in recent months. Investigators with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are working with Detroit fire officials in the probe. The latest blaze, at about 6 a.m. Thursday, engulfed "The War Room," a vacant home decorated with colorful paintings, a Detroit fire official told CNN. The Heidelberg Project was created by artist Tyree Guyton in 1986 in an attempt to bring decaying homes back to life with decorations and transform the dilapidated properties into art installations.
