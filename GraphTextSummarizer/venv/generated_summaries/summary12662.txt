"Non-pecuniary damages" are defined as "loss of care, company and companionship." Sadly, after the Exxon Valdez disastrous oil spill, the United States Supreme Court in Exxon v. Baker ruled that punitive damages may be awarded in maritime cases only on a 1:1 ratio with compensatory damages. So Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has introduced Senate Bill 3345, which simply provides that in computing punitive damages in maritime cases, the amount of compensatory damages is not to be considered. Both proposals, which have multiple co-sponsors, allow for the recovery not only of pecuniary damages, but non-pecuniary damages as well. I make careful use of the term "more nearly fair compensation" because no amount of money could ever compensate any of us for Gordon's loss.
