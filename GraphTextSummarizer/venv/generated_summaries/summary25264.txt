Google teamed up with Samsung this week to unveil the Galaxy Nexus, an ambitious smartphone they hope will make a run at the iPhone while serving up Ice Cream Sandwich, a new version of Google's Android mobile operating system. "Ice Cream Sandwich could provide the critical push in the race to catch Apple," Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who is based in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg Businessweek. Phones running the system make up about 43% of the multibillion-dollar smartphone market, compared with the iPhone's 18%. "Galaxy Nexus isn't just a smartphone -- it's beyond smart," Google Senior Vice President Andy Rubin wrote on the company's blog. No single Android phone has captured the public's imagination like the iPhone, a fact that Google would love to change.
