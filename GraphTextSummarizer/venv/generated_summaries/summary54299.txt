Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know The accuser said he started going to the Sandusky home when he was about 12 and stopped going in 2009. The prosecution's final accuser Thursday refused to look at Jerry Sandusky when he pointed to him minutes after telling jurors the former Penn State assistant football coach sodomized him and forced him to perform oral sex while he stayed in Sandusky's basement during visits. Opinion: In Sandusky trial, a second act for McQueary? Alleged Victim 3 was asked by defense attorney Joe Amendola about his grand jury testimony, in which he said he had stayed at the Sandusky home more than 25 times, not more than 50 as he testified Thursday. Under cross-examination, Alleged Victim 6 acknowledged he maintained contact with Sandusky afterward, attending football games with him, meeting him and his wife for lunch and at one point borrowing his car.
