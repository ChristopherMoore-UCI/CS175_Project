It aims to stop Ebola transmission in affected countries within six to nine months and prevent its spread internationally. The outbreak, the deadliest ever, has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with a handful of cases in Nigeria. The vaccine, which does not contain infectious virus material, has showed promise in early tests on primates to protect them from Ebola without significant adverse effects, the statement said. The WHO issued a "road map" Thursday that "responds to the urgent need to dramatically scale up the international response" in light of the acceleration of new cases, it said. It will also try to overcome bottlenecks in vital supplies such as personal protective equipment, disinfectants and body bags.
