"When users click the pay by mobile button, the download is automatically initiated on their mobile phones and the fee is deducted from their mobile credit," explains co-founder Damola Taiwo, who is also the startup's chief operating officer. Mobile phone users can select the song they want to download and pay instantly for it using their credit. Fellow co-founder Dolapo Taiwo explains that because most musicians in the country have their own record labels, the team has to approach each artist separately. "Every problem is a potential opportunity," says Dolapo Taiwo. "We're looking to having a pan-African approach to this as time goes by because what we're actually solving is an African problem," says Dolapo Taiwo.
