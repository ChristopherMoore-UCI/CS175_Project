When I watched Diana wed Charles, I never imagined that I would get to meet her twice, in the coming years. If you think that the media and the public have gone hog wild over Prince Williams' wedding to Kate Middleton, you'd be surprised by how we were whipped into even more of a royal frenzy by the Diana and Charles nuptials. The first occasion was when Diana hosted a party honoring English designers at London Fashion Week in Flare, 1987. Diana greeted all of us in a reception line, with 5-year-old Prince William by her side. -- I'll never forget watching Lady Diana Spencer tie the knot with Charles, the Prince of Wales, on July 29, 1981.
