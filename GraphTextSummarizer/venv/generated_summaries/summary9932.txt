The military worries that Obama and his team will micromanage, especially in Syria -- something that President Lyndon Johnson did with disastrous results in Vietnam. The administration expresses confidence that a reconstituted Iraqi military along with Kurdish forces, working with American air power, can destroy ISIS in Iraq, but so far, press reports are skeptical. He felt excessive pressure as well on keeping a sizable number of troops in Iraq. Going to war is serious business, especially when the conflict promises to be long and messy. An additional challenge the administration faces is that the President has now announced America is going to war, but there are virtually no signs of mobilization on television.
