-- Freshman Republican Congressman Allen West clashed with an advocate for Muslim-American civil rights at a sometimes-rowdy town hall meeting Monday night. "If there is someone here who resides in Congressional District 22 who did not vote for Allen West, I want to hear from you," West said. Nezar Hamze, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Miami, stepped to the microphone and accused West of making anti-Muslim comments in the past. We cannot allow the Muslim Brotherhood to fill the void of leadership that can occur in Egypt," West said. West's promises to oppose the new health care law and efforts to raise the nation's debt ceiling drew rounds of applause.
