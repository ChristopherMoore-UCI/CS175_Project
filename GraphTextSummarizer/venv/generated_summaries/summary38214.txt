The delay means the final launch of Endeavour, which is also scheduled to be the last launch of the space shuttle program, is likely to be delayed until April 1, said Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for space operations. -- NASA engineers will repair small cracks found on the space shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank -- a development that could further delay its launch. The cracks on support beams called "stringers" showed up during the latest round of image scans that NASA has been conducting to determine when the shuttle can take off, the space agency said Thursday. Earlier cracks found in the foam covering the fuel tank have repeatedly delayed the shuttle's final launch, originally scheduled for November 1. Discovery is scheduled to deliver a storage module, a science rig and spare parts to the orbiting facility.
