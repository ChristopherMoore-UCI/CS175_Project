The Recovery Act funded local infrastructure projects like a new police station that provided work for the small architectural firm co-owned by Joe Weithman, helping it stay in business, Obama said. -- President Barack Obama pledged Wednesday that the Social Security system won't be privatized while he is in the White House. Later Wednesday, Obama was to attend a fundraiser for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, before heading to Miami Beach, Florida, for events with Senate candidate Kendrick Meek and gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink. Senate Republicans have filibustered the measure, which would provide tax breaks for small businesses and expand available capital to them through local banks. Before the meeting, Obama huddled around the kitchen table with the Columbus family of Rhonda and Joe Weithman to talk about how his administration's economic stimulus spending has helped it.
