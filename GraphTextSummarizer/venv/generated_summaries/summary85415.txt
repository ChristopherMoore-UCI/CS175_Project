Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid sat just feet from rival Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for a rhetorical battle royal over campaign finance and Reid's push to change the Constitution to limit that spending. Supreme Court allows more private money in election campaigns By setting spending rates, McConnell argued, Congress would choose who gets how much influence in politics. "Senator McConnell had the right idea (in 1988)," he offered. "I want to ask you Sen. Cruz - are you against anti-child pornography laws?" "This amendment is about power and it is about silencing citizens," boomed Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas.
