The campaigns of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney don't agree on much. "I'm seeing more and more conservatives who aren't Romney fans starting to say, 'You know what, it's time to start fighting Barack Obama and stop fighting ourselves,' " Erick Erickson, a CNN contributor and founder of Redstate.com, said earlier this week. For starters, the long Democratic primary campaign four years ago was widely believed to burnish Obama as a candidate. "We're using this time to build while they're destroying each other," top Obama adviser David Axelrod said earlier this week. Referring to rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, a Romney campaign staffer said, "The only person's odds of winning are increasing are President Barack Obama's," arguing it was time for Gingrich and Santorum to depart the race.
