It was in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand that Armstrong's infamous onstage meltdown happened, during the iHeartRadio Music Festival. Armstrong, who sought treatment for substance abuse two days after his expletive-laden meltdown during a show in Las Vegas in September, "is doing well," Dirnt said. -- Green Day canceled the rest of its North American club tour dates for this year and has postponed all January and February shows to give lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong more time to deal with substance abuse issues, the rock band said Monday. The 21-city tour that was scheduled to start on January 7 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and conclude on February 8 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas will be rescheduled, the group's announcement said. "You've got to be ... kidding me," said Armstrong, noting his longevity on the music scene and disparaging teen pop sensation Justin Bieber, who was not among the festival performers.
