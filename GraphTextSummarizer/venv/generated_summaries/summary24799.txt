-- CNN talk show host Larry King and his wife, Shawn King, each filed for divorce Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. California law provides for marital contracts, known as transmutation agreements, to designate ownership of certain property between spouses. When Larry King, 76, married Shawn Engemann Southwick, 50, on September 5, 1997, it was his eighth marriage to seven women. King has hosted a nightly prime time talk show on CNN since June 1985. The documents said the couple separated on Tuesday, the same day Shawn King signed her papers.
