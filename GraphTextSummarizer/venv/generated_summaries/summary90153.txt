Hence, this past Friday I took my daughter Casey out of school for our annual New York City fun day. Of those 10, seven or eight evoked either Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. " Ms. Hart: "What do you want?" Jeffie: "I'm Jewish." Ms. Hart: "So?" Jeffie: "I don't think it's fair that there are no Chanukah songs in the concert." Ms. Hart: "Don't be stupid." Finally fed up, one day I swallowed my anxiety and approached Mrs. Hart, our fifth-grade teacher -- a woman who scared the living hell out of me. My father is a quirky guy: a Brooklyn-born Jew who spent his childhood attending Hebrew school and avoiding bacon.
