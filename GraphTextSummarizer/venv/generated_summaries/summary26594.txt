Bittar also argued that the media coverage could lead to threats against Becker while in jail, but the judge said authorities aren't aware of any such threats. The defense sought the delay in the arraignment because Becker's attorney is new to the case and needs time to review police reports with his clients, Christl said. On the night of July 11, Becker and her husband argued about friends staying at their Garden Grove residence, prosecutors said in a news release. When she entered the courtroom inside a defendants' cage, Becker draped her long black hair over her face to hide from cameras. Becker told authorities her husband "deserved it" when officers arrived at the scene after she called 911, the police report says.
