The Pan Am Experience takes place in an airliner "cabin" designed to look like the jumbo jets that Pan Am flew back in the day. ABC even tried a TV series in 2011, starring Christina Ricci, about a group of Pan Am pilots and flight attendants who enjoyed the glamorous, globetrotting lifestyle of the emerging jet set in the 1960s. Anthony Toth, host of the Pan Am Experience, offers visitors a chance to re-create that feeling aboard a Pan Am Boeing 747 without leaving Los Angeles. The popularity of the Pan Am brand remains strong, decades after the airline went belly-up. Toth admits that he's obsessed with Pan Am.
