Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican hero for pushing austerity measures that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions, rallied supporters Monday night, one last push before a recall that's drawn lots of outside interest and money. Barrett told supporters Monday that Wisconsin voters are tired of Walker, whom he described as "a governor who's more interested in being the rock star of the far right." Recall vote is judgment day for Wisconsin governor Does Obama's absence portend outcome of Wisconsin recall vote? The recall effort was spurred by a Walker-backed law, signed in March 2011, to limit the collective bargaining rights of state worker unions.
