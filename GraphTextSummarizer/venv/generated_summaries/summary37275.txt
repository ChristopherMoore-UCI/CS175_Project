John Edwards entered the church Saturday, holding hands with Cate, and the Edwards' two other children, Jack and Emma. She also noted Edwards' love of Christmas, describing how the Edwards family, including John Edwards, decorated their Christmas tree last Saturday, just three days before she died. In a September interview on "The Nate Berkus Show," Edwards was asked what she sees when she looks at her estranged husband, John Edwards. In addition to the eulogies by McElroy and Cate Edwards, another friend, Glenn Bergenfield spoke, remembering when Elizabeth Edwards told staffers about her cancer. A friend of Edwards' family said Saturday that Elizabeth Edwards did not plan the funeral or instruct on many details.
