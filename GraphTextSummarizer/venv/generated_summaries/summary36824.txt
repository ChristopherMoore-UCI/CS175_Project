But it is also true that Hispanics have -- in gubernatorial, congressional and presidential races over the years -- been willing to cross party lines and support moderate Republicans who eschew anti-Hispanic nativism and craft a message that appeals to them. Or will they double down by sticking with President Barack Obama who, while earning two-thirds of the Latino vote in 2008, also heads an administration that has repeatedly lied to and manipulated Hispanics by promising immigration reform but delivering only record numbers of deportations -- more than 1 million since Obama took office? Will Hispanics take a chance on the Republican presidential nominee -- especially if it is Texas Gov. Rick Perry who has a record of attracting Hispanic support to the point of being attacked by Republican rivals who mistakenly cast the immigration debate as "us" vs. "them" and put Hispanics in the "them" camp? What better time to assert the right of Hispanics to be unpredictable and complicated human beings than Hispanic Heritage Month, which gives Americans the chance to learn more about, and pay respect to, the nation's largest minority. It's true that most Hispanics are registered Democrats, just like they have been for the past five decades dating back to the "Viva Kennedy" clubs in 1960.
