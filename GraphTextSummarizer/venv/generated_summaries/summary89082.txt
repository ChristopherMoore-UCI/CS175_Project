New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill Friday that would have banned crates that severely limit the mobility of pregnant pigs, a move that will win favor with Iowa farmers and spark more speculation about Christie's presidential aspirations but cause outrage among animal rights activists who pushed for the ban. New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, who authored the legislation, said Christie is "putting his personal political ambitions ahead of the humane treatment of animals. Branstad also said he and Christie talked about the latest measure during an Iowa event last month. With more than 20 million pigs, Iowa is the nation's largest pork producer, and the state's governor, Terry Branstad, told The Associated Press that he urged Christie to veto the bill when a similar version came to the New Jersey governor's desk last year. When a nearly identical version passed again in the Democratic-led legislature, Christie faced mounting pressure this fall from activists and celebrities, including Bill Maher, Danny DeVito, Martha Stewart and Edie Falco.
