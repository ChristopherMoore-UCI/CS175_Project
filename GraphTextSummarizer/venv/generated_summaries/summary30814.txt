Though decidedly racist against all black officers, the letter singles out one in particular -- Clive Higgins, who a jury recently acquitted of using undue force in the kicking of a detained man lying at the feet of Higgins. It starts out with the words "WHITE POWER" in capital letters. Whoever wrote the racist letter apparently didn't like that Higgins was acquitted alone and threatened his life for not going along with his convicted colleagues. Those men -- Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor -- resigned from the force, pleaded guilty to the kicking charges and will serve three months in prison, local news site ctpost.com reported. The letter was flagged to authorities by a police organization for minority officers, The Bridgeport Guardians.
