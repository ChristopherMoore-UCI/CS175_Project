" Behind Wagner on 11 under was Sweden-born Carl Petterson (67), playing in his first tournament since becoming a U.S. citizen, and Americans Sean O'Hair (67), Harrison Frazar (67) and Charles Howell III (69). "I was definitely telling people to expect something early this year, which is a nice feeling," Wagner told the PGA Tour's official website after following up his tie for ninth place in the season-opening Tournament of Champions at Kapalua last weekend. World No. 5 Steve Stricker, who won in Hawaii last Sunday, was nine shots behind Wagner after closing with 74. He was level with 2011 money list runner-up Webb Simpson (68), South Korean veteran K.J. Choi (71) and 2010 U.S. Ryder Cup captain Corey Pavin (71). Sporting a mustache he started growing last year during the off-season, he carded a three-under-par 67 in his final round to win by two shots at the Waialae Country Club.
