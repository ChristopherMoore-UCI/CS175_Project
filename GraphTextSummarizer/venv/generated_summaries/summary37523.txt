"These sentences are appropriate and fit what happened to Elizabeth at the hands of a truly evil individual who strangled and stabbed an innocent child simply for the thrill of it," Cole County prosecuting attorney Mark Richardson said in a statement. Bustamante, wearing a bright green inmate's uniform, apologized to the Olten family in court, according to CNN Columbia affiliate KOMU. Alyssa Bustamante received a life sentence for the October 2009 death of Elizabeth K. Olten, according to the Cole County Circuit Court clerk's office in Jefferson City. Bob Watson, media coordinator for Cole County Circuit Court, said a life sentence in Missouri equates to a maximum of 30 years on the charge of second-degree murder. "Hundreds of law enforcement officers and regular citizens of Cole County searched for Elizabeth for two days and nights in the cold and pouring rain in October of 2009," according to Richardson.
