-- Conan O'Brien's return to TV Monday night stuck close to the standard late night talk show format and set, but he could boast one innovation. Conan O'Brien's Tuesday night guest will be Tom Hanks. Otherwise, the one-hour TBS show has the desk, couch, sidekick, band and a guest promoting a movie familiar to late night audiences for decades. " O'Brien parodied his NBC firing in a pre-produced opening segment that included cameos by actor Jon Hamm on the "Mad Men" set and CNN's Larry King as Conan's guardian angel. O'Brien's requisite opening monologue made it clear that "getting fired" jokes are to Conan what divorce jokes were for Johnny Carson.
