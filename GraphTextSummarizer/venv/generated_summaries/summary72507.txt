-- British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, announced Tuesday the birth of their fourth child, a baby girl. The baby was born by Caesarean section at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, southwestern England, at midday. Samantha Cameron was visibly pregnant during the campaign that brought her husband to power in May. The baby weighed 2.75 kilograms (6 pounds, 1 ounce), and both the baby and mother are "doing very well," Cameron's office at Downing Street said in a statement. Their oldest child, Ivan, was severely disabled and died last year at age 6.
