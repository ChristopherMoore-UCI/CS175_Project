The group, which beamed from ear-to-ear as they stood around a table filled with food and drinks, included Jessica Biel, who played Mary, David Gallagher (Simon); Stephen Collins (Rev. Eric Camden); Barry Watson (Matt); and Catherine Hicks (Annie). Biel, who's gone on to star in numerous films and is now married to Justin Timberlake, had a high-profile guest role in the season 4 premiere of "New Girl" on September 16. Noticeably absent from the gathering was Mackenzie Rosman, who starred as the Camden family's youngest daughter, Ruthie. On Wednesday, Beverley Mitchell, who starred as Lucy Camden during the wholesome drama's 11-season run, shared a photo on WhoSay of herself dining with most of her fellow cast members. -- "7th Heaven" ended its run seven years ago, but the show's stars are still like family.
