I hoped telling a simple story -- where my only qualification was life experience (not a degree, award, successful business or book) -- could encourage those of us who make media to elevate other personal narratives: the stories of someone like Trayvon Martin, the undocumented worker, the candidate without money for press. I am being handed press when good press for important issues is hard to come by. So I ask: How can we build media platforms accessible to a diversity of content creators? In particular it is the barrage of media requests I've had that confirm that how I look and what I do for a living attracts enormous undeserved attention. It's a couple of stories and observations about working as a model for the last decade.
