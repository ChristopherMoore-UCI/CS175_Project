Spain's Prime Minister blamed the attack on the Basque separatist group ETA, although there was no warning call before the explosion, as often happens in ETA attacks. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its more than four decades of fighting for Basque independence. ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years. "My stance to stop ETA is unbreakable, so that people in the Basque country and Spain can live in peace, to halt this barbarity," said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, after the attack. The Spanish national police officer killed was Eduardo Puelles, said the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez.
