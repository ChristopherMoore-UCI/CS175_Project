Facebook already launched a product, Facebook Places, for doing just that -- but they later scaled it back and merged the features into your status updates. Beluga, a recent acquisition, is in the process of shutting down while Facebook works instead on Facebook Messages, a similar service. We know from the initial report that Gowalla employees will work on Timeline, Facebook's new scrapbook-like layout, and I'd guess that their skills will be used more generally, rather than working solely on location-based features. One conclusion you could naturally jump to is that Facebook wants you to share your location more often -- and the Gowalla team will build features into Facebook to do so. "Gowalla's vision is about people telling stories, and Facebook's vision for Timeline is about stories about important moments in life," said the source.
