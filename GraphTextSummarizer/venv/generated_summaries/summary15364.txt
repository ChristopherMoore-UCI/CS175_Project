Gallery: The work of Jack Kirby Â» It's not surprising that Marvel's art -- and those it influenced -- would start to look distinctly Kirby-esque, Marvel artist Herb Trimpe said at a Kirby panel in February. With Captain America came some of Kirby's comic book innovations, Evanier says. But as new generations discovered comic books, they discovered Jack Kirby, defending him amid the corporate takeovers and boosting his spirits. The nickname was meant as a joke, a little needle from Marvel Comics mainstay Stan Lee to artist Jack Kirby. In "Kirby: King of Comics," Evanier notes that from 1962 to 1964 alone, Kirby drew more than 3,000 pages and 285 covers.
