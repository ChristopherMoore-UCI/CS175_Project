If nothing else, Silva and his spray already have some high-profile supporters, including Portuguese soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. This, although somewhat awkward to watch, addresses a problem for referees and players alike: Although they're supposed to remain 10 yards away, opposing players have frequently crept closer to the free-kick taker in an effort to disrupt the kick, starting countless arguments about fairness. For the first time, FIFA referees are using the special spray to paint a temporary white line 10 yards from the free kick spot, marking the safe area into which opposing players cannot encroach. The vanishing spray, which was an immediate hit Thursday on Twitter, is the brainchild of Argentinian journalist and entrepreneur Pablo Silva. "It started seven or eight years ago when I was playing in a championship played amongst former school members," Silva told Reuters.
