This is the scene of a mass murder, but there is such a paucity of life here that blankets, pillows and other small household items are salvaged and ferried away. Acrid in the throat, omnipresent, extinguishing from the air all the other smells of city life -- because really there is none. The regime is moving to clear the remaining parts of Aleppo of rebels and their supporters, of all human life it seems, because human life here is opposed to them by ideology or just association. It is baffling how life is sustained in Aleppo. This is not a war that has an adjusted, moderate society waiting to spring to life in the first throes of peace.
