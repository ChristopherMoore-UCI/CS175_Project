Liz Cheney, whose upstart bid to unseat Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi sparked warfare in the Republican Party and within her own family, is dropping out of the primary race, she said on Monday. In a statement after her announcement to drop out, the Wyoming Republican Party praised Liz Cheney for being a "stalwart supporter" and fundraiser for Wyoming candidates and county parties in the past. " Cheney's surprising decision to jump into the race, an announcement made in a YouTube video last summer, roiled Republican politics in Wyoming, a state that her father represented in Congress for five terms in the 1970s and 80s. The issue flared in August after the Wyoming media reported that Cheney improperly received a fishing license despite not living in the state for at least a year, as the law requires. "Serious health issues have recently arisen in our family, and under the circumstances, I have decided to discontinue my campaign," the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney said in a written statement.
