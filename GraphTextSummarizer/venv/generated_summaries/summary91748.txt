The fundraiser at the home of actor and activist George Clooney in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles attracted dozens of guests including Clooney's girlfriend, actress/model Stacy Keibler; DreamWorks studio executive Jeffrey Katzenberg; designer Diane Von Furstenberg; Barbra Streisand and her actor husband James Brolin. Obama is locked in a tight race with presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney. -- Hollywood pulled off another blockbuster as a star-studded guest list delivered $15 million into the campaign coffers of President Barack Obama Thursday night. A Politico/George Washington University poll released this week shows Romney with a one-percentage point advantage, 48%-47%, over the president among likely voters, well within the survey's sampling error. In a largely jovial address to guests, Obama acknowledged that the road to the White House in 2012 will be much different than the campaign four years ago.
