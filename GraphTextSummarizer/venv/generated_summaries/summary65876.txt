The Marc Webb-directed feature again stars Brit actor Andrew Garfield as the web-slinging Spider-Man and his girlfriend, Emma Stone, as on-screen love interest Gwen Stacy. "The wonderful thing about Peter Parker and what makes Spider-Man a great hero is his compassion, his humanity, his sensitivity, his care and love for others, his need to protect others and his ability to have empathy for others. Stone, Dargis writes, "brightens" the sequel, while Garfield, "who's making a career out of playing delicate flowers, fits the role, suit and moist sniffling fine." As the 30-year-old actor told CNN at "The Amazing Spider-Man 2's" New York premiere, personality traits he may have felt insecure about actually come in handy when he portrays Peter Parker. And I think that's Peter Parker.
