Previously, the only people who could get Glass were developers or people who applied for the device through Google contests. There also didn't appear to be any organized protests of the sale, despite isolated assaults against Glass wearers in this city amid recent tensions between longtime residents and a recent influx of tech-industry staffers. A day before opening up the online orders, Google announced the latest round of software updates for Glass, which will roll out later this week. Google did say it had sold out of the white, or "cotton" color of Glass. In response to dissatisfaction with the quality of video calls on Glass, Google has removed that feature until it can be improved.
