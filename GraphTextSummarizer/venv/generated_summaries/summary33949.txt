The Android-based gaming phone is still a prototype according to the report, so it's unlikely to arrive before the holidays; we'd bet on a Q1 or Q2 2011 release. The fabled PlayStation Phone has finally surfaced, and it is definitely packing Google's Android OS. While those reports contained several details concerning the device, there wasn't much in terms of proof. Engadget reports that the PlayStation Phone sports 512 MB of RAM, 1 GB of ROM and a 1GHz Qualcomm MSM8655 Snapdragon chip. It includes a multitouch touchpad, trigger buttons and microSD card support.
