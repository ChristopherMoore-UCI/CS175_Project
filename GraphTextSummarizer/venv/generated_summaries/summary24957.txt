"On 17 February 15, the Biloxi Police Department responded to a reported assault at the Kress Live Entertainment Venue involving Mr. Joseph Edgar Foreman who performs under the stage name Afroman," the Biloxi Police Department arrest report read. "My understanding is (the woman) got up on stage, and he hit her," Police Chief John Miller told the Biloxi Sun Herald. A video shows the rapper and guitarist playing his guitar Tuesday at a concert in Biloxi, Mississippi, when he whirls around and apparently slugs a woman who was dancing on stage behind him. Don't get on stage with Afroman. An audience member climbs on stage and leads her away.
