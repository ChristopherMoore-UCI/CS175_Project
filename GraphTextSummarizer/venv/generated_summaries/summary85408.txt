" Hutchinson's attorney, Rai Sue Sussman, said the soldier informed the Army that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of Kamani. Her lawyer said she refused to go because there was no one to take care of her 10-month-old son, Kamani, and she feared he would be placed in foster care. Alexis Hutchinson tell it, the Army forced her to make an agonizing choice between serving her country and taking care of her son. " Less than 24 hours after her fellow soldiers took off from Hunter Army Airfield, Hutchinson turned herself in and was arrested by military police. The Army, however, takes issue with the soldier's story and Hutchinson could now be facing serious charges for desertion.
