The club produced a record turnover of $455 million for the year ended June 2010, more than double that of local rivals Manchester City, but suffered a big swing from last year's profit of $77 million -- which was largely due to the world-record $130 million sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. We have £165 million (£260 million) in the bank, but in some ways we would prefer to have £80 million in the bank and Ronaldo on the pitch." Giggs targets third European crown Gill was heartened by figures such as those showing that the club has the lowest wages-turnover ratio in the Premier League of 46%, despite player salaries rising from $195 million to $210 million. "There are very good results for the club with records here, there and everywhere but they are complicated with non-cash items and exceptional one-off hits," Gill said. By comparison, Premier League champions Chelsea's wage bill was last reported at $226 million, Manchester City's is $212 million and Arsenal's $175 million.
