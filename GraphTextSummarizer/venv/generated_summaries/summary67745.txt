Douglas Alward was caught near Yuma, Colorado, about 145 miles east of Denver and about 50 miles south of the Sterling Correctional Facility he broke out of Sunday, prison spokeswoman Katherine Sanguinetti told HLN's "Prime News." Alward, 48, was serving a 20- to 40-year term for attempted murder, assault and kidnapping and had broken out of prison three times before, Sanguinetti said. Zavaras said searchers tracked Alward to a 4-square-mile patch of cornfields outside Yuma on Wednesday morning. -- A Colorado convict serving time for attempted murder was recaptured Wednesday after breaking out of prison over the weekend, and a female hostage with him was released unharmed, prison officials said. Prison officials are looking at how Alward obtained the tools, but don't believe he had outside help, Zavaras said. Zavaras released few details of the escape, but said an investigation into how Alward broke out of the maximum-security facility was under way.
