Nadal, however, is almost certain to reclaim No. 1 this fall since he trails Djokovic by less than 300 points and has no points to defend until 2014. Djokovic, though, had reason to celebrate Monday as he became just the ninth man to spend at least 100 weeks at No. 1 on the tennis tour. "I was taught to dream big and to dream to be No. 1 in the world," Djokovic told the ATP website. Federer holds the men's record for weeks at No. 1 at 302. Although he only landed one grand slam title in both 2012 and 2013, Djokovic appeared in a 14th straight grand slam semifinal in New York this month, moving him more than halfway past Federer's impressive record of 23.
