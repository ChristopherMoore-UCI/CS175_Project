There are sites like EveryBlock, which lets users punch in their ZIP code to get local news updates, and Topix, basically a home for glorified message boards focusing on individual communities.

"Technology has done a great job putting us in touch with the people we don't live close to," said Tolia, who co-founded customer review site ePinions.com in 1999.

Nextdoor is part of a growing trend of online sites and tools geared toward filling a gap left in part by commuter culture, frequent moves and dual-income homes.
