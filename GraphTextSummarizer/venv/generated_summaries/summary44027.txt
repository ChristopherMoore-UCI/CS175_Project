Beauchamp said he's hoping Verizon will agree to reduce or eliminate early-termination fees for existing customers and lower prices on phones sold without contracts. Mike Beauchamp, a Verizon customer and blogger from Wichita, Kansas, said he started the Change.org petition 11 days ago after he heard Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam say he'd consider killing cell phone contracts if consumers asked for it. "Verizon Wireless has for years offered many different choices for customers, including contract plans or month-to-month plans that do not require a contract," said spokeswoman Debra Lewis in a prepared statement. Customers who try to switch carriers before their contract is up often face hefty penalties -- up to $350 for Verizon customers, according to the carrier's early-termination policy. A petition calling for the carrier to end contracts for smartphones and "create an affordable way for consumers to purchase their devices" had attracted more than 60,000 signatures by Wednesday morning on Change.org, the online petition platform.
