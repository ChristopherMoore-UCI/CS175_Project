While it started as his ideas, Belitsky wrote on Twitter that he believes the trip meant more to their new friend Alam than to anyone else. "Alam is taking a timeout in my old bedroom, speaking to his wife, trying to get it together," Wuebben wrote on Twitter. Six days and 3,000 miles later, Belitsky put an exclamation point on the journey with an unadorned post on his Twitter page: DONE.
