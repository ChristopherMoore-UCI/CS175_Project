-- Elizabeth Johnson -- whose 8-month-old baby, Gabriel, disappeared in 2009 after she allegedly took him to Texas -- was found guilty Thursday of unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference. Instead, the jury found her guilty with aggravating circumstances on the lesser charge of imprisonment and two custodial interference charges. McQueary didn't hear from Johnson until several days later, when she reportedly sent him a text message saying she'd killed Gabriel and put his body in a Dumpster. Johnson originally told the boy's father that she had killed Gabriel, but after she was arrested, she told police that she gave the baby to an anonymous couple in San Antonio, CNN affiliate KPHO-TV reported. The mystery began December 17, 2009, after a judge awarded Johnson and Logan McQueary, the boy's father, joint custody of Gabriel.
