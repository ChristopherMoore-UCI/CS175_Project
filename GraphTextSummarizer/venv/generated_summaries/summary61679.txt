Yields on Spanish sovereign debt suffered their biggest one-day percentage jump since September as the row over slush fund allegations engulfing Mariano Rajoy, Spanish prime minister, and his party rattled investors. Spanish and Italian bond and stock markets tumbled on Monday, bringing a months-long rally to an abrupt halt as investors pulled back amid a political storm in Madrid and as Silvio Berlusconi staged an electoral fightback in Italy. Mr Rajoy also sought to dispel fears that his government would be weakened by the scandal -- and may find it harder to push ahead with economic reforms and austerity measures. But with Spain's opposition party calling on Mr Rajoy to resign as prime minister over the allegations, the country's benchmark 10-year bonds on Monday rose 23 basis points to 5.44 per cent. Mr Rajoy over the weekend denied allegations first made in El PaÃ­s that the prime minister's centre-right Popular Party operated a slush fund from which it paid money to senior party leaders, including Mr Rajoy himself.
