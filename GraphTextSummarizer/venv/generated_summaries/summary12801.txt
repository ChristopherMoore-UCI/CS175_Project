That is not sustainable," says Andy Ridley, co-founder and executive director of Earth Hour. That is the big challenge, that we all move and that the economies can adapt to the change." Organized by the World Wildlife Fund, Earth Hour started in Sydney in 2007, when WWF-Australia encouraged 2.2 million individuals and more than 2,000 businessmen to turn off their lights for one hour to support action on climate change. For Ridley, the important question is not if action on climate change is happening, but "is it happening fast enough," he says. -- On Saturday, European Space Agency astronaut and World Wildlife Fund ambassador AndrÃ© Kuipers will watch from the International Space Station as each time zone hits 8:30 p.m. -- and track to see who on Earth turns out the lights. Earth Hour 2012 has commitments from individuals, companies and landmarks to switch off lights in 147 countries and territories and over 5,000 cities, organizers say.
