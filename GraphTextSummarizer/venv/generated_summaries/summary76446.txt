" Holding to too high a price point could be fatal for foreign businesses, as Indian consumers have less capacity to pay than Western consumers. " Business practices are also different in India, and many foreign businesses underestimate the bureaucratic hurdles they will encounter, according to Pawan Budhwar, associate Dean of Research at Aston Business School and co-author of "Doing Business in India: "If you have a local player, they can perhaps better handle local dynamics like this." Budhwar said that within "modern sectors" such as IT, software and pharmaceuticals, and developed business enclaves such as those in Gurgaon, Pune and Hyderabad, levels of professionalism were often in line with international business expectations. But Singh said that for Western companies rushing to enter the Indian marketplace, it needs to be recognized that the country is a very different proposition -- both in terms of business practices and consumer preferences -- and must be treated accordingly. But by making their products affordable to the mass market, businesses put them within reach of hundreds of millions of potential consumers.
