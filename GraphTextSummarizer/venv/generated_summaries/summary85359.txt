"In Michigan, we are doing everything we can to become the home of this new electric auto industry -- and to the jobs this industry will create," wrote Gov. Jennifer Granholm. She said that for automakers, replacing the 100-year-old internal-combustion engine is both "revolutionary and daunting." Ann Marie Sastry, director of the energy systems engineering program at the University of Michigan, said the industry will have to take risks and government support will be essential. Granholm said all of Detroit's Big Three automakers -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- are working on electric vehicles. -- The future of Detroit is electric cars, the governor of Michigan declared in an opinion piece on Newsweek's Web site. The Chevy Volt is one of the electric cars being developed by Michigan's auto industry.
