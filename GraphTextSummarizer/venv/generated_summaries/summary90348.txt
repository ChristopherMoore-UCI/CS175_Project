Yet even as ISIS were broadcasting video of the pilot's killing, they were also trying to figure out how to deal themselves out of the situation they found themselves in with Mueller. And every single time anyone in the Western world wonders publicly why Arab nations aren't being more vocal in condemning ISIS, we play into their hands. Indeed, there was a similar episode back in 2004, when the group's mentors, al Qaeda in Iraq, held humanitarian aid worker Margaret Hassan. I am, of course, not alone in being outraged by ISIS' recent spate of hostage-taking and executions. And spin is what this is all about; if there is the potential for good publicity, then there is also the potential for some very bad publicity.
