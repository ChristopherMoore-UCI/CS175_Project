Weather has delayed the scheduled Monday morning delivery of the final two sections of a 408-foot spire to the top of One World Trade Center, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Port Authority Assistant Director of Media Anthony Hayes said the original design included a radome -- short for radar dome -- but that was rejected because of anticipated servicing and maintenance difficulties. The two pieces form a stainless steel beacon weighing almost six tons and will be the final piece put in place to give the building an iconic height of 1,776 feet, according to a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. While under construction, One World Trade Center became New York City's tallest building a year ago, standing 1,271 feet above street-level. The radome would not have impacted the height, but would have provided an additional design element, which ultimately proved impractical, Hayes told CNN.
