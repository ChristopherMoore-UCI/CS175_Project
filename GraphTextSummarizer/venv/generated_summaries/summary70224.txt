I just want to spend all my time talking to him and looking at him," mother Jennifer Carter told CNN on Friday. Flanary told CNN he will be filing a motion to dismiss the charges because they violate Carter's First Amendment rights. "Any clear reading and full reading of the context of that statement would make it obvious that this was just a sarcastic joke," Chad Van Brunt, one of Carter's attorneys, told CNN on Friday. The brief interview marked Carter's first public comments since he was jailed in February. Authorities said someone reported the comment -- which came about two months after the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- leading to Carter's arrest February 21 on a felony charge of making terroristic threats.
