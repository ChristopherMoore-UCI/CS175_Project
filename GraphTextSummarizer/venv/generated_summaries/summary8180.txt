-- Now is not the time to repeal the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the U.S. armed forces, Sen. John McCain said at a hearing Thursday. McCain questioned the results of a report that found that most military personnel would not change their career plans if the policy was changed, saying that only a fraction of military personnel responded. Once the Armed Services Committee's hearings are over, the spotlight will turn to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, said he believes that even among those combat forces, a transition to a new law is possible. The questions asked how military units would respond and adapt if it were repealed.
