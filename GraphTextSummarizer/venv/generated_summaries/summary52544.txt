The ideological battle comes as Prince William is scheduled to begin a Royal Air Force tour of duty there next month -- a move which has drawn more attention to the islands at a time when Argentinian officials are increasingly criticizing the British presence in the area. British Prime Minister David Cameron has offered a different take, criticizing Argentinian officials for their renewed claims to the island. Fernandez has recently emphasized her country's claim to the territory, saying she wants British officials to enter into talks with Argentina over the islands, which are known as the Malvinas in Argentina. Demonstrators marching outside the British Embassy in Buenos Aires this month burned British flags and urged Argentina to sever ties with the United Kingdom. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinian and 255 British troops died.
