Portsmouth will go into that match as massive underdogs and hardly encouraged by West Ham's 1-0 win over Sunderland in English Premier League action on Saturday, which confirms their demotion after a season of financial turmoil. They started the match the brightest and had strong appeals for a penalty turned down by Howard Webb as Norway striker John Carew appeared to be pulled down by Jon Obi Mikel. Terry had been given the chance to shoot after a poor headed clearance from a corner by Villa center back Richard Dunne. Whoever reaches next month's showpiece will face a Chelsea side, who are leading the Premier League and playing with renewed vigor since their shock Champions League exit to Inter Milan. It proved another Wembley letdown for Martin O'Neill's Villa, who were beaten in the English League Cup final by Manchester United.
