Here's a quick guide to find the best products to protect your family from the sun: --Use a sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 15  and a maximum of SPF 50; --Make sure labels list UVA and UVB (or broad spectrum protection); --Avoid products containing oxybenzone and retinyl palminate if you're concerned about potentially toxic chemicals; --Choose lotions versus spray sunscreens for a more evenly distributed protection. They end up being expensive and don't offer more protection than SPF 50." Keep in mind, SPF protects only against UVB rays. The Environmental Working Group says this ingredient does not make sunscreen more effective, and until definitive research is available, consumers should avoid sunscreen products containing retinyl palminate. To make the watchdog group's safe list, sunscreens must be free of oxybenzone, retinyl palmitate (a type of vitamin A), not have SPF above 50 and protect against UVA and UVB sunrays. Numbers game The Environmental Working Group said consumers should not purchase sunscreens with SPF greater than 50.
