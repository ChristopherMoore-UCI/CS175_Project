After serving time, rapper Ja Rule is now on a more spiritual path. Ja Rule, born Jeffrey Atkins, served roughly two years in jail for tax evasion charges and attempted criminal possession of a weapon. The artist, who had a thriving career in the early 2000s as part of the label Murder, Inc., told New York radio station Power 105.1 that he's gone from following a troubled path to seeking Christianity. "I kind of reconnected with God by doing the ... movie," Ja Rule told the radio station. Since his baptism, Ja Rule said that he's become friends with the church's pastor, Carl Lentz.
