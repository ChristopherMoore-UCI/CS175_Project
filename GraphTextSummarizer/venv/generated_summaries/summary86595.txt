"To be clear: the Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated," said Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts. The Daily Beast reported on Monday that as far back as his first gubernatorial campaign in 2009, Christie expressed sympathy for parents of autistic children who wanted more input over which vaccines were administered to kids. The flap is a reminder that as a politician who made his name by telling it like it is, Christie will be carefully watched for any sign he is toning down his act or hedging on difficult issues as he tries to navigate the early skirmishes of a likely presidential campaign. "All I can say is we vaccinated ours," Christie said, while touring a biomedical research facility in Cambridge, England, which makes vaccines. Christie "is very moderate in what he is saying, but he is going to get pummeled as anti-vaccine," Largent said.
