"It is clear that for many of our members two websites would make things more difficult, so we are going to keep Netflix as one place to go for streaming and DVDs," CEO Reed Hastings said in a blog post. The company's public relations nightmare began in July, when Netflix announced that it would stop offering free streaming video services to households that paid for its DVD-by-mail service. "This means no change: one website, one account, one password ... in other words, no Qwikster." Actually, that puts Netflix back at square two -- before the Qwikster fiasco, but with price hikes. Then Netflix said in September that it was splitting its DVD and streaming services into two companies: Qwikster and Netflix. Not all consumer reaction to Netflix's decision to kill Qwikster was negative, however.
