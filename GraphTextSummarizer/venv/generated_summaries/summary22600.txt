Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah condemned the crackdown on anti-government protesters in Syria on Sunday, saying there is "no justification for the bloodshed." Ties between Riyadh and Damascus also were strained by a January political crisis in Syria's former client state of Lebanon, during which Saudi Arabia gave up on efforts at mediation. And while Abdullah has condemned the Syrian crackdown, Saudi Arabia sent troops to Bahrain in March to help its neighboring Gulf monarchy suppress anti-government protesters there. In his remarks Sunday night, he said Syria's future "lies between two choices -- either wisdom or chaos." Syria is a longtime ally of Iran, Saudi Arabia's leading rival in the Persian Gulf region.
