Ballew ruled last week that not only should little Messiah's last name be changed -- from Martin to McCullough -- but also that his first name should be changed. His mother, Jaleesa Martin, and father, Jawaan McCullough, who are not married, couldn't agree on a last name for their baby, now 7 months old. Martin has appealed the court's decision; it will go before the Cocke County chancellor next month. That's why they ended up in the courtroom of Child Support Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew. Heartbroken and shocked, Martin told CNN Ballew gave the parents a one-hour recess to pick a new name and then issued the new name when she and the baby's father couldn't come up with one.
