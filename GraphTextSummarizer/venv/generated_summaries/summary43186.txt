-- Young Portuguese rider Alberto Rui Costa was rewarded for his bravery in taking part in a long breakaway as he won the eighth stage of the Tour de France in Super-Besse Saturday. Reigning champion Alberto Contador and last year's runner-up Andy Schleck were also prominent in the final 1.5km steep uphill drag to Super-Besse, but it was the impressive Evans of BMC who led them home, three seconds down on Gilbert. Stage one winner Belgian Philippe Gilbert burst out of a whittled down peloton containing all the main yellow jersey contenders to finish 12 seconds behind Rui Costa. Hushovd has been in yellow since his Garmin-Cervelo team won last Sunday's team time trial, but will come under pressure again on stage nine over similar testing terrain. As the breakaway group fragmented, Movistar's Rui Costa took advantage to pull clear, but he came under pressure from Astana's Alexandre Vinokourov who raced out of the peloton to catch all the early leaders bar the eventual winner.
