It appears fewer than 50,000 people successfully signed up for health coverage through the federally run Obamacare website during the first five weeks of open enrollment, falling well short of expectations for the period, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The Journal's figure is pegged to "834 transmissions" received by insurance companies to complete enrollments. It is not clear if it also included enrollments for a large expansion of Medicaid meant to provide insurance to more low-income Americans. It reported private health plans had received federal enrollment information for 40,000 to 50,000 users. A CNN analysis of publicly available data from the states with Obamacare exchanges showed 59,441 people had enrolled as of a week ago.
