"If you ask mothers who are doing breast ironing on their daughters, they will tell you that, 'no I'm doing it because I want to help her, I want to protect her from men,'" said Taku. -- Cameroon's high rate of teenage pregnancy is being blamed for driving mothers to use harmful traditions on their daughters -- including the unspeakable practice of breast ironing. "It's not easy to approach mothers who are involved in the practice of breast ironing," she said. "What is killing the Cameroonian girl in society is that mothers don't communicate with their daughters, they don't talk," said Taku. "Our victims help us a lot because they talk to mothers; they make the mothers understand that they suffered from this practice," Taku said.
