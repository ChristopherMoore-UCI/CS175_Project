House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki and others joined us to break ground on The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. A Stanford University study last year estimated that as many as 35 percent of Iraq war veterans will suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome, a condition that has already led to high rates of depression, suicide, substance abuse, unemployment, relationship and family problems, and other issues. But, while there are many fitting memorials to fallen soldiers, as well as monuments to our founding fathers, there is nothing for disabled veterans. As we prepare to pay tribute this Veterans Day to the courageous men and women who have selflessly served our country, the image of American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is in our minds. Editor's note: Lois Pope and Arthur H. Wilson are co-founders of the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation, the nonprofit organization that has spearheaded the development of The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.
