Most everyone would agree that Sterling's ideas fail in the marketplace of ideas. This past week, my inbox blew up with e-mails asking whether Donald Sterling's First Amendment rights were violated in the uproar over the Los Angeles Clippers owner's racist remarks about black people. The Sterling story is not that we found a bigot and dragged him to the gallows in the middle of the marketplace of ideas. Sterling represents the bad old days. Nevertheless, I reluctantly stand on Sterling's side today.
