-- The daughter of deposed Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi asked international prosecutors to begin investigating her father's and brother's deaths as possible war crimes in a letter submitted Wednesday to the United Nations Security Council. Ali Aujali, Libya's ambassador to the United States, said the National Transitional Council and the Libyan people wanted Gadhafi to be taken alive to answer for his crimes. Gadhafi was initially captured alive and unharmed as troops from the National Transitional Council overran his hometown of Sirte, according to Mahmoud Jibril, Libya's then interim prime minister. Aisha Gadhafi, who fled to Algeria in August 2011, asked International Criminal Court Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo last year to open an investigation. Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks captured some of the onetime Libyan strongman's last moments, as the bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi was being hauled onto a truck.
