If intelligent life forms do exist on other planets, and they try to contact us, Tarter will be among the first to know. Jill Tarter at the Allen Telescope Array in California, which monitors radio signals for signs of alien life. University of California professor Marcy is skeptical about the existence of intelligent alien life and believes our galaxy's vast distances would make communication between Earth and beings on other planets almost impossible. NASA hopes to launch within a decade a Terrestrial Planet Finder, an orbiting observatory that would detect planets around nearby stars and determine whether they could support life. So here we are not only having found planets, we are looking for habitable planets, signs of biology on those planets," Marcy told CNN.
