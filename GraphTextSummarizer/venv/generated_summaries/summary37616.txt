However, for the past few months, folks with Verizon iPads have had to buy separate external Verizon MiFi devices in order to connect when Wi-Fi wasn't available. Although connecting to the network when Wi-Fi wasn't present did require a bundled MiFi, costs were comparable and data plans were better than what AT&T customers were getting. Along with hearing the announcement about the Verizon iPhone Tuesday, we've learned that Apple's iPad -- which has been marketed by Verizon for some time -- will now actually be able to connect directly to the Verizon network. iPads with embedded Verizon chips will be coming soon; however, an exact release date hasn't yet been set. Now, as Apple's exclusivity with AT&T comes to a close, the iPad will be able to connect directly to Verizon's 3G -- and who knows, perhaps even its 4G LTE -- network.
