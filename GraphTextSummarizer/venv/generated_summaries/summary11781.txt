-- Manny Pacquiao will take a slight weight advantage into his fourth fight with Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez in Las Vegas Saturday. The Filipino tipped the scales right on the 147lb welterweight limit in the weigh-in at the MGM Grand Hotel Friday with Mexico's Marquez coming in at 143lb. He is anxious to get his career back on track, with the prospect of a showdown with American superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. still eagerly awaited by boxing fans. "It is most important to show people who the best man is," Marquez added. "We know each other really well and it's going to be a war," predicted Marquez after the weigh-in.
