Prince Saud al-Faisal told Arab League foreign ministers that "Syria did not comply with the Arab resolution plan," according to the Arab League official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. CNN cannot confirm the claims by opposition groups of violence and deaths, as Syria's government has limited access by foreign journalists. The presence of Arab League monitors in the country hasn't quelled daily reports of deadly violence. -- The Arab League agreed on a path forward in Syria on Sunday that instructs President Bashar al-Assad to delegate powers to his vice president following the formation of a national unity government. He spoke to reporters in Cairo following the Arab League announcement, calling for the protection of civilians in Syria, describing U.N. cooperation as vital and stressing the need for Al-Assad to resign.
