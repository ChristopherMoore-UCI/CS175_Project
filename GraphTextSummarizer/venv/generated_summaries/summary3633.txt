Modi's invitation to Obama, say India experts, is a simple but extremely important gesture that could jump-start relations between the two countries. That last point got me thinking about India's growing prominence and what the world might look like 50 years from now in terms of power. The study said that in 1750, China owned 33% of the global GDP and India, 24.5 %. India, of course, has a way to go to catch China, although it has already outranked Japan as the third largest economy. But some economists think that India has a chance to leap over China in about 50 years.
