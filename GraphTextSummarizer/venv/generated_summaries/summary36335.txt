" Kisida hadn't heard of other schools hosting entire days of school at museums, but some programs are trying to emphasize learning outside the classroom, like the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum School Partnership Program in Boston and Embarc in Chicago, he said. The final schedule spanned 87 sessions for students in pre-K through high school, far more than could be offered during a standard school day, sometimes allowing teachers to break out of their typical subject matter. He found that benefits were even greater for students who came from high poverty or rural schools, minority students and those who had never before visited a museum. "I got to see a lot of new students I haven't worked with and their outlooks on the art," Siegel said. In late February, students from the independent, private Galloway School in Atlanta spent the entire school day inside the museum.
