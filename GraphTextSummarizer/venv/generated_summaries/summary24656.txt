The bodies have been identified as Lester William Hobbs, 46, and Aja Daniell Johnson, authorities said at a Wednesday news conference. The girl's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City. Cherokee Ballard, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma state medical examiner's office, said Wednesday that the office used fingerprints to identify Hobbs and dental records to identify Aja. Authorities had been searching for Hobbs and the girl since late January, when Aja's mother, Tonya -- Hobbs' estranged wife -- was found dead inside an RV in Geronimo, Oklahoma. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with the girl and that she would keep the child away from Hobbs, the documents said.
