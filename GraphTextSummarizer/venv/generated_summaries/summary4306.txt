It's as if our leaders in Washington are standing on a beach holding fire hoses full open, pouring more capital into an ocean of capital. Efficiency innovations also emancipate capital for other uses. Efficiency innovations are liberating capital, but that capital is being reinvested into still more efficiency innovations. The dials on these three innovations are sensitive, but if set in a recurring circle -- with empowering innovations creating more jobs than efficiency innovations eliminate, and the capital that efficiency innovations liberate being invested back into empowering innovations -- the economy is a magnificent machine. We truly are awash in cheap capital -- which means that returns on long-term investments in empowering innovations will yield the same returns as short-term ones.
