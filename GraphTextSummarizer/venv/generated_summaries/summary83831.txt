Parenting.com: Yummy breakfast-in-bed ideas for Mother's Day The last Mother's Day I got to celebrate with my mom was May 10, 2009. My most precious Mother's Day gift She didn't end up making it out of the rehab in time to witness her grandson's birth, but she eventually made it home a few weeks later. While my husband and toddler went exploring in the hallways of the rehab center, my mom and I sat together, trying to enjoy our time but looking forward to better days. The Mother's Days since have been tinged with bittersweet longing. My mom wallowed in self-pity for a few days, thinking about how uh, crappy, it would be to have to walk around with a bag of stool taped to her stomach for the rest of her life, but did her best to clutch at her usual spunky, snarky self.
