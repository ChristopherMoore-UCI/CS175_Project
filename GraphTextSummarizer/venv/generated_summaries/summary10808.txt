The Chinese authorities have since put Gu Kailai -- the wife of the former Chongqing party chief, Bo Xilai -- under investigation in relation to Heywood's death. But he said he was making an exception "given the intense interest in this case." CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report. Among the companies Heywood advised was Hakluyt and Company a consulting firm founded by former officers of the British spy agency MI6. That link fueled rumors that Heywood might have had connections to the British intelligence services. "Mr Heywood was not an employee of the British Government in any capacity," Hague said in the letter, which was seen Thursday by CNN.
