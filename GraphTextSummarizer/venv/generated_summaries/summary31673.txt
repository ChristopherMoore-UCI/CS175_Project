Pacelle finds it outrageous that some people raise chimps as pets. Preiss gave three reasons why chimps shouldn't be pets. The chimp, which was well-known and liked in the community, escaped in 2003 and "wreaked havoc" on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours, said Stamford Police Capt. The Humane Society is asking people to support the passing of The Captive Primate Safety Act, which would prohibit interstate and foreign commerce for primates as pets. "But they grow up and become dangerous to manage." Just how dangerous was demonstrated Monday when a pet chimp named Travis attacked his owner's friend in Stamford, Connecticut.
