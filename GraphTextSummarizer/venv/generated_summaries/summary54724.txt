Opinion: Timbuktu tomb attack is an attack on our humanity One of the town's residents said the militants surrounded the ancient Djingareyber mosque area at 7:30 a.m. -- Members of two Islamist militant groups destroyed tombs at a shrine to Muslim saints Tuesday, according to the mayor of Timbuktu, Mali, and other residents. Mali was plunged into chaos by a military coup in March that ousted former President Amadou Toumani Toure. Last week, the United Nations called for sanctions against Islamist fighters in northern Mali and warned it is considering a proposal by West Africa states to deploy troops in the troubled country. "The Islamists ordered the people to leave the area before they started smashing the tombs," Mayor Ousmane Halle said.
