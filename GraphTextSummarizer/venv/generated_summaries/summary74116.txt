Watch Michelle Obama tell students about the garden Â» The first lady told a group of Washington schoolchildren on hand for the occasion that first daughters Sasha and Malia Obama were usually more willing to try fresh fruits and vegetables because fresh produce generally tastes better. "What I found with my kids [is that] if they were involved in planting it and picking it, they were much more curious about giving it a try," she added. First lady Michelle Obama helped break ground on a new White House organic "kitchen garden" Friday. "We're just hoping that a lot of families look at us and say this is something that they can do and talk to their own kids about and think a little bit critically about the food choices that they make," said Marian Robinson, the president's mother-in-law. The presidential garden will be used, among other things, for growing such staples as butterhead and red leaf lettuce, spinach, broccoli, onions, carrots and peas.
