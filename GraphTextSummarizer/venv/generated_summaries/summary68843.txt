Ranchers who thought they were doing the right thing were blindsided, said state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven. "With the government shutdown and no farm bill in place, we need South Dakotans to help their neighbors," Gov. Dennis Daugaard said. "Motorists must be aware that livestock carcasses or stray livestock may be present on or along the roadways at any time," the emergency management agency said in a statement. Oedekoven says he may never know the total number of livestock killed. "We have misplaced cattle everywhere," Oedekoven said.
