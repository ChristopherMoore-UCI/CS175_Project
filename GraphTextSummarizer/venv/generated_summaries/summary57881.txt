-- The National Rifle Association responded Friday to a chorus of voices calling for gun control in the wake of last week's horrific mass shooting in Connecticut by doubling down on its own position: more guns, not fewer, provide true security. Conservative Democrats and even some Republicans who have supported gun rights have said they are open to discussing gun control. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home Others pointed to the apparent contradiction among conservatives who want to reduce public spending but also support the NRA's idea to arm schools. Policies banning guns at schools create a place that "insane killers" consider "the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk," he said. Schools remain a target for criminal gunmen because they are not protected by armed security the way other important institutions are, LaPierre said.
