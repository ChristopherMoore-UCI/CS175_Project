We live in a society where women are necessary breadwinners whose income is counted upon for families to make it. Among topics that are sometimes seen as more traditional women's issues such as family planning, access to birth control and the right to choose, Hillary has the advantage in that she can make her stance clear, based on her life experiences as a woman. Hillary recently spoke at a Silicon Valley conference for women in the tech field with the theme of "Lead On." In the coming weeks, which serendipitously happen to be part of Women's History Month, Hillary's speaking schedule is heavy with events and gatherings that center around women. Women have been steadily making strides in the years since Hillary's 2008 campaign, and as they did, they smoothed the way for one of their own to run for the highest office in the land without having to play down her gender.
