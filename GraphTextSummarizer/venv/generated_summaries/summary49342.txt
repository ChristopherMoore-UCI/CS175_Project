" Koonin's comments come a day after general manager Danny Ferry began an indefinite leave of absence tied to controversial comments he made in June about Luol Deng, then a prospective free agent player. "As an organization, we must own these shortcomings and failures," Steve Koonin wrote in an open letter Saturday to his team, fans and the city of Atlanta. The Hawks' controlling owner then offered his thoughts on why more whites didn't attend games: "My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a significant season ticket base. -- The Atlanta Hawks organization's issues with race go beyond one inflammatory email or offensive comments on one conference call, the team's CEO said, before promising fans that those systemic problems will be corrected. " Levenson then outlined steps to take, like asking for more "music familiar to a 40 year old white guy" and that camera shots and "the kiss cam" don't focus as much on black fans.
