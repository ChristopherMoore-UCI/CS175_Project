Suspected cop killer Eric Frein was slapped with terrorism-related charges Thursday in Pennsylvania for allegedly admitting that he shot two state troopers in a bid to change the government and "wake people up," according to court documents. On Thursday, Frein was charged with two terrorism counts for committing "a violent offense intending top influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion" and committing a violent offense "intending to affect the conduct of government," according to court documents. After his arrest, authorities found a laptop, first aid supplies, shave kits, DVDs, contact lenses and even a copy of the New Testament belonging to Frein, according to police documents. The suspect told authorities he used a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop while on the run to access open wireless connections and use the Internet, according to court documents. After his arrest, Frein allegedly told investigators that he "wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was insufficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for," according to an affidavit filed in Pike County in support of the new charges.
