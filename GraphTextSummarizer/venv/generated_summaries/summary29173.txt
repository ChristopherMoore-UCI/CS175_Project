"We all know how that story ends." A spokesperson for Experience Hendrix tells Rolling Stone that the company had no idea the movie would include non-Hendrix songs. "They want to make a Jimi Hendrix movie without Jimi Hendrix music," says the estate representative. The company, which is run by Hendrix's sister Janie, said that it "has made it known many times in the past that no such film, were it to include original music or copyrights created by Jimi Hendrix, can be undertaken without its full participation." If the movie were to include songs Hendrix wrote, like "Purple Haze" or "The Wind Cries Mary," the producers would have needed permission from Experience Hendrix, which owns the copyrights to the material. Last month, Experience Hendrix LLC, which oversees the Hendrix estate, issued a statement regarding the movie, which has been in production for four months.
