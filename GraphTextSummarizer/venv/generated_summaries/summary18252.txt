"Star Trek" helmer J.J. Abrams told EW in November that he wouldn't be taking the reins of another intergalactic franchise: Disney's upcoming "Star Wars" extension. "I quickly said that because of my loyalty to 'Star Trek,' and also just being a fan, I wouldn't even want to be involved in the next version of those things," Abrams told Empire. But a new interview in Empire Magazine reveals that initially, Abrams did entertain the idea of putting his stamp on "Star Wars." Abrams has made no secret of his affection for "Star Wars." The "Lost" creator said that he and Kathleen Kennedy, the series's new overseer, had "very early conversations" about how he might be involved in "Star Wars: Episode VII's" development.
