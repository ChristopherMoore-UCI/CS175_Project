Zimbabwe's state media made no reference to the planned demonstration that was supposed to be similar to ones that toppled the long-serving leaders of Tunisia and Egypt last month and caused similar demonstrations throughout the Middle East and North Africa. -- For the group calling itself FreeZimActivists it is back to the drawing board after its planned protest against President Robert Mugabe's rule in the style of Egypt and Tunisia flopped in Zimbabwe. The group was arrested after authorities said they were caught watching footage of the protests that led to the ouster of Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia in January and of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February. Last week, Zimbabwe authorities charged 46 people with treason. "On 16 February they held a meeting and the purpose of the meeting was to organise, strategize and implement the removal of a constitutional government of Zimbabwe by unconstitutional means, the Tunisian-Egyptian way," prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba said in court on Thursday.
