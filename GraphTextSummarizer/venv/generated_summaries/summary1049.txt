The 49-year-old was admitted to the Sanatorio Los Arcos clinic in Buenos Aires on Monday after suffering an injury to his top lip, hospital spokesperson Izarriaga Facundo told CNN. In 1986 he scored an infamous "Hand of God" goal against England on the way to inspiring Argentina to World Cup victory. Maradona's Argentina side made a disappointing start to their World Cup campaign before qualifying for the finals in South Africa via a late goal against Uruguay in their last game in October. Since retiring from playing aged 37, he has battled several health problems related to his weight, drugs and alcohol. He was suspended from football for 15 months in 1991 after failing a doping test for cocaine while playing for Napoli in Italy, and was sent home from the 1994 World Cup in the U.S. for using ephedrine.
