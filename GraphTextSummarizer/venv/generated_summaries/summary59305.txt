The decrease in demand for air travel, and thus use of hotels and other tourism costs,  lasted for almost two years, triggering airline bankruptcies and eventually forcing the U.S. government to bail out airlines. Yet his measured response did seem to reassure the traveling public about the true risk associated with air travel: The AMEX index of airline stocks, which fell by 40.3 percent in September 2001, dropped by only 1.7 percent the day after Christmas, and had recovered completely by the first week in January, as had the stock of the airline itself. To put that risk in perspective: Traffic accidents in the U.S. annually account for about 150 times as many avoidable deaths as there were passengers on Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam. Those "self-inflicted" costs amounted to about three-quarters of a percent of U.S. GDP, the difference between a quick recovery and a prolonged recession. The Christmas Day attempted attack by would-be "underwear bomber" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab provoked the U.S. government to plan to spend $1 billion for full body scanners and other bomb-detecting devices at airports.
