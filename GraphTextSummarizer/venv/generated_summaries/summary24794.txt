The governor's order suspended one-week waiting period for store employees who seek unemployment benefits in Placer County. Roseville police and fire departments rushed to the scene, but both stalled in entering the mall because of the possibility the suspect may have had a bomb, the report said. The damage was so severe that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency at the time. -- A sprinkler system was turned off for more than an hour during a fire that devastated a California mall, a report says.
