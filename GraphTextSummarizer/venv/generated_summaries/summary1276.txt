Substantiated or not -- and no cases of Ebola have yet been identified in Central America -- linking Ebola and ISIS to border security is a way for Republicans to raise an issue that President Barack Obama and Democrats had sought to keep off the table until after November's midterm elections. The most direct link came from Rep. Duncan Hunter, who is sticking by his claim that at least 10 ISIS fighters were caught by border security officers trying to cross the United States' southern border. The seemingly disparate issues are gelling into a single talking point for Republicans arguing that weak border security is leaving the United States vulnerable. Also linking Ebola and ISIS to border security on Thursday was GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas. "It's so critically important to really use every tool, shut off every mechanism, for them and that disease and other potential diseases to come into our country," he said, adding that Shaheen has voted against GOP-backed border security measures and he wants to "call Sen. Shaheen out on that issue."
