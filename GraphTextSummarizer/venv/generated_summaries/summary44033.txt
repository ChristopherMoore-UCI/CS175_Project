Right when I came off tour (from her second solo album, "The Sweet Escape"), we started to write, and I was pregnant (with her second son, Zuma), and we did a lot of eating, a lot of chatting -- and then we had this magic 15 minutes from 4:45 to 5 o'clock where music would actually come out for a minute. Each member now travels in their own individual tour bus -- a must for an entourage that includes kids, toys and nannies. Kanal: This will be our first time on separate buses, only out of necessity. Stefani and her husband -- former Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale -- welcomed two sons, while bassist Tony Kanal is the only member to remain single and child-free. Instead of sharing a tour bus, you'll each have your own individual buses.
