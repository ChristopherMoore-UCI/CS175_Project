The letters said that Damascus, Aleppo and other Syrian cities "witnessed several terrorist bombings over the last weeks" that left dozens of innocent people dead, the state-run news agency reported. But opposition groups have said the regime is responsible for the violence that erupted after it began a crackdown on peaceful protests in March 2011. Some analysts said the attacks raise concerns about the presence of jihadist elements in Syria, noting Thursday's Damascus strikes resemble suicide car bombings during the sectarian violence in Iraq in the past decade. But recent protests and violence there could signal a significant shift. The latest bombings didn't deter Syrians from taking to the streets in protest across the country Friday, the day opposition groups have been staging nationwide protests.
