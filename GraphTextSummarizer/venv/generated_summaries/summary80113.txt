How have you seen games advance just during the course of time that you've worked on these Tiger Woods video games? And with Tiger Woods games expanding to Facebook and to mobile devices do you play those versions? In this exclusive interview, Woods talks about his love of video games, how his new game compares to playing the Masters and teaming up with future NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal in the kung fu viral video, "Duel of the Masters." The real awesome game at the time was Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Space Invaders, or games of that nature. That's interesting because most of the pro gamers play games like Halo, Call of Duty and StarCraft II.
