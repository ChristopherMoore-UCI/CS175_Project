No one from the Jackson camp has contacted county authorities yet, said county spokesman William Boyer. " Boyer said Santa Barbara county has never been approached about burial on private land. Jackson purchased the Neverland Ranch -- named for the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's "Peter Pan" -- in 1987 and filled it with animals and amusement rides. Santa Barbara County says it hasn't yet been contacted about burying Michael Jackson at Neverland. A lawyer from the Jackson family contacted state officials recently about possibly burying Jackson at the ranch that was his home for almost two decades, said Amanda Fulkerson of California's State and Consumer Services Agency.
