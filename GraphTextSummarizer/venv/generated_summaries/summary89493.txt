-- Serena Williams brushed aside Maria Sharapova in straight sets Sunday to claim the season-ending WTA Tour Championships in Istanbul. In 2011 Federer won in Basel, Paris and London in a superb end to the season. Federer, under pressure from Novak Djokovic for the top spot in the rankings, later withdrew from the Paris Masters this week where he is defending champion to rest up ahead of the ATP Tour Finals in London. Since mid-summer she has claimed the Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles before coming out on top in the WTA Tour's finale, despite having not played since her Flushing Meadows triumph. Sharapova, who beat World No.1 Victoria Azarenka in the semifinals, put up a brave fight, but was outgunned by the 31-year-old American.
