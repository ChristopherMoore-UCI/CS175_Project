The overall crime rate in the city increased 3% last year -- but "if you subtracted just the increase in Apple product thefts, we would have had an overall decrease in crime in New York," Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said. -- It's called "Apple picking," a growing wave of crime in which thieves target mobile devices, particularly iPhones and iPads. As mobile devices become more popular, stealing them has become a unique sort of crime that has law enforcement and government officials taking notice. In New York, a special police unit has been created to deal with stolen mobile devices. Apple's announcement came the same week that George Gascon, the district attorney in tech hub San Francisco, plans to meet with the New York state attorney general and representatives of cell phone companies to discuss ways of discouraging mobile-device robberies.
