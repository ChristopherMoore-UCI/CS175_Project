Chief executive Gerard Sinclair said, "As it does in every case the Commission will now give careful consideration to this new application. Swire does not believe al Megrahi was responsible for the bombing and is among a number of relatives of the victims who have been fighting for the evidence in the case to be re-examined in court. Dr. Jim Swire, whose 23-year-old daughter Fiona was killed in the bombing, attended court to file the application on behalf of the al Megrahi family, the Commission said. -- The family of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi has applied for a review of his conviction in a Scottish court for the 1988 bombing of PanAm Flight 103. "I previously indicated last month that there are several important matters which will affect the timescale within which the Commission will be able to deal with this fresh application and subsequently, if there is to be a further review of this conviction, any such review will take some time to complete."
