Portwood, 22, was arrested on May 24 for violating her drug court probation requirements by failing a urine test and then lying about it, Prosecuting Attorney Rodney Cummings said. " Portwood will likely spend two-and-a-half years in prison before being released on parole for the remainder of the five years, Cummings said. Kim Kardashian blames MTV for teen pregnancies Portwood was first arrested on felony domestic violence charges in November 2010 because of incidents seen on her reality TV show -- where she was shown shoving, punching, slapping and choking her boyfriend, Gary Shirley. She had avoided prison with a plea deal that included drug rehab, but she dropped out of the program last month. The report that Portwood definitely will be placed in a prison drug rehab program is not accurate, since that can only be decided once she is in the Indiana prison system, he said.
