Vermont emergency management officials got a phone call that one woman was in labor and driving to the hospital before she was waylaid by flood waters, Bosma said. Jill Remick, from the state's emergency management division, said waters in the area -- where multiple rivers converge -- could rise as high as 20 feet, above the 17.5 feet that led to substantial flooding in May. City Manager William J. Fraser told CNN Sunday evening that most of downtown, which has retail, insurance offices and boutiques, likely will be underwater by Monday. "The storm essentially shut southern Vermont down," he said. Cadran said many dismissed the prospect that a hurricane -- that hits land about 120 miles away -- could do serious damage in Vermont. In the ski resort town of Ludlow, near Okemo in south-central Vermont, town communications officer Dave Vanguilder said about three dozen roads in the area were closed.
