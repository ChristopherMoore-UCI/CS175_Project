Interest, meet Pinterest: Site helps users catalog their passions "The idea was to form a community around Pinterest in Atlanta that extends beyond just sitting behind a computer [and] into the community to see actual things that are featured on Pinterest, " Schultze said. "This party and other parties of this nature are truly an amazing effort by the Pinners themselves," a Pinterest spokeswoman said in an e-mail. As the online community swells with more and more people sharing images of dream homes, extravagant food and inspirational phrases, pinners are forging connections in real-life at fan parties such as May's "Perfect Pinterest Party" in Atlanta. Pinners are known to host get-togethers in homes or organize outings based around activities and recipes discovered via Pinterest. Besides donating T-shirts and promoting the event on social media, Pinterest had no hand in directly organizing it.
