-- Bangladesh lifted a two-year-old state of emergency on Wednesday, less than two weeks ahead of parliamentary elections. The caretaker government adopted emergency powers that allowed authorities to arrest a person without a court warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime, Human Rights Watch said. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December 29. The order was issued Tuesday by President Iajuddin Ahmed, according to Shahenur Miah, a government spokesman.
