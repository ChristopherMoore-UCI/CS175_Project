Seems the president signed a memo that laid out restrictions on the contacts between lobbyists and government officials in connection with the stimulus package -- including restrictions on telephone calls and meetings about individual project proposals. Here's the dirty little secret: Those who lobby on specific issues are often the most knowledgeable on those issues. Next, there's a revolt brewing among lobbyists (including the so-called do-gooders) who say they're being denied both government jobs as well as the constitutional right to petition just because they have "lobbied" in the past. President Obama needs to take another look at the rules on lobbyists, Gloria Borger says. And also make sure that lobbyists left on the outside don't unduly influence the new folks running the place.
