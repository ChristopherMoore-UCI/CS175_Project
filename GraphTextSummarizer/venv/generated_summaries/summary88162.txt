Al-Adnani added a warning that "the gates of hell have opened" and that the Islamic State of Iraq "will carry out more attacks in the near future by suicide bombers, car bombs and roadside bombs." " Iraqi officials expressed concern Thursday that the violence could cast a shadow over Iraq's hosting the next Arab summit on March 29. -- The Islamic State of Iraq has claimed responsibility for Thursday's attacks in that country that killed dozens of people and wounded hundreds more. "These heinous acts targeted people going to work and shopping, children going to school and security forces working to protect the citizenry," the embassy said, adding the attacks were "targeted at all the people of Iraq in a desperate effort to undermine Iraqi society and its institutions." The umbrella group, which includes al Qaeda in Iraq, issued an audio message that was posted on an al Qaeda-linked website.
