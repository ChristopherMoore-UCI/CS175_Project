The cast of "Doubt," from left: Viola Davis, Amy Adams, Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The movie is a departure for Adams, who became famous for sunnier roles in films like "Enchanted" and "Talladega Nights." But Streep, who plays the terrifyingly severe and determined school principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, said she changed her mind when she saw the final product. She plays Sister James, a nun who expresses her suspicions about Father Flynn's relationship with the student to Sister Aloysius. Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays the priest targeted by Streep's character in the film, says he "adores" her.
