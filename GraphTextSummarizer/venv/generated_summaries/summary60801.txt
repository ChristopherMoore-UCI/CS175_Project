"What we now increasingly do is we think much more in terms of sub-clusters, where you have east Africa, where you have west Africa, where you have southern Africa," he said. The growth in spending on consumer goods, telecoms and banking can turn Africa's consumers into an increasingly attractive business proposition, creating markets large enough to be appealing for multinational firms, said McKinsey. The second group is comprised of "Balanced Seniors" and "Struggling Traditionals" (middle aged, mid-income Africans with average CPG category spend), while the third one includes "Evolving Juniors," "Wannabe Bachelors" and "Female Conservatives" (this is the continent's biggest tier, consisting of consumers who spend much less than average on CPG categories -- see fact box). Instead, Nielsen says its seven types of consumers can be grouped in three tiers based on monthly income and average spending. A recent survey by Nielsen has identified seven types of consumers that companies targeting African markets need to be aware of.
