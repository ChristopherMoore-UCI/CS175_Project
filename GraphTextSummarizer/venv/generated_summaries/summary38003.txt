Each year tech junkies from around the world gather in Las Vegas for International CES, the Consumer Electronics Show where innovators come to show off their latest prototypes, preview products and announce new releases. StoreDot, an Israeli start-up, showed off its super-fast charger, which it claims works up to 100 times faster than others and can be used for phones, tablets, laptops and wearable tech. When air is pumped into the ball it softens, molding around an object, and then when air is removed, the green ball  hardens and grips objects from bricks to ping pong balls. Although the show is over 40 years old, this year's event, held from January 6 - 9, saw some of the most futuristic products ever, from driverless vehicles to a revolutionary battery which, according to its makers, could let you fully charge a cell phone in minutes. The technology hasn't been proven and is not yet available to consumers, but according to the BBC the product already has backing from Samsung and Russian businessman Roman Abramovich and StoredDot says it has begun working on a product to charge electric vehicles.
