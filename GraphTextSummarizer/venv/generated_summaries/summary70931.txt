Smith said the new measures will shift the focus onto sex buyers because they create demand for prostitution and demand for the trafficking of women for sex. But representatives of sex workers attacked the plans Wednesday, saying they will force prostitution further underground and make women more vulnerable to violence. -- Paying for sex with trafficked or exploited women would become a crime under new laws proposed by the UK government Wednesday. Jacqui Smith says she is proposing the new measures to protect vulnerable women and tackle the demand for prostitution. "I want to do everything we can to protect the thousands of vulnerable women coerced, exploited or trafficked into prostitution in our country, and to bring those who take advantage of them to justice," Smith said in a statement.
