Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq have all taken in large numbers of refugees from Syria since its 3-year-old civil war began. "We are seeing here the immense costs of not ending wars, of failing to resolve or prevent conflict," said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. "Looking at the region, one asks ourselves, how can refugees from Iraq be received in the context of all the other situations that exist around Iraq?" he said. More than 50 million people worldwide currently are refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced within their own countries, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday, in a new report released to mark World Refugee Day. The soaring number of refugees means more demand on the world's wealthier donor countries to provide aid and on those nations on the front lines to shelter and absorb the refugees.
