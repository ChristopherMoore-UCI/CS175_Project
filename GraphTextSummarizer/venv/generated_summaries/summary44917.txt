Delhi postcard: Why India longs for U.S. election Where once we would intensely study every little sign coming from Washington for clues of what might befall or grace us, now the Greek antennae are trained anxiously toward Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris. Looking back, every U.S. election of that past few decades incited expectations amongst my fellow Greeks that were, quite quickly, dashed -- although this was more a reflection of our unrealistic expectations than on anything that occurred in Washington. Whereas in the past we were divided between Left and Right, between pro- and anti-Americans, nowadays America is being seen by almost everyone here as a kindred spirit; a nation that understands what the Greeks, the Irish, the Portuguese etc. are going through in the hands of a German-dominated austerian Europe; a continent that has lost its way. Paradoxically, it may be that the crash of 2008 simultaneously robbed America of much of its global authority and endowed my fellow Greeks with a better feel of the Americans' struggle to keep democracy alive in troubled economic times. I recall my schoolmaster's enthusiasm for a certain Mr. Carter -- who would, in his estimation, put human rights on the map, impose an arms embargo on Turkey and, thus, reward the recently re-democratised Greece with the bargaining power it craved so as to reverse Cyprus' occupation, and thus liberate us Greeks from the need to spend an unseemly portion of our national income on defence.
