Both were indeed bankers in London¹s financial district, but nowadays you are likely to find them at baby fairs in Poland, Germany, and other European countries promoting their new line of baby wear called "Mon Petit Bebe." After years that saw the country's best and brightest leave Poland to get an education and work experience elsewhere, more and more Poles are returning as their economy has shown itself robust during the international crisis while countries like the UK have faced a much deeper recession. Their company offers something they say is new on the Polish market: Fully organic baby clothes, made from 100 per cent organic cotton and sewed by hand in small factories in Poland. The twins patiently explain their new products to inquisitive mothers as babies hover around the stand at the baby fair -- sometimes falling over, sometimes crying after falling to the floor. Experts have yet to put numbers on the new trend of returning to Poland, ­a process labeled "brain gain" by some, ­but former expats say they know of many people who are coming back to try their luck in their home country.
