Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was ordered to attend the Tuesday afternoon hearing in U.S. District Court in Michigan, despite the his efforts to not appear. In September, AbdulMutallab told U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds he did not want to be represented by the public defenders assigned to his case and wanted to act as his own lawyer. U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the alleged bombing attempt. "As long as (the) defendant chooses to represent himself in this matter, he must appear at court for all proceedings," Edmunds wrote in her court order. He was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route to Detroit from the Netherlands on Christmas Day 2009.
