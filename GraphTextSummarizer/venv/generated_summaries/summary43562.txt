Troyer said authorities are seeking Maurice Clemmons, 37, of Pierce County as a "person of interest." "It was not something I was pleased with at the time," Larry Jegley, who prosecuted Clemmons for aggravated robbery and other charges in Pulaski County, Arkansas, told CNN Sunday. Investigators are checking with area hospitals to determine whether the gunman sought treatment after the shooting, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. Two employees of the coffee shop and other customers inside Forza Coffee Company were unharmed, Troyer said. Investigators believe Clemmons, the person of interest, "is intentionally avoiding us," Troyer said.
