"But if the reasons given are good enough, and we choose somewhere where the standard is acceptable and it is in a good location, then they accept it." Gerard Tempest, marketing director at Premier Inn believes budget hotels offer a genuine alternative to mid-market hotels with the same convenience and quality but at better value. Sally Rademaker, travel sourcing manager, sub-Saharan Africa at Ericsson says while budget may not be an option in Africa, where they pay a premium for security at top end hotels, the communications firm is considering budget options in Europe and the United States where quality is better. Following the acquisition of a chain of mid-market hotels last year, they invested a further $10 million to meet their "budget" standards. And while top-end establishments prepare for a decline as consumer spending falls, budget hotels are determined they are recession resilient. In the U.S., budget hotels already account for 33 percent of the supply and 24 percent in France, says the report.
