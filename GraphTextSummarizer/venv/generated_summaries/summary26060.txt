"We can confirm we have submitted our entry for the 2010 Formula One world championship," confirmed Williams chief Adam Parr to Press Associations Sport. With the deadline for entries closing on Friday, Williams have been forced to act, making it clear their position in no way undermines the unified efforts of the Formula One Teams' Association in their ongoing debate with governing body FIA with regard to next year's proposed rule changes. It is very important for our employees, sponsors and fans to know we will be in Formula One for next year and many years to come. "We have done that, because we have a contract with Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management, and also with the FIA, called the Concorde Agreement. But the FIA is right in saying it is both necessary and opportune to create the opportunity for a number of new teams to come into the sport.
