-- On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, John Sutter and Stephanie Goldberg take a look at the digital rush of mass consumption that is "Cyber Monday. Our Reader Comments of the Week come from a story about Facebook and the possibility that the networking super-site will eventually offer itself as a publicly traded company on Wall Street. We also take a look at this week's announcement that Spotify, the hot-as-fire music-streaming site, is opening up its massive database of songs to outside app developers. The story looks at how such a move might impact Facebook's users. But we use this opportunity for a reality check on some comments that crop up every time we write a Facebook story.
