Prosecutors say there is no evidence of conflict of interest and Simpson's claims are "without merit." Simpson, who played in the NFL from 1969 to 1979, was acquitted in a criminal trial in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. "I am confident Mr. Simpson has not told him anything that would inculpate him because I'm confident the truth is he did not intend to commit any crime. "There are 19 issues here in our writ and all you need is one of them to be granted and Mr. Simpson gets a new trial," Fumo said. The courtroom gallery is small, occupied mainly by journalists, and the hearing lacked the big media spectacle of prior Simpson court appearances. Wearing a blue prison uniform, O.J. Simpson testified Wednesday in a Las Vegas courtroom that his former attorney advised he could use some force to reclaim personal items from sports memorabilia dealers as long as he didn't trespass.
