Paes, who has won six major doubles titles in his career, and Stepanek, a finalist alongside compatriot Jiri Novak at the 2002 U.S. Open, upset the odds to defeat second seeds Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Canada's Daniel Nestor. With the birth due on Saturday, Bob has banned the mother-to-be from watching the final against Indian doubles specialist Leander Paes and the Czech Republic's Radek Stepanek. Mirnyi and Nestor, the 2011 French Open champions, took the first set before Stepanek and Paes rallied to win 2-6 6-4 6-4. In Miami, Bob's pregnant wife Michelle had to stop watching the American top seeds' showdown with Robert Lindstedt of Sweden and Romania's Horia Tecau because the stress was bringing on contractions. "She turned it off in the third set because she was starting to feel a couple of small contractions," Bob told reporters after the nailbiting 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5) victory over the seventh seeds.
