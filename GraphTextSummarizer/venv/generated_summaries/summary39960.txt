Shortly afterward, Officer Jeffrey Bolger cut Nala's throat with a knife, even though she was contained, according to police spokesman Eric Kowalczy. Nala's owner, Sarah Gossard, said police did not give her details on how Nala died until Wednesday. The dog was Nala, whom police restrained using a pole around her neck, authorities said. -- A Baltimore police officer faces felony animal cruelty charges after he slit the throat of a dog that had escaped from home, authorities said. Gossard said Nala was not a violent dog.
