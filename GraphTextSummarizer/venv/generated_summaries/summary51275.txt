"We owe it to the public to find out what was the cause of this," Mioduszewski said Friday. -- A man suspected of abducting and sexually assaulting a Central Michigan University student posted a final goodbye a few hours later on his Facebook page shortly before an officer fatally shot him, authorities said Friday. Ramsey had abducted the student from CMU's campus about 2.5 hours northwest of Detroit on Wednesday evening, then drove her to a home where he bound and sexually assaulted her, the sheriff's department said in a news release. Thursday, Isabella County Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski told CNN in a telephone interview. As the woman was calling police, Ramsey poured gasoline on the house and set it afire before fleeing, the sheriff said.
