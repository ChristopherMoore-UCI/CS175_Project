The state prosecutors said state and local authorities were working the case and pledged cooperation with federal authorities as well. Alejandro Poire, Mexico's national security spokesman, told CNN's Rafael Romo last week that half the more than 15,000 drug-related deaths last year occured in just three of the country's 32 states -- Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas. Tamaulipas is in the central northeast of Mexico, bordering Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Northern Mexico has been plagued by a steady stream of violence fueled by the lucrative drug trade in Mexico. The top security official in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon was found shot dead and burned inside a truck in the city of Monterrey, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing state officials.
