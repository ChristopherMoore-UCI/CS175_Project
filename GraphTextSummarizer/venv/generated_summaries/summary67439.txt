UNC also said in its summary that each expert independently found similar things -- that this specific test shouldn't have been used to determine reading levels and also that, based on the same data Willingham used, a majority of those tested were, in fact, reading at a college level. Each had taken a 25-question reading vocabulary test on the Scholastic Abilities Test for Adults (SATA) -- an aptitude test used by many universities to gauge the learning level of incoming students. UNC said these three were chosen  "based on their knowledge of adult literacy, assessment and measurement in education, and multivariate analysis." When asked why Willingham wasn't mentioned in the summary, UNC spokesman Joel Curran told CNN, "This is not about her. "Outside experts found no evidence to support public claims about widespread low literacy levels," UNC said in a statement. CNN first reported this week that California Rep. Tony Cardenas is also demanding the NCAA answer questions on why UNC was never sanctioned for having paper classes.
