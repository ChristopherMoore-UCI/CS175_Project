We want the government to abandon the implementation of the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), which allows internet users to delete search results about themselves on search engines if the information is outdated or inadequate, as it will undoubtedly hinder the free flow of information. We will do whatever we can to strive for freedom on the Internet as we believe the Internet plays an important role in spreading news and information. I will continue to devote my time in Keyboard Frontline to defend internet freedom in Hong Kong. There are no more tents on the streets in Admiralty and Mong Kok and, in some ways, everything is back to normal. I skipped most of my classes last semester as I used up all my energy during the nights protesting in Mong Kok or in Admiralty and, of course, my results were poor.
