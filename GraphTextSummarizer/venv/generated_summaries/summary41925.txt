Even when they wish to resign, Chinese pilots are prohibited from quitting, say Air China pilots in the letter. Signed by dozens of Air China pilots last month, the letter criticizes unfair salary structures between Chinese and foreign pilots and complains about what the pilots call the airline's "blind expansion" policy and a "destructive usage" of pilots. In recent years, Chinese airlines seeking quick solutions to pilot shortages have recruited foreign pilots with high salaries and enticing benefits packages. In China, pilots resignations must be approved by airlines, as pilots are considered assets too expensive to lose due to expensive training paid for by airlines. The report states that Air China pilots receive the lowest salary in China among nationalized and private airlines in terms of hourly wage.
