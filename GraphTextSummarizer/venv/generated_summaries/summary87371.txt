Since the inaugural world championships in 1992, events have been held in Australia, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Italy and New Zealand. Crews from Italy and Australia do battle in the recent Blind Sailing World Championships in New Zealand. Lancaster's remarkable feat came at the recent Blind Sailing World Championships on Lake Rotorua, New Zealand. New Zealand won the overall team trophy at the event. The New Zealander, who gradually lost sight until he became completely blind in the last couple of years, is also the chairman of Blind Sailing New Zealand.
