The French-led investigation into the murders continues, Surrey Police said, adding that British officers had carried out "exhaustive" inquiries in the United Kingdom as part of the joint probe. Annecy Prosecutor Eric Maillaud told CNN the French investigators agreed with their British counterparts that there was not enough evidence to pursue the case against Zaid al-Hilli. Saad's brother Zaid al-Hilli, who lives in the county of Surrey, southwest of London, was arrested in June last year on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. UK police dropped their case Wednesday against the brother of a British-Iraqi man who was killed with his wife, mother-in-law and a French cyclist in a mysterious attack in the foothills of the French Alps. He was later released on bail, but Surrey Police said Wednesday that the 54-year-old's bail had been canceled since he could not be charged.
