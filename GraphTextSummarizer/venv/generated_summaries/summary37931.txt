A convoy of U.S. Army armored vehicles is drawing crowds, cheers and tears as it makes an 1,100-mile journey from the Baltics through Poland and the Czech Republic to Germany. It is being supported by NATO military units and U.S. Air Force planes and Army helicopter units for reconnaissance and resupply, according to an Army statement. The convoy, which began on Saturday, is expected to take 11 days to its end at Rose Barracks in Vilseck, Germany, about 40 miles from the Czech border. It is designed to show solidarity to allies in the wake of recent Russian actions in Ukraine and Crimea that have Eastern Europe on edge. We see that we are not alone, that there is someone to defend us," Zdzislaw Narel, 60, told The Associated Press as the convoy made a stop in Bialystok, Poland .
