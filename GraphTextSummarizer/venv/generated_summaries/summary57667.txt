Authorities would not say how the four ended up together, but Japanese media reported that the women were attending a Nicki Minaj concert in Tokyo when they met the men and decided to accompany them to their hotel rooms. -- Police have detained two American men as part of an investigation into the strangling death of an Irish exchange student in Tokyo, Japanese authorities said Sunday. Nicola Furlong, 21, was found dead in a hotel room with one of the men, according to Tokyo police. When the staff got to the room, they found her in the room with the 19-year-old and called the fire department, Tokyo authorities said. Rather, police arrested the men on suspicion of improperly touching Furlong's friend in a taxi early Thursday, as the four headed back to the hotel, authorities said.
