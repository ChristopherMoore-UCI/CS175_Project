Meanwhile, although spending on welfare has been cut in half since it was reformed in 1996, other federal spending on programs, such as food stamps, has soared year after year and decade after decade. The Heritage Foundation's annual Index of Dependence on Government tracks government spending and creates a weighted score adjusted for inflation of federal programs that contribute to dependency. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that 49% of the population lives in a household where at least one person gets some type of government benefit. Simply put, spending on social welfare programs has exploded. Future Congresses could impose deep cuts in social welfare programs across the board or raise massive taxes to support these exploding programs.
