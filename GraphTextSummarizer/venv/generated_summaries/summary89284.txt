A cadaver dog found part of a human hand Wednesday morning about 50 yards from where a severed head was discovered in a Hollywood Hills park on Tuesday, police said. Another hand was located later in the afternoon, and two feet were found Wednesday evening, Los Angeles Police Officer Cleon Joseph said. -- Searchers found two hands and two feet Wednesday near the famous "Hollywood" sign, the same area where police said a severed head was discovered earlier. The head, found Tuesday by two people walking dogs along a dirt trail, is that of a man between 40 and 60 years old, with salt-and-pepper-colored hair, Los Angeles County Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Wednesday. Los Angeles police homicide investigators have begun checking recent missing-person reports for leads on the identity of the man whose head was found, Winter said.
