" Fast forward to October and Serbia is facing more scrutiny after England's Football Association reported "a number of incidents of racism" to European governing body UEFA following the second-leg of an Under-21 Euro 2013 playoff match on Tuesday. The difficulty for Serbia, as shown by Pejovic's testimony, is that it has a history of racism not just at club level but also at international level, which Milosevic acknowledged, though he insisted that the problem "is no more than in other European countries". Over the last year English football has had to grapple with the fall out of racism cases involving Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and Chelsea defender John Terry, with English FA punishing both players. "I would support calls to ban Serbia from international football and their clubs from European football if such racist activity occurs. This was the first case of racism in Serbia and the racism is still present."
