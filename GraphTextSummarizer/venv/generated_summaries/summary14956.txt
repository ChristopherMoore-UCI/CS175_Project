Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who police say the couple lured with a Craigslist ad, strangled, repeatedly stabbed and dumped in a yard. Yet in the 2013 killing, police documents show Barbour told police she and her husband couldn't clean up all the blood LaFerrara's killing left in her CR-V, and that one of the ways investigators traced the killing to her was her own cell phone. Even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple, Northumberland County District Attorney Tony Rosini, said he discounts Barbour's other claims. The last number dialed on LaFerrara's phone led to Barbour, according to police. However, Alaska State Troopers said Tuesday Barbour's claims don't bear out -- at least in their state.
