Last year's Race to Dubai champion Rory McIlroy -- watched this week by his tennis playing girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki -- sits six shots behind Stenson. Stenson is one of three golfers guaranteed of capturing the Race to Dubai by claiming the title this weekend -- the others are Justin Rose and Graeme McDowell -- and he admits he is keeping an eye on his major rivals. With a win in Dubai, Stenson would become the first man to claim the Race to Dubai -- finishing as the European No. 1 -- and FedEx Cup in the United States in the same season. "I have my game plan cemented on this course and it's been working out great the first two days," Stenson, who is nursing a lingering wrist injury, told the European Tour's website Friday. If Ian Poulter emerges triumphant in Dubai, Stenson needs to finish second to clinch the Race to Dubai.
