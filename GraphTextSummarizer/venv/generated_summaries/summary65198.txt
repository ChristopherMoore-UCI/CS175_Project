"France's decision to intervene against al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Mali in 2013 was shaped by this growing concern about the ways that overseas terrorist safe havens increase the threat to France itself," Chivvis said. "We did think when bin Laden was killed and al Qaeda central was really strongly wounded that maybe we were on the down slope of this problem, but the civil war in Syria has really been a game changer, Schanzer told CNN. A hint of France's expected response to the Charlie Hebdo slaughter -- and a claim of responsibility by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for the rampage that claimed 12 lives -- came in remarks President Francois Hollande made aboard his country's nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier before it embarked to the Middle East. Merah told police he had attended an al Qaeda training camp while visiting Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to a French prosecutor. French (special operations forces) performed well in Mali, however, when it came to the element of surprise and keeping the initiative against a retreating al Qaeda foe."
