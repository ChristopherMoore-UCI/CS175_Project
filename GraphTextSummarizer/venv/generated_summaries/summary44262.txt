I wish that all cancer patients could partner with integrative oncologists to guide them through the maze of confusing options, avoid fraudulent treatments and scams and make use of all safe and effective therapies to eliminate tumors, prevent recurrences and preserve quality of life. I would urge patients and families not to reject surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy but to seek and demand integrative treatment. In the case of pancreatic cancer, they usually offer minimal extended survival, often at the expense of reduced quality of life. Every cancer patient there gets appropriate surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as sophisticated herbal therapy designed to reduce toxicity and increase efficacy of those treatments, to strengthen body defenses against cancer and enhance quality of life. No one knows how long he would have survived or what his quality of life would have been had he opted for immediate surgery and used only conventional treatment.
