Show creator Julian Fellowes made sure to pack in the first six episodes with as much plot development as there are characters -- from Mary and Matthew's wedding to the release of Mr. Bates from prison, from the birth of Sybil's first child (immediately followed by poor Sybil's shocking passing) to the financial hardships plaguing Downton. PBS' official Masterpiece site promises both the flaring up of new romances and the unfolding of a new crisis on "Downton Abbey." "Downton Abbey" is wrapping another season chock-full of upstairs, downstairs drama. Rumors have surrounded the departure of star Dan Stevens, who plays resident heartthrob Matthew Crawley. Tom finally found his place in the Crawley family as he became manager of the Downton estate.
