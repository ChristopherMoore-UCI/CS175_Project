-- A three-judge federal appeals court panel Tuesday overturned a lower court's order blocking key parts of a Texas law requiring doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion, potentially clearing the way for enforcement of the law. As written, the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure. In August, just before the law was set to take effect September 1, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin, Texas, found several portions of the law "unconstitutionally vague," and ruled it violated the First Amendment by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government-mandated speech. A previous U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Pennsylvania case "held that the fact that such truthful, accurate information may cause a woman to choose not to abort her pregnancy only reinforces its relevance to an informed decision," U.S. Circuit Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote in a concurring opinion. The center, she said, is evaluating "all available means" to challenge the Texas law "and all laws that seek to undermine women's fundamental rights."
