But in depositions for a lawsuit against the firm, Stern's employees admitted, under oath, they were signing foreclosure documents so fast that they barely had time to even see who the homeowner was. In an excerpt from a deposition of Cheryl Samons, an employee who once worked for Stern, she says she did not read foreclosure documents before signing them. "Their mill is the printer, printing off document after document after document and just having people sign them," said Ice Legal attorney Chris Immel. Florida's attorney general says Stern's foreclosure business is the largest in the state and accuses the firm of submitting false documents, even making some up, just to speed up the foreclosure process. That simple number, from foreclosure data firm RealtyTrac, doesn't tell the whole story, especially in Louzado's case.
