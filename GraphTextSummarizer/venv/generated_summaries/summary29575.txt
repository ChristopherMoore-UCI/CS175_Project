Cast member and Hawaii resident Woody Harrelson was known to escape to nearby beaches on his breaks from filming to brave the infamous North Shore swells. Real adventurers can take a series of trailheads through the dense forest of Manoa Valley and up behind Paradise Park, a former animal performance venue, where scenes from "Catching Fire" and the popular television show "Lost" were filmed. Although much of the preliminary filming of "Catching Fire" took place on the U.S. mainland, the cast and crew spent five weeks in the dense jungles and pristine beaches of the North Shore of Oahu, enjoying the sun, sand and aloha of the 50th state.
