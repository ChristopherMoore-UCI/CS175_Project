According to Balkin, good sleep hygiene includes going to bed and waking up at the same time each day (ideally without an alarm clock); using the bedroom only for sleep and sex; abstaining from nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol after 2 p.m.; and avoiding stressful tasks right before bed. "Asians tend to sleep with children in their beds and that could have an impact on sleep quality because anything that disrupts sleep like a dog or kid in the bed can negatively impact sleep and the restorative value of that sleep," Balkin says. Roughly 20 percent of whites, African Americans, and Hispanics said that financial problems were causing them to lose sleep at night, compared to just 9 percent of Asians. "Sleepiness impacts every aspect of our lives, so for those people who are not getting a good night's sleep, getting better sleep will make you sharper in the boardroom, give you a better quality of life, and [make] the sun seem a whole lot brighter." "The first step is to become aware of the problem, and then make more time for sleep and engage in practices that promote good, healthy sleep."
