Nigella Lawson: Flirtatious celebrity chef Personal spending The two sisters are accused of spending large sums on luxury goods on company credit cards they were supposed to use for household expenses. She recounted finding a packet containing white powder in the bathroom, rolled up bank notes, and credit cards and CDs with traces of white powder on them. In the e-mail, which the defense shared with the court in a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the two assistants would probably "get off" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and "allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked." Grillo said she had never seen Lawson take drugs but said she was aware that she used cocaine and cannabis. Allegations of drug use by Lawson emerged in June, around the time she and Saatchi were photographed having an argument in a restaurant. Elisabetta Grillo, who is accused alongside her sister Francesca of embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds from Lawson and her ex-husband, Charles Saatchi, insisted under cross-examination she had told the truth in her own defense.
