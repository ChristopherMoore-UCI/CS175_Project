More than a third of the world's bitcoin transactions now flow through China's largest bitcoin trading website BTC China, according to bitcoin data websites. "I believed in bitcoin as a more secure way to store the value than renminbi," Liu said, referring to China's currency. China has surpassed Japan's Mt.Gox and Europe's BitStamp, reaching 100,000 Bitcoins in daily trading volumes, or more than 400 million yuan (U.S.$65.7 million) in daily transactions. In recent years China has been pushing to internationalize the yuan, adding more value to the once tightly controlled currency on international markets. However, digital currencies are not officially recognized as legitimate in China.
