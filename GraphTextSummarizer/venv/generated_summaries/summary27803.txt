"The assault victims did not come forward until police began combing the Kensington (neighborhood) for suspects and potential victims following the November homicides," Evers said. The partially clothed body of the latest victim, Casey Mahoney, 27, was discovered December 15, according to police spokeswoman Jillian Russell. "The investigation appears to be limited to Philadelphia," said FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver. -- DNA has linked the slayings of three women, Philadelphia police said Tuesday night in announcing they are looking for a serial killer. Previously, DNA from the scene of the two earlier homicides was found to be from a single person, police spokesman Ray Evers said.
