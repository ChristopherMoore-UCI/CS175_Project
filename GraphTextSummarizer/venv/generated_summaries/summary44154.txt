Authorities believe Poplawski, wearing a bullet-proof vest, aimed more than 100 rounds at police, using an AK-47, Harper said Saturday. Kelly was a 14-year veteran of the department, Police Chief Nathan Harper has said, while the other two had worked there for two years each. -- Three police officers -- shot to death after responding to a domestic argument call -- will lie in repose at Pittsburgh's city-county building later this week, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl told reporters Monday. The two had an argument, and Margaret Poplawski told her son she was calling police to remove him from her home, according to the complaint. The complaint says Margaret Poplawski called 911 about 7 a.m. Saturday to report that her son was "giving her a hard time."
