Roach also underlined his desire to see Pacquiao and Mayweather get into the ring, even though Marquez predicted the Filipino would struggle with the American's style. -- Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach has admitted Juan Manuel Marquez deserves a fourth fight against the Filipino after the pair's latest bout ended in another disputed points decision. Roach admitted the veteran proved a far more difficult opponent for Pacquiao than he expected and has conceded the 38-year-old is entitled to a fourth showdown, meaning Pacquiao's much-touted clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr. may have to wait. "[Marquez] has given us problems three times now," Roach told reporters in Las Vegas. Pacquiao emerged victorious on Saturday night during their WBO welterweight clash in Las Vegas despite Marquez claiming he should have been crowned the winner.
