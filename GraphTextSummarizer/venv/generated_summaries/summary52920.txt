So on Christmas Eve, she called in to the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa tracking center with an urgent question: "If I lose my tooth, and the Tooth Fairy comes, could the Tooth Fairy scare away Santa Claus?" The Santa trackers at NORAD started on Christmas Eve at 6 a.m. ET, fielding questions from all over the globe and continuing a tradition that began by accident in 1955. The first lady replied, "More than 3 billion gifts he's already delivered." Abby, whose favorite Christmas song is "Silver Bells," spoke with Michelle Obama alongside her siblings, Lilli and Kyle, while Santa flew over Italy. He says the volunteer Santa trackers are mostly NORAD workers or their family members. On the other end of the phone for some lucky youngsters Monday was first lady Michelle Obama, who watched Santa's progress along with children nationwide from her vacation in Hawaii. That year, an ad placed in a local Colorado Springs newspaper encouraged kids to call a phone number to find out Santa's whereabouts on Christmas Eve, but instead of the intended number, the operations center for what is now called NORAD was printed.
