Ujjwal Nikam, the Indian public prosecutor for the 2008 Mumbai-attack trial insisted Indian prosecutors dealing with the Mumbai trial had given what he called ample evidence to Pakistani authorities against Lakhvi. In the attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including high-end hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and the Jewish cultural center Chabad House. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, was granted bail by an anti-terrorism court in Islamabad on Thursday, prompting dismay from Indian officials. The Pakistani government plans to challenge the granting of bail to the man accused of masterminding the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, a law enforcement official said Friday. "It is very disappointing that the accused of the Mumbai attacks has been granted bail," said Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister on Thursday.
