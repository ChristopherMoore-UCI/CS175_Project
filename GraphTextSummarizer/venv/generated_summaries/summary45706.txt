-- Bolivian leader Evo Morales says he's worried that U.S. authorities will plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking when he attends Wednesday's United Nations General Assembly meeting. He also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the U.S. government at the United Nations General Assembly that year. "They have always tried to harass the president, since he was a lawmaker they wanted to connect him with drug trafficking and they never could prove anything, and he has always faced the accusations," Rep. Edwin Tupa said. "The president has to understand that these types of messages are not good, because he who has not done anything wrong has nothing to be afraid of, and when the president shows these fears it makes the population worry and it harms his international image," Rep. Jaime Navarro said. But Morales' supporters said political opponents have long used such strategies to bring down his government.
