We were filming as Monday's mob sparked into action after police stopped and searched two men in front of a nervous crowd in Hackney, London. See the rest of Hackney: Systems Overload at VBS.TV As the police have been overrun, most of the nation have submitted authority to the mob, with only East London's Hasidic, Muslim and Turkish communities beating the crowd back from shops and mosques. Thirty minutes later, kids were tearing the street apart, smashing up opticians, sports shops, raiding supermarkets for ammo, attacking busses and looting a tree surgeon's van for wooden weapons. All while our Parliament, London's mayor and Britain's prime minister were away on holiday. Shops were looted, huge buildings were burned, people were pulled from their cars and homes were invaded.
