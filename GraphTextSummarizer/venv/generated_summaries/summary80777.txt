The next day, the walrus/wordbank situation got even stranger as more images and mentions started showing up on Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram and Google+. By the time Ruderer and his wife started putting their five children to bed, pictures of walruses labeled as "wordbanks" started showing up everywhere, including several Beatles-themed images. You see, Jonas, who is in kindergarten, had incorrectly identified a seal as a walrus from a word bank of several different arctic animals in a matching exercise. So, eventually, being a modern parent, Jim did what was absolutely necessary -- he posted Jonas' school assignment on the website Reddit. So, yes, they're super fat and toothy, and they probably like bands you've never heard of, but walruses are still cute.
