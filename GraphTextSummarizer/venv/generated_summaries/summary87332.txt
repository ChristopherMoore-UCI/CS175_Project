In fact, as the Hispanic population grows in the years to come, we can expect many non-Hispanics to panic and batten down the hatches. The original idea was to celebrate what Hispanics have contributed to this magnificent country, and all that they have sacrificed, dating back at least to 1863, when Corp. Joseph H. De Castro of the Union Army became the first Hispanic recipient of the Medal of Honor, for heroism at Gettysburg during the Civil War. As a result, the study found, the median net worth of white households is now 18 times that of Hispanic households. Closer look: Hispanics in the U.S. And how are lower-level Hispanic workers treated at these companies? According to a 2011 study by the Pew Research Center, the median wealth -- assets minus debts -- of Hispanic households fell by 66% from 2005 to 2009.
