The applications affected by Wednesday's announcement are for approved drugs made for the U.S. market, drugs pending approval but not yet on the market, and certain drugs manufactured in Ranbaxy's Ohm Laboratories in New Jersey, which relied on data from the Paonta Sahib plant. In its second action in six months against Ranbaxy's Paonta Sahib plant, the FDA invoked its Application Integrity Policy, which is usually invoked over concerns about the integrity of data in drug applications. -- The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that it has stopped reviewing drug applications from an India-based pharmaceutical plant, alleging that officials there falsified data and test results in applications, some of which the agency has already approved. In September, the FDA issued an import alert barring entry of generic drugs produced at the plant in northeastern India and two others owned by Ranbaxy. An investigation is under way, but the FDA said it has no evidence that drugs manufactured at the plant do not meet quality specifications.
