"Mr. Sheen was very cooperative and we are done," said Los Angeles police spokeswoman Norma Eisenman. It came to the attention of the Los Angeles police department that Sheen is the registered owner of firearms, Eisenman said, and the search was conducted to see if any firearms or ammunition were in his possession. The restraining order states Sheen cannot possess, have, buy or try to buy, receive or try to receive, or in any other way get guns, other firearms or ammunition. A source close to Sheen told CNN the actor knew authorities were coming to search his home for firearms. " The restraining order was filed March 1 after Sheen's estranged wife, Brooke Mueller, requested it, alleging that he had threatened to kill her.
