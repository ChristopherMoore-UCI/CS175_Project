Music producer and composer Quincy Jones says he wants to encourage arts education in the United States. There's a photo of Jones recording Dinah Washington; a copy of the lead sheet of "We Are the World"; a map of Jones' exhausting trip through Europe in 1960, a tour that left him almost $150,000 in debt. One look through Jones' new book, "The Complete Quincy Jones: My Journey & Passions" (Insight Editions), shows how Q -- the nickname Sinatra gave him -- found his way. -- If there's one thing Quincy Jones can't stand, it's people without a sense of history. The producer, composer, arranger and music industry eminence grise has made versatility and hard work his life's guiding principles.
