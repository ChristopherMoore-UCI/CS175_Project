Martin's death sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control, as well as Florida's controversial "stand your ground" law, which allows the use of deadly force when a person perceives a threat to safety. The picture, posted Monday on Zimmerman's defense website, was taken by a police officer, Zimmerman's attorneys wrote. His attorneys say it was taken the night unarmed teen Trayvon Martin was killed in Sanford, Florida. Martin's attorneys say he was shot and killed "in cold blood." Prosecutors have charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder for the February 26 killing. In August, a new judge was named to oversee the case, after an appeals court agreed to a request from Zimmerman's defense team.
