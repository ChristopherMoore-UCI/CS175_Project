Concerns about ongoing violence led Nigerian election officials last week to delay subsequent gubernatorial elections in two states. -- Rural villages held mass burials in northern Nigeria on Sunday, the Red Cross said, raising the possibility that six days of post-election violence have produced heavy casualties. Muslims fearing reprisal attacks in Christian areas have fled to military barracks or neighboring states, the Nigerian Red Cross said. The election of President Goodluck Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north last week. The Civil Rights Congress, based in Kaduna, has in the past been known to ally itself with pro-northern political groups.
