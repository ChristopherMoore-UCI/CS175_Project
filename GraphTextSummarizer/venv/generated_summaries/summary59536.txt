"Fantasy is still going strong, and with the success of Sarah J. Maas's 'Throne of Glass' series and the highly buzzed 'Snow Like Ashes' by Sara Raasch, I'm sure we'll see even more fantasy novels next year," said DJ DeSmyter, assistant Web editor at RT Book Reviews. The 'John Green effect' Contemporary stories with heavier topics and "illness books" are on the rise, according to Elissa Petruzzi, website editor of RT Book Reviews. The nature of trends is cyclical rather than disappearing, said Michelle Bayuk of Egmont Publishing. -- Since the first Harry Potter book came out in 1999, trends in young adult fiction have shifted from wizards to glittering vampires, followed by bloodthirsty "Hunger Games" and, now, teens coping with terminal illnesses and realistic issues. "There's also been a slight increase in novels dealing with teen sexuality, which I think -- and hope -- will carry over into 2015 and beyond," DeSmyter said.
