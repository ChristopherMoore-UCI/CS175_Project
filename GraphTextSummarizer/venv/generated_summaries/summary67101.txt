-- Sudanese billionaire and communications mogul Mo Ibrahim has issued a warning to African leaders clinging to power, saying people are no longer prepared to put up with bad governance on the continent. Ibrahim says the prize is needed as leaders in African countries can sometimes be tempted to hang on to power for monetary reasons. However, Ibrahim believes that the game is up for leaders who cling to power for 30 to 40-years. The businessman's remarks come as his foundation awards its annual prize for good governance and leadership in Africa. "I think the quality of leaders coming to Africa now are really improving a lot and what is important in Africa is the rise in civil society," he said.
