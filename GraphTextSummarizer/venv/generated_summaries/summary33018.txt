-- To bolster its digital currency, Facebook is deepening ties with digital purchasing provider PayPal, the two companies said at an event Tuesday. Although PayPal had a partnership in place with Facebook in February, PayPal President Scott Thompson said these new features are a step toward expansions between the two companies. "More people play games on Facebook than on the top three consoles combined." These features will roll out in the next several months, said Osama Bedier, PayPal's vice president of product development. Facebook will add the ability to buy virtual items individually, rather than in increments of $15, thanks to PayPal's new digital goods platform, which was unveiled at the conference. "PayPal is already one of the main ways to buy Facebook Credits," Sandberg said.
