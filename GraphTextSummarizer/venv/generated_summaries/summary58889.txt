The type of shark hadn't been identified as of Tuesday afternoon, and that base beach was closed until further notice, authorities said. -- A surfer died Tuesday after a shark bit him off the coast of a Southern California air force base, authorities said. Authorities say the surf board showed bite marks, the military base said. Solorio, who was from Orcutt, just two miles from Vandenberg, wasn't affiliated with the military base, said a Vandenberg spokeswoman. Surf Beach is one of three that sit on the coastal military base and is the only one open to the public, a military spokesman said Tuesday.
