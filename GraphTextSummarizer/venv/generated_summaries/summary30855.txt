France, who also beat England in Capello's second match in charge, have now won four successive matches under coach Blanc -- who suffered two defeats after taking over from Raymond Domenech following Les Bleus' first-round World Cup exit. Midfielder Martins volleyed the opening goal right on halftime after Cristiano Ronaldo's shot was only blocked by Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Norway won 2-1 away to the Republic of Ireland, World Cup dark horses Slovakia lost 3-2 at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, while Serbia won 1-0 in Bulgaria with an 80th-minute goal from striker Nikolai Zigic -- who was later sent off. The striker put Romania ahead in the 34th minute after the Italian defense failed to clear, but headed past his own goalkeeper with seven minutes to play after Italy substitute Fabio Quagliarella touched on a corner by halftime replacement Andrea Pirlo. Benzema fired the opening goal in the 16th minute with a low shot past goalkeeper Ben Foster at the near post following a smart interchange of passes with Florent Malouda.
