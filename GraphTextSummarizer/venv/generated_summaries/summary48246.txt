The operation to capture Barrera began when Colombian authorities shared intelligence with Venezuela about his whereabouts on August 6, El Aissami said. " Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said Barrera played a significant role in international drug trafficking and described him as one of Colombia's most-wanted drug traffickers, noting in a statement that the Colombian government had offered a $2.5 million reward for information leading to his capture. -- It took 14 teams and 45 days of daily intelligence operations to nab one of Colombia's last great crime bosses in Venezuela, an official in that country said. This week's arrest is evidence that Venezuela is tough on drug trafficking, El Aissami said. The monitoring operation stretched for weeks, as Barrera rarely made phone calls himself, preferring to have third parties use the public phones to call Colombia to run the business, El Aissami said.
