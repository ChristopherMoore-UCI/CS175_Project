-- Real Madrid returned to the top of the table in Spain after edging past Racing Santander 1-0 on Saturday, while previous leaders Barcelona could only draw 1-1 at Athletic Bilbao. Henry was finally brought on by coach Pep Guardiola in the 84th minute, but Barcelona could not penetrate the stubborn Bilbao defense, with the home side left in seventh place after a hard-earned point. Real, still missing the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and with veteran talisman Raul starting on the bench, dominated struggling Santander but had only a solitary first-half strike from Gonzalo Higuain to show for it. The result lifted some of the pressure piling up on Real coach Manuel Pellegrini, who has a big week ahead with Wednesday's Champions league clash against FC Zurich and then the "El Clasico" battle with Barcelona on Sunday. Real, whose last home outing ended in an embarrassing exit from the Copa Del Rey against lower-league opposition, saw midfielder Xabi Alonso hit the post in the 13th minute and then defender Alvaro Arbeloa also hit the woodwork with a floated cross. Argentina forward Higuain, who started in place of Raul, kept up his good goalscoring form in the 22nd minute when he pounced from close range after Kaka's right-wing cross was not cleared.
