Chisora threatens to shoot Haye "Chisora's not a nice guy, the fact he bites people in the ring, spits water in peoples' faces, slaps people at weigh-ins, kisses people at weigh-ins. In 50 years' time when people look back at my career they won't see this fight and think Dereck Chisora was a great fight and look what David did to him. -- Money talks -- that's hardly a revelation, but the overriding feeling towards Saturday's David Haye versus Dereck Chisora "circus fight" in London is shock and outrage that it could even take place. "Amateur female boxing is more about technique and skill and evading the heavy blows than it is about smashing people up," says Tanya Aldred in British newspaper The Independent. Chisora was banned by the World Boxing Council and the British Boxing Board of Control following his bust-up with Haye in Munich in February, while his former world champion opponent escaped punishment only because he had already retired.
