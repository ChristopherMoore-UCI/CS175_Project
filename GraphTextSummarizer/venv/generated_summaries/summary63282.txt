That's what President Obama says the American people want, admitting Sunday that the country is ready to shift gears and hit the gas with a new leader. Discussing potential 2016 contenders, Obama had kind words about a former competitor and colleague, who has racked up a number of political accomplishments on her own 2016 odometer. "I think the American people, you know, they're going to want that new car smell," Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's "This Week." "She hasn't announced so I don't want to jump the gun," Obama said about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom he said he speaks with regularly. But even if he considers his mileage to be 2016 baggage, Obama says he wants to help his party in any way he can to win the next presidential election.
