Photos: Miley Cyrus wild child Cyrus was in on the joke from the start, as the camera cut to her being warned not to take the stage by "old Miley," as played by "SNL's" Miley impressionist, Vanessa Bayer. Cyrus hit back with a tweeted dig at O'Connor's past mental health issues, as well as the infamous moment in 1992 when the "Nothing Compares 2 U" singer ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II on "SNL." And thus began an extremely Miley-heavy episode of "SNL," as she appeared in most of the night's sketches and gave two pared-down performances of her hits, "We Can't Stop" and "Wrecking Ball." While she's made headlines for both the music videos for those songs and her attire while performing them live, on "SNL" Cyrus turned in two tasteful sets that were focused less on her dance moves and more on her voice. It all began when O'Connor wrote an open letter to Cyrus last week about her nudity and suggestiveness in the "Wrecking Ball" music video.
