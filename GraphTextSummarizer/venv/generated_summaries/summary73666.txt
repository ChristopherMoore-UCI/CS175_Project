The four daughters and three sons listed in the lawsuit allegedly are trying to exploit a provision in the 1976 federal copyright act that allows copyright holders a one-time opportunity to renegotiate older copyrights, the suit said. "The foundation depends upon the income received from the said intellectual property and contract rights to continue the wishes of Ray Charles," the suit said. The Ray Charles Foundation accuses the adult children of sending copyright termination notices to music publishers claiming they owned the songs, which the foundation contends it owns. Some of the songs were also written as "work for hire," which are not subject to copyright renegotiations, it said. Charles created a $500,000 trust for each of his 12 children two years before his 2004 death in exchange for agreements from them that they "relinquished and waived any further claims to their father's estate," the lawsuit said.
