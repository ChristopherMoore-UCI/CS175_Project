Although it is true that the DREAM act will initially help only a few hundred-thousand, pro-Latino reformers should not forget the lesson of minority rights since the 1940s: Rights expand over time, covering more groups and more issues. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, introduced the "DREAM" act in 2009 to offer legal status to these young people who were brought here as children and finished college or two years of military service. But there's hope: A few in the movement have begun to see that getting meaningful action will require small steps and "mini-bargains. Legalization forces can get DREAM, but they must also support increased border enforcement. That's when Congress passed, and President Reagan signed into law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which married border control and the legalization of millions of illegal immigrants.
