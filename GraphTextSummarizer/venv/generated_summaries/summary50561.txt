Per the complaint, Coffman revealed that she had experience connecting potential recruits with ISIS facilitators. After establishing a relationship, the undercover agent told Coffman about an associate who shared their views on Islam and was prepared to join the fight with ISIS in Syria. On October 19, the undercover agent told Coffman about plans to travel overseas, search for routes into Syria, and find an ISIS contact, to which Coffman replied, suggesting she could help find a contact and facilitate travel. Coffman had multiple other Facebook accounts with a variety of user names, including Heather Coffman, Heather La'ahad, Heather Obeida La'ahad, Heather Ametova, and Ubeida Ametova, and which authorities say displayed varying degrees of radicalization. After seven months of investigation and undercover work, federal officials have arrested a Virginia woman and accused her of lying to federal agents about involvement with the terrorist group ISIS.
