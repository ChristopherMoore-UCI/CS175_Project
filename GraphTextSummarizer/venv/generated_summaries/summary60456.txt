It's fair to say that many Olympic locations in the Krasnaya Polyana region, such as the athletes' village, the Gorki media center and the resort of Rosa Khutor, more closely resemble new towns than alpine sporting facilities. The coastal cluster -- actually situated in the town of Adler, a few miles south of Sochi -- now boasts world-class, design-led arenas, a spectacular media center, new hotels as well as new train links and stations. A ski jump whose start point seems to scratch the sky such is the way that it's perched on, and protrudes from, the mountainside; cable cars that criss-cross spectators across the epic crevasses below; huge seating galleries and bleachers, erected on the angled ground with a complex mesh of scaffolding and ingenuity; slopes and slideways of the Alpine Center and Sanki Center (race locations for the downhill skiing-type events and bobsleigh-type events respectively) that carve smooth pathways down the otherwise unpredictable surfaces; they are fantastic stages for sporting competition. Accommodation First impressions of the accommodation has broadly not been good, an assessment which, in large part, has been formed by the unpreparedness of hotels set aside for media. -- In the months leading up to the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics the story of Sochi, the stage for one of the world's biggest sporting extravaganzas, has evolved into a distinctly negative narrative: security threats, gay-rights protests and corruption allegations.
