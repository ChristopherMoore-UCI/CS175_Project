" Hitto has Kurdish heritage, one of the ethnic minorities in diverse Syria. "Mr. Hitto was a pioneer to raise funds to send direly needed humanitarian aid to Syrians, as well as raise awareness of the events happening in Syria," the Shaam Relief Foundation said in a statement. " "There is a sense that Hitto's appointment has allowed the Muslim Brotherhood, assisted by key regional actors, to walk in through the front door and assume control of Syria's opposition movement." Oday Shahin, a Muslim community leader in Dallas, said he thinks Hitto will seize the day during a "historic moment" for war-torn Syria. At a protest last year in Texas, Walk for the Child of Syria, Hitto's passion against the al-Assad government was on bold display.
