North Korea said in a separate statement that Martinez entered the country in November, two days after American diplomat James Clapper arrived. Martinez said he first tried to cross over from South Korea's Han River and tried again from China's Yalu River in Dandong. Images released by North Korea showed him wearing a suit and sitting in a room facing a large group of people. He also talked about unidentified flying objects, CIA involvement in the cocaine trade, "ultrasonic" devices that cause people to hear voices and experience bodily discomfort and how the Western news media unfairly portrayed North Korea. An American who said he crossed illegally into North Korea denounced the United States political and economic system Sunday morning at a press conference in that country.
