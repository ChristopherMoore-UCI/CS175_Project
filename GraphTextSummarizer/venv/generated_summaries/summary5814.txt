Surveillance video shows other students in the gym with Johnson before he died, but according to local investigators' reports, there's no record of interviews with any of them, although they spoke to more than 90 students. Investigators then spoke to five more people in February and March before conducting interviews with 72 people in April, about the time media coverage of Johnson's death gained momentum. U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia Michael Moore said in November that federal authorities would investigate Johnson's death, and last month, the FBI seized the original hard drives from the surveillance system at Lowndes High School, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation surrounding the hard drives. CNN has learned that the FBI has been in South Georgia conducting interviews, and the Johnsons recently spent almost three hours with investigators at an FBI field office in Thomasville, an hour west of their hometown. The first responders weren't interviewed until April 17, according to the file, and the paramedic who noticed bruising on Johnson's jaw -- and considered the gym to be a crime scene -- wasn't interviewed until April 18.
