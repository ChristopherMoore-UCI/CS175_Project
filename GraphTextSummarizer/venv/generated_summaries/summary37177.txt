-- Kentucky Derby winner I'll Have Another surged to a surprise win Saturday at the 137th running of the Preakness Stakes, keeping its hopes for the coveted Triple Crown alive. The 3-year-old colt, with odds at 15-1 going into the Kentucky Derby, stunned the racing world by dashing past favorite Bodemeister to win. The Preakness, the second of three races that make up the storied U.S. Triple Crown, is run at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. Like at the Preakness, Bodemeister led for most of that race before being overtaken at the wire by I'll Have Another. I'll Have Another went into the race with 3-1 odds, behind Bodemeister, the favorite with odds at 2-1.
