"Recent prosecutions have highlighted illegal exports of stealth missile technology, military aircraft components, naval warship data, night vision equipment, and other restricted technology destined for China or Iran. The department said the United States will tighten monitoring of export licenses and increase export restrictions on technologies that could have both civilian and military applications and could pose a danger to U.S. national security in the hands of terrorists or potential enemies. The illegal export of U.S. military technology to Iran and China poses a growing threat, the Justice Department said Thursday as it announced plans to combat the practice. " Representatives of more than a half dozen federal agencies will jointly announce their plans at a Justice Department news conference Thursday. "China and Iran pose particular U.S. export control concerns," the Justice Department said in a statement issued Thursday.
