The win moves Real to within three points of Barcelona who travel to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. -- Gareth Bale netted his first hat-trick for Real Madrid in a 4-0 win against Real Valladolid at the Bernabeu on Saturday. Bale popped up to score Real's first in the 33rd minute, nodding the ball home after goalkeeper Diego Marino had palmed the ball into the Welshman's path. An 88th minute own goal by Espanyol striker Christian Stuani gave Real Sociedad a 2-1 win and moves Jagoba Arrasate's side back into sixth spot. "I think that his adaption period has finished as I said yesterday," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said.
