He picked up 25 boundaries and seven sixes, surviving a dropped catch by West Indies captain Darren Sammy while on 170. The West Indies, who were looking to level the series at 2-2, were always behind the run chase as debutant leg-spinner Rahul Sharma picked up three wickets in his first three overs for the home side. He was finally caught in the deep off Kieron Pollard after putting on 176 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir (67) and 140 for the second with Suresh Raina (55). Sehwag broke the previous best of 200 not out by his legendary compatriot Sachin Tendulkar as he took advantage of a perfect batting wicket at the Holkar Stadium in Indore. Sehwag is skippering India in the series in the absence of the rested Mahendra Singh Dhoni and had scored just 46 runs in the previous three matches.
