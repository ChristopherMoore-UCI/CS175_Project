Protests come to the police station Eight people were arrested outside the police department on Sunday night when demonstrations grew violent again, police say. Protests erupted last month after Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson's fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. For several hours, police officers stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the police department with protesters a short distance away, some milling about and others chanting. Ahead of a town hall meeting Tuesday night, Ferguson's mayor said the aftermath of the shooting death of Michael Brown helped open the eyes of city officials to the town's racial divide. Although previous protests at the police station have been largely peaceful, some demonstrators among a crowd of about 150 people began throwing rocks and bottles at officers about 10 p.m., according to CNN affiliate KTVI.
