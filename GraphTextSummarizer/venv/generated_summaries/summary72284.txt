The intended targets of Jose Pimentel, 27, were U.S. military personnel who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as U.S. postal facilities and police in New York and Bayonne, New Jersey, according to Bloomberg and New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. "His stated desire to attack our servicemen and women ... could have come from an al Qaeda playbook." Vance said that his office and other New York authorities had long been "in communication with federal authorities." That said, Pimentel was arrested by state law enforcement agents and will be tried in New York courts. The issue that came out just before al-Awlaki's death, for instance, emphasized that al Qaeda supporters in the West should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves. The commissioner said that Pimentel even talked about changing his name to Osama Hussein -- in honor of his now deceased "heroes," long-time al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
