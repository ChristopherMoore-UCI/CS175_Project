"The second complainant argued that the comparison between dog owners and starving children is unfounded and irrelevant. Suggesting that white people are happy to feed their dogs expensive food, but not to help starving black children is offensive. The commercial then switches to a text message reading: "The average domestic dog eats better than millions of children," before asking for donations to Feed a Child. It is not the responsibility of dog owners to feed other people's children. It suggests that white people treat and feed black kids like dogs, which is exceptionally degrading and dehumanizing," it said.
