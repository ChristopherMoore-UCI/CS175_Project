Dignity in Dying, a British charity that advocates the choice of assisted death for terminally ill patients, said it was "extremely sad" that the Duffs had to travel abroad to die. "Had they had the option of an assisted death in this country they may still be alive, as their physical ability to travel would not have been a factor," said Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying. Peter and Penelope Duff from Bath, England, died in Zurich on February 27, according to a statement released Thursday by their family and reported by Britain's Press Association. A hospice with cancer -- there is not uncontrollable pain," Bowman told CNN. Phyllis Bowman, executive director of Right to Life, which opposes euthanasia, also said the Duffs' case was sad.
