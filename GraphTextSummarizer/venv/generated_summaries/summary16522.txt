The FDA regulates caffeine in sodas at a level of .02%, or 200 parts per million (there is no current FDA caffeine limit for energy drinks). Facing renewed controversy about the safety of energy drinks, Monster Energy Corp. has decided to market its products as beverages instead of dietary supplements. The scientists have concluded there is not enough evidence to show that high levels of caffeine in energy drinks are safe. The scientists say caffeine in energy drinks differs from that in coffee because the caffeine in coffee occurs naturally, instead of being added by a manufacturer. This week, 18 public health experts sent a letter to the FDA about the safety of energy drinks.
