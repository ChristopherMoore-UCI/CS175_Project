Black conservatives say high profile GOP candidates like Cain and Michael Steele, who once headed the Republican National Committee, have helped their visibility and recruitment efforts. "There were probably many black conservatives who weren't sure if the tea party movement were accepting of them, but Cain proved that they were," says Richard Ivory, Publisher of the HipHopRepublican.com, which caters to urban republican and libertarian voters of color. But all agree, there is no collective voice among black conservatives, and Cain certainly didn't enjoy all of their support. "Just because my parents vote Democrat party, why am I really voting for them?" said Wright, whose mission is to encourage more black voters to examine candidates rather than vote emotionally. -- As the now-former presidential hopeful Herman Cain moves to Plan B, black conservatives say it's time to stick with their Plan A, and use the leverage that the GOP candidate gave them.
