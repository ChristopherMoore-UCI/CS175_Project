All day Saturday, messages and reports were sent directly to Coffee Party organizers and left on the Facebook fan page from across the country, "The event exceeded my expectations ... We can find immediate institutional solutions -- for example, changing Senate rules and procedures that impede government, countering misinformation and promoting campaign finance reform and term limits. People from all walks of life and all political dispositions sat together as fellow Americans to discuss their concerns about our politics: accountability, corporate influence, health care reform, education reform, the economy, immigration reform, filibusters, etc. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a president and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country." Would anyone respond to my call for civility in our political discourse and cooperation in government?
