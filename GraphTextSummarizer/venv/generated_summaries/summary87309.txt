Mario, 24, was charged with second degree assault after police were called to a Baltimore, Maryland high-rise apartment complex with a report of "a mental case breaking up property inside" an apartment early Friday. "Anyone who has waged the battle to save loved ones from the forces of drugs knows the irrational behavior that almost always accompanies their actions," said Hassan Murphy, Mario's Baltimore attorney, on Saturday. -- The arrest of R&B singer Mario for allegedly assaulting his mother was "an unfortunate incident between a loving son and a mother who continues to struggle with a devastating addiction," his lawyer said Saturday. " A Baltimore police spokeswoman was unable to confirm if Mario had posted bail. After his mother told police she feared for her life, they arrested Mario and booked him on a second degree assault charge, police said.
