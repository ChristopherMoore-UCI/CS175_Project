-- New Hampshire Republican political pros are not expecting a big surprise when the state's voters cast their ballots in Tuesday's GOP presidential primary, seeing an easy victory for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. A CNN survey of 52 New Hampshire GOP insiders found that only one thought Romney would lose the primary, and that was to former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Another said, "I believe like so many (that) it's Romney's to lose." Since finishing second in the GOP presidential primary here four years ago to Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Romney has continued to court New Hampshire Republican activists and maintained a home on Lake Winnipesaukee, about an hour north of Manchester. "Other than Romney right now, feels like the junior varsity on the field," said one New Hampshire GOP insider. Perception that he can't win in the general election -- 50% His stance on foreign policy -- 48% Paul is too extreme for New Hampshire (volunteered) -- 2% "He has a ceiling to grow entirely because of his foreign policy views," one New Hampshire GOP insider said.
