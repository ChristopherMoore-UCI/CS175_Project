"This is another significant discovery in the last few years (that) have repeatedly confirmed that the Abusir necropolis provides a number of unique sources for the reconstruction of major epochs of ancient Egyptian history," Barta said. The discovery was made in an Old Kingdom necropolis southwest of Cairo in Abusir, home to the pyramid of Pharaoh Neferefre, who ruled 4,500 years ago. The team's leader, Miroslav Barta, said in a statement that their newest find is just more proof of how ripe the Abusir site is for further research. "This discovery will help us shed light on certain unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, witnessed the construction of the first pyramids," el-Damaty told the AFP. In a statement to the Agence France-Presse, Egypt's Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty called the queen Khentakawess III, noting that this is the "first time we have discovered the name of this queen who had been unknown before the discovery of her tomb."
