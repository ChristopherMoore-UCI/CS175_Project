In an earlier interview at Spaulding, Fucarile told CNN that in the frantic minutes after the attack, Boston police took him to a hospital in a detainee van because no ambulance was immediately available. He was discharged Wednesday morning from Boston's Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. He underwent multiple surgeries, staying 45 days at Massachusetts General Hospital before transferring to Spaulding -- a post-operation and rehabilitation facility -- for 55 days. Fucarile is the last Boston Marathon bombing victim to be released from a hospital. -- It's been a long 100 days for Marc Fucarile, but he finally got to go home Wednesday.
