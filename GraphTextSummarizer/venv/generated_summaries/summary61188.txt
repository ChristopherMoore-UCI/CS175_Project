"La Linea thought she was discriminating against newspaper vendors they were extorting," municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. In a statement Tuesday, federal police said they believed the female newspaper vendor was targeted by an area gang because she was seen as a threat to the gang's control of street vendors. At least 14 people were killed in 48 hours in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, including the Tuesday deaths of a municipal police officer and a newspaper vendor who police believe was targeted because of her job. Also Tuesday, municipal police officer Ciro Puga Cruz, 39, was killed after armed gunmen shot him 15 times at a crowded intersection while his car stopped at a red light. The killing happened in front of dozens of people and caused panic, said journalist Arturo Chacon who was at the scene.
