"Republicans right now think that all we have to do is talk about how bad the Obama economy is and how bad Obamacare is and we're going to win in 2014," Idaho GOP Rep. Raul Labrador told reporters at a forum of House conservatives on Capitol Hill this week. -- House conservatives are putting House Speaker John Boehner on notice: The 2014 agenda needs to be about more than railing on the President and the failures of Obamacare. Perhaps in response to growing calls from his own members, the speaker committed that House Republicans would come forward this year with their own proposal to replace Obamacare. Election year makes Washington even more confusing A big test for Boehner's ability to assuage conservatives comes soon: House Republicans need to decide how they will approach the debate over the debt limit. House Republican leaders are again expected to push similar versions of the jobs bill they pushed in 2013 to keep the focus on the economy, along with some more bills tweaking Obamacare, according to GOP aides.
