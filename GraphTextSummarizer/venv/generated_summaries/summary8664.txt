Beijing-based MAD Architects and Chicago firm Studio Gang have released artist renderings of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art that wouldn't look out of place in its namesake's "Star Wars" franchise. The permanent collection will feature works from Lucas' personal collection, which is estimated to be worth $600 million and includes Norman Rockwell paintings, Alberto Vargas pin-ups and, yes, original props from "Star Wars." It joins a series of other Chicago institutions in the area, including the Alder Planetarium and Field Museum of Natural History. Studio Gang have designed the 17 acre plot's landscape, and will design a bridge connecting the plot to nearby Northerly Island. Inspired by the works of Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (both of whom designed buildings in Chicago), it's meant to evoke a disc floating above the surrounding harbor.
