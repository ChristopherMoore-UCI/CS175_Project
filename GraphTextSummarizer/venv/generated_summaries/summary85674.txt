-- Antonio Patriota, Brazil's foreign minister, stepped down Monday night amid a diplomatic row with neighboring Bolivia. The resignation comes a day after a Brazilian diplomat helped an opposition senator from Bolivia flee into Brazil. President Dilma Rousseff's office issued a brief statement, saying Patriota had submitted his resignation and would be replaced by Brazil's representative at the United Nations, Luiz Alberto Figueiredo. Pinto said he was targeted by Bolivian officials after accusing members of Bolivian President Evo Morales' government of drug trafficking and corruption. According to the press statement, Patriota will be appointed to head up Brazil's mission at the United Nations.
