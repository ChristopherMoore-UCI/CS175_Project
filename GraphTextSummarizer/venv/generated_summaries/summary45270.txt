-- France established Tuesday its first strategic foothold in the Gulf, when President Nicolas Sarkozy opened a French military base in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. The other agreement signed Tuesday by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and his Emirati counterpart "outlines a cooperation framework for the assessment and possible use of nuclear energy for peaceful ends," WAM said. Djibouti remains the base for French warships on anti-piracy patrols. "Today France manage to break the United States' long monopoly to the Gulf region, which is important for the whole world," Mustafa Al'alani, from the Dubai based, Gulf Research Center. The U.S. maintains the predominant foreign military presence in the Gulf, with key air bases and logistics operations, and its Fifth Fleet headquartered in Bahrain.
