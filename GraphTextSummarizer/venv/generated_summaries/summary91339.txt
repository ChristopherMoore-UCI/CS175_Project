Ivo Daalder told reporters late Sunday there is "no planning going on that's related to a NATO role in Syria." "As it relates to NATO planning, a NATO ally has to come forward and request that type of planning. On the same day Daalder spoke, at least 60 people were killed in Syria's 14-month crisis, opposition activists said. You've got security forces intermingled with the population, and that introduction of greater military intervention from outside or arms to groups within Syria could further militarize the conflict in a counterproductive way." "We've also decided, however, that a military intervention of the nature that we did in Libya would further militarize the situation in ways that wouldn't necessarily protect civilian life," Daalder said. "We'd obviously take any requests of that nature seriously if it were to be made." Daalder also said that NATO, along with European allies and Arab partners, has provided assistance to the Syrian opposition, including political and diplomatic support.
