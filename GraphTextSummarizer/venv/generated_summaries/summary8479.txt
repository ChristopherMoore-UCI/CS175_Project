The Department of Education, meanwhile, said it would consider its options and continue to work with Virginia Tech and other schools to improve safety. -- A judge has sided with Virginia Tech and overturned a $55,000 fine, ruling that the school did not violate a law requiring it to notify students in a "timely manner" about threats during a 2007 campus rampage. At question was whether the school gave appropriate warning to students after the dormitory shooting. The shooting, which left 33 people including the gunman dead, started at West Ambler Johnston dormitory with the death of two students. At the end of the day, we all agree that the most important thing we can do as a country is to put safeguards and protections in place that will help prevent a tragedy like this from occurring again," spokesman Justin Hamilton said.
