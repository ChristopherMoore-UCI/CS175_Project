" Billy and another boy, 15-year-old "John," told Pinsky that the alleged incidents occurred at the end of last school year at La Puente High School. "This is deeply disturbing to me and the entire community," said Barbara Nakaoka, superintendent of Hacienda La Puente Unified School District. Brian Claypool, the attorney for the alleged victims, said Monday he has not reviewed any medical records or other potential physical evidence, but insists their stories are credible and consistent. They displayed signs and banners, calling for school officials to be held accountable if the allegations prove true. But still the effects linger, and he says he does not want to return to school.
