The choice of skiing looked to be validated by her first World Cup podium in early 2007, but Gisin's injury problems continued and after a fall in downhill training she was sidelined yet again through a knee problem. Even as an up and coming star on the junior circuit, Gisin was plagued by persistent knee injuries and fearing for her future in the sport, turned to her second passion, flying, to make a living. Without a win at the highest level since winning her third World Cup race in 2010, Gisin had gone into the Games with slender hopes of victory. Fate then played its part and, ironically as a result of her skiing injuries, the officers in charge of the flying program decided Gisin's fragile knees would not stand the rigors of full-time military service. Gisin still finds time to keep her license as a pilot -- getting about 25 hours of flying in her log during the off season.
