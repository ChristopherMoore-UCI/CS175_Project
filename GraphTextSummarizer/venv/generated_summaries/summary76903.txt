Spain is to be offered an initial 30 billion euros (US$36.9 billion) to bail out its troubled banks following an emergency meeting of Eurozone finance ministers. In June, European finance ministers agreed to set aside $150 billion to shore up the capital base of Spain's banks. The ministers from the 17-nation bloc met 10 days after their heads of government agreed to use its temporary bailout funds to recapitalize Spain's ailing financial system and to set up a joint supervisory body for the area's lenders. Under the terms of the deal, this supervisory body will oversee the eurozone's banks and use the single currency area's rescue funds, the European Financial Stability Facility or European Stability Mechanism, to aid banks directly without adding to governments' debt. Spain given extra time to cut deficit "We are aiming at reaching a formal agreement in the second half of July, taking into account national parliamentary procedure, allowing for a first disbursement of 30 billion euros by the end of the month to be mobilized as a contingency in case of urgent needs in the Spanish banking system," Juncker said in a statement to reporters after the meeting.
