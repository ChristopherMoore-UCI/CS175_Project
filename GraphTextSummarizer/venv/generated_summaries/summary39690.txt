Editor's note: Beauty and makeup expert Bobbi Brown saves the day with tricks to age-proof your smile, grow out bangs, and make blush stay put. Aside from wearing a hat or headband, I've found that it helps to style bangs all piece-y (using a tiny dab of styling cream). And a clear gloss or balm adds a nice sheen to lips (or eyes!), nourishes cuticles, and tames flyaways. Be patientâ€”it could take at least four to six weeks for bangs to (noticeably) grow out. I go to the dentist every six months, brush with my fave Tom's toothpaste, and rinse after drinking anything colorful, like coffee or red wine.
