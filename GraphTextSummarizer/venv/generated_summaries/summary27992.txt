-- Rhode Island moved toward becoming the 10th state in the nation and the last in New England to approve same-sex marriage after its state Senate voted Wednesday to approve a bill extending marriage rights. Though the House version of the bill passed by a vote of 51 to 19 in January, the Senate amended it, "so it needs to go back to the House, where it has solid support," Senate press secretary Greg Pare said. Their combined populations, based on U.S. Census estimates for 2012, represent 15.8% of the U.S. population. The Senate Republican Caucus on Tuesday expressed unanimous support for the bill. During a debate Tuesday over reversing Nevada's law banning same-sex marriage, state Sen. Kelvin Atkinson revealed that the issue is a personal one for him.
