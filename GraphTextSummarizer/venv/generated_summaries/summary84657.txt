Russia has been stirring trouble in Ukraine -- inside Europe -- for many months. Below the headline the paper printed a photo of scowling, heavily armed pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine, men who many believe fired the missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, with support from Vladimir Putin's Russia. Now that the names and faces of the victims are being made public, disbelief is giving way to outrage -- mostly targeted at Russian President Vladimir Putin -- along with frustration that the Dutch government is moving too cautiously because of economic concerns. But Putin's bullying tactics have successfully instilled fear of retaliation, particularly in parts of Europe that use Russian gas to stay warm in the winter. The Netherlands is not yet ready to indict the Russian president or the militias he supports, the separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.
