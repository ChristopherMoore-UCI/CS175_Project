For TV viewers in the '70s and '80s, the performer was most familiar as the dapper pitchman in 7Up ads, telling viewers to sample the "Un-Cola" in his rich voice. Holder, who stood an imposing 6-foot-6 and had a deep, mellifluous, Caribbean-lilted voice, was a multitalented performer who easily shifted between painting, theater, film and TV. He followed that up with principal dancer work with New York's Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1955 and 1956, and went on to star in an all-black production of "Waiting for Godot" in 1957. Some of his more memorable work appears in 1967's "Doctor Dolittle," 1982's "Annie" and 1973's "Live and Let Die," in which he faced off against Roger Moore's James Bond as the villain Baron Samedi. In later decades he worked with Eddie Murphy in 1992's "Boomerang," and more recently did voice work in 2005's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."
