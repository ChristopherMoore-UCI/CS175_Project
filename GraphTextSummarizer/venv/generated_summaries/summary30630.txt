The carrier first attempted a comeback in 2010, but was thwarted by a $1.2 billion lawsuit by Kuwait, which claimed Iraq owed it for aircraft destroyed during the first Gulf War. The airport, which will have a capacity of 60 million passengers annually after the completion of the first stage (projected 2017), will be situated near the holy city of Karbala, a place of pilgrimage for the region's Shiite Muslims. Earlier this year Iraq's national carrier started expanding its route network for the first time in 23 years. "Given Iraq's location, it will put them in a position where they'll be able to reach most places in the world on a non-stop basis." There are four million Iraqis living outside of Iraq, so that's a big market," says Saad Al Khafaji, a spokesman for the airline.
