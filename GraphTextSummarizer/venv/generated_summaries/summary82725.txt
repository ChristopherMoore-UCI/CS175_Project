The division of Libya into east and west is not a viable option and is not in the long-term interests of Libyans or wider regional security. -- While the Zintan militia leads the battle for control of Tripoli's airport, another set of militia and radicalized Islamist insurgents in the east are threatening a fragile Libya. Meanwhile, the government is continuing to fail to live up to its promises and has not provided security or jobs to ordinary citizens. The struggle to tackle armed groups in Libya continues, and it simply cannot be left to one renegade general to remove Islamic insurgents and keep armed militia groups in check. As a retired General, many Libyans are unsure of the longer-term motives and personal ambitions of a man who once attempted to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi.
