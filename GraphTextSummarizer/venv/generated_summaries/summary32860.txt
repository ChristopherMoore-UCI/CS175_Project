Customers have access to specialized content -- not available to anyone other than Starbucks customers -- from Men's Health, Women's Health, Runner's World, Bicycling, Prevention, Organic Gardening and Eat This, Not That!, along with a custom built "Map my Ride, Map my Run" application. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each channel: News: This section of SDN is comprised of Starbucks media partners offering premium or exclusive content to customers. Beginning today, Starbucks customers who use the free Wi-Fi at more than 6,800 U.S. company-operated stores will be greeted with the Starbucks Digital Network (SDN) -- an exclusive content network curated by the company and designed to enhance the customer's in-store experience.

Newly signed content partner GOOD is providing early access to its infographics, so Starbucks customers can view them before anyone else.
