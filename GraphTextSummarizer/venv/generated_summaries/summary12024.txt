John Roos, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said the U.S. military has delivered over 7,000 pounds of food and water to the disaster area so far and more than $5.8 million of U.S. aid has come to Japan. -- Thousands of Japanese filled evacuation shelters or joined foreigners seeking a way out of the country Thursday in the aftermath of last week's devastating earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis at stricken reactors. On Thursday morning, helicopters operated by Japan's self-defense forces made four passes over the plant's No. 3 reactor to dump water. Concerns spread far beyond Japan's borders, with U.S. stock markets falling and the U.S. military dispatching a radiation-sniffing aircraft to determine if toxic clouds were rising from disabled reactors. Workers have been pumping sea water into reactors in an effort to prevent further damage.
