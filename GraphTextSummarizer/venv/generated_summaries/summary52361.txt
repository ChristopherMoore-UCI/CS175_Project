The two children, identified by police as 4-year-old Kaia Diez and 13-month-old Cole Diez, were found safe at the California home with family members. A little more than three hours after the shootings, Lake Havasu police investigators discovered that Diez's vehicle was parked at a home in Rancho Cucamonga, California, more than 250 miles away from the site of the killings. -- A man suspected in the shooting deaths of five people at a Lake Havasu City, Arizona, residence on Saturday night was found dead early Sunday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police. According to an Amber Alert issued Sunday for the missing children, Diez, their father, was locked in a custody battle with their mother, identified by police as 23-year-old Deborah Langstaff. The killings began just before midnight Saturday when police say 26-year-old Brian Diez entered the residence, shot six people and abducted two children from the home, according to a press release from the Lake Havasu City Police Department.
