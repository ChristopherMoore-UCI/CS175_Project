Today, as the co-founder and chief technical officer of software company Logiciel, she is considered one of the most powerful women in financial technology on the continent -- in 2013, South Africa's CEO Magazine named Bedwei  the most influential woman in business and government in Africa for the financial sector. Three years later, Bedwei was on the move again and soon found work as a senior software architect at Rancard Solutions. Along with her business achievements, Bedwei prides herself on inspiring others through organizations like The Girls in ICT Committee -- a group established to encourage more women to pursue IT careers. Bedwei was home schooled until the age of 12, and then continued her education at a government school where she was able to socialize with other children. Her family noticed her passion for computers, so it was decided for Bedwei to skip senior high school and enroll in a one-year computer course at the St. Michael information technology center.
