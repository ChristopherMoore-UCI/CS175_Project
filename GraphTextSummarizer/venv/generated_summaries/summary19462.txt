But while it is designed to hit Americans in the heart, it also condemns thousands of Russian orphans who could have found families in America. When children become wards of the state, they need the government to find adoptive families, in their home country or failing that, internationally. Less than a decade ago, 4,000 to 5,000 Russian children found adoptive families in America each year. Institutionalized children need families, not staff. These families, like ours, left their Russian children holding small albums with photos of their soon-to-be families.
