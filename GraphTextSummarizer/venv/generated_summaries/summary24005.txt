Now that the door has been opened, there may be a flood of American productions headed to Cuba's shores. In January, it was announced that a production of "Rent" done in cooperation with the Cuban National Council of Performing Arts would be the first full Broadway musical held in the country in 50 years. In December, President Obama announced that the U.S. would be moving to re-establish diplomatic relations with the island nation, including reopening an embassy in Havana and loosening travel restrictions. In February 1959, Jack Paar traveled to Cuba to interview Fidel Castro for "The Tonight Show." The trip gives the 'Conan' audience a rare glimpse into the daily life of a country not often seen by American viewers."
