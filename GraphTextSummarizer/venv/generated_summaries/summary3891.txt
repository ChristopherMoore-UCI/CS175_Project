"One way or another, she's hoping for either closure or hoping that she's at least one step closer to finding him due to the fact the motorcycle was found." Del Sardo said Ann Devert spent time in Mexico after her son's disappearance, meeting local authorities and residents in the southwestern Mexican state of Michoacan in an attempt to find him. " Mexican authorities, acting on tips, on Thursday located his green Kawasaki motorcycle in a shallow grave in the state of Guerrero, along with the badly decomposed remains of a man in two plastic bags, said Darren Del Sardo, an attorney for Devert's mother. Del Sardo said Ann Devert was told that the remains may have been moved to the shallow grave. Ann Devert had been in touch with both the American and French embassies in Mexico. Ann Devert said her son took a safety course and spent hours studying YouTube videos on how to survive falls from bikes.
