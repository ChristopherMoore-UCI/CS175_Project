Ruiz is part of a recent increase in the number of Hispanics attending college in the United States -- a figure that spiked last year and even surpassed that of young blacks, according to a study released last week by the Pew Hispanic Center, part of the Pew Research Center. Researcher Richard Fry, who worked on the Pew study, attributes the gains in Hispanic enrollment to the overall population increase of Hispanics and an increase in the number of Hispanics graduating from high school, making them eligible to go to college. For that same time period, college enrollment for blacks and Asians also increased, but not as dramatically as that of Hispanics. There was a 4% decline in college enrollment among young whites since 2009, the largest drop since at least 1993, the study showed. Although the enrollment of white students decreased to 7.7 million, the study showed, whites still make up the vast majority of college students.
