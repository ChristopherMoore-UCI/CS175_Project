-- Dina Lohan, mother of actress Lindsay Lohan, was arrested and charged with two counts of driving while intoxicated Thursday night, New York State Police said Friday.

Lohan, 50, was issued traffic tickets for the two DWI offenses and speeding. According to a press release from the police, the elder Lohan was stopped at approximately 11 p.m. Thursday when the white BMW she was driving westbound on the Northern State Parkway was observed traveling at 77 mph in a 55 mph zone. She is scheduled to appear in Nassau County 1st District Court on September 24 to answer to the charges.
