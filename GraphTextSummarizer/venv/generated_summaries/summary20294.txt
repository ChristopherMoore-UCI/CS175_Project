"The ideal solution would be to have an armed police officer in each school," Attorney General Tom Horne said in a news release Wednesday. The "next best solution," Horne said, "is to have one person in the school trained to handle firearms, to handle emergency situations, and possessing a firearm in a secure location." But budget cuts have limited the number of Arizona schools with "school resource officers" on campus, he said. A school would be invited to send the principal "or another designee" to "training in the use of firearms and how to handle emergencies such as that which occurred in Newtown," Horne's release said. "The designated individual (no more than one per school) would then be authorized to keep a firearm locked in a secure place, and would have adequate communication to be alerted to an emergency in any part of the school," the release said.
