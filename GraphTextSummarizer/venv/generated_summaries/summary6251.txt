When the court is in the middle of a term, it is easy to focus on hard legal questions, the legal views of individual justices and the consequences of landmark decisions. When Arkansas was considering placing cameras in the courtroom, Justice Robert L. Brown conducted a survey and found that "state supreme courts have blazed a significant technological trail. ... [N]o state that currently provides video of its oral arguments cites grandstanding as a problem." Arkansas has joined the majority of states that allow cameras in their courtrooms. Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy have suggested that the presence of television would lead to grandstanding by lawyers and maybe even the justices themselves, but the experiences in state courts demonstrate such concerns are greatly exaggerated. Few witnesses to history The second aspect of our Supreme Court that needs to be changed is the lack of television coverage of oral arguments and decision announcements.
