Efforts to bring Biggs home were frustrated because by then, he had fathered a young Brazilian son -- Michael Biggs -- and authorities rejected British requests for his extradition. Michael Biggs said then that his father had expressed regret for the robbery, but did not regret "living the life he had." Britain's Telegraph newspaper, in its obituary, makes the point that while Biggs won notoriety for the heist and his subsequent life on the run, "people tended to forget that he had seriously wounded the train-driver, Jack Mills, who died six years later having never recovered his health." Biggs' death coincides with the release in the United Kingdom of a two-part BBC series about the 1963 train robbery that made him famous. "Great Train Robber" Ronnie Biggs -- one of the most notorious British criminals of the 20th century -- has died, his publisher told CNN on Wednesday. Biggs, who despite his crimes became the subject of books, films and TV shows and even recorded a single with the Sex Pistols, had been released from prison in 2009 on health grounds. Cliff Moulder, of publisher MPress, told CNN that close family and friends informed him that Biggs passed away early Wednesday.
