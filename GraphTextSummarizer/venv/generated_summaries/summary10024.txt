But large and growing areas of Afghanistan are under Taliban control. How much our entanglement in Afghanistan is turning into a sad farce became all too clear when President Obama flew to Kabul to tell Karzai that he ought to stop corruption.

Moreover, it turns out that major sources of corruption are our corporations and the CIA. After that, the people of Afghanistan can duke it out over which kind of regime they want.
