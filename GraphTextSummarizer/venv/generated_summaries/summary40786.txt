Will Smith plays Cypher, a military Ranger famous for his total absence of fear (that's why he's invincible to the monsters, who stalk their prey by smelling fear), and Jaden plays his upstart Ranger-cadet son, Kitai, who is traveling with him on an interplanetary mission. The movie teams Will Smith and his son, Jaden Smith, and it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the former maestro-huckster of the twist ending. We're not used to seeing Will Smith shorn of his lightness and humor, but in "After Earth," he's solemn and heavy-lidded, and he speaks with grave deliberation, never even using contractions. I'm someone who thinks that Jaden Smith has a lot of talent; his moody melancholy held that "Karate Kid" remake together.
