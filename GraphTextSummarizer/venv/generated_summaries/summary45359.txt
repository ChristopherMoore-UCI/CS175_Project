Charlie Hebdo attack: What we know and what we don't Because of the recent travel of hundreds of French fighters to the Middle East, the French Parliament adopted new anti-terrorism laws in November to prevent French nationals from traveling abroad to fight. Many Muslims, such as the Kouchai brothers, live in grim banlieue --suburbs of large French citiesâ€”that are not dissimilar to projects in the United States where there is little in the way of opportunity; they live divorced from mainstream French society. A travel ban can be imposed on French nationals when "there are serious reasons to believe that someone is planning to travel abroad to take part in terrorist activities..." He was arrested by French authorities in 2005 when he was about to leave to fight in Iraq. After a series of bombings in France in 1995 carried out by militants with links to the former French colony of Algeria that included the Musee' d'Orsay attack, French authorities enacted harsh anti-terrorism laws that allow prosecutors to charge the mere intention to commit an act of terror as a crime and also to hold those suspected of such crimes for up to three years as prosecutors investigated their cases.
