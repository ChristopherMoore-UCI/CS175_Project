In precisely the same way, a requirement of background checks for gun purchases reduces the overall likelihood that people will die of gun violence. It is not normal, in a civilized nation, to assert that the best solution to gun violence is for more people to have more access to more guns. Many gun-rights absolutists respond to the death and mayhem of a Marysville or a Sandy Hook by saying that a particular gun law -- say, background checks for gun purchases -- wouldn't have prevented that tragedy. But this is not the first shooting in and around schools and colleges in America since the most infamous shooting at Sandy Hook. The other tragedy, then, is that gun violence -- in schools, in workplaces and across our communities -- has become virtually normal in America.
