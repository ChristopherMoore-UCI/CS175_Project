Even hardened political heavyweights aren't immune: A televised debate between Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, of the "Yes" camp, and former UK finance minister Alistair Darling, of the "Better Together" campaign, descended into shrillness, name-calling and finger-pointing. Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond and the Yes Scotland campaign both condemned the egg attack. The politician told STV news: "The kind of attack that was conducted on the Wings over Scotland site is the kind of thing that's designed to intimidate; it's designed to bully people into not expressing their genuinely held views. Most political campaigns become a little bad-tempered at times, but when the stakes are this high, and the discourse goes from sniping to downright nasty and even violent, things can get tough. The article, which asserted that Scotland "is more commonly associated with work-shy dole scroungers and skag-addled prostitutes than with the industriousness of Adam Smith or with its glorious pre-Reformation spirituality," suggested that independence might be a good thing, if only to rid the rest of the UK of their "scrounging Caledonian neighbors."
