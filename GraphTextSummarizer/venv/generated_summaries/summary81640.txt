Azarenka was one of seven players to pull out of the tournament Wednesday with injury, joining Rafel Nadal's conqueror Steve Darcis, France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Czech Radek Stepanek, U.S star John Isner, Croatia's Marin Cilic and Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova on the sidelines. The 29-year-old had been set to face Poland's Lukasz Kubot in the second round, but failed to overcome the problem in time. John Isner was another casualty after pulling out of his clash with France's Adrian Mannarino just two games into his second round game. Although a number of players have withdrawn injured, only one player has attributed this to slipping over on court. It is an unwanted statistic for the tournament, which has seen 10 withdrawals in the singles competition overall, with the record currently held by the 2011 U.S. Open when 17 competitors were forced out with injuries.
