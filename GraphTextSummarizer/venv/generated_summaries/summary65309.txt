It also brought heavy rain to parts of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Virginia and prompted flood warnings and watches as far south as Georgia, according to CNN meteorologist Monica O'Connor. High water from intense rain caused major flooding along the Housatonic and Still rivers in Connecticut, as well as minor or moderate flooding along the Connecticut, Farmington, Quinnipiac and Pomperaug rivers. The storm -- the same system that brought tornadoes to Louisiana earlier in the week -- dumped up to 30 inches of snow on parts of Vermont, New York and Maine. Up to 2 1/2 inches of rain are forecast for parts of Connecticut on Thursday, raising the threat of additional flooding in the western part of the state, according to the state Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. That being said, heavy March snow is not unheard of in the state -- the record for the month is 47.6 inches, she said.
