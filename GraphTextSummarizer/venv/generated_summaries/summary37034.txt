Obama represents a "clean break" from the past, and his election is the first big step toward change, said Dick Martin, author of "Rebuilding Brand America. The biggest thing Obama could do to reshape U.S. foreign policy would be to capture Osama bin Laden, Quelch said. In addition to exposing the rest of the world to U.S. culture, Obama should also make sure young Americans are citizens of the world. Martin also suggested that Obama take a page out of President Eisenhower's playbook and give the rest of the world an opportunity to experience American culture through an agency like the now-defunct United States Information Agency. America's image has declined in nearly every region of the world in recent years, but Obama's victory "enables the United States to start again with a clean slate," according to John Quelch, the senior associate dean at Harvard Business School.
