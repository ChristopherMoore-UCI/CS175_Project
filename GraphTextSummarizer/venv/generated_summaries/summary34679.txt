For each dollar spent on programs like Early Intervention, according to studies by people such as the Nobel Laureate James Heckman and the Rand Corporation, the state saves at least $7 in future services. Kansas, under Sam Brownback, has pushed disabled people off Medicaid, making services less effective and efficient. Last December, House Republicans insisted that the ABLE act, a bill intended to help people with disabilities and their caregivers save money, only be offered to those who were disabled before the age of 26, a limitation aimed at excluding people who become disabled through work, disease, accident or age. Respite programs, which the Rauner budget eliminates entirely, provide qualified assistance to people who care for people with disabilities. Violent encounters between police and people with disabilities will only become more common.
