Robert Alan Black -- who'd  been in the UAE to speak at an international creativity conference -- had been held in Abu Dhabi's Al Wathba prison since October 21 after being "charged with taking pictures of restricted areas," said Rosemary Rein, the spokeswoman for Friends of Alan Black. Rein has said Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia. A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. " Black characterizes himself as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, professor and creativity consultant on his website. "The court found that the action was committed with no ill-intention, and ordered the minimum fine of 500 (UAE dirhams or about US $135)," according to Rein's statement, which was posted to a "Free Robert Alan Black" Facebook page.
