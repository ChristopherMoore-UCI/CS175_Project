The court heard arguments Tuesday about the legality of the "legitimate impediment" law, which would effectively grant top Italian government officials immunity while they are in office. The Berlusconi-backed law says top government officials cannot be prosecuted because their officials duties make it impossible for them to attend court hearings. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 separate charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994, but remains very popular with the Italian public. The Constitutional Court can rule it is unconstitutional and strike it down, uphold it, or rule it partially unconstitutional and modify it, Italian media reported. He's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case, and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another.
