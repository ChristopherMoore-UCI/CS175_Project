Micheletti's government sent a letter to the Brazilian authorities on Tuesday asking them either to give Zelaya asylum in their country or to turn him over to Honduran authorities. The Honduran government extended a nationwide curfew to 36 hours Tuesday, as the country awaits the consequence of the surprise return of deposed President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Earlier in the day, local television footage showed video of water cannons being used to scatter Zelaya supporters and the ousted president's backers throwing rocks and other objects at police. Despite increasing political, diplomatic and economic isolation, the government of interim President Roberto Micheletti has steadfastly resisted pressure to allow Zelaya to return to power. Micheletti has denied that a coup took place, saying that Zelaya was removed legally through constitutional means.
