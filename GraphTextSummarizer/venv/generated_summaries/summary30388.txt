The administration has failed to build international support for this action and has offered a shifting set of reasons for using force, a strategy that has reminded many Americans of the buildup to Iraq. Carter promised to offer new approaches to domestic policy that avoided the militaristic record of his Cold War predecessors. Obama, who won the hearts and souls of many Americans in the 2008 election with his trenchant criticism of President George W.

He promoted human rights as a centerpiece of international policy and signed the Panama Canal treaties that he hoped would rebuild the image of the United States in the region.
