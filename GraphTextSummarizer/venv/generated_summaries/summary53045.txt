The Cut: What no one tells you about losing lots of weight Embracing a new self Body image disturbance isn't unusual when people lose weight, said Emily Sandoz, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Focused on weight loss and fitness, Janetzko didn't pay close attention to his body's signals that it was being pushed too hard. Janetzko started going to the gym often, focusing on jogging and light weights. The first stage of Janetzko's weight loss came when he lived at home in Toronto during college. " Sandoz's approach to helping people with body image problems is to shift the focus to other areas of their lives that they care about, such as work or parenting.
