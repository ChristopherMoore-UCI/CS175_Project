I was in Bosnia during the war in 1994 when it was discovered there were rape camps where white women were being raped. It is my hope that these words and those of others will break the silence and break open a sea of action to move Congolese women toward peace, safety and freedom. Is it flat-out racism, the world's utter indifference and disregard for black people and black women in particular? Playwright Eve Ensler says conflict in Congo is taking a terrible toll on women and girls. Nothing I have heard or seen compares with what is going on in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where corporate greed, fueled by capitalist consumption, and the rape of women have merged into a single nightmare.
