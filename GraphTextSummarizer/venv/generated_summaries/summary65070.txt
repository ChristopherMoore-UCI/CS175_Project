At least that's the assessment of an annual study by Millward Brown, a communications company that ranks Google as the world's most popular brand, topping Apple, which had held the top spot for the past three years. According to the 2014 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brand ranking, Google's brand value rose 40% last year, to $159 billion. Apple, meanwhile, was criticized by some for failing to keep breaking new ground, settling instead for incremental upgrades to its breakthrough products like the iPhone and iPad. Twitter and LinkedIn debuted on the list at numbers 71 and 78, respectively, and with a 68% increase in perceived value, Facebook was the second-biggest climber on the list, reaching number 21. In the past year, Google's Android mobile operating system continued to gain popularity worldwide, its connected Glass eyewear became more of a wearable-tech staple and stories about its long-range products, like a self-driving car, continued to captivate imaginations.
