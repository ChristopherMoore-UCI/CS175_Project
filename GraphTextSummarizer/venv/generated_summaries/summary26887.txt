Or a day at a St. Barts beach in the Caribbean is memorable?" asks captain Ben Lyons, speaking by satellite phone from a ship currently cruising Finland's fjords. "Other people can go to remote islands in the Pacific," explains Lyons. "Enigma XK" has been fully kitted out with opulent extras, including a gym and sauna -- hardly the Shackleton idea of "roughing it." "With this sort of yacht you can do in one trip, what would take five years to do on a commercial cruise ship," explains Lyons. Once on board, they can take a personal submarine out for underwater exploration -- "they're essential toys on superyachts," explains Lyons. Or sailing past a three-mile-wide iceberg in Antarctica -- now those are once-in-a-lifetime experiences," says the chief officer of Eyos Expeditions, a company offering luxury journeys to destinations that time forgot.
