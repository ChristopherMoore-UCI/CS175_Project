Matt Stopera, 27, was greeted with bouquets of flowers, hordes of photographers and screaming fans as he arrived in Meizhou, southern China Wednesday, embracing Li Hongjun --  a restaurant owner who somehow came across the iPhone that Stopera lost in New York over a year ago. Two men from different worlds — a BuzzFeed editor from New York and a man in southern China known as "Brother Orange" — have united dramatically after social media helped them bond over a stolen iPhone. The story went viral in China, where Internet users banded together to search for the stranger, who they nicknamed Brother Orange. According to images posted to social media, the two spent their first hours in China eating noodles and walking around tourist sites. While Stopera waited for his visa to be approved, the two swapped messages -- Stopera began learning Mandarin phrases, while Brother Orange posted videos of himself learning English.
