Andriy Shevchenko has told CNN Sport's Pedro Pinto that the Euro 2012 finals in his native Ukraine will be his final major football tournament, and he is determined to end his international career on a high. The 35-year-old Dynamo Kiev striker, who is widely regarded as the greatest Ukrainian player of all time after a celebrated 18-year career with Kiev, AC Milan and Chelsea, is looking forward to next year's showpiece -- and believes co-hosts Ukraine will stage a tournament to remember. Shevchenko is best remembered for his time at AC Milan, where he scored 175 goals in seven seasons -- the second most prolific striker in the famous Italian club's history -- as well as helping the club lift the Champions League title in 2003. Captaining his country in a major international tournament on home soil will be a fitting end to a wonderful career for Shevchenko, who is among the greatest forwards the world has ever seen. When I was 14 I visited Milan's San Siro stadium and remember thinking how unbelievable it was," said Shevchenko.
