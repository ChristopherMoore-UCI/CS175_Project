He challenged the 40% figure for gun sales without background checks -- particularly at gun shows. In total, 16 states and the District of Columbia require background checks on handguns sold at gun shows, Nichols said. But federal law does not require background checks for "private transactions," like sales at gun shows. Keene did say he favored background checks to block people who may be mentally ill or potentially violent from buying guns. Forty percent of all firearms purchased in the United States are sold without background checks because the guns aren't purchased from a federally licensed firearms dealer, Nichols said.
