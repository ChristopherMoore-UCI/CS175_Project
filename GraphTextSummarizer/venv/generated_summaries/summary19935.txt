The agency and the governments of both Kenya and Somalia agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of Somali refugees. Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in eastern Kenya this month, killing 147 people. Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday gave the United Nations' refugee agency three months to relocate refugees from the Dadaab camp -- the world's largest -- to Somalia, or "we shall relocate them ourselves. That's why, in addition to moving the Dadaab camp, Kenya is building of a 435-mile (700-kilometer) wall covering most of the Somali border from Mandera to Kiunga -- a wall that Ruto says has begun to prevent Al-Shabaab elements from getting into Kenya. Kenya's government says that attack was masterminded by senior Al-Shabaab leader Mohamed Mohamud, whose "extensive terrorist network within Kenya" extends into the sprawling Dadaab complex, according to a Kenyan government document given to CNN.
