The former Israeli soldier who posted photos of herself on Facebook posing in front of blindfolded Palestinians waved off criticism of her actions, arguing that her behavior was no different than that of news outlets. The photo shows Abergil smiling in front of blindfolded prisoners. "This was just a military (service) experience," Eden Abergil said in an interview on Tuesday with Israeli Army Radio. In another picture she is sitting in front of three blindfolded Palestinians, one with his hands tied in front of him. In another interview on Dayan's show, a Channel 2 Army commentator, Roni Daniel, expressed anger over Abergil's attitude.
