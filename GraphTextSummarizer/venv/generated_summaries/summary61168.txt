For more than a year, CNN has been investigating and reporting on veterans' deaths and delays at VA facilities all across the country, including detailed investigations in November and January 2013 examining deaths at two VA facilities in South Carolina and Georgia. After Foote's revelations about Phoenix, numerous other whistleblowers stepped forward with similar charges of veterans' waiting for care and possible deaths of veterans who were waiting. Dr. Sam Foote, a retired Phoenix VA doctor who will testify before Congress on Wednesday, says the VA's inspector general has downplayed the way in which employee manipulations of patient wait times contributed to deaths. CNN has learned the VA's inspector general told congressional officials in a private briefing in August that 293 veterans died while waiting for care, though the deaths were not said to be caused by delays. Foote first appeared on CNN in April, with detailed allegations that as many as 40 American veterans had died in Phoenix, waiting for care at the VA.
