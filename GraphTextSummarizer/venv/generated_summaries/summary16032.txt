In May, auto industry officials and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Energy Department discussed potential dangers faced by first responders from electrical charges produced by hybrid and electric cars. A report by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) highlighted risks to first responders and tow operators from potential electric shock from damaged systems not disengaged during or immediately after a crash. Ford has published a guide for first responders encountering its Focus EV involved in accidents. Another recommendation would create a guide for emergency workers, something Mackintosh called a "cheat sheet for first responders." But the case highlighted potential safety concerns for first responders.
