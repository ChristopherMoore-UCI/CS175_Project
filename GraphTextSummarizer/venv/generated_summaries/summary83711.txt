In this outback, where the Indian Ocean meets the Timor Sea, remote islands proliferate, and rivers and inlets-accessible only by small ships-lead to isolated gorges, towering rock faces, and waterfalls. In this outback territory, where the Indian Ocean meets the Timor Sea, remote islands proliferate, and rivers and inlets lead to isolated gorges, towering rock faces, majestic waterfalls (as high as 328 feet), and roving saltwater crocodiles. When you picture paradise, chances are it looks a lot like French Polynesia, an ethereal collection of islands where dark volcanic peaks loom above the greenest of green foliage and turquoise sea. But big ship lines, too, are bringing passengers to ocean-accessible scenic wonders like Alaska's Inside Passage, where the roar of calving glaciers is best experienced from the vantage point of a ship's deck. In this stark setting, you can spot orca and sperm whales from the deck and observe penguins and elephant seals up-close on island stops.
