The shooter left on foot after the attack and headed toward a different part of downtown Brussels before he disappeared, according to police. Police have arrested a suspect in Marseille, France, in connection with the shooting deaths of three people May 24 at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium, Belgian federal magistrate Wenke Roggen said Sunday. Francois Molins said Nemmouche, who has a criminal history that included a five-year prison stint, was detained at the St. Charles Train Station on Friday after returning to France by bus from Brussels by way of Amsterdam. The suspect is identified as Mehdi Nemmouche, a 29-year-old Frenchman from Roubaix in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France.
