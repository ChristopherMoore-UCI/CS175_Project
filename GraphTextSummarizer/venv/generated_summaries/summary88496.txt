In a Monday letter to Korman, Justice Department attorneys said the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services had agreed to make the single-pill version of the drug available "without age or point-of-sale restrictions. Under current policies, prescriptions are still needed for the generic version for those under age 17. But the FDA won't allow girls to obtain a two-pill version of the drug, saying there is less safety data available on the use of the product by younger adolescents. The administration had been criticized by some women's rights groups for trying to stop contraception sales to underage females. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours.
