I couldn't quite believe my eyes when I read the initial comments from Microsoft's CEO on how women who don't ask for raises will receive "good karma." Would a female chief executive officer have ever suggested that women should trust the system and trust that they'll receive "good karma" if they don't ask for raises? We need more women in tech: We already knew we have too few women in the tech industry, but the Microsoft chief's gaffe is another reminder. You have to wonder if he'd ever make such comments or believe them if he were surrounded by more women. What do you think about the Microsoft CEO's initial comments that women shouldn't ask for a raise?
