But the protest has been dismissed by FIFA on the grounds that Costa Rica failed to follow official regulations in its protest, meaning the U.S. team's first win of the North and Central American and Caribbean qualification competition is secure. "FIFA received a letter via email from the Costa Rica FA on 24 March 2013 with regards to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier played on 22 March between USA and Costa Rica," said a FIFA statement. "FIFA has examined the content of the letter and, taking into consideration article 14, paragraph 4 of the 2014 FIFA World Cup regulations, has confirmed that the conditions established in the regulations for an official protest have not been met by the Costa Rica FA. The Costa Rican Football Federation complained to FIFA following last week's 2014 World Cup qualifier in Colorado, which was played in blizzard-like conditions. The win was vital for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who had come in for criticism following a 2-1 defeat to Honduras last month.
