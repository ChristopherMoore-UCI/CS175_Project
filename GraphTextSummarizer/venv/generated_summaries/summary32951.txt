The U.S. space agency is interested in MISS and microbial mats because scientists are looking for them on Mars to possibly show life once existed there. As the study's lead author, Nora Noffke of Old Dominion University, notes, "The signal of early life forms has been preserved more clearly in MISS" compared with other prehistoric finds. Deep in a remote, hot, dry patch of northwestern Australia lies one of the earliest detectable signs of life on the planet, tracing back nearly 3.5 billion years, scientists say. " "If there was life," said Noffke, "then MISS is one of the likely targets. That's young relative to the Dresser Formation find, which the Astrobiology report says is about 3.48 billion years old.
