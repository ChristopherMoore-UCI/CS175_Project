"I had no idea his anger would extend beyond me, to include all people in his killings." John Muhammad, the mastermind behind the Washington-area sniper attacks of 2002, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday evening at a state prison near Jarratt, Virginia. Muhammad said she divorced John Muhammad because of abuse and has not visited him since he was in prison. But Mildred Muhammad believes she was the ultimate target of her ex-husband, John Allan Muhammad, the man dubbed the "D.C. Sniper." John Muhammad's other ex-wife, Carol Williams, also talked to King Monday. Williams also brought letters that John Muhammad wrote her from prison.
