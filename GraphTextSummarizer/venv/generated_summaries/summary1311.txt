The attacks took place on Wednesday evening, coinciding with the end of a four-day tour of the Xinjiang region by Chinese President Xi Jinping. -- Chinese state media is proclaiming the Xinjiang bomb blast "case closed" after authorities claimed to have identified the suspected assailants. One of them has been identified as Sedirdin Sawut, a 39-year-old man from Aksu in southern Xinjiang. After the blast, President Xi urged "decisive actions" against violent terrorist attacks. Frequent outbreaks of violence have beset the resource-rich region, where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the past few decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group.
