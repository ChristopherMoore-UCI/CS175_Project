In 1965, Haight-Ashbury was a mixed-race enclave of cheap apartments and old Victorian houses, home to working-class laborers and Beat artists looking for inexpensive digs. "The Haight" showcases pictures Marshall took from about 1965 to 1968, when Haight-Ashbury went from a quietly run-down fringe area to the most famous neighborhood in America: Hippie Central. He was at ground zero," says Amelia Davis, Marshall's longtime assistant, who now oversees the estate of the late photographer. Amazingly, Marshall's photographs were done on manually operated Leicas -- no autofocus, no special lighting, certainly no Photoshop. The Beatles, shot at their last American concert, are caught backstage, pensive and bored; in one photo, Paul McCartney doodles on a table while Joan Baez smiles into Marshall's lens.
