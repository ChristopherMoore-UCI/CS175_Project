Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama "runs against the repeated commitments by the U.S. government that the U.S. recognizes Tibet as part of China and gives no support to 'Tibet independence,' " Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said. Thursday's encounter took place against the backdrop of several contentious issues already threatening to sour the relationship between America and China, including trade disputes, a recent U.S. arms sales deal for Taiwan -- which China considers an illegitimate breakaway province -- and a censorship fight over Internet search engine Google Inc. The meeting is "another event in the recent, one has to say, downward spiral in U.S.-China relations," China scholar David Shambaugh said. But the survey, released Thursday, also indicates that most Americans think it is more important to maintain good relations with China than to take a stand on Tibet. "We need each other for a number of international security issues -- to deal with the global climate crisis, to deal with the global financial crisis." Poll: Most Americans favor Tibetan independence China is the largest-growing export market for U.S. companies, Paal said, expanding by 65 percent last year alone. "China demands the U.S. seriously consider China's stance, immediately adopt measures to wipe out the adverse impact, [and] stop conniving and supporting anti-China separatist forces."
