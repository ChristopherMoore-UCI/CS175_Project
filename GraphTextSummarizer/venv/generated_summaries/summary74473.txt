"Currently, the thousands of Muslim staff and students (within Montgomery County Public Schools) have to choose between their education and observing their religious practices," says a statement on the website of the Equality for Eid Coalition, which has been advocating for Montgomery County to close school on Muslim holidays. The decision also arrived amid a push from leaders in the Muslim community to see their faith's holidays, such as Eid al-Adha, get the same treatment from Montgomery County schools as the Christian and Jewish observances. " Montgomery County isn't the first district to remove the names of religious holidays from its school calendar; Maryland's Baltimore City Public Schools have done something similar. Starting next year, the names of religious holidays like Christmas and Yom Kippur will no longer appear on the school calendar in Montgomery County, Maryland. The county's Board of Education made this decision Tuesday, pointing out that schools don't close for religious reasons but for secular ones, such as high absenteeism among students and teachers.
