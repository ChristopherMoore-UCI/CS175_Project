Abour 140 Goodwill agencies contribute items to the Shopgoodwill.com online store, which has more than 61,000 items in 350 categories that include art, electronics, jewelry and transportation. Like the collection of 55 African artifacts that sold recently for a Goodwill online record of $23,472. "The African collection will provide significant revenue for job training in the region," said Terry Hayes, president of the Tacoma (Washington) Goodwill, in a written statement. In between are specialty boutiques for high-end apparel and accessories or home decor, and regular retail stores. While most think of Goodwill as a great place to buy really cheap shirts or gently used shoes, maybe even some furniture, the charity has an online auction site called shopgoodwill.com. He said he thinks more people have learned about the auction site through media coverage and an increased number of bidders helped yield the record amount.
