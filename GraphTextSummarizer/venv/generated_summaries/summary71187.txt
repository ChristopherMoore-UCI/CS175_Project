Syracuse fired Fine on Sunday, less than a month after the university placed him on administrative leave after Lang and his stepbrother, Bobby Davis, came forward to publicly accuse him of molesting them over several years. Mike Lang accused former men's assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine, 65, of touching him inappropriately at least dozens of times when he was a boy. I don't believe that he had any knowledge this was going on." Lang, now 45, said he used to tell Fine to stop touching him, but that "you couldn't tell him no." The investigation at Syracuse comes in the wake of a sex abuse scandal at Penn State University that received nationwide attention. Regarding Jim Boeheim, head men's basketball coach at Syracuse, Lang said, "I honestly believe he didn't know anything about this."
