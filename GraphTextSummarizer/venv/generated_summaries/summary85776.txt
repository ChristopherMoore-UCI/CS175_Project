The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management requested that NOAA investigate the site after it was originally detected as an "unknown sonar contact" by Shell Oil Company during a 2011 oil and gas survey of the Gulf, government officials said. " Scientists aboard the NOAA ship "Okeanos Explorer" were able to view the wreckage using advanced multi-beam mapping sonar technology and a remotely operated underwater vehicle, named "Little Hercules." Scientists were able to view the remains of "anchors, navigational instruments, glass bottles, ceramic plates, cannons, and boxes of muskets" aboard the ship, NOAA stated. "Shipwrecks help to fill in some of the unwritten pages of history," said Frank Cantelas, a maritime archaeologist with NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research. Shipwreck found on Gulf floor while thousands watched "Artifacts in and around the wreck and the hull's copper sheathing may date the vessel to the early to mid-19th century," said Jack Irion, a maritime archaeologist with the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
