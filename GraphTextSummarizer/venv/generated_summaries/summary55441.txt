-- Rail riders along the California coast and the Boston-Washington "Northeast Corridor" are set to reap much of the benefits from $2 billion that Florida policymakers had earlier rejected for high-speed rail development. Among other things, the funds will be used to improve speed and service in the Northeast, add faster rail lines in the Midwest and help spur more efficient train service between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Soon after taking office, Florida Gov. Rick Scott cited expected cost overruns and long-term operating costs for his call to block federal funding for an 84-mile-long high-speed rail line that would link Tampa and Orlando. " Supporters insist the emphasis on faster rail transportation is a necessary investment in the country's economic competitiveness. " "I don't see how anyone looking at the numbers can say that high-speed rail is going to be a primary driver of economic growth" in the regions targeted by the new money, Staley said.
