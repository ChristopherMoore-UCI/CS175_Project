Cruise line passengers get bill of rights Tweeting cruise fire news The ship had been docked just six hours when Royal Caribbean tweeted that passengers would receive full refunds of the fare paid and a certificate valued at the May 24 fare for a future sailing. In an age when nearly everyone has a smartphone to record incidents as they are occurring, cruise lines should be prepared for passengers to share what happens aboard ship. The cruise association's new passenger bill of rights, announced May 22, applies to 26 North American member cruise lines and applies to cruises purchased in North America on those lines, regardless of itinerary. "Yes, the cruise lines are hard at work protecting/salvaging their public image in the face of tragedy, but on the same note, cruise lines do seem to take tragic matters seriously as demonstrated in how they take immediate action to remedy any given situation. Transparency wins over passengers "Nothing says a cruise line has to break the information on Twitter," the way Royal Caribbean is doing, Spencer Brown said.
