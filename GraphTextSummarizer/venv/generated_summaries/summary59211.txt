It is the story Updike wrote for the New Yorker, "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu," that has allowed Williams' last hurrah to take on a life of its own and that last year prompted critic Charles McGrath to argue that "Hub Fans" is "probably the most celebrated baseball essay ever. -- It came as no surprise to anyone who is a baseball fan that last year on September 28 a flurry of articles marked the 50th anniversary of Ted Williams' final game. Updike was able to capture more than any of us saw that afternoon at Fenway Park, and with the passage of time, his story of Ted Williams' final game has become more powerful than the original experience. The Ted Williams whom Updike describes is a man divided between pride in his craft and determination to avoid making himself vulnerable to the whims of fans. " Thanks to Updike, Williams' last home run is far better known than his even more remarkable feat -- which took place exactly 70 years ago this month --- of going six for eight on the final day of the 1941 season to lift his average to .406 and become the last man in baseball to hit .400.
