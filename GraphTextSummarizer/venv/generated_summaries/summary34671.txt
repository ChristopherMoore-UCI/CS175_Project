Indeed, one can see how this shift affects policy today toward Russia over its meddling in Ukraine and toward Syria, where in both instances international response has taken the form of international sanctions as well as international criminal justice, both responses eschewing collective punishment. In 1995, at the first public indictment proceeding of the architects of the Balkans ethnic cleansing policy,  Chief Prosecutor Richard Goldstone declared that the proceeding of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia would establish a "public record" to "assist in attributing guilt to individuals ...and in avoiding the attribution of collective guilt to any nation or ethnic group." Opinion: The mighty women of World War I Many analysts now conclude that this miscarriage of justice, this experience of collective punishment, backfired and helped pave the road to World War II. Guilty nations have been replaced by war criminals, prosecuted and punished by international tribunals. Such international justice via individual accountability would break "old cycles of ethnic retribution" and thus by displacing vengeance would advance reconciliation.
