A Democratic source briefed on the latest draft of the speech said Obama will include a series of proposals, including: -- Tax reform so that wealthy Americans pay more and the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 expire -- More refinancing for homeowners in trouble -- Additional tax breaks for companies that bring back jobs to the United States -- More clean energy incentives -- " Democratic sources told CNN on Sunday that the bullet points of Obama's blueprint will focus on American manufacturing, including "insourcing" -- or bringing back jobs from overseas. In a December 6 address in Osawatomie, Kansas, Obama described stark differences between a Republican ideology he described as leaving people to fend for themselves and his vision of government that helps provide equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of where they begin in life. Obama will also suggest job training for the long-term unemployed and veterans, the sources said. However, this official acknowledged that Obama's tone will not differ significantly from the approach he's taken in recent months when he's attacked Republicans in Congress for general inaction.
