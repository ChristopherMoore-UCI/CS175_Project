Athletic Bilbao moved up to sixth place with a 2-1 win at home to Racing Santander following goals inside the first 10 minutes from Javi Martinez and Iker Muniain. Real have been linked with a move to bring veteran Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy back to the Santiago Bernabeu, and the player's German club Hamburg confirmed the La Liga side's interest on its website on Saturday night. -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has revealed that the Spanish club's bosses have relented and will seek to sign him a new striker after all. France international Karim Benzema has been filling in for the Argentine, but Mourinho wants more options as Real seek to stop Barcelona retaining the Spanish title and also to win the European Champions League for the first time since 2002. I think it would be good to have another forward for what is left of the season," Mourinho told Madrid's website ahead of Sunday's trip to bottom club Almeria.
