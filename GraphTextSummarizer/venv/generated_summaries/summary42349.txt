So organizers turned to track designer Hermann Tilke -- "nothing is impossible for him," says Zabara -- with the German engineer offering another plan more suitable for the Olympic Park facilities. "He's my sort of man," Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone says of Russian president Vladimir Putin's influence in the project to stage the nation's first grand prix this October in Sochi. But the Sochi pitch filled Ecclestone with confidence, so much so that a six-year deal reportedly worth in excess of $250 million -- though Ecclestone would not confirm that figure -- was signed to secure the event until 2020. But we'll look back at Vancouver and say it didn't come close to what we've just seen in Sochi," Ecclestone argues. It's maybe the reason Ecclestone expects the Russian president to attend the inaugural race in October and why he remains so enthusiastic about this month's Winter Games.
