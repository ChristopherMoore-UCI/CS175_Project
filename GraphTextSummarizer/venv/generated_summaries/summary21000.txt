In stump speeches, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has touted her eventual decision to abandon the Gravina Island bridge, which she initially supported. Read Abbie Boudreau's "backstory" blog on "Road to nowhere" Campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Palin would not have allowed the road project to go forward under normal circumstances. Gov. Sarah Palin let the "Road to Nowhere" go ahead because the contract had been signed. "Gov. Palin could have stopped construction of this road," said Weinstein, who wore his "Nowhere, Alaska" T-shirt to an interview with CNN. The proposed $400 million span that would have connected the coastal city of Ketchikan to its airport on Gravina Island died after it became a symbol of congressional excess.
