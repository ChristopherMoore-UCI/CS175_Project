An associate of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez  pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges stemming from the killing of 27-year-old semipro football player Odin Lloyd. Authorities have said that Hernandez, Wallace, and a third man, Carlos Ortiz, picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before his death. Ernest Wallace is charged with being an accessory after the fact in Lloyd's slaying in an industrial park near Hernandez's Massachusetts home. A full bail hearing is scheduled for September 26, "after the defense has had an opportunity to review the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings," Wallace's attorney, David Meier, told CNN. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later.
