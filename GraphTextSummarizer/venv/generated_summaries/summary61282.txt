The lack of respect for people's rights to land makes it extremely easy for companies to brutally evict farmers. The most noticeable change is the increased pressure on agricultural land. The Indonesian Peasant Union (SPI) calculated that the number of land conflicts increased five-fold, from 22 in 2010 to 120 in 2011. In 2011 alone, the farmer's union counted 20 deaths due to land conflicts in Indonesia. This discourages farmers from producing, ultimately raising unemployment, encouraging more people to migrate away from rural areas and putting pressure elsewhere in the system, especially in our already stressed urban areas.
