" Murray has helped it gain slightly wider acclaim after being introduced to American filmmaker Charles Dye, who last year released a documentary called "Indian Relay." "Some of these are super-duper poor communities and in some cases without Indian Relay some of the young kids would fall into trouble," he says. Dye had some prior knowledge of Indian Relay but admits his project became less about the sport and more about the people, the tribes and the communities it touches. "I was away from Indian Relay for 21 years but I was never away from horses. It's a special thing." Riders like Little Plume are "treated like rock stars," says Dye, but only to a local audience.
