Police on Tuesday were still not sure who set off the bomb or why, though one transportation union leader said that gang members had threatened violence if bus companies did not pay extortions. Gamaliel Chan of the bus drivers' union said that his organization had warned authorities of the possibility of an attack because of threats made to them by gang members. According to Noti 7, the gang members were asking for 60,000 quetzals from the bus drivers, or about $7,300. -- Six people were killed and 17 were injured in a bomb blast onboard a bus in northwestern Guatemala City, officials said. The gang members allegedly told the drivers that there would be an attack if they did not pay a Christmas "bonus."
