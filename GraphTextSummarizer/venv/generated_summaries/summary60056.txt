For all the money Americans spend on health care (60 percent more per person than any other advanced country), Americans are not an especially healthy people. And Americans do all those things, more than other people. This poor performance is often blamed on the fact that millions of Americans lack health insurance. American children are nine times more likely to be injured in a gun accident than children in other developed countries. If all Americans quit smoking, if everybody wore a seat belt, if gun owners consistently secured their weapons, if we all drank in moderation and abjured illegal drugs and if the one-third of the country that is overweight would drop the extra pounds, those individual actions would do more to improve health and extend lives than any contemplated by Congress or the president.
