Indonesia is on high alert after police foiled terror plans to detonate bombs Friday near a church in a Jakarta suburb. Security will be beefed up around houses of worship, tourist destinations, embassies and sites visited by foreigners, officials said. Authorities found about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives near the church on Thursday, said Boy Rafli Amar, the national police spokesman. "Starting tonight until the day after Easter, the military and the police will be on the highest alert at all places," said Joko Suyanto, the coordinating minster for security. Police arrested the suspects in connection with the church bomb and/or attempted mail bomb attacks last month.
