-- Weeks after getting asylum in Russia, Edward Snowden now has a job there, one of his lawyers says. Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims Snowden, a 30-year-old former government information technology contractor, collected information on spy programs -- in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- and exposed the programs to the media. As Snowden got ready to start his new job, he was also meeting Thursday with a German lawmaker who visited him in Russia. The meeting comes amid outrage among many German leaders over claims that an NSA surveillance operation targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Hans-Christian Stroebele, a well-known leftist legislator in Germany, met with Snowden in Moscow to invite him to testify before the German parliament.
