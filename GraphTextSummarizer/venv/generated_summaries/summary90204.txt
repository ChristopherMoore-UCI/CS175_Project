-- Brazil's Federal Police agency said Thursday it's investigating an oil spill at a site off the coast of Rio de Janeiro being explored by the U.S. oil company Chevron. The Federal Police's Rio de Janeiro office said in a statement those responsible for the "environmental accident in the Campos Basin" could face sentences of up to five years in jail if found guilty. The resulting slick was about 163 square kilometers (100 square miles), Chevron said, and was situated about 120 km (75 miles) off the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's Oil and Gas Regulator (ANP) said Chevron reported a seepage in its offshore Frade project November 8 and said that between 200 and 330 barrels of oil per day leaked into the ocean. But according to the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, Federal Police did a fly-over of the site Tuesday and saw only one vessel.
