Breyer got his original claim to U.S. citizenship from his mother, who was born in Manayunk, Pennsylvania, and who returned with her family to Germany before World War I. After World War II, Breyer migrated to the United States in 1952 and claimed citizenship as a displaced person. " The U.S. case against Breyer dates to the 1990s, when federal authorities sought to strip him of his U.S. citizenship, arguing that Nazis were not eligible. According to the current complaint, Breyer told U.S. authorities in 1991 that he was a perimeter guard and may have fired into the air occasionally. German authorities have charged Breyer with complicity in the murder of more than 216,000 European Jews from Hungary, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, who were forcibly deported to Auschwitz, in southern Poland, on 158 trains between May and October 1944, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. " German authorities alleged that Breyer served in the Nazi "Death's Head Guard Battalion" from 1943 to 1945 at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau concentration camp and at another location, according to court papers.
