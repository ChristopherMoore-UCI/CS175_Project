"Exploding Kittens," the card game dreamed up by video game designers Elan Lee and Shane Small and illustrated by The Oatmeal's Matthew Inman, is now the most backed campaign in Kickstarter history, in terms of the number of backers, according to the crowdfunding platform. Luke Crane, Kickstarter's community manager for games, says the success of "Exploding Kittens" is a combination of The Oatmeal's online popularity, Elan Lee's great reputation in the games world, and Kickstarter's own game-loving community. Curious kittens exploding are the Internet's new potato salad meets "Reading Rainbow" with a guest appearance by Veronica Mars, meaning this card game is seriously winning the hearts of Internet users and party game lovers alike. And they've pledged a total of $305 million to games projects since Kickstarter first launched," Crane said. You wonderful people have come together to form the largest community in Kickstarter history, and the numbers keep rising," the creators wrote.
