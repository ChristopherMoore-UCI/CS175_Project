Obama, please remember, it was those stupid, very hopeful people who took the over on a stupid point spread on Obama with a stupid hope to help our country, which includes stupid Vegas. Smoke cigars, have sex with strangers, get wasted and see stupid shows with stupid Elvis impersonators doing stupid impressions of that stupid hillbilly. We don't know how much, but when the president of the United States of America makes his jokes about Vegas -- he costs real people real money. Vegas also stands for stupid gambling like that. Shortly after Obama's comments, he sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, saying, "I wasn't saying anything negative about Las Vegas...there is no place better to have fun than Vegas, one of our country's great destinations.
