The drive by, South Rim For all its stature as an American icon, the Grand Canyon belongs to the world, too. In a world where the instantaneous isn't fast enough, the Grand Canyon measures time not in billionths of seconds but in billions of years. On any given day, the South Rim may be the country's most diverse place, an international village with a population that changes by the hour â€” Buddhist monks in saffron robes and Mennonite women in black bonnets, busloads of grand-touring Germans and giggling Japanese teens moving and texting in packs, even a Scotsman playing bagpipes for an audience of hikers and curious ravens on a promontory. Where to stay: Grand Canyon Lodge. Suddenly, amazingly, the Grand Canyon feels new again.
