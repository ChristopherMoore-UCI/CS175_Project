Big names in the martial arts arena, such as Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White and former light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz, have joined in to help stop bullying and promote their sport. Through the anti-bullying campaign, McCullough said he is sending a message to kids. "What if my kid gets picked on?" Martial arts may not appeal to all the children in the campaign's assemblies, but McCullough said he is sure the message is true for everyone. Constantly relocating, he remembers how other kids were not always welcoming when the family moved to a new neighborhood. "I would like to share with other kids that maybe if they are going through issues of being bullied, or they are a bully, it's a place that they can go to to work that stuff out," he says.
