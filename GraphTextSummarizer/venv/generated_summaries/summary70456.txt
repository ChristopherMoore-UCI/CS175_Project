Faulkner County Circuit Judge Michael Maggio admitted posting details from Theron's closed-record adoption of a child in 2012 on "tigerdroppings.com," a Louisiana State University fan site, using the online name "geauxjudge," according to documents that a judicial commission submitted to the state Supreme Court. The commission's report includes five pages of comments Maggio made in the social media forum on other cases under the username "geauxjudge," including statements on various aspects of gender, race and sexuality issues. The top court in Arkansas has ordered the immediate dismissal of a judge who leaked confidential details about an adoption involving Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron, according to court documents. Theron is one of Hollywood's top actors with roles in movies ranging from "Monster" and "Mighty Joe Young" to "North Country" and "Snow White and the Huntsman." Maggio commented in January 2012 that a friend of his handled a single-parent adoption case involving Theron, and that she came to court wearing a "long brown wig, oversized clothes" so as not to be recognized, the commission's report says.
