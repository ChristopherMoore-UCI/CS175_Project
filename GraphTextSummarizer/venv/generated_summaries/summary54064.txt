It was an indication of a lack of confidence in Adm. Blair," said Fran Townsend, CNN national security contributor who was President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. Blair was the third person to serve as director of national intelligence since the position was created five years ago. Although Blair's resignation was not a complete surprise for those in the intelligence community, he was not expected to step down for another month, senior intelligence officials said. He decided to leave sooner than expected when Obama asked CIA Director Leon Panetta and national security adviser James Jones to go to Pakistan and Blair was not asked to participate, the sources said. Blair, who also caught some of the blame for the more recent failed Times Square bombing attempt, responded to the report by noting changes made in response to the Christmas incident, including creation of a National Counterterrorism Center analytical unit dedicated to following up on terrorist threat information.
