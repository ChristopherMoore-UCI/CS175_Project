" "The United States calls on Hondurans to await the completion of the counting of official results and to resolve election disputes peacefully through established legal processes," the State Department said. With about two-thirds of ballots counted, ruling party candidate Juan Hernandez led with 34% of the vote, followed by 29% for Xiomara Castro, who is Zelaya's wife. This was second presidential election (but the first truly robust one) since the 2009 coup of former President Jose Manuel Zelaya, which ushered in a period of political turmoil. Given these challenges, observers hope that political upheaval is added to the mix. "The Honduran citizenry has shown itself to be a first-rate citizenry, with second-rate politicians," political analyst Raul Pineda said.
