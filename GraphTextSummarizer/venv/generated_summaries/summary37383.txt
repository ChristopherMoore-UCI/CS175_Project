Immigration reformers seek to avoid deja vu Immigration law experts say they can see little merit to attempts to connect the Boston Marathon bombings to current immigration reform efforts. On the surface, the type of heated exchanges that boiled over at a congressional hearing on Monday on immigration reform appeared to center on the two foreign-born suspects in last week's Boston Marathon bombings. "Last week, opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston Marathon bombing. "What I do see is the opponents of immigration reform who have no arguments about the morality and politics of (this immigration package) very cynically jumping on this horrible tragedy to derail this bill," said David Leopold, an immigration attorney and past president of the Washington-based American Immigration Lawyers Association. Opponents assert that the measure's supporters are rushing through immigration reform legislation.
