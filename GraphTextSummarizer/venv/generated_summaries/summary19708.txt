By moving to stop legalization efforts in DC, Congress will have trumped the over 70 percent of district residents who voted to legalize marijuana in November. The congressional spending bill agreed to on Tuesday night blocks Washington, DC lawmakers from using federal or local funds to implement November's popularly passed referendum to legalize marijuana in the district. What's more, while Congress is making decisions for the district, proponents of district autonomy were quick to point out that district residents still have no voting member of the House or Senate. DC marijuana activists' worst fears were realized on Tuesday night with the agreed upon language. With Congress blocking marijuana funding, expect many DC residents to cry foul about what they calling living under the thump of Congress.
