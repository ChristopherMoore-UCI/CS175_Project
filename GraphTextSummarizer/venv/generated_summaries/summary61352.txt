AMBER Alerts have previously been available to many users via their local law enforcement Facebook pages. The child-abduction alert system used by law enforcement, broadcasters and transportation departments is now available on Facebook. But now, Facebook users can receive the announcements directly from state AMBER Alert pages, by choosing which state's alerts they want to see. The AMBER (America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response) Alert system started as an agreement between broadcasters and law enforcement agencies to quickly release information to the public on child abductions so citizens can assist in the search for the child. Facebook users who want to receive the alerts must will sign up at http://apps.facebook.com/amber_alert/. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said designers of the program wanted to be sensitive to people who would see the alerts as spam, so users must sign up to receive the alerts.
