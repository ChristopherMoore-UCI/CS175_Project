Valencia moved up to second place with a 4-2 win at home to BATE Borisov, having led 3-0 after 51 minutes with goals from Jonas, Roberto Soldado -- who netted a penalty -- and Sofiane Feghouli. The result left Barca still on top of Group G, while Celtic's hopes of reaching the last 16 were greatly improved as a first-half goal from Victor Wanyama and an 83rd-minute strike from teenage substitute Tony Watt put Neil Lennon's team in second place with two games left. Messi netted at the start of injury time after an initial block by Forster but Barca could not repeat the last-gasp heroics of Celtic's visit to the Nou Camp last month, when Vilanova's team snatched a 2-1 victory. The 18-year-old Watt, making his first appearance in Europe's top club competition, made it 2-0 after veteran midfielder Xavi failed to cut out a long clearance by Celtic keeper Fraser Forster. It left Shakhtar on top of Group E on goal difference from Chelsea, with Juventus a point adrift in third following a 4-0 win at home to Nordsjaelland.
