O'Rourke said that they had been stopped around 1:30 a.m. at a gate outside the San Diego Naval Base on strong suspicions of drunken driving. O'Rourke said police and others at the base just finished a week of security training, preparing them for an incident like this. -- Navy police shot one sailor in the gut and took another into custody early Saturday after their vehicle smashed into two police cruisers following a chase at San Diego's naval base, a military spokesman said. " The passenger is being held on base, the biggest on the West Coast and home to 59 ported ships and thousands of sailors. Naval police officers then opened fire, eventually hitting that sailor in the abdomen.
