CPSC animation shows how magnets twist the intestines One of Braylon's physicians, Dr. R. Adam Noel, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Louisiana State University Heath Science Center in New Orleans, surveyed his fellow pediatric gastroenterologists to get an idea of how often this occurs. Since magnets are fun to play with and they look like candy, young children will likely try to eat them. A spokesman for the CPSC says the agency might do something similar with adult magnet toys. Product recalls, even bans, are 'on the table' Magnets have a long and not very happy history with the CPSC. The 33 physicians who responded to Noel's survey had altogether seen 82 young patients who had swallowed magnets.
