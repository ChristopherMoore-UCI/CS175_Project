Listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for hundreds of deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the candidate from Zapatero's Socialist Party who until recently as Spain's interior minister led the fight against ETA, said the announcement "puts an end to decades of broken lives." After that conference -- which did not include representatives from the Spanish government, the Basque regional government or the main opposition party in Spain, the Popular Party -- former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern read a statement calling for ETA to issue a declaration akin to what it made on Thursday. The development "marks the culmination of years of unceasing efforts in the fight against terrorism," he said, as he congratulated Spain on its efforts to combat ETA. Police have cracked down in recent years on ETA in Spain and France, leaving it operationally weak.
