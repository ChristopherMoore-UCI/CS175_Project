The iconic Christmas tree is expected to arrive on a flatbed truck Friday morning and will grace Rockefeller Center in Manhattan when it's officially erected at the end of November. -- Every year Debra Keller would take her granddaughters to New York City to take in the holiday traditions -- going to a show, having lunch at their favorite restaurants, shopping and a visit to the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. The tree, which is approximately 75 years old, was first spotted by the Rockefeller Center team during a routine drive down Interstate-80. The first formal Rockefeller Center tree lighting ceremony was held in 1933 and was decked with 700 lights in front of the then eight-month-old RCA building. The 46-foot-wide tree will be raised at Rockefeller Center Friday morning.
