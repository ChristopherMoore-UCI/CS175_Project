When asked at a press conference if there were any chance the band would play again together "in the flesh," John Paul Jones said only, "Sorry." Jimmy Page suggested that "if (in the five years since the movie was made,) there wasn't a whisper or a hint that we would get together to do something, it seems pretty unlikely, doesn't it?" Jimmy Page on another Led Zeppelin reunion: 'I don't see it' -- This week's New York premiere of Led Zeppelin's forthcoming concert film, "Celebration Day," may have brought out both fans and rock stars, including Mick Jones, Stevie Nicks and Paul Stanley of Kiss, but beyond the 2007 reunion depicted on-screen, don't expect to see the legendary band in concert anytime soon. The concert was a tribute to the group's friend and Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun. From "Stairway to Heaven" and "For Your Life" to "Kashmir" and "No Quarter," Plant's voice is as crisp as ever, Jones tackles the keyboards like few can and Page hasn't lost his touch as what some have called the finest rock guitarist ever. Jones will appear at the Berlin premiere on Monday, while Page will be at the Tokyo premiere Tuesday.
