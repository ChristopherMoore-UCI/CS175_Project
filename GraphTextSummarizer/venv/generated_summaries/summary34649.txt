-- Five years ago, to show her gratitude for U.S. troops serving overseas, teenager Kaylee Radzyminski started sending them donated CDs and DVDs. I know for a fact that we have boxes going to the Horn of Africa, which many people don't know (that) we do have troops there. Radzyminski: Tunes 4 the Troops is part of the Service Learning Center here at the university, so there's basically a staff and student workers who volunteer for community service hours that are able to work on Tunes 4 the Troops. Radzyminski, now 19 and on an Army ROTC scholarship at Tennessee Tech University, spoke with CNN's Danielle Berger about reaching this goal. Tunes 4 the Troops is now based at Tennessee Tech.
