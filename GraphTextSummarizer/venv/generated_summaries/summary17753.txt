-- A coalition of civil rights organizations has filed a motion in federal court seeking to block an Arizona law that requires officers to make immigration checks while enforcing other laws if "reasonable suspicion" of illegal immigration exists. "In a state that's more than 30 percent Latino, requiring police to act as immigration agents is an invitation to racial profiling on a massive scale," Omar Jadwat, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement. Earlier this month, federal officials said they had not seen a change in the number of illegal immigration checks sought by local Arizona police as allowed by the partially upheld law. According to the ACLU, the new evidence shows that lawmakers who supported SB 1070 used false statements and discriminatory language with the intention to impose a statewide practice of racial profiling. The state law allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws, the chief said.
