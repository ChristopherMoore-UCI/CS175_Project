"I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS," Romney said to Jim Lehrer, who moderated the first debate and anchors "PBS Newshour." "We came down to support PBS and to support freedom of speech in our nation's capital," said Jim Brett, who went to Washington with his kids, along with various puppets. "Sesame Street" is produced by Sesame Workshop, which says 93% of its costs are funded by corporate sponsors and licensing. The twist on a popular protest chant echoed Saturday as people marched -- many in costume or with puppets -- in support of public broadcasting. Romney promised to stop funding to the Public Broadcasting Service, home to "Sesame Street" and Big Bird.
