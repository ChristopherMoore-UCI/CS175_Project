A high-school classmate now living in Las Vegas reported seeing Richardson at the Rio Hotel and Casino in early June, sparking the new effort by detectives to check out his report. She said hundreds of similar reports in Los Angeles have failed to pan out, while the man who reported seeing her in the casino hadn't seen her daughter since high school. Last month, Sutton sued Los Angeles County and several sheriff's officials for wrongful death and negligence in her daughter's disappearance, according to court documents. Investigators have spent about six weeks checking out a high-school classmate's report that he saw Mitrice Richardson at a hotel casino, and are "unable to show that it is not a good lead," Los Angeles police Capt. Richardson, who would be 25 now, is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Malibu in the early morning hours of September 17, 2009.
