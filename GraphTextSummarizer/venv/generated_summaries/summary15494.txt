Less than 24 hours after that incident, a flurry of violence in northeastern Nigeria, blamed on Boko Haram, left more than three dozen people dead and may have taken many more lives. "It is difficult to say how many people died in the blasts, but you are talking of dozens of dead people," said resident Babagoni Hassan. Daglun, Maiduguri and Mainok are all in the northeastern Nigeria state of Borno, the site of repeated Boko Haram incursions. Boko Haram is an Islamist militant group that has waged a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, trying to impose its strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law. But Daglun residents, some of whom were forced to flee into the bush from burning homes, said the bombardment caused many more casualties.
