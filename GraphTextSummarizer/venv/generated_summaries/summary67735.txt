-- When U.S. negotiators raise the issue of captured U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl with the Taliban in the coming days, it won't be the first time. While the United States has been pushing for the return of Bergdahl -- captured in June 2009 in Afghanistan -- the Taliban has been pushing for the release of five of its own men from U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay. Senior U.S. officials have also discussed the idea of transferring all five Taliban prisoners to Qatar first, before Bergdahl is freed. In the past, U.S. officials have talked about transferring the Guantanamo detainees in two stages -- perhaps two men first, and then after Bergdahl is released, transferring the remaining three. An American proposal for Bergdahl's release was a topic each time, U.S. officials told CNN in May 2012.
