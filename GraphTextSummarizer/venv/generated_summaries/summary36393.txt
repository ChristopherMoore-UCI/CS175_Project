Facebook is working on a new mobile tool that would make it easier for the VIPs to slog through the noise and better communicate with their fans, according to a report from AllThingsD. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed in an e-mailed statement that the company is working on "mobile features designed to help public figures interact with their fans" and said it was only testing them with a select group of people for now. Some high profile people do use the site to communicate all on their own, as evidenced by the many entertaining late night ramblings and Twitter fights. "Dear Facebook: Put away the red carpet for celebs, we're happy with just friends," wrote Twitter user Tom Flowers. It's common for a social media manager to use the social network on an actor or musician's behalf to post information about public appearances, carefully chosen snapshots and other updates. Twitter has dominated as a platform where the famous can broadcast their latest news and have some casual back and forth with fans.
