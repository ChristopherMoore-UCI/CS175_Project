Where were you and what you were doing when Neil Young first contacted you last year about a Buffalo Springfield reunion? Neil made it clear at the first show -- and certainly this was our understanding going in -- that this was not Neil Young and Buffalo Springfield or Stephen Stills and Buffalo Springfield. With the Richie Furay Band I do a medley of songs that I sang on the first Buffalo Springfield album. Saturday night, Buffalo Springfield will wrap up their seven-date reunion tour with a headlining slot at Bonnaroo. Hours before taking the stage with Buffalo Springfield at the Santa Barbara Bowl tonight, Furay called into Rolling Stone to chat about the tour.
