The Bucs first developed a customized application on the iPad as a draft tool to allow coaches to watch college games while evaluating players involved in the draft, said head coach Raheem Morris. After the success of the draft tool app, the Bucs' owners approved the purchase of 150 iPads and 90 were handed out to players and coaches. One of those developers, Bloomberg Sports, decided to give iPads to professional baseball players so they could review its newly developed app, "Pitch Review," created exclusively for professional baseball players. In the halls of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice facility, players can be seen carrying iPads everywhere they go. While there are still NFL restrictions on how computer tablets can be used, these devices are slowly starting to change the way professional teams operate, offering high-quality video and Internet connectivity almost anywhere.
