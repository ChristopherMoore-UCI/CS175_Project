"I get to marry my best friend!" West and Kardashian have known each other for years, as West told Kardashian matriach Kris Jenner on her talk show in August, and for the Grammy-winning rapper it was love at first sight. After dating publicly for a little over a year and welcoming their first child together, daughter North, in June, West popped the question on Kardashian's 33rd birthday Monday. And that wasn't all: a 50-piece orchestra played Lana Del Rey's "Young and Beautiful" followed by West's own song with Keri Hilson, "Knock You Down," with the whole extravaganza being topped off with fireworks. The artist set up an elaborate surprise at San Francisco's AT&T Park, which he rented out for the proposal and filled with Kardashian's close friends and family members. Kardashian said to E!, which airs her family's reality series, "Keeping Up with the Kardashians."
