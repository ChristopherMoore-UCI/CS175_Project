Is Fox host and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee next? -- Fox News and potential presidential candidate Ben Carson went their separate ways last week. Media Matters, a liberal watchdog group that scrutinizes and criticizes Fox, said Wednesday that "Huckabee has provided just as much evidence he plans to run for president as Carson" and called on Fox to drop Huckabee. Huckabee, who sought the Republican nomination for president in 2008, is clearly considering a second run -- which would mean he'd have to give up his Saturday night show on Fox News. Fox News has been a home for any number of prospective candidates in the past, including Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Sarah Palin.
