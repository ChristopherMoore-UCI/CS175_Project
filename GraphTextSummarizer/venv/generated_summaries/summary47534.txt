"No one expects Hindus to marry in a church, so why are Hindu funerals shoehorned through Chapels of Rest designed like Anglican churches?" Allowing open-air cremations in Britain would also save Hindu families money, Ghai says. Such cremations are sanctioned by Hindu scriptures, according to the Hindu Council UK, which supports Ghai's case. Collins said case law indicates that "burning of dead bodies in the open is not necessarily unlawful" and that the point is arguable in court. He was never prosecuted, but the city council in Newcastle, where Ghai lives, promptly ruled funeral pyres illegal. Davender Ghai, 70, a world-renowned charity advocate in Britain, argued the practice is already legal under British law, but he sought clarification in order to hold such cremations in the future.
