By the end of that fifth year, perhaps in an attempt to save myself, to escape my despair, I started becoming convinced that I had written all I had to write, that I was a minor league Ralph Ellison, a Pop Warner Edward Rivera, that maybe it was time, for the sake of my mental health, for me to move on to another profession, and if the inspiration struck again some time in the future... My novel, which I had started with such hope shortly after publishing my first book of stories, wouldn't budge past the 75-page mark. All the hundreds of failed pages, boxed and hidden in a closet. Five years of my life and the dream that I had of myself, all down the tubes because I couldn't pull off something other people seemed to pull off with relative ease: a novel. Nothing I wrote past page 75 made any kind of sense.
