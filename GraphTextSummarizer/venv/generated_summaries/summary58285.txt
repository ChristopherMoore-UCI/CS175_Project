-- Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, walked out of London's High Court after being freed on bail Thursday, nine days after he was arrested for questioning about alleged sex crimes in Sweden. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, which represented Swedish authorities in the fight over bail, said Thursday that Ny "fully supported" their decision to appeal Tuesday against granting Assange bail. Assange must stay at the mansion of a supporter outside London, report to the police daily, wear an electronic tag to monitor his location, and put up 200,000 pounds (about $310,000) in bail money, plus two 20,000-pound sureties (about $31,000 each), the judge ruled. A judge granted him bail on Tuesday, but lawyers representing Sweden immediately filed an appeal, keeping Assange behind bars until the High Court judge decided on the Swedish appeal. After his arrival at Smith's Ellingham Hall in Suffolk, Assange told reporters that his "highest task" was to continue his work with WikiLeaks.
