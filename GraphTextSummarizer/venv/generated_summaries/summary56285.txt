The public option is the part of our reform effort that will lower costs, improve the delivery of health care services and force insurance companies to offer rates and services that are reasonable. That alternative will do almost nothing to reform health care but will be a windfall for insurance companies. By ending that protection, we will be able to go after insurance companies with federal penalties for misleading advertising or dishonest business practices. But under the Senate plan, millions of Americans will be forced into private insurance company plans, which will be subsidized by taxpayers. Insisting on a government mandate to have insurance without a better alternative to the status quo is not true reform.
