Murdoch found himself in trouble on Twitter over the weekend for apparently referring to Welsh singer Charlotte Church, actor Hugh Grant and television presenter Jacqui Hames as "scumbags" after they met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the potential reform of Britain's media laws. On Saturday, the media baron tweeted: The missive prompted this retort from Church: Hames, a former detective-turned TV presenter who fronted the British crime-fighting program Crimewatch, also demanded an apology, after earlier tweeting: "I've been called worse, but admittedly not by CEO of large multinational corp." Both women, along with actor Hugh Grant -- who is not on Twitter -- have been vocal supporters of Hacked Off, a pressure group that's fighting for "a better press that is answerable to the public it is supposed to serve," according to its website. The inquiry heard from Murdoch and former British Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, along with celebrities, sports stars and even the families of murder victims who claimed that their phones had been hacked by employees of the now defunct, Murdoch-owned newspaper, "News of the World" (NOTW). It's not clear whether Grant attended the meeting, but on October 9 British media reported that Church and Hames met Cameron during the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England. It followed British media reports that suggested the British prime minister might be leaning towards self-regulation.
