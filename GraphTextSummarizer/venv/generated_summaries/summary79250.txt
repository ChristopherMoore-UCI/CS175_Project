" On January 22, Kepner signed up to be a candidate for the medical center's clinical trial for hand transplants. "Based on the results of hand transplants performed so far around the world, just about everyone regains protective sensation, which is the ability to distinguish between hot and cold and feel a pin prick," Lee said. He is expected to remain in the intensive care unit for a week, said Lee,  chief of the division of plastic surgery and professor of surgery and orthopedic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Kepner shows no signs of transplant rejection, Lee said. Despite the risks, Lee said hand transplant recipients regain much of their autonomy.
