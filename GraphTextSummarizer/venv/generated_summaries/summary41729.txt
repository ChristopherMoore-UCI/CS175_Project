-- The suspect in the shooting of a woman killed during a Ku Klux Klan initiation has at least a seven-year history of Klan activity, according to an organization that tracks hate groups nationwide. The Southern Poverty Law Center said it is unaware of any Klan group operating under the name Dixie Brotherhood or Sons of Dixie, names that have surfaced in media reports of Lynch's death. Relatives describe Cynthia Lynch as having a deep need to feel wanted and eager to join groups. Among the seized documents were membership applications, titles and a chain of command for group members George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Jack Strain gave CNN this account of what happened: During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head.
