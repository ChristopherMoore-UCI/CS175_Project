Typhoon Mekkhala was upgraded from a tropical storm and should make landfall in the Philippines at about noon, about an hour after the Mass concluded, just northeast of Tacloban, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Just two weeks ago, a tropical storm struck Tacloban and surrounding area, causing a commercial passenger plane to slide off the runway while landing at the Tacloban airport, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. During the Pope's visit to Tacloban, he will have lunch with survivors of the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, renamed Typhoon Yolanda in that country. Typhoon Mekkhala, which is called Typhoon Amang in the Philippines, was arriving on the island of eastern Samar -- a site about 50 miles from where the Pope was in Tacloban. While all too many people live in dire poverty, others are caught up in materialism and lifestyles which are destructive of family life and the most basic demands of Christian morality," the Pope said in other remarks.
