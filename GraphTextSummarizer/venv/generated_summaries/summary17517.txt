First, it is important to understand that the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- the division of the Labor Department that reports data on unemployment -- is run by career civil servants. Or it would turn out to be inconsistent with the data on unemployment for young people and old people. They would have the problem that this 7.8% number was inconsistent with the data on unemployment rates for whites and African-Americans. The drop in the unemployment rate would not be consistent with other data in the survey. This would require the cooperation of dozens of top people at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
