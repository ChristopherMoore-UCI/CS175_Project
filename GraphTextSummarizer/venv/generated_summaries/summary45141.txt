The group's Facebook page has been targeted with derogatory anti-Muslim comments by the far-right British National Party, while some travel agents have been reluctant to promote the tours due to unease about Islam, said Bowler. During the 10-day or 21-day tours (the "month" in the tour name is slightly misleading, organizers admit), tour members stay in a 400-year-old Sufi lodge in Istanbul's Eyup district, visit the ancient city of Konya to visit the tomb of Sufi mystic Rumi, and admire the ecstatic services of the whirling dervishes who follow his teachings. Bowler, a Thailand-based Australian, has run half a dozen of the tours in recent years, during which participants are taught the basics of Islamic practice, study Islamic history and calligraphy, pray in mosques and live and eat with Muslim families. But Bowler, who has also run "Monk for a Month" tours with Thai Buddhists, and is launching an "Interfaith Express" tour in Turkey focusing on the three Abrahamic faiths, believes there is nothing wrong with the tour's approach to religion. Does it matter?" Reisman-Boukes's experience reflected the aims of the course, which were twofold, said Bowler: to correct the current "low PR of Islam itself, and religion in general."
