Miami Seaquarium is one of the oldest marine parks in the United States, and activists say Lolita's  habitat is not big enough. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will soon add Miami Seaquarium's killer whale, Lolita, to the endangered species list, but nothing will change for the longtime Miami entertainer. Activists say they have a plan to move Lolita from Miami to a privately owned cove at San Juan Island in Washington. " Activists petitioned NOAA to include Lolita to the Southern Resident endangered list, saying they never had the right to separate her from designation for the Seattle killer whale population. PETA says even if Lolita can't be rehabilitated to return to the wild, the Washington state cove is much larger and her former killer whale pods will swim by her open water habitat.
