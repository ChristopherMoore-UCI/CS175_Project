-- Carla Bruni, the wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, has given birth to a girl, a very close family friend told CNN on Wednesday. Sarkozy, 56, was seen earlier leaving the French capital's La Muette clinic, where Bruni gave birth, according to French media. Bruni, a former supermodel and singer, previously dated singers Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger. Bruni, 43, announced in early September that she was pregnant and vowed to keep the child out of the spotlight. Sarkozy divorced his wife of more than 11 years before marrying Bruni.
