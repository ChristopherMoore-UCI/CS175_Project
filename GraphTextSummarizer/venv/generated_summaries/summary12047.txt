The fire began around 11:30 a.m. inside a warehouse located in the Georgia Port Authority's Ocean Terminal, just west off of the city's historic riverfront, said Savannah Fire Department spokesman Mark Keller. -- A huge plume of black smoke soared above the picturesque Georgia city of Savannah on Saturday afternoon, prompting officials to urge people to stay inside to avoid the fumes. "Pretty much (the smoke) is going straight up," said Vern Beaver, a National Weather Service meteorologist in nearby Charleston, South Carolina. If the sight of the large column of rising black smoke wasn't enough, people were being told not to go outside. The Savannah College of Art and Design tweeted that people should avoid the River Street area, a popular spot for tourists filled with restaurants and stores.
