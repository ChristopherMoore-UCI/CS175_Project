Instagram Vows: We Won't Use Your Photos in Ads Last week, Instagram announced that it had changed its TOS, which spurred widespread outrage from users and celebrities -- National Geographic even shut down its account, though it's now posting again. -- A class action lawsuit against Instagram has been filed in San Francisco federal court, following user outrage regarding the mobile photo sharing app's changed Terms of Service. Instagram maintained the mandatory arbitration clause as well as a clause saying it will display ads based on user content. The new rules suggested Instagram would sell users' photos without compensation and introduced a mandatory arbitration clause, which would force users to waive their rights to file a class action lawsuit in most circumstances. This appears to be the first civil lawsuit filed as a result of Instagram's service term changes, Reuters reports.
