Similarly, though Bolt's smashing of the 100 and 200 meter men's world records was spectacular, who could say the athletic success of Ethiopian distance runner Kenenisa Bekele and Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva were less deserving of admiration. In a recent panel discussion with Laureus World Sport Academy members Sean Fitzpatrick, Sebastian Coe, Boris Becker and Michael Johnson, Johnson told CNN anchor Pedro Pinto that Bolt was worthy of his place: "When you look at Usain Bolt, when he first broke the 100 meter record, it was only the fourth time he raced at that distance. The top 10 of Tiger Woods, Roger Federer, Michael Phelps, Michael Schumacher, Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Lance Armstrong, Annika Sorenstam, Kobe Bryant and David Beckham / Zinedine Zidane hold few surprises for sport aficionados, but what of those who did not make the final cut? " Becker also added that it was right for Federer to appear prominently in the list: "After already winning 13 grand slams most tennis players would have been happy, but he went onto to win his first French Open title in 2009 before winning at Wimbledon again. It is a tough call to select the cream of the Noughties' crop, especially in a decade of enthralling sporting achievement, but after much thought, discussion and deliberation the World Sport team have had their say.
