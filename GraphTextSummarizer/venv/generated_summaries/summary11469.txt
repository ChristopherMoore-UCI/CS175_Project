Watch a suicide bomb attack kills 5 U.S. soldiers Â» U.S. and Iraqi military forces plan to pull out of Mosul  to allow Iraqi police to control security in the city. A suicide truck bomber breached the outer security barrier of Iraqi National Police headquarters in southern Mosul, and detonated his explosives, killing eight people and wounding 60 others, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. -- Five U.S. soldiers were killed Friday in a suicide bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul -- the single deadliest attack on U.S. troops in more than a year, the U.S. military said. Last year the U.S. military said Mosul was the last urban stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq. "(That) means we'll need U.S. forces to stay in Mosul.
