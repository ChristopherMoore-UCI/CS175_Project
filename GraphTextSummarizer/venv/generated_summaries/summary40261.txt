Embattled Republican Sen. Pat Roberts is enlisting high-profile GOP leaders to help his re-election chances, including former Senate majority leader and fellow Kansan Robert Dole. The 91-year-old Dole campaigned Monday night in Dodge City with Roberts. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is considering running for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, will attend a fundraiser and public event for Roberts next Monday. He is stepping up his efforts on behalf of Republican candidates, hosting a Florida fundraiser Tuesday for several GOP Senate candidates. The Republican Party is uniting around Pat Roberts because he is the only candidate in this race who will ensure Harry Reid is no longer in control of the Senate," the campaign said.
