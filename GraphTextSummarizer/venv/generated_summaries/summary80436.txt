"We noticed a few audiovisual patterns across comedy videos on YouTube, such as shaky camera motion or audible laughter, which we can automatically detect," Shetty wrote on the Google Research Blog. There's a certain irony to the degree of wonkish jargon needed to explain the things that make us laugh in a blog post from Sanketh Shetty, a Google researcher and member of the Web giant's amusingly titled "Slam Team." First, Google's speech-recognition technology lets it scan videos for cues such as laughter. Always fond of an ambitious algorithm, Google, which owns the Web's top video-sharing site, has set out to try to determine scientifically which videos are the funniest, and what makes them so. Top-ranked videos have made it into what Google is calling its "Comedy Slam."
