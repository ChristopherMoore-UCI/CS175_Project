The negatives of life can be met with a better attitude and fresh perspective. I had just run close to 3 miles with my 24-year-old son, and wishing I had been in better shape to enjoy more activities with my kids when they were younger. I have come to realize that life is too short to needlessly suffer the consequences of inactivity and procrastination. By setting small goals, I feel that I am better able to focus on tasks and am more efficient with the demands of my workday. You are fearfully and wonderfully made; take advantage of that and follow me and the rest of Fit Nation Sassy Six as we work to live the second half of our lives better than the first.
