For years Al Ahly fans were attacked by police as they tried to watch their favorite team play. The two teams maintain a historic rivalry but, briefly, the fans of Ahly and Zamalek -- as well as supporters from other ultras groups -- joined forces in Tahrir Square and in the other cities around Egypt. Death sentences were passed down on a number of Al Masry fans, and some officials were even jailed. In 2007 I met the founders of the Ahlawy, the ultras group of Al Ahly -- Egypt's biggest team and Zamalek's main rival. Meanwhile Egypt is again counting the numbers of the dead.
