There were no injuries, Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee said in an e-mail. Those might be dandy reasons to explain why a man drove his soft-top Mercedes coupe into CNN Center in downtown Atlanta early Friday, but police have a better reason: The driver was allegedly high. CNN's corporate security office declined to comment, and CNN's corporate communications office referred a reporter to Atlanta police, saying it had no information except that the driver traveled down the sidewalk before crashing into the building. The driver, Gerlmy Javon Todd, 22, was traveling near the intersection where CNN's world headquarters is located "when he left the roadway and struck the building" at about 4:15 a.m. "While I don't have additional info at the moment I feel it is safe to say that the car was on the road at some point and then left it," Chafee wrote in a later e-mail.
