Entingh said he never received a notice, but was aware of school authorities telling students, including Nathan, that any gun-related behavior would have serious consequences. In the Columbus City Schools district, where Nathan goes to school, 12 students were expelled because of incidents in the "firearm look-a-likes" category, while 69 students were suspended. A teacher could have talked to him and sat him down, given him detention, but a three days suspension?" Entingh is the father of five children, including Nathan, and he says none of them have ever gotten in trouble at school. Ten-year-old Nathan Entingh doesn't understand why he got suspended from school for three days. " SB 55 also called for schools to "establish strategies to address such behavior that range from prevention to intervention," but Tavares believes schools have opted for punishment strategies instead.
