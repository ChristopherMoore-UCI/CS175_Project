In the South, they were called "slave patrols," and they were paramilitary groups that regularly patrolled slave plantations to make sure restive slaves weren't going to rise up against their white overlords. Since the ghastly massacre of elementary school children at Sandy Hook on December 14, 2012, by a deranged teenager, as of June there were at least 74 school shootings, on school grounds or in schools themselves. Of course, the Supreme Court did an end run in recent years around what the framers of the Bill of Rights actually intended. James Madison and the others who framed this single sentence understood perfectly well that you can't have unregulated mobs running around in the streets with guns. The Southern states were police states designed to keep slaves in check.
