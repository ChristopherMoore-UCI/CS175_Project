-- The 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Liu Xiaobo, a leading Chinese dissident who is serving an 11-year prison term after repeatedly calling for human rights and democratization, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced. Liu's wife, Liu Xia, told CNN she could not wait to visit him in prison in northern China and tell him the news. We hope it will keep the spotlight on the struggle for fundamental freedoms and concrete protection of human rights that Liu Xiaobo and many other activists in China are dedicated to," said Catherine Baber, the deputy Asia-Pacific director at Amnesty International. The president of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Thorbjoern Jagland, said Liu won for his "long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China." Liu, he said, is an "eloquent and courageous spokesman for the advance of universal values through peaceful and non-violent means, including his support for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.
