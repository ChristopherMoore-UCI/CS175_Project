"Ice shelves are sensitive to atmospheric warming and to changes in ocean currents and temperatures," Helmut Rott from the University of Innsbruck said in an statement from the space agency. "The northern Antarctic Peninsula has been subject to atmospheric warming of about 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 Fahrenheit degrees) over the last 50 years -- a much stronger warming trend than on global average, causing retreat and disintegration of ice shelves." It went down to 6,664 square kilometers in February 2002 after several parts broke off, and a month later Larsen B was down to 3,463 square kilometers. Larsen C has so far been stable, the space agency said, though satellites have observed some recent thinning and melting. The space agency says the satellite's observations confirm the vulnerability of the ice shelves to climatic warming.
