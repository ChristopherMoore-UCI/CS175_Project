After decades of conflicting and increasingly convoluted decisions on the use of race as a criterion for university admissions, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the citizens of Michigan could constitutionally ban the use of race and other criteria in the selection of students. It then ruled 5-4, in Grutter v. Bollinger, to uphold race criteria in the admissions process for Michigan Law School. In one case, Gratz v. Bollinger, the court voted 6-3 that the university violated equal protection in the selection of students based on race and other criteria. It was presented with two cases involving the use of race as a criterion in the undergraduate and the law school admissions processes at University of Michigan. Michigan voters responded to the divided results in the Grutter and Gratz cases to bring their own clarity to the area.
