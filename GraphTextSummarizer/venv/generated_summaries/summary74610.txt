" "FC Metalist Kharkiv have been disqualified from UEFA competitions for the 2013/14 season following the conclusion of disciplinary proceedings against the Ukrainian club," the statement read. -- Ukrainian club Metalist Kharkiv have been thrown out of UEFA competitions for a year after European soccer's governing body found them guilty on match-fixing charges. Metalist, who finished runners up in the Ukrainian Premier League, had been drawn to play German side Schalke in the final qualifying stage of the European Champions League. Metalist beat PAOK Thessaloniki in the third qualifying round of the Champions League last week, but the Greek side may now be reinstated. " Earlier this month the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld a decision by the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU) to ban Yevhen Krasnikov -- Metalist's sports director -- from the game for five years in relation to allegations he helped to fix a Ukrainian league game against Karpaty Lviv in 2008.
