Lacoste was also a member of two Davis Cup-winning teams in an era when the competition took on the same prestige as a modern-day soccer World Cup. The scene is set for Guy Forget to lead the nation to Davis Cup victory for the first time in 59 years. "He was very inspirational, not only to me but to a lot of French players," Forget says of Lacoste. "I remember all the letters we got and all the phone calls (from Lacoste) when we won the Davis Cup in 1991," Forget told CNN's Open Court. The Parisian would have been forgiven for walking away from the game at this point, but his unrelenting passion for tennis, and perhaps the heartache suffered from his premature retirement, drove him on to leave a more far-reaching legacy than just a collection of trophies.
