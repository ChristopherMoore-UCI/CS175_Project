Anderson was the lead driver in a re-enactment last summer of Ramsey's journey, when she became the first woman to drive an automobile from coast to coast. Ramsey "fit a category of woman in the early-20th century, late-19th century who was interested in quietly demonstrating that women were as capable as men in many of the things that had been considered manly pursuits," said Drake Hokanson, author of the book "Lincoln Highway: Main Street Across America. "It all came down to a lot of books and manuals and guessing and putting a puzzle back together again with no instructions," Emily Anderson said. Antique car enthusiast Richard Anderson recruited his 34-year-old daughter to drive the 1909 Maxwell DA he and two friends built from parts they scavenged from around the globe, and hand-fabricated when necessary. Millions of women have followed in her tracks, few more precisely than Emily Anderson exactly 100 years later.
