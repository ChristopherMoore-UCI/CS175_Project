-- Mega Millions jackpot winners and Washington state residents Jim and Carolyn McCullar stepped forward on Thursday to claim their half of a $380 million prize during a Washington State Lottery news conference. The ticket in Idaho was sold in Post Falls, near the border with Washington state. " Jim McCullar, 68, had previously worked as a real estate agent from Ephrata, with a population of just more than 6,000 in central Washington. Store manager Geoff Bell told CNN affiliate KREM that the phones began to ring off the hook when news surfaced that the store had sold one of the two winning tickets. As days went by without a winner, residents in the 42 states that take part in the Mega Millions drawing rushed to stores to buy more and more tickets, pushing the jackpot to $380 million, the second-highest in the drawing's history.
