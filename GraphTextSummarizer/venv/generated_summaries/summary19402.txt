" These national treasures are among the millions of cultural artifacts being stored in secure vaults in the Library of Congress' National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, some 90 minutes southwest of Washington. But thanks to new international standards for audio formats -- a 97-kilohertz, 24-bit, broadcast wave file -- audio snippets catalogued here will be playable around the world. "Any physical artifact is just that, a physical artifact," said Mike Mashon, head of the Library of Congress' moving image section. More than 10,000 historical recordings are already available to listeners on the Library of Congress' National Jukebox page. But the federal library has been collecting analog recordings of sound and moving images since the late 1800s: Early film reels from inventor Thomas Edison's lab of the 1890s.
