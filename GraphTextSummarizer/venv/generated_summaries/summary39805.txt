Elsewhere in the EIU rankings, 28 cities saw changes in their rankings with negative livability changes driven by "civil unrest, with the Arab Spring, European austerity and Chinese discontent all contributing," according to the EIU report. The top spots are mostly "mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a relatively low population density," said the EIU. Vienna came a close second while Canadian cities Vancouver and Toronto stayed at third and fourth; Calgary tied with Adelaide for fifth place. The top cities and indeed much of the rankings remained similar to last year, with Australian and New Zealand cities landing five of the top 10 spots. Canadian cities made up another three of the top 10 positions.
