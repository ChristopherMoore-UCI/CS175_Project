-- Federal officials will travel to Standish, Michigan, on Thursday to tour a state prison that could be used to house terror suspects detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. government officials said Wednesday. " Another location often mentioned for housing Guantanamo prisoners is a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Some local officials would like to see Guantanamo prisoners brought there as a way to keep the prison open and preserve jobs in an area with more than 20 percent unemployment. President Obama announced plans early in his presidency to close the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay by January. The prison in Standish, Michigan, is slated for closure but would stay open if Guantanamo detainees are sent there.
