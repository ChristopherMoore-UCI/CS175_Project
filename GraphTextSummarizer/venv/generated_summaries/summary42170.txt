Unless it continues to plummet at this rate (which seems unlikely â€” World War Z and Monsters University provided unexpectedly massive competition), Man of Steel is still on pace to reach the $300 million mark. In second place, the Brad Pitt vehicle World War Z went totally viral with an excellent $66 million debut from 3,607 theaters. The zombie thriller, which reportedly cost over $200 million to produce (Paramount is admitting to $190 million), had a famously troubled production, but thanks to Paramount's relentless marketing campaign (including numerous ads in this year's hugely popular NBA finals), World War Z became the biggest opening of Brad Pitt's career, ahead of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which opened with $50.3 million in 2005. EW: 'World War Z' review World War Z has a long way to go before it can be deemed a success, but its great box office debut and surprisingly strong reviews have wiped away much of the stigma that surrounded the project. According to Fandango, 87 percent of people who purchased a ticket to World War Z said that the film's much-reported production struggles had zero effect on their decision to go.
