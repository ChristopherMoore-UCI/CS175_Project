A Swedish diplomat in Iran was arrested and accused of participating in Iranian protests during observances surrounding the Muslim holy day of Ashura, two semi-official news agencies reported Sunday, citing members of Iran's parliament. "According to witnesses and evidence, several foreign embassies in Tehran played a role behind the scenes and were represented [on the scene on that day] by their charg√©s d'affaires and other diplomats," Elahian said. Its observance in Iran was marked by anti-government protests. He was arrested by Iranian officials who considered his presence at the demonstration to be an interference in international affairs, Elahian told Fars. "Based on the law and international norms, diplomats cannot be detained or arrested," Alaedin Boroujerdi, a member of the Iranian parliamentary National Security Committee, told Mehr.
