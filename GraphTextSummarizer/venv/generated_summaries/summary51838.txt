The Williams team has called on Formula One bosses to review the safety-car rules after Sunday's controversial European Grand Prix in Spain. "From a personal perspective, I was in favor of the old system when you could duck and dive into the pits under the safety car in order to win advantage, but I also appreciate that the current rules are there to promote safety." Confusion surrounded the Canadian Grand Prix after Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher passed Alonso during the end of lap 78 while the safety car was still on the track. " "That is a very serious and unacceptable event that creates dangerous precedents, throwing a shadow over the credibility of Formula One." Nine drivers were given post-race penalties for speeding while the safety car was on duty following a horrific crash involving Red Bull's Mark Webber, who was lucky to escape the incident unhurt.
