I may disagree with Representative Scalise but a racist he is not. "While it is sometimes fun to see Republicans in trouble, you'd be wrong to blame Representative Steve Scalise for being racist on account of addressing a meeting of European-American Unity and Rights Organization 'EURO' in 2002," Johnston, who is now a lobbyist in Washington, said in a statement. But the fast rising career of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who was tapped as House Majority Whip this summer, may not be in the ditches just yet. It turns out Scalise addressed an anti-Semitic, white supremacist group back in 2002 run by none other than David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Klu Klux Klan who is well-known in Scalise's home state of Louisiana because of several statewide campaigns for governor and senator. And Scalise is touting his Catholic faith as a reason he wouldn't associate with white supremacists.
