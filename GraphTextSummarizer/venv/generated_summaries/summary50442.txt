-- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, just back from a secret trip to Argentina unknown to his staff or his wife, admitted Wednesday he has carried on an extramarital affair with a woman in Buenos Aires, Argentina. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford chokes up on Wednesday as he admits to having an affair. "The news revealed today hurts all of us who have gotten to know Gov. Sanford over the years and so it is with regret that the RGA accepted Gov. Sanford's resignation as chairman," Barbour said in a statement. "While this news is deeply disappointing, I also know it's important to remain focused on the future and Gov. Sanford's resignation allows him and us to do just that." Shortly after Sanford's announcement, Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, issued a statement saying, "Our thoughts and prayers are with Gov. Sanford and his family, and I wish them the best as they try to heal this wound." "I'm deeply disturbed that no one knew where Gov. Sanford was over the last five days," state Sen. Harvey Peeler said in a statement, adding: "We cannot let the governor's personal life overshadow his public responsibility, or in this case, his negligence of gubernatorial authority.
