Diamond said the comments made at the hearing had had "a terribly unfair impact" upon his reputation, a reputation which Diamond said was "of paramount concern to me." He added: 'I look forward to discussing this issue with you further if you wish to do so." Yet those close to the parliamentary body say it is unlikely Diamond will have a second chance to put on a polished appearance because the committee is due to be reshuffled next week. In a letter obtained by CNN from Diamond to UK Treasury Select Committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie dated July 10, the 60-year-old American-born banker seemed keen to get a second chance to speak. CNN can also reveal that those very same regulators will now be called to testify next week alongside a key Barclays executive, who Diamond said had mistakenly told traders to lower their submissions to the London Interbank Offered Rate -- or Libor. " Bob E. Diamond Jr's letter to Treasury Select Committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie July 10, 2012 Dear Mr Tyrie, Having watched the Committee's session today I was dismayed that you and some of your fellow Committee members appear to have suggested that I was less than candid with the Committee last week. -- Former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond has hit back at British lawmakers who suggested he misled them over concerns voiced by the country's financial regulators.
