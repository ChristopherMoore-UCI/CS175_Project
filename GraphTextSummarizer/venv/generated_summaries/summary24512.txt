Consumer groups are lobbying Congress to include better protection for credit card holders, demanding legislation to prevent what they call unjustified interest charges and deceptive practices, especially in light of the massive financial bailout now being considered. -- As an account manager for credit card giant MBNA, Cate Colombo spent four years speaking to customers, answering questions about interest rates and waiving late fees. But it's opposed by the banking industry and the White House, which said it would lead to less access to credit and higher interest rates for consumers. " Bank of America told CNN, "Only customers in good standing and with good payment history are able to access cash up to available credit line." Americans for Fairness in Lending, which put CNN in touch with Colombo and Ellingwood, wants deceptive credit card practices included in the financial bailout legislation that is now before Congress.
