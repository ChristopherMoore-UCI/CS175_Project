In his capacity as ambassador for the recent HSBC Sevens World Series tournament in Wellington, Lomu was given a hero's welcome at the New Zealand capital's Westpac Stadium. "My bloodstream was septic and the doctors were starting to think the worst: that my kidney had failed and my body was in total meltdown," Lomu, who on the waiting list for a new transplant, revealed last year. Kenya -- a relative rugby backwater -- shocked the rugby world by beating New Zealand in the semifinals at last year's Wellington Sevens. But at the same time the fans make what sevens is all about," Lomu tells CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. " From 1994-2002, Lomu ran in a total of 37 tries in 63 appearances for New Zealand in an international career interrupted and eventually prematurely curtailed by a life-threatening kidney condition.
