The Canadian woman who was rescued last week after being stranded and alone for 49 days in a Nevada wilderness was upgraded to good from fair condition Tuesday, an Idaho hospital spokesman said. Rita Chretien, 56, is tolerating solid food very well, continuing her physical therapy and showing high spirits, according to a statement by St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center in Twin Falls, Idaho. Rita Chretien lived off the little food she had -- beef jerky, some trail mix, fish oil pills and one piece of hard candy per day. "She is enjoying solid foods and had a dinner of salmon, rice and green beans last night," the spokesman's statement said Tuesday. Scores of men and women had searched for the Chretiens since the Penticton, British Columbia, residents were last seen March 19 leaving a Shell gas station convenience store in Baker City, Oregon.
