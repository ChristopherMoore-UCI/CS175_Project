Gorillas can fetch up to $20,000 on the black market, the head of Virunga National Park said. It is not clear if the young gorilla's mother is alive or dead, park spokeswoman Samantha Newport said. The gorilla is a lowland eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), also known as the Grauer's Gorilla, a subspecies of Eastern Gorilla only found in the forests of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the park. "We must remember that for each trafficked baby gorilla, several gorillas have probably been killed in the wild." The gorilla, thought to be about two years old, was hidden at the bottom of a bag and covered with clothes when Congolese Wildlife Authority officers arrested the suspected trafficker on Sunday, Virunga National Park said.
