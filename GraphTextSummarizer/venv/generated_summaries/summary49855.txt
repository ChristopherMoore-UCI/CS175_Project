The mother-of-two was paying $3,000 a month to rent an apartment in another part of north London when she decided to give it up for life on the water. Alan Wildman, of the UK's Residential Boat Owners' Association, pours cold water on the idea. In nearby Amsterdam, pavement life spills onto the intricate network of canals, home not just to residential boats, but a huge array of hotel vessels, and the world's only floating flower market. There are around 30,000 to 40,000 people living on boats in the UK, estimates Wildman. " Long-term moorings in London can be over $30,000 a year -- "and that's just for somewhere to hang your boat," adds Wildman.
