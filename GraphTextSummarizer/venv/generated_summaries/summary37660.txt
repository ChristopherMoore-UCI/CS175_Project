"Thanks to the leadership and determined action of our Fire Department, the very real potential of severe damage to other homes, businesses and structures in the neighborhood was avoided." -- Half of the firefighters on duty in San Francisco on Tuesday night were battling a blaze at a construction site that is threatening nearby buildings, authorities said. Officials evacuated "several hundred" residents who live across the street from the blaze, said Mindy Talmadge of the San Francisco Fire Department. Authorities said the entire structure will likely collapse due to a combination of water used on the blaze and damage. "The city and the Red Cross will work closely with any displaced residents of nearby homes," Lee said.
