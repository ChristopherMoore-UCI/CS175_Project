New York relatives In Brooklyn in New York City, where Carey's mother and one of her four sisters live, a neighbor reported seeing the suspect Tuesday picking up her daughter. A few months after her daughter was born, Miriam Carey was diagnosed with postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister told CNN's AC360. The source told CNN that Carey left a letter addressed to the boyfriend at her apartment and that it appeared to contain white powder. Earlier, sources said investigators found medications, but that proved later not to be accurate. Carey's Facebook page includes a map pinpointing Stamford and New York.
