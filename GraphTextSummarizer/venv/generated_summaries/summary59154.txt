All of those brick-and-mortar retail stores also will carry the phone, along with select Apple-approved retailers -- which as of Friday morning had not been listed by Apple. -- The iPhone 4S -- Apple's newest creation -- quietly went on pre-sale at 12 a.m. on Friday. Pre-sale orders can be placed at Apple's online store, as well as on AT&T, Verizon and Sprint's websites. The homepage of the company's website, however, remained a dedication to the company's co-founder, Steve Jobs, who died on Wednesday after a history of pancreatic cancer. The new iPhone will be available in 22 additional countries by the end of October, Apple says.
