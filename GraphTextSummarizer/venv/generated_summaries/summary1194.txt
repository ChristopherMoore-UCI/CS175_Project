Appalled by tales of pet owners compelled to hand over their cats and dogs to shelters, King formed her organization in 2008 in an effort to provide cash-strapped owners a way to keep their canine and feline friends. "People sometimes just cry because they need help." But King, also the pet food bank's executive director, said that unlike traditional food banks, her group doesn't typically benefit from a resource boost around the holidays. "I've had people say to me, 'I'm down to my last half bag (of pet food) and I don't know what to do,'" King said. "Rescue Bank is doing for pets what the food bank network has successfully done for people in this country for more than 40 years," said Debra Fair, vice president at Mars Petcare US. Food banks across the country kicked into high gear for the holiday season this week in an effort to feed America's hungry.
