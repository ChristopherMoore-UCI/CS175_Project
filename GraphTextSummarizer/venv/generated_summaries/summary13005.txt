Explaining Obama's speech Obama, the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term, used a pair of Bibles in Monday's ceremony -- one from Abraham Lincoln, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago, when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama's historic first inauguration. Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its "never-ending journey" to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him. For his second term, Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation's immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy, proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals, and oversee the implementation of Obamacare. "It's the second inauguration for Obama, and it's pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era, that we're here," Don King said.
