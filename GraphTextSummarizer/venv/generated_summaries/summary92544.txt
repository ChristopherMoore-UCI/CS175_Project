" Researchers have suggested that creating video games with three-dimensional information could be used to help children and adults with eye misalignment problems achieve improved stereo vision, McKee said. Bridgeman's case reminds experts of Susan Barry, neurobiologist at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, who wrote a book called "Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey Into Seeing in Three Dimensions" about how she gained stereo vision. Since a BBC article appeared about Bridgeman last year, he's gotten numerous e-mails from others with stereo vision problems. Other experts say the vivid 3-D movie could have indeed jolted Bridgeman's visual system in this way, but that it wouldn't work as a quick fix for most people with eye alignment problems. After viewing "Hugo," Bridgeman read up on research on the neuroscience of vision to come up with a possible explanation of what happened.
