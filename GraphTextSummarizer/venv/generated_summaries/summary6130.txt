The Inaugural Ball was split between two floors in the building, and attendees were not allowed to go from floor to floor. On Sunday night, they included the Red, White and Blue Ball headlined by Lynyrd Skynyrd; the Hip Hop Ball, chaired by Russell Simmons with appearances by 2 Chainz, John Legend, Eva Longoria and Swizz Beatz; and the "Latino In Performance" and "Let Freedom Ring!" galas at the Kennedy Center. -- After celebrating his second inauguration with a throng estimated at about 800,000, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama spent the evening at more intimate affairs: 30,000 guests at two inaugural balls. President Bill Clinton's second inauguration in 1997 holds the record for most balls with 14. The Obamas dashed around Washington to 10 balls in 2009, but like many things in his second inauguration -- smaller crowds, shorter lines, shorter speeches -- the number was reduced.
