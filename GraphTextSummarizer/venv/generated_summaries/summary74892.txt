A strike from Slovenian captain Robert Koren in the 79th minute found the net after the Algerian goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi made a clumsy attempt at parrying the ball away. Until Ghezzal's sending-off, Algeria looked the better of the two teams, showing more initiative going forward than the more defensively-minded Slovenian team. CNN's World Sport blog Slovenia's only chance of the half came moments before interval when midfielder Valter Bisra fired a fierce shot on target, but it was easily tipped over by Chaouchi. Ghezzal, a striker, had replaced Rafik Djebbour after 59 minutes and almost immediately received his first booking for tugging on Slovenian defender Marco Suler's shirt. Algeria came close in the 36th minute when defender Rafik Halliche narrowly headed wide from a corner.
