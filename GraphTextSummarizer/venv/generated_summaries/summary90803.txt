" For her part, Carlina Renae White, had nursed a nagging feeling that she was raised by a family to which she did not belong, said Ernie Allen from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Carlina was admitted in the hospital and White went home to rest. The woman on the other end of the line said she was Carlina, and she sent White a picture taken in 1987. "Carlina was a missing link," Pat Conway, Carlina White's aunt, told CNN affiliate WABC as she raised her hands in the air.
