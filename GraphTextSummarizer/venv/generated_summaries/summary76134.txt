A judge ruled that William Marotta must pay child support, even though he says he signed documents waiving his parental rights. Had a physician carried out the insemination, that would not be the case, because Marotta would be able to document that he was a sperm donor and not the lover of the girl's mother, CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said. The state contacted Marotta for child support. It is also asking Marotta to pay child support, which could run into tens of thousands of dollars, he said. Shawnee County District Court Judge Mary Mattivi said on Wednesday that Marotta failed to conform to Kansas law, which says a licensed physician must be involved in an artificial insemination process, court documents show.
