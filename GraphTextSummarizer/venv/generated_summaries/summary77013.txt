The two neo-Nazi activities the FBI referred to in January occurred in nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho -- one on the King holiday and another three days earlier. Harpham lived alone in a mobile home or modified mobile home on a 10-acre tract in rural Stevens County, and the closest large city is Colville, Washington, Ormsby said. -- Authorities have a suspect in custody in connection with a backpack bomb found in January along a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade route in Spokane, Washington, according to Michael Ormsby, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Washington. " During the evening of the holiday, about 15 neo-Nazis demonstrated outside the Human Rights Education Institute in downtown Coeur d'Alene. The Coeur d'Alene area had been a hotbed of neo-Nazi activity through the Aryan Nations and Order II hate groups since at least the 1970s, though the groups were disbanded through criminal convictions and civil lawsuits by 2000, said Tony Stewart, one of the founders of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations in Coeur d'Alene.
