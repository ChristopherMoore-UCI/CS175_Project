-- Lionel Messi scored his 19th consecutive league goal on Saturday setting another La Liga record as Barcelona drew 2-2 at relegation-threatened Celta Vigo. This shows how great this player is," said Barcelona assistant coach Jordi Roura. Malaga warmed up for their Champions League clash with reigning German champions Borussia Dortmund with a 3-1 away to Rayo Vallecano. The visitors were back on level terms five minutes later thanks to a Cristian Tello strike and when Messi slotted home with 17 minutes remaining Barcelona looked odds-on for all three points. The result means Barcelona remain 13 points clear at the top.
