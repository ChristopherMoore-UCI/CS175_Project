-- Longtime film critic Roger Ebert, who lost much of his jaw to thyroid cancer, will show off his new face -- thanks to a prosthesis -- when his PBS show debuts this weekend. According to "Entertainment Tonight," the Chicago Sun-Times critic is producing and will appear in brief segments in his new show "Roger Ebert Presents At the Movies," which launches on PBS stations nationwide. The process of crafting the silicone prosthesis and matching it to his face and features took about two years, Ebert said. Since the cancer, Chicago-based Ebert, 68, has been unable to speak or eat conventionally. "That's not to fool anyone, because my appearance is widely known," said Ebert, who appeared with the late Gene Siskel on a movie review show for more than 20 years.
