"This will be a very different court," said Justice Anthony Kennedy. "I was given a note that had been written by someone sitting in the audience one day in the courtroom, and it said, 'Dear Justice O'Connor, I've been in the audience watching the court today, and I noticed that you did not have a judicial collar. Justices on the Supreme Court say they are like a family, and change is sometimes difficult. "There were very few robes available," said retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor who joined the court in 1981 as the first female justice.
