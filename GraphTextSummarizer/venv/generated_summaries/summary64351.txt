Judging by its success, with statistics pointing to more goals coming from free kicks and less time needed to take them, the little spray cans are set to be a permanent addition to the back pockets of referees for many years to come. -- It's been a World Cup notable for late drama in most of the matches and a high number of goals scored, particularly in the preliminary stages. The brainchild of a former amateur player from Brazil, with a German-sounding name, Heine Allemagne, it was used as first used as far back as 2000 in a junior football tournament in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. But for some, the real star of Brazil 2014 comes in a small spray can, a "magic foam" which allows referees to make sure players retreat the requisite 10 yards (9.15 meters) when a free kick is awarded against them. It has also been used to mark the exact location of a free kick, stopping players from gaining an advantage by edging forwards nearer the goal.
