Most Americans believe the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 should continue, but roughly half the country thinks the arduous search is being conducted in the wrong place, according to a new national poll. After failing to find any wreckage or debris on the ocean surface, authorities last week announced the suspension of aerial searches to focus efforts instead on 60,000 square kilometers of the ocean floor, a process that could take six to eight months. As to the possible causes of the plane's disappearance, Americans have a open mind, with some sort of action on the part of the plane's pilots or crew the most likely possibility. Some two-thirds of respondents say it is very likely (26%) or somewhat likely (40%) that the disappearance was due to actions taken by the pilots or crew members. Fewer Americans -- about 42% -- think hijackers may have been involved, while 9% believe that space aliens or beings from another dimension were involved.
