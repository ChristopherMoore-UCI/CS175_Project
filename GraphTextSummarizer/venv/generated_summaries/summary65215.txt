Likewise, passing laws provides no guarantee girls will be protected unless they have community support: 158 countries have set the legal age for marriage at 18 years but the laws are simply ignored by communities where marrying children and adolescent girls is common practice. -- Nine of the 10 countries with the world's highest rates of child marriage are in Africa: Niger, Chad and Central African Republic, Guinea, Mozambique, Mali, Burkina Faso and South Sudan, and Malawi. We need to show community leaders examples of girls who have stayed in school, learned skills, and have helped develop their local economies. But in traditional Maasai communities like mine, marrying off girls is very common. Our traditional values dictate girls are meant for marriage, and when the men decide we are biologically ready, we are married.
