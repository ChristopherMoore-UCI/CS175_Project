The tweets generated headlines around the world, as well as criticism and mockery on Twitter, with firebrand liberal TV host Keith Olbermann frantically tweeting to many individual Twitter users that Obama is fine. -- FoxNews.com alerted the Secret Service on Monday about the apparent hacking of its Twitter feed for political news, after the feed was used to falsely report that President Obama was killed. "While Twitter does monitor accounts for brute-force login attempts and similar methods of attack, we're unable to anticipate compromises that take place due to offsite behavior," Twitter spokesman Matt Graves said in its statement. "Hackers sent out several malicious and false tweets claiming that President Obama had been assassinated," it said. That message encouraged Twitter users to repost the message on their own Twitter accounts, which would spread the fake news.
