The monsoon rains, which last through September but would normally be at their heaviest in July and early August, not only provide rain for agriculture and hydroelectric power, but serve as a natural coolant, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. By dawn, many backup power systems had run out of fuel; power was partially restored after about six hours, authorities said. " India -- the world's fourth-largest consumer of electricity -- relies on coal for much of its energy but also uses hydroelectric power, which has been affected by the diminished monsoon rains. Several hours later, by 9:30 p.m., power had been largely restored, the Power Grid Corporation of India reported on its website. Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who has ordered an investigation into Monday's outage, said it had been a decade since an entire grid last failed in north India.
