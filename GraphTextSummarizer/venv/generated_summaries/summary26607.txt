In a dissenting opinion, Justice Karen R. Baker wrote that the ruling flies in the face of rulings in other states, including Texas, Florida, Delaware and Idaho, finding that giving discretion to corrections officials does not violate state separation of powers provisions. The court also lifted an injunction imposed by the circuit judge prohibiting state officials from acquiring execution chemicals "by any means that violates state or federal law," according to the Supreme Court ruling. The ruling partially affirms a decision by the Pulaski County Circuit Court judge who found the law unconstitutional on grounds that it granted too much discretion to corrections authorities in determining the cocktail of chemicals used in executions. Since, shortages of the drugs have disrupted executions in several states, including Texas and Arizona. "I will review what the options are, talk to the attorney general and key legislative leaders and will study the way other states have handled these rulings.
