On Sunday, Alex Rodriguez hit his 536th homer, tying Yankee Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle for having the 13th most homers ever. -- The wife of New York Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez filed for divorce Monday morning in Florida's Miami-Dade County Family Court. Reports have linked Alex Rodriguez, nicknamed A-Rod, with pop icon Madonna and Cynthia with rock star Lenny Kravitz. Rodriguez also landed the most lucrative contract in baseball history with a $250 million-plus 10-year salary with the Texas Rangers in 2001, which was extended by the Yankees. Lawyers representing Cynthia Rodriguez say she has officially filed for divorce from Yankees slugger A-Rod.
