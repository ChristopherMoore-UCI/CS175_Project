The department continues to warn American citizens against traveling to Ivory Coast despite the arrest of former President Laurent Gbagbo, who defied calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost a presidential election in November to Alassane Ouattara. The statement claims there are continued reports of lawlessness in various neighborhoods of Abidjan, the nation's largest city and commercial center. -- The U.S. Embassy consular section in Abidjan may reopen Monday, but it initially will provide limited services, according to the State Department. Ouattara has been recognized internationally as the legitimate winner. A violent power struggle followed the standoff, with supporters loyal to both sides taking to the streets in protests since December.
