Ziemann, who is also accused of misdemeanor sexual assault and battery, faces arraignment on October 5. A Calumet County Circuit Court Judge issued the ruling Tuesday after hearing from the alleged victim, who spent about 90 minutes on the witness stand describing his ordeal, attorney Rob Bellin said. The man, who has a criminal record in Wisconsin dating back to 1998, is in custody on unrelated charges of child abuse, theft and harassment.
