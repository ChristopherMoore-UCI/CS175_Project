Weinstein told CNN's Piers Morgan on Friday night that he can't in good good conscience advocate against on-screen violence while promoting movies that some claim revel in it. In this case, the Mr. Smith role -- of a U.S. senator who goes toe-to-toe with the NRA -- will be played by Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep. While he has no problems with real-to-life films like "Lone Survivor," the current hit chronicling a team of Navy SEALs in Afghanistan, the producer vowed, "I'm not going to make some crazy action movie just to blow up people and exploit people." Weinstein recalled calls to action to address gun violence in the wake of such mass shootings, only to have that momentum seemingly fade after a few days. He characterized the resistance to gun control in the United States as a byproduct of the big business of the gun industry.
