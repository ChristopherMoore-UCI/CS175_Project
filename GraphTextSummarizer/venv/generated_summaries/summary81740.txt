The seven-year-old mother, Shin Shin, had given birth to the baby after conceiving naturally, a first in Japan and a rare feat among the bears who have a low birth rate and are usually bred in zoos using artificial insemination. China leased the mother, Shin Shin, and her mate, Ri Ri, to Japan in early 2011 for a fee of $1 million per year. After the cub's birth, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry said the newborn could promote better relations between China and Japan. Its death worsened the strained relations between China and Japan at the time over the islands, which are called Diaoyu in Chinese. Shortly before the cub was born, Shintaro Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo, sparked outrage in China by suggesting the cub be named "Sen Sen" or "Kaku Kaku" -- both in reference to Senkaku, the Japanese name of disputed islands lying 120 miles east of Taiwan that are a prominent source of tension between the two countries.
