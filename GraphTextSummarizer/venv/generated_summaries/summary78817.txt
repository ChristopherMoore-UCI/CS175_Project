Other academic hubs that made the cut are Ann Arbor, Michigan (No. 4), Boulder, Colorado (No. 5), Gainesville, Florida (No. 8) and Columbia, South Carolina (No. 15). The rankings were determined by compiling the number of books, magazines and newspapers bought by Amazon customers in both print and Kindle format since June 1, 2011, and dividing that number by the city's population to determine the number of units sold on a per-capita basis, Amazon said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Amazon customers in the home of Harvard and MIT bought the most books in the business and investing category. The list is full of university cities, like Berkeley, California, which came in third, with purchases of travel books at the top of customers' lists. The formula explains why some of the nation's largest cities, like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, did not make the list, while cities that don't normally appear on top-20 lists did.
