In Lincoln County, a swiftwater rescue team saved two people found hanging Sunday onto a tree after their canoe tipped over in Lincolnton, North Carolina, according to emergency mangement spokesman Dion Burleson. The drownings happened Saturday after 4 inches of rain fell over five hours, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in Catawba County. Delilah Lovett, 10, of Charlotte and Juan Alberdi, 48, of Huntersville -- members of different families who were visiting the area together -- were both swimming in what is known as the "bathtub" on Wilson's Creek in Caldwell County around 6:15 p.m., the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office said. Search and rescue crews found Alberdi on Sunday, about a quarter mile north of where they were first told he went into the water, according to LouAnne Kincaid, a spokeswoman for Caldwell County. The heavy rains inundated area interstates, leaving cars stranded and traffic backed up for miles.
