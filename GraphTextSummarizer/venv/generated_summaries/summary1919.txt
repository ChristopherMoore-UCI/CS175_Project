Waldman: Zimmerman case echoes issues of race, guns There was a time in this nation's history, not so very long ago, when black America looked to the courts, particularly its federal courts, for justice, and received it, most notably in the area of civil rights. But for black America, Trayvon Martin is the latest name on a long list of African-American men and boys whose non-black killers escaped justice in America's courts -- a list that runs from Emmett Till to Amadou Diallo to Oscar Grant to Sean Bell. Like the fictional defendant in the film, black America knows all too well that in this country, the promise of equal justice for all is often a hollow one. In truth, when black boys and men are killed by non-blacks, more often than not, justice will not be served. Black America's belief in the possibility of receiving justice from our legal system is eroded by every verdict that fails to hold a killer who is not black accountable for the death of a black man or boy.
