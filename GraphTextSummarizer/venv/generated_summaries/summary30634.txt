Tomb of ancient Egypt's beer maker to the gods of the dead discovered Space archaeologist unlocks secrets of ancient civilizations Mystery surrounds Egyptian sphinx unearthed in Israel "Continued work in the royal tombs of the Abydos Dynasty promises to shed new light on the political history and society of an important but poorly understood era of Ancient Egypt," said Wegner. The discovery shows that during a fractured period of time around 1600 B.C. during which the north and south of the Nile were split into rival kingdoms, there was a middle kingdom that may have survived for several generations. A newly found pharaoh's tomb in Egypt has historians scrambling to rewrite the chronicles of the ancient kings of the Nile. Wegner suspects there will be much more evidence to uncover at the sprawling site buried under the hot Egyptian sand.
