The firefighter didn't recognize his daughter's body at the time, police chief Bill Quigley told local newspaper The Union Leader. The mangled body of a dying woman he removed from the crushed SUV in the town of Brookline was his own daughter, CNN affiliate WMUR reported, citing police. The town of 4,000 holds Hamilton and Whitcomb in high regard, Quigley said. Hamilton, 30, died of her injuries caused when another vehicle struck hers from behind, pushing it into the opposing lane of traffic, where a third car collided with hers head on, Quigley told WMUR. Ellworth Austin said he knew both the volunteer firefighter, Steve Whitcomb, and the daughter, Katie Hamilton.
