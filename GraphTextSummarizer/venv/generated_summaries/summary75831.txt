-- An SUV slammed into a Cadillac, sending it through the front wall of a Kansas City day care center Tuesday, seriously injuring three children in the building, officials in the western Missouri city said. Workers on Tuesday afternoon were trying to shore up the front of the building to ensure it wouldn't collapse, Rotert said. The incident started, police say, with the SUV rear-ending the car outside the child care center on 27th Street in central Kansas City. The crash left a gaping hole in the front of Christian Academy Child Care, where about 40 children were when the Cadillac punched through around 1 p.m. (2 p.m. CT), Kansas City police Capt. Officials believed that all children have been accounted for, "but we are still searching," Grant said Tuesday afternoon.
