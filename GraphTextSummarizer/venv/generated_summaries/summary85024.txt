Meanwhile, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its daily update on H7N9 cases that a total of 109 H7N9 cases have been reported within mainland China, including 23 deaths. A 53-year-old Taiwanese man who worked in eastern China was confirmed to have H7N9 on Wednesday, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control said. Most cases have been confined to Shanghai and neighboring provinces in eastern China. Fukuda's warning came as Taiwanese health authorities said they've confirmed the first human case of H7N9 in Taiwan -- one they said was imported from China. Taiwanese health officials said they are screening travelers arriving from China for signs of H7N9.
