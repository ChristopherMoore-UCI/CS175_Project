Historian Simon Schama and journalist George Packer told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that U.S. policy toward Afghanistan has drifted as the Obama administration has tried to focus on domestic priorities. -- U.S. President Barack Obama has waited too long to address the instability in Afghanistan, putting at risk the efforts to stabilize the troubled country, a pair of authors said Monday. Packer faulted the White House for concentrating on domestic issues, including health care reform and U.S. economic stability, and for the president failing to give a major speech on Afghanistan since March 2009, a silence that allowed public attention to slip. "Obama has to make the case that we need 100,000 American troops in Afghanistan, which is what it will be after this surge, in order to protect our own streets from al Qaeda," said George Packer, staff writer for The New Yorker magazine and author of the "Interesting Times" blog and several books.
