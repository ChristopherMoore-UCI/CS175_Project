Larijani was referring to the well-publicized case of Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani, who faces the possibility of execution after being convicted in 2006 of adultery. Through human rights activist Mina Ahadi, Sajjad Mohammedie Ashtiani said she would be satisfied only when Iran's judiciary officially drops the charges against her. Iran's top human rights official said the Islamic regime is reviewing a sentence of execution by stoning for a woman convicted of adultery. But Larijani said protests from outside Iran will not affect Ashtiani's case. Larijani's comments seemed to contradict Iran's first public statement on the case made Thursday by the Iranian Embassy in London, England, which suggested Ashtiani would not be stoned.
