In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Saudi king said Britain failed to act on information provided by Saudi security services ahead of the suicide bombings on London's transport network in July 2005 that killed 52 people and injured more than 770. There have also been allegations by Policy Exchange, a think tank, that organizations linked to the Saudi authorities have promoted Islamic fundamentalist literature in UK mosques. Human rights groups have called on the UK government to react to allegations about the treatment of women and the gay community in the Saudi kingdom, while other protesters have attacked the failure of the Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribes surrounding arms deals. Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown met the king at London's Horseguards Parade parade ground, ahead of a full state banquet at Buckingham Palace. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi Arabian counterpart in London Monday, but the Foreign Office insisted it was for personal reasons and not a snub.
