Another woman told CNN affiliate WCCO that she "didn't really know what was going on" when stores unexpectedly began closing down but soon saw police "pushing us all away from Nordstrom (department store). " "Unfortunately, as we have witnessed at shopping sites across the country this week, large groups of individuals can come together and create bad situations," mall officials said in a statement. Police and security officers at the Mall of America arrested a mix of young adults and juveniles after a food-court fight around 4 p.m. Monday broke up into brawls elsewhere in the shopping center, Bloomington Police Department Commander Mark Stehlik said. It says it has more than 520 stores, 50 restaurants and attractions that include an aquarium, flight simulator and a spa for children. Some witnesses told WCCO the fights began after reports that rappers Lil' Wayne and Drake were visiting the mall.
