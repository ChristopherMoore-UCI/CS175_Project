The British Foreign Office has filed two amicus briefs in U.S. federal courts in Carty's case, which complain that Britain was not notified of her original arrest, said a Foreign Office spokesman who declined to be named, in line with policy.

Last year, Carty recorded a seven-minute message pleading for her life. Linda Carty, 52, has made a public plea to British citizens, asking them and human rights groups to intervene and win her clemency. -- A British woman on death row in Texas, convicted of murdering a young mother, had her latest appeal set aside by the Supreme Court.
