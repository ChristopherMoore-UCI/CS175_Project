The Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shiite Islam that dominates Syrian leadership; Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is an Alawite. The clashes were between Lebanese Alawites who support the Syrian government and Sunni Muslims who oppose it. The majority of the Sunnis in Tripoli loathe the Syrian regime, but the Alawites in northern Lebanon thrived during the Syrian presence. Lebanon dispatched troops Friday to quell clashes that arose in the city of Tripoli over the Syrian crisis. Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on TV that Lebanese army reinforcements went to two neighborhoods to "put an end to what happened."
