Bieber didn't use foul language,Thompson said, as he allegedly did with police in Miami when he was arrested there early Wednesday. Bieber asked after a dozen deputies woke him up at 8 a.m. on January 14, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson told CNN Friday. "We do search warrants to collect evidence, but this is a person who's been wreaking havoc on the neighborhood, who's been operating, basically, with impunity because he hasn't spoken to us in the past about anything that went on." Bieber apparently didn't take the warning to heart, based on the druken driving arrest in Miami Wednesday, Thompson said. A deputy did find suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of Bieber house guest Lil Za -- real name Xavier Smith. "It was kind of like a fraternity house, but no signs of drugs," Thompson said, contradicting some media reports that deputies overlook evidence of illegal drug use.
