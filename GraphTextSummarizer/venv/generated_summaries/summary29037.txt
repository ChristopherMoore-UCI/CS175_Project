A plane full of illegal migrants were flown from Israel back to Africa on Sunday night, the first of what potentially could be thousands of such deportations of people who have illicitly entered the Middle Eastern country in recent years. "Today, the government will begin the operation to repatriate illegal work infiltrators to their countries of origin," Netanyahu said, according to a cabinet communique released by Israel's foreign ministry. "the first plane of illegal infiltrators (would) leave for South Sudan" that night, with another aircraft set to depart next week for Africa. The issue of illegal African migrants has been of growing concern in the country in recent months. In his remarks Sunday to Cabinet, Netanyahu said that construction of a fence along Israel's southern border will be finished "in the coming months."
