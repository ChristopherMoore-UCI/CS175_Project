" "Loyalist forces in Libya must immediately stop such killings of captives, and both sides must commit to ensuring no harm comes to prisoners in their custody," the group said, noting that the killing prisoners in a conflict is a war crimes. Guards loyal to Gadhafi at Qasr Ben Ghashir shot and killed five detainees captured during the conflict and held in solitary cells. -- Eyewitnesses say Gadhafi loyalists killed "numerous detainees" this week at two military camps in Tripoli, Amnesty International reported on Friday.
