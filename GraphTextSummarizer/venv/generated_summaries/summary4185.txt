Hamilton, who beat the duo to win the penultimate race in the U.S. last weekend, headed off McLaren teammate Jenson Button in Saturday's qualifying at Interlagos. Championship leader Vettel had to settle for fourth on the grid behind Red Bull teammate Mark Webber, while second-placed Alonso was back in eighth -- later bumped up to seventh -- as he was again out-qualified by Ferrari colleague Felipe Massa. The scene is set for a thrilling climax to the 2012 Formula One season after Lewis Hamilton upstaged title contenders Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso by claiming pole position for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix. Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen, seeking to hold off Hamilton for third place in the drivers' standings, will be eighth on the grid ahead of Mercedes' Nico Rosberg and Force India's Paul di Resta. "But let's wait and see what happens tomorrow." Hamilton claimed his seventh pole this season and is seeking to end his career-long spell at McLaren with a second successive victory.
