I support the demonstrations that started on June 30th and saw that former president Mohamed Morsy was unfit to be president, but that doesn't deny the fact that I believe there needs to be a thorough investigation into the events at the Republican Guard headquarters, that I'd like to know how long the Islamists' TV channels will be closed; and that I find the private media to be full of discrimination and inciting rhetoric. We are losing this battle before it has even begun: those who claim to be freedom fighters and have been denouncing the fascism and discrimination of the Brotherhood are now contributing to the building of sympathy towards them. The ideas, approaches and appearances have disappeared, and all that remains are fascism and discrimination that unite us over hatred, rather than reconcile our prejudices. I could write volumes on the lack of intelligence on the part of the Brotherhood and their corruption of both religion and politics, but that is another battle that requires different tools. We are returning par excellence to the atmosphere of the 90s when we settled for "the security option" and the media corruption and let the chests rage with a fire of hatred and allowed extremism to deepen day after day.
