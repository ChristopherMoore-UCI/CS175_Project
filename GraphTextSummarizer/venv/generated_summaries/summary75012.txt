Today, we're living with economic problems that have a direct correlation on our ability to nurture strong families. It's time to rethink the notion of family values and remember, as the story of Willy Loman reminds us, that a strong family starts with a strong economy. Public policy most keep the interest rates on student loans at a reasonable level to make sure that families are not crushed by the pressures to finance college costs. Too often, politicians ignore the kinds of strains that economic problems cause for families. During the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt always understood that family security could only result from economic security.
