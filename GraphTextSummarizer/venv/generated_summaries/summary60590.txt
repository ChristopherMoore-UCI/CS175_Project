Pretoria-based Gospel Taxi Club spreads the word of God by giving taxi drivers CDs that mix music with messages from the Bible. Passengers wanted to know where they could buy the tracks they were hearing, and with no record stores stocking the music, taxi drivers began selling CDs directly from taxi ranks and roadside stalls. Producers like Bojo Mujo are starting to make waves, McLloyd's "Tembisa Funk" has just been released by British dance label Positiva and Mujava is currently scheduled for a European tour, but has had to cancel because of illness. Once Pretoria's taxi drivers had generated a buzz about "Township Funk," Sheer Music stepped in, signing Mujava. In the run up to the recent general election, South African opposition party the Democratic Alliance (DA) gave taxi drivers CDs featuring specially recorded songs that promoted the party message.
