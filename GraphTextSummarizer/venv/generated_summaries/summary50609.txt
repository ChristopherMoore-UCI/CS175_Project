"There have been some organizations that have decided not to renew their charters with Scouting," BSA spokesman Deron Smith said in May. Faith-based organizations charter more than 70% of Scout chapters, providing meeting space and leadership, according to the BSA. The BSA, however, will maintain its ban on gay adult leaders. The National Jewish Committee on Scouting, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, the Unitarian Universalist Association and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors more Scout units than any other faith, all endorsed the change. "Trail Life USA will be inclusive of boys, regardless of religion, race, national origin or socioeconomic status, and accept boys who are experiencing same-sex attractions or gender confusion," a statement from the group says.
