Cultural Revolution food might be tainted by unpleasant memories, but at least it was not tainted by pesticides. Sitting on the outskirts of the Chinese capital city, the eatery chose its moniker after the famous Maoist song of the same name and is themed around China's Cultural Revolution (1966-76), an era which many would rather forget. However, they still bring people closer to an otherwise rarely mentioned period of recent Chinese history, and in so doing, shed light on China today. They are those who hark back to a time, real or imagined, that they deem better than contemporary China. "China's historical memory is very barren, so even recent events can fall through a gap," said James Palmer, a longtime China watcher who visited one of these venues as part of field research for a book he wrote on the death of Mao, whose passing away marked the end of the Cultural Revolution.
