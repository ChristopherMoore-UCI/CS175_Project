But the circus says that no evidence was presented at the six-week trial that such tools as bull hooks and hot shots are used on elephants. Besides the Animal Welfare Institute, other groups involved in the suit are the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Fund for Animals and Born Free USA, acting with the Animal Protection Institute. Are circus elephants abused? "Ringling Bros.' practices are well known to the federal government who regulates their business," says Ringling Bros. attorney Michelle Pardo. Pardo insists the trial evidence "showed the elephants are healthy, well cared for and they're thriving in Ringling Bros. care."
