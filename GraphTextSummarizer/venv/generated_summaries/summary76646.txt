In Nigeria, the mass abduction of schoolgirls isn't shocking Boko Haram victim: I cried for someone to help me, but no one would come "The escalation of violence in northeastern Nigeria in 2014 has developed into a situation of non-international armed conflict in which all parties are violating international humanitarian law," said Netsanet Belay, an official with that rights group. In February, the Nigerian military blamed Boko Haram for killing at least 29 students in an attack on a federal college in Buni Yadi in Yobe state. But rights groups have accused Nigeria of going too far in using heavy-handed tactics such as illegal searches, torture and extrajudicial killings. The northeast, where Boko Haram has been most active, is economically depressed and among the least educated regions in Nigeria.
