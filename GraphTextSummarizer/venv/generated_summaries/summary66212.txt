The report states that a correctional officer observed via a prison video feed Kilpatrick touch his wife, Carlita Kilpatrick, on her breast with his right hand in the prison visiting room at Oaks Correctional Facility in Manistee. He is accused of using the Kilpatrick Civic Fund -- a tax-exempt fund meant to pay for voter education -- to make cash payments to himself, his family and friends. On Tuesday, the former mayor was arraigned in federal court on 19 counts of felony fraud and tax charges. According to Marlan, the incident also will be discussed during a parole hearing for Kilpatrick in a year. Kilpatrick currently is serving a maximum five-year sentence in Michigan for violating probation in a 2008 case against him.
