"I tell my family I am in good health and in good spirits, but I have not taken my medicine since Friday, so I am a little tired." Family members had previously said that Louis suffers from diabetes and they weren't sure if he had his medicine. Louis offered himself as a hostage after gunmen took the female parishioner, his son, the Rev. Jean Louis, told CNN on Monday. The two Americans and their guide were taken hostage Friday when gunmen boarded their tour bus, which was on its way to Israel, family members said. Abu Masouh, a member of a prominent Bedouin tribe in the Sinai, had said he wanted Egyptian police to free his uncle, whom Bakr said had been caught in Alexandria, Egypt, with a half-ton of drugs.
