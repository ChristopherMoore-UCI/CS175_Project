Research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter revenues will grow nearly 90 per cent this year to $545.2m, and reach more than $800m in ad revenues worldwide by 2014. Twitter said users would not see more ads as a result of the new system, at least in the short term, but that pricing might increase for advertisers as its auctions to buy ads become more competitive. Ms Underwood told the FT that there was "no direct impact on the user experience in the short term", although Twitter users should see "more relevant and better ads" as a result of the new system, because it would be simpler for advertisers to use the targeting capabilities which it introduced last year. By using granular targeting, segmenting the campaign by regions and testing different bid levels on pricing, the company increased its number of Twitter followers by 63 per cent. "As interest in Twitter has grown, our focus has been on delivering better ads for users, not more ads," said April Underwood, Twitter's product manager for revenue, in a blog post.
