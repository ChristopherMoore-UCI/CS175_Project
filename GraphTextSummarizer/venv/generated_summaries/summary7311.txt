This year, many photographers started early, including Karen Lim, whose blog "The Story of Bing" won the 2011 Singapore Blog Awards Best Lifestyle Blog. "It started with a simple idea," founder Cowart said, "to give back with our skills and talent -- and it's blossomed into a grass roots, worldwide movement fueled by people hungry to give, instead of take, portraits." His nonprofit, Help-Portrait, gives professional quality portrait photographs to people who could otherwise not afford them. " This response from a recipient of a free portrait at the L.A. Skid Row Rescue Mission is what inspires celebrity photographer Jeremy Cowart. Each local coordinator determines where their community's event will take place, with Cowart's general guideline of helping people in need.
