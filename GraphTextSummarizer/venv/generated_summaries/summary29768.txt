-- Jeffery Watson napped in the comfort of a $2,500 presidential suite at Pittsburgh's stately Omni William Penn Hotel, which has hosted movie stars, leaders of industry, and every U.S. president from Theodore Roosevelt to Barack Obama. The guests alerted hotel security, who woke Watson from his slumber on a couch and escorted him downstairs into police custody, police spokeswoman Diane Richard said. After Watson, 48 and homeless, was discovered Tuesday by guests who had rented the grand suite with crystal chandeliers and a grand piano, police escorted him to the Allegheny County Jail, where the decor is described in the jail's website as "simple, sturdy and secure." Watson told police he is from Los Angeles and had been trying to get back home. He said Watson has been banned from the Penn.
