The U.S. contends insurgents routinely launch attacks from the Pakistani tribal region into Afghanistan, crossing the border to resupply militants with money and weapons. -- Three suspected drone strikes Monday killed 21 people in a volatile northwest Pakistani tribal region that borders Afghanistan, two Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN. But it is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely. A suspected drone fired at two alleged militant hideoutsin South Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. It was the second such series of strikes since Friday in the same area, officials said.
