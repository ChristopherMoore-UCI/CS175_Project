" "Northwestern considers its students who participate in NCAA Division I sports, including those who receive athletic scholarships, to be students, first and foremost," Alan Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in a statement last month. Northwestern University football coach Pat Fitzgerald said Saturday he does not believe his players should unionize, even though the players won that right in court last month. Last month, the National Labor Relations Board office in Chicago ruled that players are employees of the school and have the right to unionize after former quarterback Kain Colter testified about the rigorous demands of being a Division I football player. He has said the Chicago NLRB ruling would have national implications, but he wouldn't talk about whether teams at other schools were planning to hold union votes as well.
