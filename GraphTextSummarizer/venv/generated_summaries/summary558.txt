This forced Allegiant to juggle its schedule, pushing back 16 flights to Saturday, canceling two altogether and causing various delays, according to airline spokesman Brian Davis. Initial checks revealed that 14 of the company's MD-80s were compliant (because they had gotten new slides, four for each plane, within the past year) and could fly, according to Davis. In fact, the airline spokesman says all flights should head off fine Saturday, as Allegiant uses its full available fleet as well as aircraft contracted from other carriers. When reviewing this incident, Allegiant officials noticed a discrepancy between its practice of overhauling its MD-80 slides every three years with the manufacturer and Boeing's recommendations -- which Allegiant views as requirements -- that it happen every year. The headaches began Monday, when smoke detectors went off on an Allegiant flight destined for Peoria, Illinois, as it was taxiing from the terminal to the runway at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport.
