The Senate will send President Barack Obama legislation authorizing the use of military force against ISIS shortly after the GOP takes majority control in January, presumed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. McConnell left the door open to congressional action on immigration -- which both McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had said would be made much more difficult by Obama's executive action halting deportations for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, the Kentucky Republican said he'd like to see Obama ask Congress for such a measure -- but that one is coming anyway. " In the interview, McConnell previewed his plans for the final two years of Obama's tenure -- saying he expects the Senate to pass legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline, forcing the President into a tough veto decision, and to "push back against this overactive bureaucracy" on environmental regulations. But McConnell, pointing to a meeting with Obama last week, said Republicans might be able to agree with the President on a few issues.
