Sneak peeks of the upcoming collection hint that it's more streetwear-focused, with flat-bill caps, graphic tees and grungy plaids, but Generation Y is buzzing for any and all impending Throwback Thursdays as the brand hints at a "heritage" collection with jeans with 20-inch-plus leg openings. Folks on social media are wigging out over the return of a brand that was all that and a bag of chips to alternative youth culture of the 1990s: JNCO jeans. " Though the brand has been active on Facebook and Twitter since October, the wide-leg reboot gained Internet traction this week after appearing at a fashion trade event in Las Vegas. "Through the use of experimental fits, cutting-edge techniques and application of fresh, unconventional fabrications, JNCO sets to defy the rules of street wear and re-establish a brand and aesthetic that is purely in a class of its own," according to its website. After all, there's certainly not enough room in today's skinny jeans to store your Tamagatchi, Dunkaroos and Walkman.
