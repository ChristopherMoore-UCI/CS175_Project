-- A 22-year-old Sudanese model who had been missing for nearly two weeks was found in an area hospital, a New York Police detective told CNN on Monday night. Hopkins has worked with designers from Oscar de la Renta to Diane von Furstenberg, according to Corinne Nicolas, president of Trump Model Management. "We are very worried," said Nicolas, who said she learned of Hopkins' disappearance last week. Detective Kelly Ort had no details about the condition of Ataui-Deng Hopkins, known in the fashion world as Ataui Deng. She was last seen August 6 about 11 p.m. on West 48th Street in Midtown Manhattan, according to a New York City Police Department statement released earlier Monday.
