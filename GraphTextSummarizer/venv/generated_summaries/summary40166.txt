Philippines authorities say there were more than 1.2 million registered firearms in the country last year and estimate there were another 600,000 unlicensed firearms in circulation nationwide. The official Philippines News Agency reported that Talumpa had previously survived an assassination attempt in Manila in 2010 and a grenade attack in 2012 in Zamboanga del Sur, the province where Labangan is situated on the southern island of Mindanao. Talumpa and his family had flown from the southern Philippines to Manila, where they planned to spend the Christmas holidays, Villacorte said. The deadliest outbreak of politically motivated violence in recent history took place in 2009 in Maguindanao province on Mindanao.
