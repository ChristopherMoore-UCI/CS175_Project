Its call to action: a plea to the British government to grant pardons to the estimated 49,000 men who were convicted under the UK's anti-gay laws, just as Alan Turing -- the computer scientist and World War II codebreaker -- was in the 1950s. I find this deplorable, because Turing's actions did not warrant forgiveness -- theirs did -- and the 49,000 other prosecuted men deserve the same." Indeed, part of what makes telling Turing's story so important is that thousands like him experienced the same cruelty as he did, enduring relentless discrimination simply for attempting to live complete, fulfilled lives. Truth be told, most apologies given would be posthumous like the one Turing received from Gordon Brown and Queen Elizabeth II a few years back. Members of Turing's family and the movie's cast joined Fry in drafting an open letter to Britain's political leaders, including David Cameron, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- insisting that those men deserved to have the stains of criminal conviction removed from their names. But to ignore the injustice they all suffered just because they're not there to hear us is to ignore history, do further injustice to their families, and that's something we quite simply cannot do.
