Despite difficulties in southern Somalia, the agency says it is still dispensing food in the capital city Mogadishu and several other areas. One of the recent threats to the food agency occurred in late November when Islamist militants in Somalia warned the agency to buy food from Somali farmers or stop sending aid to the impoverished African country. -- Recent threats and attacks from militant groups have made it almost impossible for the World Food Program to get food to hungry people in southern Somaila, the aid agency said Tuesday. The actions by militant groups have led to a partial suspension food distribution in much of southern Somalia, the agency said in a statement. That threat came from al-Shabaab, a group that has waged a bloody insurgency against the U.N.-backed government of transitional President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed.
