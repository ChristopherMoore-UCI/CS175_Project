"Yoga Hosers" also stars Depp and his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp, along with Smith's daughter, Harley Quinn Smith. The movie, which also stars Justin Long, Johnny Depp and Genesis Rodriguez, is actually the first part of Smith's "True North Trilogy." Writer/director Smith explained on Twitter, "for those asking (about) the @YogaHosers pics of @HaleyJoelOsment, Haley is playing the Canadian Fuhrer, Adrien Arcand." According to Variety, the film is Smith's answer to persistent questions from fans about his making a comic book movie. Arcand was a Montreal journalist who led a series of fascist political movements between 1929 and 1967.
