The 2 p.m. incident involved three aircraft: Chautauqua Airlines 3072, Republic Airlines 3329 and Republic 3467. -- The Federal Aviation Administration Tuesday ordered a nationwide halt to "opposite direction" runway operations, in which planes arrive on runways in one direction and depart in the other, as the result of an investigation into last week's incident at Reagan National Airport involving three planes which came dangerously close. Huerta said the Reagan incident also raised the issue that the FAA's front-line managers are managing administrative tasks in addition to overseeing tower operations. Controllers sometimes allow two-way traffic to comply with noise restrictions or to accommodate cargo operations, he said. "We believe this contributed to the miscommunication." Huerta said he is halting two-way runway traffic "out of an abundance of caution," and that the FAA expects to have standard procedures in place within a month.
