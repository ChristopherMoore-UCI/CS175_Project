U.S. special operations forces went into Syria in July to try to retrieve Foley and other ISIS captives. The United States and other countries attempted hostage rescues, but these have achieved mixed results. Tice, a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to The Washington Post and other news outlets, disappeared in Syria in August 2012. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen reports that ISIS is understood to be holding at least two other American citizens, as well as hostages from additional Western countries. The beheading of British aid worker David Haines by ISIS has intensified fears for other Western hostages being held by the jihadist group.
