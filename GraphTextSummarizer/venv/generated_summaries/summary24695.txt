Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle: "Did you tell Mr. Gongaware that you thought Mr. Jackson had a dependency on opiates?" Finkelstein: "Yes." Boyle: "And what did Mr. Gongaware say to you?" Finkelstein: "He said, 'Don't be a Dr. Nick.'" Boyle: "And by Dr. Nick, was he talking about Elvis?" Finkelstein: "Yes. And he was kind of warning me that, you know, don't get all infatuated where you start administering meds to a rock star and have the rock star overdose and die on you." Dr. George Nichopoulos, known as "Dr. Nick," was "the doctor whose overprescription of drugs to Elvis had led to Elvis' death," according to a court filing by Jackson lawyers. Gongaware denied in his testimony that he ever knew that Jackson had drug dependency problems while touring. If he was an addict, Jackson "would be taking drugs that were not prescribed by a medical professional, taking larger amounts than prescribed and have drug-seeking behavior," Dr. Sidney Schnoll testified. Finkelstein said Gongaware called him again in the spring of 2009 as preparations for Jackson's comeback tour were beginning.
