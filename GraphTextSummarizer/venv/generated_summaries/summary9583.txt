-- A powerful earthquake struck off the northeast coast of Japan on Friday evening, rattling buildings in Tokyo and setting off a small tsunami. Radiation levels in fish caught near the area remain high long after the 2011 meltdowns, suggesting contamination from the site might still be seeping into Pacific waters, a U.S. researcher said in October. The weaker, 7.3-magnitude quake on Friday took place further out at sea -- 462 kilometers (287 miles) east-northeast of Tokyo at a depth of 36 kilometers (22 miles) -- the U.S. Geological Survey said, slightly revising the initial location it gave. Radioactive levels staying high off Fukushima CNN's Alex Zolbert reported from Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong. CNN's Junko Ogura in Tokyo and Elizabeth Joseph in Hong Kong contributed to this report.
