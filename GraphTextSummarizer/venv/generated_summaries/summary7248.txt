While Crocs clogs were undeniably popular, they were also scorned by fashionistas and people tired of seeing the colorful plastic shoes nearly everywhere. "A lot of the haters didn't like the way other people looked in them, but they did maybe resent a little bit the comfort those people had and that they had the courage to go ahead and go out in public and wear them," explained Dale Bathum, Crocs' senior vice president of product. The economic collapse in 2008, combined with a saturated market, created what Crocs CEO John McCarvel described as a "perfect confluence of events. "I think you do get to the point where maybe everybody has a red and a blue and a black pair and they are looking for something else, and that was part of the strategy," said Christy Saito, the company's vice president of product design. So the company set out to create a new line of shoes -- flats, wedges, sneakers, boat shoes, even winter boots -- that would be as comfortable as the clogs, but would appeal to more style-conscious consumers.
