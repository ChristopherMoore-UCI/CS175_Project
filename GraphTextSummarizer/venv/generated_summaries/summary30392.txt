But after the Democratic Senate candidate Chad Taylor dropped out, and Orman, an independent, began rising in the polls, the group decided to join several others to try to save Roberts, and potentially a GOP takeover of the Senate. The Chamber's ad, which is set to air statewide in Kansas on broadcast and digital, is trying to crack that image of Orman by painting him as just another politician refusing to take positions on key issues, and follows the GOP talking point of the last few weeks -- linking Orman to President Obama and Democrats in the Senate. The Chamber of Commerce has been playing a big role this election year by spending millions on ads to prop up incumbents in GOP primaries, and now in the general election, to help defeat Democratic incumbents. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is coming to the rescue of Republican Senator Pat Roberts, airing its first television ad in Kansas starting Wednesday morning, CNN has learned. Republicans had hoped to only be defending competitive seats in Georgia and Kentucky, but Roberts tarnished image in Kansas as someone who lost touch stuck with him even after he won a tough GOP primary earlier this year.
