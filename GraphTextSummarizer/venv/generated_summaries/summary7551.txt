"Africa Stop Ebola" is performed in French and regional dialects, and the lyrics are a message about what citizens can do to stop Ebola spreading. "Liberians themselves have been at the frontlines of the fight against Ebola from the very beginning while the country waited for international support to materialize," explains Saran Kaba Jones, founder of FACE Africa, a group working to improve access to clean water in rural parts of the country. Musical teaching Liberia, the hardest hit country in the Ebola outbreak, has also gone on to implement more creative education campaigns. Communications is key Ike's messaging platform is, however, just one of the many homegrown initiatives developed and rolled out across West Africa to raise awareness and prevent the spread of Ebola -- from mobile apps and education campaigns to catchy songs and multi-million dollar private donations, Africans are at the forefront of the war against the virus. "Very little of Africa's front line efforts to stop the spread of Ebola is visible in Western Media and as a result, very little material support is going to these organizations," he wrote in a recent blog post.
