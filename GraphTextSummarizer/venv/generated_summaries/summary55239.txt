Another team to be denied in the last minute were Spain, whose remarkable run of 24 consecutive wins in qualifying games -- which stretched back to 2007 -- was ended when drawing 1-1 at home to 1998 World Cup winners France in Madrid. It was a mixed night for England, whose Under-21 side qualified for next year's European Championship when beating Serbia in a game in Krusevac that ended with ugly scenes and the visitors reporting "a number of incidents of racism" to European governing body UEFA. Elsewhere, an historic night for Cristiano Ronaldo -- who was winning his 100th cap for Portugal -- was upstaged by visitors Northern Ireland, who led for large parts of the game in Porto before Helder Postiga earned a 1-1 draw just ten minutes from time. "The FA condemns both the scenes of racism and the confrontation at the final whistle during which time our players and staff were under extreme provocation," said the English FA in a statement. In other games, Russia needed a fortuitous 84th minute penalty to defeat Azerbaijan 1-0 in Moscow, Belgium continued their impressive form when beating Scotland 2-0 at home while Italy made light of losing Pablo Osvaldo to a red card after 46 minutes as they won 3-1 in Milan against Denmark.
