In July, USGS scientists installed a volcanic-gas monitoring station on the mountain. A flurry of small earthquakes rumbling near the Mammoth Mountain Volcano, have been categorized as "volcanic unrest" by the United States Geological Survey. Mammoth Mountain, standing at 11,053 feet, last erupted about 57,000 years ago, according to the USGS. David Shelly, a seismologist with California Volcano Observatory, said this swarm is "bigger than we've seen recently, but normal in the area." The center of the caldera has been uplifting slowly over the last several decades and seismologists continuously monitor it.
