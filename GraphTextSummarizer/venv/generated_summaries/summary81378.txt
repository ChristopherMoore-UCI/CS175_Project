St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar sent an e-mail to his staff saying the Rams' chief operating officer called him Monday to apologize. Police leaders meet with Rams officials Aside from the semantics of the phone call, leaders from the St. Louis Police Officers Association and the St. Louis County Police Association met with team officials Monday. The latest Ferguson confrontation isn't taking place on the streets of the beleaguered city, but between the St. Louis County Police Department and the St. Louis Rams football team -- over an apology, or lack thereof. "Apology: 'expression of regret for not being able to do something" @kdemoff: "I regretted any offense their officers may have taken,'" St. Louis County Police tweeted Monday night. The Rams also issued a statement, saying the team will "continue to build on what have always been strong and valued relationships with local law enforcement and the greater St. Louis community as we come together to help heal our region."
