Faced with pressure to duplicate the success of their first, the Perrys are trying to remember that they've been doing this for years -- and will continue to play after the spotlights fade. In 2011 the band won both the American Country Music and the Country Music Association's new artist of the year awards, as well as the 2011 CMA award for single of the year. The three siblings -- Kimberly, Neil and Reid -- have been performing together for 14 years. So far it has been only psychological warfare: Paisley peppered a concert venue in Kentucky with a photo of the band, using a head shot of Christopher Guest to replace Reid. He's known to be a prankster -- spraying opening acts with water, throwing bread rolls on stage and even decorating Jerrod Niemann's tour bus.
