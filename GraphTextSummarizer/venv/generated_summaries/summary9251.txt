There is no doubt that the detainees will try to use the legal proceedings as a soapbox to spout their contempt for America -- a contempt already indelibly displayed by such acts as ordering passenger jets to fly into iconic buildings or, in the case of Mohammed, personally beheading Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Mohammed, four others charged in 9/11 attacks As I detail in my new book: "Hard Measures, How Aggressive CIA Actions After 9/11 Saved American Lives," there are many myths surrounding the detention of a relatively small number of top terrorists at CIA-run "black sites" from 2002 until they were sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2006. -- The arraignment of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others charged as terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, over the weekend was widely described by the media as a "circus." In my book, I detail the critical information we obtained from al Qaeda terrorists after they became compliant following a short period of enhanced interrogation. Mohammed's period of harsh -- but legal and necessary -- treatment was even less.
