It left Chelsea seven points adrift of leaders Manchester United in third place in the standings and Benitez was again subjected to barracking by home supporters unhappy at his appointment. The Old Trafford faithful had barely settled in their seats when the Dutch striker picked up a pass from Michael Carrick and saw his shot deflect off James Collins to loop over visiting goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. Rafael Benitez is still searching for his first win and first goal since taking charge of Chelsea as interim manager following the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo. It was the quickest goal of the EPL season and left United a point clear of neighbors and defending champions Manchester City, who won 2-0 at Wigan. His side were held 0-0 at home by West London rivals Fulham, off the back of the same result against Manchester City Sunday.
