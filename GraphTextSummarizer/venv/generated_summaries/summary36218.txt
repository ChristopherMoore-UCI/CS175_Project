"We have a saying -- if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere." Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic operates 10-day expeditions (a seven-day cruise + transfers) aboard National Geographic Endeavour and National Geographic Islander departing San Cristobal and Baltra, year-round. While tourism to the region has tripled in the last 20 years -- just over 200,000 people visited the Galapagos last year -- visitors cruising the islands with responsible operators are helping to correct the damage caused by over hunting and species introduced by sailors, whalers and pirates. Clambering back into the Zodiac dinghy -- or panga, as they're known in the Galapagos -- for the short return trip to the National Geographic Endeavour, one fellow "explorer" quizzes our accompanying naturalist. On one of the daily snorkel expeditions I spot octopi, manta rays and a solitary Galapagos penguin, puffed up as if to officiate, on various excursions. Voyages also have a strong photography slant, with most on-board naturalists certified as photo instructors by National Geographic.
