The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office called Igor a "dangerous" storm and said Bermudan authorities are making appropriate plans for its arrival late Sunday or early Monday. It was moving toward the northwest at 10 mph (17 kph), but forecasters said its forward speed and strength are expected to increase in the next couple of days, followed by gradual weakening. At 8 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), Hurricane Igor, downgraded to Category 2, had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph (165 kph). Home Affairs Minister David Burch warned island residents to be ready for storm surge and high winds. The Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to weaken to a tropical depression soon and dissipate over the mountains of Mexico on Sunday.
