Otunbayeva is disappointed that the violence in Kyrgyzstan did not spark the international outrage that violence in Mideast countries has. Otunbayeva says events of last year were some of the toughest and most dramatic in Kyrgyz history. One of the first tasks Otunbayeva and her fellow opposition leaders worked on, after years of presidential rule, was introducing a new constitution with a parliamentary system. Smiling broadly, she says: "So, women can do something in Kyrgyzstan." In July of last year, after Bakiev fled the country, Otunbayeva was sworn in.
