iPhone Flash app pulled from Apple To test it, I had to find a popular website loaded with Flash video. The app's primary function is to take websites that use embedded Flash video and automatically transcode that video into HTML5 so that it's viewable on the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Maybe Apple approved Skyfire, an iPhone web browser that plays Flash videos, to prove a point: Flash is losing relevance. (Note that Skyfire only displays Flash video -- not games, animations, ads, etc.) I loaded the TED Talks website, which is a gallery of Flash videos, and Skyfire didn't transcode the videos.
