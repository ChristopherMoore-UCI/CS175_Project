"I can neither confirm or deny the reports in the L.A. Times and other media about the Loughner case," Bill Solomon, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona, told CNN when asked about the reports late Saturday night. Court documents released a few days after the shooting showed that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event. In July 2011, bizarre and suicidal actions by Loughner while in custody pushed a federal appeals panel to allow authorities to force the defendant to take anti-psychotic medication. In February, a federal judge ruled Loughner could receive medical treatment for another four months. His attorneys consistently fought court rulings that Loughner continue his treatment at the hospital.
