The soldiers were moving from one post to another along the border when they came under fire by Indian forces, said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, Pakistan army spokesman. Lt. Col. J.S. Brar, Indian defense spokesman for the disputed Kashmir region, said there were two violations of the cease-fire on the Line of Control, the de facto border between Indian- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India has accused Pakistan of aiding infiltration into Indian Kashmir, which has battled separatist violence for more than two decades. Since a cease-fire is in effect, the firing by Indian forces was unprovoked, Abbas said. It was unclear whether the incident took place late Tuesday or Wednesday, as Pakistani and Indian officials provided different times.
