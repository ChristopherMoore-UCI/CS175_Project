This dramatic change in food culture has made cardiovascular disease and stroke the leading cause of death in the country according to Uauy -- followed closely by diabetes. However, the Brazilian government, and ministry of health, are taking the matter seriously and have been heralded for their recent projects issuing food guidelines for the public and creating programs for schools to source 40% of their food locally as childhood obesity is approaching adult levels. Set aside at the ends of rows throughout the stadium, the low-backed, wide-set seats for obese people have been built in accordance with Brazilian law, in which obesity is classed as a disability and must be accommodated. Communities across the country -- both urban and rural -- have reduced their intake of fruit and vegetables to include more meat, sugar and processed foods. Globalization has enabled even the most rural of residents to access processed foods; Nestle, for example, has provided scheduled boats since 2010 that serve as floating supermarkets for communities residing along the Amazon.
