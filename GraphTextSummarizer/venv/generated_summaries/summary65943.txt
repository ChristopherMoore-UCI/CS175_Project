The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement. The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities. Uyghurs are a Muslim minority from the Xinjiang province of far west China. -- Two of four Uyghurs relocated to Bermuda after seven years of detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, denied Friday that they had ever been terrorists and expressed gratitude toward U.S. President Barack Obama for working to free them. The issue of where they go is controversial because of China's opposition to the Uyghurs' being sent to any country but China.
