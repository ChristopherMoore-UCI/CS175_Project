In his blog post announcing the vote last week, Facebook vice president of communications Elliot Schrage said, "If turnout is less than 30%, the vote will be advisory." Even with a sliver of the required votes, it's clear what Facebook users who voted are advising Facebook to do. A weeklong open vote on proposed policy changes, including whether to keep public voting and how data is shared with affiliates such as Instagram, closed Monday. "We will be announcing the results and the next steps regarding the governance process shortly, so check back soon," read a post Monday on the official Facebook Site Governance page. Another update would change how Facebook shares user data with companies it owns or partners with, most notably Instagram. The two documents Facebook wishes to update are its data use policy and its statement of rights and responsibilities.
