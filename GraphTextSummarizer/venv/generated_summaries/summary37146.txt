Mickelson roars to victory as Tiger falls apart at Pebble Beach "I explained to Phil some things to be aware of when playing with Tiger," Harmon told the tour's official website. -- The secret to Phil Mickelson's recent successes against longtime rival Tiger Woods could lie with the man who has coached both golf superstars -- Butch Harmon. Harmon, who has also worked with other top names such as former major champions Greg Norman and Fred Couples, has revealed how he gave Mickelson an insight into what to expect from former world No. 1 Woods. Harmon helped Woods to eight of his 14 major triumphs between 1993 and 2004, and started working with Mickelson three years later. "I don't believe anybody has benefited more from what he's done for the game than myself," said Mickelson, who has outscored Woods on eight of the 12 occasions they have played together since he started working with Harmon in 2007.
