Baby albatross on a remote Atlantic island are threatened by killer house mice. Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world. "We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers," said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem. "The decline in bunting numbers is alarming," said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town, who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s. House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said.
