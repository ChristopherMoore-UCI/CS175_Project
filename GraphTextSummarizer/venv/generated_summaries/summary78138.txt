At numerous evictions, authorities have been met by dozens of protesters who have organized to provide support for families facing evictions across the country. The move will not halt all home evictions during the ongoing economic crisis, but the Spanish Banking Association issued a statement saying that "due to social alarm generated by the home evictions," it agreed with a government proposal made last Thursday to halt foreclosures "during the next two years, in those cases where there are circumstances of extreme necessity." There have been protests for months in Spain over evictions as the nation suffers a recession and an unemployment rate just over 25 percent. " Housing advocates say hundreds of evictions are scheduled every business day. Just hours after the second suicide last Friday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told a regional election rally that the government "will protect the most vulnerable families affected by evictions."
