The child welfare agency then provided sheriff's investigators with a possible identity of the missing child, and San Augustine County prosecutors secured a warrant for Tanner, Cunningham said. The woman, Krystle Tanner of San Augustine, was the godmother of Miguel Antonio Morin, who was 8 months old when he and Tanner went missing, the boy's mother, Auboni Champion-Morin, told CNN Wednesday. In August 2011, the state child welfare agency received a report against Tanner about alleged negligence of her children, Cunningham said. Tanner was arrested Monday in connection with the boy's kidnapping after Child Protective Services began investigating her in August on allegations of negligently supervising her children and an unknown 8-year-old child who had been physically abused, Cunningham said. Tanner allegedly gave the child welfare agency's investigators contradictory information about the 8-year-old boy, saying the child was hers and then wasn't hers, that the child belonged to her brother or someone else, Cunningham said.
