The settlement does not affect the more than 60 suits that have been brought against other parties such as West Virginia American Water, Eastman Chemical Company, which manufactures MCHM, or against named individuals at Freedom Industries. These were the suits brought by plaintiffs who were customers of West Virginia American Water and whom either lived in, worked in or owned a business in the affected area between January 9 and January 19, according to Majestro. Freedom Industries Inc. would transfer $2.9 million into a trust fund that will be used "for the greater good," according to Anthony Majestro, one of the attorneys in the class-action lawsuit. A week after the spill, Freedom Industries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Under the terms of the agreement, which still have to be approved by a judge, 24 pending lawsuits against Freedom Industries would be settled.
