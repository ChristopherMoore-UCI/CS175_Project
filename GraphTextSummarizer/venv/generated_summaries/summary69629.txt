-- A federal judge has approved a $41 million civil rights settlement to five black and Hispanic men wrongfully convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a white female jogger in New York's Central Park in 1989, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement Friday. "To the extent that the evidence suggests that these five young men were wrongfully convicted and sentenced to substantial prison terms for a crime they did not commit, that in and of itself constitutes an injustice in need of redress," Corporation Counsel Zachary Carter said in a statement Friday.
