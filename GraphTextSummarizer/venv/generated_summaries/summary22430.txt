Water may have trickled to the building's basement, where Reshma was found, from recent rains and from water sprayed by rescuers. State-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) reported Reshma told her rescuers that she survived on dry food and water that was tossed into the rubble in the first days after the collapse. Asked how long someone can survive without food or water, Gupta said, "We keep redefining that a bit." -- A well-placed pool of water and an air pocket appear to have combined to help a young woman survive for 16 days under the rubble of a collapsed Bangladeshi building. Gupta said the woman likely had some sort of access to food, although people have been known to survive a couple of weeks without it.
