The proposed Food Safety Enhancement Act (S. 510) covers many aspects of food safety, including better preventive control measures by manufacturers, more frequent inspections of facilities, and greater FDA authority over recalls. "We believe it would significantly cut down on the number of recalls and, when they do occur, it would allow the FDA to identify the food more quickly," CSPI's DeWaal said. After recovering from her illness, she started advocating for food safety, she said. "When things go wrong with the food supply, consumers sometimes are the last to know but the first to pay," said Caroline DeWaal of the Washington-based, non-profit advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. One of those reportedly sickened by recalled food was Rylee Gustafson, 13, of Henderson, Nevada.
