California's state fire department is sending 25 fire engines to the area to help battle the blaze at the request of the local fire department, spokesman Daniel Berlant said. Kaiser Permanente South San Francisco hospital received three people in ambulances and four walk-ins with injuries from the fire, Administrative Services Director Nida Winnett said. "The flames are being fueled by something," said Kelly Huston of California Emergency Management. "There was a loud explosion being reported by witness and just dozens of homes on fire" He said there were some injured and walking wounded after the fire, which started around 7 p.m. (10 p.m. ET). -- Firefighters were battling a gas line or gas-fueled blaze Thursday evening that engulfed dozens of homes and sent bright flames and huge plumes of smoke shooting hundreds of feet into the air in a neighborhood in San Bruno, California, emergency management officials said.
