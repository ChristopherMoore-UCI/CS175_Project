Taha was Sudan's first vice president -- the second highest post in the east African nation -- from 1998 to 2005, became second vice president between 2005 and 2011, then returned to the previous position. -- Sudan's second most powerful official -- who was the man who signed a 2005 peace deal ending the country's decades-long civil war -- has resigned, the African nation's president said Saturday, according to state media. First Vice President Ali Osman Taha is leaving his post as part of a reshuffle of President Omar al-Bashir's Cabinet, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Five years later, following a popular referendum, South Sudan officially became independent from Sudan. In 2008, Taha stood firmly behind al-Bashir after the International Criminal Court filed genocide charges against the Sudan president for a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur, calling this move an attempt to "paralyze" his country.
