The fire had been extinguished by Wednesday night, Pemex said in a Twitter post. Mexican state oil company Pemex said 45 workers were injured in the blaze, which began early Wednesday morning. Four workers died in a massive oil rig fire that raged for hours off the coast of Mexico Wednesday. The state oil company hasn't said what caused the fire on the platform, which is located in the Gulf of Mexico's Campeche Sound. Authorities evacuated about 300 people from the Abkatun Permanente platform after the fire started, Pemex said.
