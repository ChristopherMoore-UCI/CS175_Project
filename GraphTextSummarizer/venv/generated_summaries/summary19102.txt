McDonough revealed a startling list of alleged abuses and crimes going on inside Florida's prisons: • Top prison officials admitting to kickbacks; • Guards importing and selling steroids in an effort to give them an edge on the softball field; • Taxpayer funds to pay for booze and women; • Guards who punished other guards who threatened to report them. This house, on prison grounds in Florida, is described as a party house where prison officials held orgies. The parties and orgies were often carried out at a waterfront ranch house built on prison grounds for a former warden with taxpayer dollars, McDonough said. In addition to the orgies and other misconduct outside the cell blocks, there were other allegations of prisoners being harmed, McDonough said. McDonough described a bizarre prison culture among those that ran the system -- one that he says seemed obsessed with inter-department softball games and the orgies after games.
