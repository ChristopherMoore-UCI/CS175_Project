These attacks came amid growing tensions between Sunnis and Shiites, especially after an incident in Hawija in Kirkuk province, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. The 10 car bombs exploded within two hours in the Baghdad communities of Kadhimiyah, Sadr City, Saidiya, Mashtal, Baghdad al-Jadida, Al-Husseiniyah and Zafraniyah. Since December, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of predominately Sunni provinces -- including Anbar, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Diyala -- demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. In Baghdad, 10 car bombs exploded in the predominately Shiite neighborhoods, killing 24 people and wounding 110 others Wednesday evening. -- At least 29 people were killed and more than 120 others wounded in a dozen car bomb explosions in Baghdad and Kirkuk on Wednesday, police said.
