That is, when the survey takes into account the "dog-whistles," the new buzz word for code language only those "tuned in" will hear, anti-black sentiment is 56% and anti-Hispanic sentiment is 57%. In an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, former New Hampshire Gov. Sununu said, when asked about Gen. Colin Powell's endorsement of Barack Obama, "You have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or that he's got a slightly different reason for supporting President Obama... And the prejudice isn't limited to blacks: 52% openly express anti-Hispanic sentiments. According to the poll, "51% of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48% in a similar 2008 survey." I am not naÃ¯ve enough to think that with the election of Barack Obama racism has disappeared from America.
