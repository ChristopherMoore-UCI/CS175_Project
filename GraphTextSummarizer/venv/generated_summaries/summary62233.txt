The alleged ringleader of a group of Florida A&M University marching band students who beat drum major Robert Champion Jr. in a 2011 hazing incident was convicted Friday of multiple charges related to Champion's death, according to CNN affiliate CFN13, which was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. So there should be sadness all the way around for everyone, and we hope and pray to continue our mission to eradicate hazing -- to end it," Champion's mother, Pamela Champion, told CNN affiliate WFTV. A medical examiner ruled Champion's death a homicide, saying he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows and internal bleeding from the beating. The initiation requires pledges to run down the center of the bus while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. Champion, 26 of Decatur, Georgia, died after a band hazing ritual in which he was beaten aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida.
