No, not about whether Christie knew about the prank and conspired to inconvenience scores of New Jersey residents in order to bully a political opponent. They can't stop talking about whether members of Christie's staff tried to harass the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, by shutting down traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge, and whether Christie was in on it. The angry liberal talk show hosts on MSNBC are even worse, droning on about the bridge story day after day in what is a blatant attempt to smear Christie. Appearing last week on MSNBC's "Daily Rundown," the veteran newsman lamented the fact that so many of his colleagues are stuck on the story of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's bridge problems. Think back to the great leaders who helped define the last century -- from Teddy Roosevelt to Winston Churchill to Franklin D. Roosevelt to Harry Truman to Margaret Thatcher to Ronald Reagan.
