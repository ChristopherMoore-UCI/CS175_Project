-- A coroner's investigator dismissed online speculation that the pneumonia deaths of actress Brittany Murphy and her husband, Simon Monjack, may both have been related to viral mold inside their Los Angeles home. The home apparently was tested by "a well-respected company" for dangerous mold just two months before Murphy's death, according to Neal. "Simon Monjack received the report and assured Brittany and Sharon Murphy that there was no mold danger and it was safe to stay in the house," Neal said. "There were no indicators that it was from mold," Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Monday. Murphy, 32, and Monjack, 39, died five months apart in the same bedroom of the home they shared with the actress' mother, Sharon Murphy, in Hollywood Hills. The preliminary autopsy concluded that Monjack's death May 23 was caused by acute pneumonia and severe anemia, "just like Brittany," Winter said last week.
