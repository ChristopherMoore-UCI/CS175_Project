Romney's team has certainly had enough time to think about its candidate's positions -- he's been running for president for six years -- and about the law in question, which was the very first one that Barack Obama signed as president more than three years ago. When combined with pay inequality, Romney's promises would mean women would earn less income and then be forced to pay more for basic health care. While Romney decides whether he opposes gender discrimination, here is an important reality he should consider: This isn't just about women. Romney then went on national television, where Diane Sawyer asked him if he would have signed the bill into law. One was simple and straightforward: "Does Gov. Romney support the Lilly Ledbetter Act?" In other words, when a woman is paid less than a man for doing the same work, does the presumptive Republican nominee support her right to fight for the equal pay she's guaranteed under the law?
