In 2011, UFC President Dana White said there would never be a women's MMA match in the UFC. Rousey improved to 7-0 in her MMA career and made history by winning the first women's match in the UFC. Rousey and Carmouche met in the headline fight for the UFC 157 pay-per-view event in the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. On Saturday, Rousey found herself in early trouble for the first time as an MMA fighter. Rousey used her signature armbar move to force Carmouche to submit late in the first round.
