Away from the traditional aspects of the city, Munich is a hub for high tech, high art and high rollers. From onion domes to beer halls, the city of Munich also has more than its fair share to entrance culture vultures. -- Known for lederhosen, weisswurst and its beer festival, Munich is a city that counters these brassy cliches with a mix of art, history and style. Don't be fooled by the chocolate box architecture in parts of the Altstadt (old town): Munich is the biggest city in the state of Bavaria with an ego to match -- no other state in Germany boasts its own "national museum." The Pinakothek triumvirate have enough art and history to span hundreds of years, and take almost as long to see in their entirety.
