Vilified by the international community for his government's attitude on gay rights, Russian president Vladimir Putin has found himself an ally in Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone. Succession planning With Ecclestone's legal problems casting doubt over his future in F1, the media has been speculating about his possible successors -- with Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Justin King, chief executive of British supermarket Sainsbury's top of the list. But in an exclusive interview with CNN, Ecclestone says he "completely agrees" with Putin's policy towards homosexuals. "He hasn't said he doesn't agree (with homosexuality) just that he doesn't want these things publicized to an audience under the age of 18," said Ecclestone, arguing critics had misrepresented Putin. Ecclestone believes Russia has done a "first-class job" in the new circuit's preparation and a "super job" hosting the Olympics and that more credit should be given to Putin.
