-- WBA world heavyweight champion David Haye has branded his IBF, WBO and IBO counterpart Wladimir Klitschko a "robot" and said the Ukrainian will "malfunction" in their unification bout in Hamburg on Saturday. The fight will take place at the Imtech Arena, home of Bundesliga football club Hamburg, on Saturday. Former world amateur championships silver medallist Haye has previously said he will retire before turning 31 in October, but "The Hayemaker" has also expressed a desire to defeat both Klitschko brothers before hanging up his gloves. "You're going to become a better person, a better man, with better behavior and you'll be on time. Vitali famously faced a British fighter in 2003, when he lost to Lennox Lewis by technical knockout after the end of the sixth round.
