These include encircling China's existing metropolises with satellite cities in a hub-and-spoke pattern that would allow migrants to live an hour away with legal housing registration. For the past 20 years, city planning and urbanization has been driven by real estate sales that funded city governments and enriched well-connected property developers. The "China 2030" report published by the World Bank and the Development Research Center, a Chinese think tank that advises the leadership, said that if China can provide legal urban housing registration for 10 million migrant workers a year and transform them into the next wave of consumers, then China can enjoy 6% annual growth for the next couple of decades. This population of migrant workers is now estimated to consititute as much as 25% of the residents of major Chinese cities today. Just over 50% of China's 1.3 billion people now live in cities, as compared to some 20% when reforms began in 1980.
