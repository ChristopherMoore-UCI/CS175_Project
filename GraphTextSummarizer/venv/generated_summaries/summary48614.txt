The holy grail of Uganda wildlife watching is Bwindi Forest, where roughly half of the world's mountain gorillas reside. "Bwindi's gorilla population is around 400 and growing," says Dr Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, founder of Conservation Through Public Health, which promotes the coexistence of gorillas, humans and other wildlife in Africa. "Uganda lost a whole generation of tourism talent and workers during the civil wars," says Stephen Asiimwe, who took over a CEO of Tourism Uganda earlier this year [2014]. -- Fifty years ago Uganda was the "Pearl of Africa," a newly independent republic with a thriving economy, a functioning democracy and splendid national parks. Uganda isn't quite back to being the "Pearl of Africa" but it's definitely headed in the right direction.
