-- Police armed with rubber bullets were patrolling neighborhoods in Johannesburg on Tuesday in an effort to quell a recent spree of violence aimed at foreigners that police say has killed 22 people and displaced an estimated 13,000. Mbuso Mthembu, provincial manager at the Red Cross office in Johannesburg, said that the number of people fleeing is continuing to grow and that violent attacks seem to be spreading into other areas. Evidence of the violence was seen in smoke rising from burned homes in one Johannesburg neighborhood. The violence began a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township, police say, and has been concentrated in the city's poorest areas. Locals angry about the rising number of foreigners arriving in South Africa had set homes ablaze.
