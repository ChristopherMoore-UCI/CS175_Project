In 2003, Texas Tech University student Matt Coday created the United White Person's College Fund, a scholarship that looked to serve "as a source of financial assistance to students whom Coday feels have been discriminated against by organizations designed to give money to minorities," according to the Texas Tech newspaper University Daily. The Lydia C. Roberts Graduate Fellowship is, at least on paper, available to white students "of either sex, born in the state of Iowa," according to a Columbia University charter from 1920. It awarded $250 to students with at least a 3.2 GPA and who are at least "one quarter Caucasian." However, a representative for College Republicans at Boston University says there are no longer any scholarships funded by the organization. -- Columbia University is seeking to alter the 1920 charter of one of its graduate school fellowships which is still limited "to persons of the Caucasian race," though the fellowship has not been granted in years. The university filed an affidavit in Manhattan Supreme Court last week to support a petition from JPMorgan Chase, the fellowship's designated trustee, to change the whites-only provision, according to Robert Hornsby, assistant vice president for media relations at Columbia.
