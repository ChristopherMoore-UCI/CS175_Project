Iran and Iraq have enjoyed closer ties in recent years, especially as Iraq's Shia Muslim majority has solidified its power in the absence of former leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim. Last year, at the height of the protests, Bahrain called it troops from member nations Saudi Arabia and the UAE and cracked down. The GCC was formed in 1981, soon after Iran instituted a Shiite theocracy and went to war with primarily Sunni Iraq. "Such strategic vision would include common approaches to defense, security, political and economic long-term interests," said GCC Assistant Secretary General Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg in an opinion piece Sunday in the Saudi English-language daily, Arab News. Iran is also engaged in a longtime border dispute with the UAE over three Persian Gulf islands; Abu Mousa, and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
