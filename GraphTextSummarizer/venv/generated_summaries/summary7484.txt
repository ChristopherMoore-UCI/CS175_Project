One of 10 people killed in the collision of two helicopters in Argentina, France's Florence Arthaud has been described as a "national treasure" by fellow sailor Shirley Robertson. According to Robertson, Arthaud had inspired a generation of French sailors. Along with Camille Muffat and Alexis Vastine, the 57-year-old Arthaud was one of three sports stars killed in the collision as two helicopters transported the athletes to a gorge in northwestern Argentina to film the reality TV show "Dropped" for French broadcaster TF1. Known as the "little girl of the Atlantic," Arthaud was the daughter of Jacques Arthaud, the director of the Arthaud publishing house. "Brave and brilliant, nothing was impossible," added Robertson of Arthaud.
