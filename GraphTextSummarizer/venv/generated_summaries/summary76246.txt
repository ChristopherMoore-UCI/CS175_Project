Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage, admitted at the start of the trial Tuesday that he was the shooter at the Fort Hood medical building where soldiers were being prepared for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. Fort Hood witness on Hasan: 'His punishment will come' Logan Barnett told the court his initial thought when he heard the shooting and the screams was that it was a training exercise because of a deadly shooting earlier at a mental health clinic at Iraq's Camp Victory. Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions Investigations that followed the Fort Hood killings found Hasan had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. Prosecutors allege the devout Muslim had undergone a "progressive radicalization," giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime.
