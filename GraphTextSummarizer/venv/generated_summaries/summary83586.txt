This city's anti-tech backlash took a new turn Sunday when protesters lashed out at Google Ventures partner Kevin Rose, waving banners outside his home while demanding that Google fund "anti-capitalist" communities in the Bay Area. Most of the anti-tech fervor has focused on big-name companies such as Google and Twitter and the private bus systems that ferry their employees from the city to various corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. The post demands that Google give $3 billion to an anarchist organization so it can "create autonomous, anti-capitalist, and anti-racist communities throughout the Bay Area and Northern California. After Rose's last startup was acquired by Google, he went to work at Google Ventures, where he helps decide which startups the company's venture-capital arm will invest in. In a tweet Sunday he noted as "odd" their use of Google products, such as Android phones and YouTube, to tape and share videos of the protests.
