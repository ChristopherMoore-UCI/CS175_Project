In the judgment released Friday, Judge Stan Strickland -- as quoted in a court transcript from January 2010 -- ordered Anthony to serve "a year of supervised probation, once released." "Miss Anthony has not received permission to move to another state." -- A Florida judge ruled Friday that Casey Anthony must serve one year of supervised probation for a check-fraud conviction, saying that failing to carry through on a "lawfully imposed sentence" would be a "mockery of justice. Anthony's defense team responded with a motion saying she cannot serve probation again when she has already served it behind  bars, claiming that would violate the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth  Amendment. " Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. said that Anthony has to report to a state Department of Corrections facility in Orlando no later than noon on August 26, though she can report earlier.
