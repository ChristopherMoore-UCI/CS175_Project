Most donated goods are sold at Goodwill stores, but prizes such as the Dali are auctioned online -- to maximize their value, said Munroe, who works for Goodwill's online department. Stolen Salvador Dali painting returned from abroad "This is probably the real deal," Munroe said of her discovery of the Dali work. An appraiser retained by Goodwill also confirmed the authenticity of the Dali, and the charitable organization also ensured the art wasn't stolen, said Amanda Bedell, spokeswoman for Goodwill in Tacoma, Washington. When a signed piece of art arrives at a donation center, Goodwill sets it aside for special review, Munroe said. "Across the board they thought it was ugly," said Shea Munroe, who sorts the art and collectibles donated at Goodwill Industries in Federal Way, Washington.
