-- New York Police investigators are probing whether three men arrested last week with a stash of Apple products possibly bought with gift cards altered with stolen credit card data may have ties to a broader network of scammers, a law enforcement official said. Law enforcement officials and experts said altering gift cards, or other so-called stored-value cards, is a favored way for scammers to launder money and stolen credit cards. Rather than making new fake credit cards with the stolen data, thieves use gift cards to avoid detection since cashiers are less likely to be suspicious. They also had a stash of 39 gift cards with magnetic strips that had been altered to carry stolen credit card data, according to court documents. Point of sale machines in stores read the magnetic strip data and won't detect that a gift card is carrying stolen credit card data.
