After 12 people were killed Wednesday during a lunchtime attack on the offices of a Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, an illustration was posted on the Instagram account @Banksy, which has about a million followers. The drawing shows a sharpened pencil with the word "yesterday" written above it, followed by a broken pencil with the word "today" and a final image marked "tomorrow," with the broken portion of the pencil sharped to create two pencils. Clerc tweeted her tribute to the dead, among whom were several respected political cartoonists, with the caption "Break one, thousand will rise #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie #raiseyourpencilforfreedom." The caption on the Instagram says "RIP." The elusive artist Banksy is known for producing powerful imagery, so it makes sense that more than 100,000 people would share his Instagrammed tribute to those killed in Paris on Wednesday.
