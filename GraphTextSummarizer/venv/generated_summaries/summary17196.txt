Buttu was speaking from Nazareth, while Mark Regev -- the Israeli spokesman -- was in Jerusalem. "What every (Israeli) government spokesperson has been doing has been defending the collective punishment that they've meted out on thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank," Buttu said. The tension of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be felt on CNN on Saturday morning when a prominent Palestinian-Canadian human rights attorney refused to appear on screen with a representative of the Israeli government. Buttu was highly critical of Israel's airstrikes in response to the West Bank kidnappings, but did condemn Palestinians who are calling for a third intifada, or uprising. On CNN's "New Day Saturday," Diana Buttu -- a former legal adviser to the Palestinian Liberation Organization -- said she would not go on television at the same time as "an Israeli government spokesperson who defends the indefensible."
