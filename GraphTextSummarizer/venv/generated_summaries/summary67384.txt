The FBI says that after he left America, Shukrijumah started off as an al Qaeda dishwasher, doing menial tasks at training camps. Shukrijumah worked at odd jobs, including selling used cars, and took classes in information technology and chemistry at a small college in South Florida. He was killed in a raid in South Waziristan on Saturday, Pakistani army spokesman Asim Bajwal said on Twitter. An FBI counter-terrorism agent linked Shukrijumah to the thwarted New York subway suicide mission in fall of 2009 in the biggest post-9/11 terror investigation. He was indicted by New York authorities in 2010 over an alleged plot to have two men blow themselves up in the city's subway system.
