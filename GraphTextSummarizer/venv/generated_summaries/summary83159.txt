The helicopter crashed at about 5:23 a.m. ET about 12 miles northeast of Palatka, Florida, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. It identified those employees Monday as cardiac surgeon Dr. Luis Bonilla and procurement technician David Hines. "We recognize the commitment our transplant teams make every day in helping patients at Mayo Clinic and beyond. "As we mourn this tragic event, we will remember the selfless and intense dedication they brought to making a difference in the lives of our patients," said John Noseworthy, Mayo Clinic's president and CEO, in the statement. "Mayo is working internally to support the family and employees of those lost in this unfortunate tragedy," the clinic said.
