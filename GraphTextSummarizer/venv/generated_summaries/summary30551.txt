They never imagined it could more than make up for the income they were losing because Aidan's father, Wiley Reed, had to take unpaid time off  to be with Aidan during treatments. Wiley Reed is back at work but takes unpaid time off when Aidan has a doctor's appointment. " "He's a great artist, but I never thought he'd be famous at 5," adds Reed, who lives in Clearwater, Kansas, and gave birth to Aidan's little brother, Amry, just 12 days after Aidan's cancer diagnosis. Aidan's art is of monsters -- green ones, black ones, scary ones, silly ones. "Usually Aidan tells us if he's hurt himself or run into something, but he couldn't explain these bruises at all," Reed says.
