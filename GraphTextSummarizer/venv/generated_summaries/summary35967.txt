-- Former "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and wife Kayte Walsh Grammer are expecting twins, the actor said Sunday. Grammer, 56, married the 32-year-old former flight attendant in February in New York, just after Grammer's divorce became final from his third wife, Camille Donatacci, who appears on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." Grammer also told the CNN host that his "parting gift" to his third wife was her role in the reality series "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." "Whether or not it worked well for her doesn't matter," Grammer said. Grammer currently portrays Chicago Mayor Tom Kane in the Starz series "Boss." He closed his Globes acceptance speech by thanking his wife "for the future and what a magnificent year it's been." Grammer and Donatacci had two children -- Jude, now 7, and Mason, 10.
