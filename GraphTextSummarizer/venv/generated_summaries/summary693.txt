Arab News, a Saudi English-language daily newspaper based in Riyadh, reported that Judge Hamad Al-Razine said that "if a person gives SR 1,200 [$320] to his wife and she spends 900 riyals [$240] to purchase an abaya [the black cover that women in Saudi Arabia must wear] from a brand shop and if her husband slaps her on the face as a reaction to her action, she deserves that punishment." Women in the audience immediately and loudly protested Al-Razine's statement, and were shocked to learn the remarks came from a judge, the newspaper reported. Saudi women's rights activist Wajeha Al-Huwaider told CNN that Saudi women routinely face such attitudes. "This is how men in Saudi Arabia see women," she said in a telephone interview from the Saudi city of Dahran. -- Husbands are allowed to slap their wives if they spend lavishly, a Saudi judge said recently during a seminar on domestic violence, Saudi media reported Sunday. Domestic violence, which used to be a taboo subject in the conservative kingdom, has become a hot topic in recent years.
