White House officials were apoplectic in 2011 when Netanyahu lectured Obama in the Oval Office about the history of peace talks and warned him not to fall prey to "illusions." Alistair Baskey, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Obama and Netanyahu have "forged an effective partnership, and consult closely and frequently." Still, irritants have long tested the alliance between Washington and the Jewish state â€” over peace talks, wars in Lebanon and Gaza, settlements and Israeli military action in places like Iraq and Syria. "I fervently hope that under your leadership that will not happen," Netanyahu told Obama in a White House photo-op this month. "When the president discusses Israel and Iran, it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is America's friend and who he thinks is America's enemy," House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday. Personal relations may be fraught now with Netanyahu, but Obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military U.S. aid to Israel which amounts to $3 billion a year.
