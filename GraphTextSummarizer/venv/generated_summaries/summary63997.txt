French and Turkish officials have been outspoken in their criticism of the Syrian regime's behavior, and some key international diplomats, such as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, said Thursday that the ongoing attacks on government buildings in Syria "look like a civil war. Syria has accepted "in principle" an Arab League plan to permit observers into the country to verify whether the regime has taken measures to protect civilians, a senior Arab diplomat said Friday. France's top diplomat called the state of affairs in embattled Syria "no longer tenable" Friday and wants the U.N. Security Council to step up and grapple with the eight-month-long crisis in the turbulent Arab nation. Still this morning, in the north of Syria, several villages were bombarded by the Syrian army. Syria's failure to make promised reforms had led to a peaceful opposition "morphing" into one that was, at least in part, well armed and prepared to take action against the Syrian government, she said.
