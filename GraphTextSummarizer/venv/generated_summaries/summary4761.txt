" Gay -- who recorded the fastest 100m time this year when he ran 9.79 seconds in Florida in June -- was expected to be one of the main challengers to Jamaica's reigning world and Olympic champion over 100 and 200 meters Usain Bolt. American sprinter Tyson Gay will miss the remainder of the athletics season after undergoing surgery on a hip problem. Gay, 28, will now miss the world championships in Daegu, South Korea, which are set to get under way on August 27. "Dr. Marc Philippon from the Steadman Philippon Research Institute in Colorado in the USA, performed an arthroscopic procedure to address an impingement in Tyson's right hip and to correct a labral tear that has been bothering him for some time," read a statement from Gay's manager on the IAAF web site. The U.S. national record holder has also set the second and third fastest times ever over 100m, behind Bolt's world record of 9.58 secs.
