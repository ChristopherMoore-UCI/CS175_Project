"The actions of Ocala's community leaders, its law enforcement professionals, our neighbors at Jumbolair and its surrounding communities have offered us the dignity to grieve the loss of our son and Ella's brother in peace," the letter said. -- John Travolta, in a letter thanking his Ocala, Florida, neighbors for sympathy shown in the wake of his teenage son's death, asked them to love their friends and family "like there was no tomorrow. " Travolta and Kelly Preston were vacationing in the Bahamas with their children when son Jett died. "Comforting words, thoughts and prayers of Ocala's citizens have made an impossibly painful situation, a little less painful." Since returning from the Bahamas, the family has remained inside the gated Jumbolair Aviation Estates -- a fly-in community on the outskirts of Ocala.
