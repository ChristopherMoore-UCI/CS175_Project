Inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen tale "The Snow Queen," "Frozen" told the story of two sisters, Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), and how an impressive but isolating gift of Elsa's almost came between them. Disney's new short, "Frozen Fever," will focus on Anna's birthday as her sister, Elsa, and rugged love interest Kristoff "are determined to give her the best celebration ever." The film will reunite the award-winning creative team behind "Frozen," including "Let It Go" songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and will bring the film's central characters back to life. Don't worry, hug-loving snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) is returning for "Frozen Fever" too, and there'll be a new song. But, Disney's statement warns, "Elsa's icy powers may put more than just the party at risk."
