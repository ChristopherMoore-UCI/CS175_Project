But, in those cases where illegal immigrants squeak by and wind up on the job, U.S. workers have to compete with them, like it or not. Run by the Department of Homeland Security, that program lets those employers who choose to participate verify the validity of Social Security numbers provided by new hires. As I've said for the last 15 years of writing about immigration, those who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted and jailed. They do -- sales taxes, property taxes, even income taxes thanks to something called an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number), which Uncle Sam helpfully created to allow those who don't have valid Social Security numbers to still dread April 15. According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2007, DHS commissioned an independent study of the program, which found that "the database used for verification is still not sufficiently up to date to meet the requirements for accurate verification."
