"Not Jim." Regardless, Gorham says of his art, "The phone case is a commentary on both the curious nature of the mobile phone case industry and of the modern dependency and/or addiction to mobile technology." To this, Gorham notes, "Like most mobile phone cases, it does offer the illusion of individualism." His creation was actually inspired by arguably one of the weirdest (and most brilliant) people ever, Salvador Dali, who, in 1936, designed a fully functioning Lobster Telephone. At the time, Dali called his creation of a painted plaster lobster attached to the receiver the Aphrodisiac Telephone, presumably just to mess with people. Anyway, whether or not you would walk around with Gorham's modern version of Dali's lobster phone is a moot point.
