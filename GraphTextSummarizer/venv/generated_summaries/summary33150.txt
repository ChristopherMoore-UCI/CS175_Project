Both women started the match nervously losing their opening service games, but it was Bartoli whose game suddenly gelled while Lisicki, appearing in her first Grand Slam title, wilted under the pressure on a sweltering Center Court. Lisicki, who stunned Serena Williams in the fourth round, fought to the end holding serve in the seventh game and breaking Bartoli as she served for the match in the next. France's Marion Bartoli has claimed the women's singles title at Wimbledon with a crushing 6-1 6-4 victory over Sabine Lisicki. The 28-year-old, a losing finalist against Venus Williams in 2007, swept aside her German opponent in one hour 21 minutes to claim her first Grand Slam title. Bartoli becomes only the second French woman to win Wimbledon in the open era, following in the footsteps of Amelie Mauresmo who won in 2006.
