Ted Turner has donated $1 million to help save endangered gorillas in eastern Congo, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund announced. Turner's donation comes as the Fossey Fund works to build three new field stations and hire 30 new staff near the conflict zone in Congo, formerly called Zaire, that is the Grauer's habitat. His donation is aimed at helping to protect Grauer's gorillas in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the fund said. The fund was founded by Fossey, the famous naturalist who was murdered in 1985 in Rwanda. "It comes down to this: every single gorilla counts; every single person counts in protecting the gorillas; and every single dollar counts in supporting the work to protect the gorillas," Turner said, according to the Fossey Fund.
