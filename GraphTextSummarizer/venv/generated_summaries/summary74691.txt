Liberman announced his resignation last December, a day after the Ministry of Justice said he would be charged with breach of trust and fraud. -- Former Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman was acquitted Wednesday of corruption-related charges. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding Liberman's post open for him until his return. Prosecutors said he pushed to get the Israeli ambassador to Belarus posted to another country after the diplomat allegedly handed over confidential information that included details of a secret police inquiry regarding Liberman. His ultra-nationalist party is especially popular with immigrants from the former Soviet Union, where Liberman was born and raised.
