When I made that movie almost 20 years ago, I hoped that the film would be a warning to other cities that this corporation was intent upon removing jobs from this country and taking them to Mexico and Brazil and other places. When Roosevelt came in and when World War II faced the country, Roosevelt said to General Motors and Ford, you're not going to build cars anymore. Filmmaker Michael Moore says the collapse of General Motors could mean the loss of millions of jobs. If General Motors collapses, then there goes hundreds of thousands of jobs, if not millions of jobs of the ripple effect of this. I'll tell you, you know, I'm of mixed mind about this bailout, Larry, because I don't think these companies, with these management people, should be given a dime, because  that's just going to be money going up in smoke or off to other countries.
