"Over and over again, courts have said that states cannot block people from getting preventive health care at Planned Parenthood, and the vast majority of the American public agrees," said Cecile Richards, president of the nonprofit's Action Fund. In signing the bill, Daniels and other state officials said other options existed for Medicaid patients seeking reproductive health care. Of those, 5,580 received abortions, but most were given basic reproductive health care, including contraceptives and health screenings. The justices let stand a lower court decision that had blocked patient reimbursement through Medicaid for health providers that perform abortions as part of overall medical care. Indiana officials asked the Supreme Court to intervene, but the justices declined without comment.
