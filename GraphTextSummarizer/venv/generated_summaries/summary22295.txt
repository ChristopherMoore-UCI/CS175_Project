I thought about him last week, when millions of Gmail users found out that, without notice, they were temporarily cut off from Google's e-mail service. But today, whenever there is an unanticipated short silence -- cell service goes temporarily dead, e-mail or text messaging or social networks cease to function because of an electronic burp somewhere -- it gives us the occasion to reflect upon how quickly we have gotten used to the new way, with our messages coming in and going out continually and seamlessly, day and night. So if 10 percent of them could not send or receive e-mails, that, potentially, could be as many as 35 million people. "Why?" "Who do you think carried more electronic equipment?" Did it feel like a snow day -- like getting an unexpected vacation from constant digital dutifulness?
