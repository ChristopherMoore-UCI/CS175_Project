The head of Naval Warfare Special Command had warned Navy SEALs against betraying their promise to maintain secrecy just days ahead of a SEAL's  "60 Minutes" interview defending his publication of details from the Osama bin Laden mission. While Losey does not mention the bin Laden raid directly, it's the publication of those details and the mission to free the captured sailors of the Maersk Alabama in 2009 off the coast of Somalia that have gotten much publicity. The claims in the Esquire article were met with skepticism by those in the SEAL community who said the close quarters and darkness and intense shooting made it difficult to determine whose bullets killed bin Laden. The admonition is seemingly directed both at Matt Bissonnette -- who revealed his role on the 2011 bin Laden mission with "60 Minutes" on Sunday -- and at a SEAL at the center of an upcoming Fox News documentary. SOFREP has identified the so-called "shooter" of bin Laden, who was the unnamed subject of a Esquire magazine article last year and whose identity will reportedly be revealed in an upcoming Fox News documentary.
