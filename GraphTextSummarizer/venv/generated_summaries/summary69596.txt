Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan Army sources. -- Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday, warning instead that government troops intended to continue a new offensive until the group surrenders, a senior government official said. The proposed cease-fire came six days after the Sri Lankan army launched a new offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) in the country's northern area. Tamil demonstrators call for a cease-fire in Sri Lanka during a rally Saturday in Paris, France. We do not recognize this so-called offer," said Lakshman Hulugalle, director of Sri Lanka's Media Center for National Security.
