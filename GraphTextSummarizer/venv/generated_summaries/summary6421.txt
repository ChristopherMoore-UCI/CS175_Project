"Let us hoist the Palestinian flag to the sky, and this should be a symbol of justice and peace in the Middle East." Erdogan put an end to decades of relative Turkish isolation from the Arab world. "Our Palestinian brothers should declare an independent state," Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced to an assembly of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo. In a move that is sure to win support on the streets of many Arab cities and towns, the Turkish leader continued his diplomatic offensive against Israel. "They [Israel] should pay the price for these attacks and crimes they committed," Erdogan said, reminding the audience of the botched May 2010 Israeli commando raid against a Turkish-led humanitarian convoy sailing to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. Erdogan repeated his vow to take Israel before the International Court of Justice for the deaths.
