Sure, some critics have expressed reservations about Elena, noting that she is not getting her own movie like the other princesses, and that she is on Disney Junior channel, not the more popular Disney Channel. Consider Elena's series will be rolled out in 25 languages on Disney Junior channels, in 154 countries around the world. But most importantly, Elena -- a princess meant to reflect "diverse Latin cultures and folklore," says Disney -- will offer young Latina girls an opportunity to see themselves in the media that they consume. From Sleeping Beauty to Snow White, the Disney princesses are a staple of pop culture -- fantasy heroines iconic to generations of young girls. Just like other American girls.
