In an uncharacteristically personal address, Apple CEO Tim Cook is speaking out about civil rights, saying equality for all is "at the core of my beliefs and values. In a dramatic football game two weeks ago, Auburn defeated archrival Alabama when the Crimson Tide attempted a game-winning field goal with one second remaining, only to see Auburn's Chris Davis return the missed kick 109 yards for an improbable victory. " The speech came when Cook was accepting a lifetime achievement award from Auburn University, his alma mater, in New York City last week. Apple is one of several Silicon Valley companies that have been vocal on civil issues like immigration reform, nondiscrimination and same-sex marriage. Apple has donated money to the fight against California's Proposition 8, which would have banned gay marriage.
