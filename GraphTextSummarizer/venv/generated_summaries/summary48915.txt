Saudi Arabia has its own designs, Bahrain, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and, of course, Dubai. The kingdom is the world's top oil producer -- making an estimated $2 billion from oil exports last year. Abdulkarim Abu Al Nasr CEO of NCB, the region's biggest bank John Defterios (JD) sits down with Abdulkarim Abu Al Nasr (AN), CEO of NCB, the region's biggest bank and begins by asking him how Saudi Arabia can help the lowest levels of society to benefit from the record oil prices. I think also there are different players for example the financial centre in Saudi Arabia is predominantly bringing financial intermediaries together in a compound. It is a different play than for example the one in Dubai or in Qatar.
