The plan explains that, "It is possible to stop new HIV infections among children and keep their mothers alive if pregnant women living with HIV and their children have timely access to quality life-saving anti-retroviral drugs." In August, the U.S. government announced that anti-retroviral AIDS medicines could reduce the transmission of the disease from infected to non-infected partners by 96%. One of the programs that could suffer is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, otherwise known as PEPFAR. Started in 2003, the program began by providing $15 billion over five years to combat AIDS around the globe through testing, counseling and medical treatment. By 2009, a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that in African countries receiving PEPFAR funding there had been a 10.5% reduction in the AIDS death rate.
