In some Maine cities, voters voiced support earlier this month for recreational pot legalization, while the initiative was defeated in other regions. A new Maine-based activist group released a detailed proposal on how to legalize recreational marijuana this week, potentially adding Maine to the growing list of states nationwide where use of the drug is permitted. These efforts by Legalize Maine, based largely on an agenda of statewide economic growth, mark the second attempt in the state in recent months to put pot before voters in 2016. Laws in these places remain hazy, as consuming marijuana is still listed as a Schedule 1 narcotic under federal law. The goal is to give at least 75 percent of these licenses to owners of small farms in an effort to cultivate statewide industry.
