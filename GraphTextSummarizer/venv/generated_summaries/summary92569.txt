Spanish league strike called off His central defensive partner Pique is suspended after picking up his fifth yellow card this season in Barca's final league game of 2010, the 5-1 thrashing of city rivals Espanyol on December 18. " Spain's top two clubs will also line up in midweek for the second leg of the Spanish Cup last-16 ties, with Barca away to Athletic Bilbao and Real traveling to Levante. Coach Pep Guardiola has given top scorer Messi permission to miss Sunday's home clash with Levante as his side seek to move five points clear of second-placed rivals Real Madrid in the La Liga standings. Bilbao will be hoping to pull off a shock after earning a 0-0 draw at Camp Nou this month, but Levante have little chance of overturning an 8-0 first-leg deficit. "I had never been in a session attended by so many people," Real's former Getafe winger Pedro Leon said.
