Hamlisch 'a trouper to the end' Hamlisch was a musical director and arranger of Streisand's 1994 concert tour and television special, and had recently worked on a musical adaption of the production of "The Nutty Professor," a musical comedy directed by Jerry Lewis. His legacy leaves us with a treasury of songs and stories that will always be familiar to theater-goers as they stir up meaningful and heartfelt emotions," said Charlotte St. Martin, League Executive Director. Manhattan's 40 Broadway theaters are expected to turn down their lights at 8 p.m. ET for a total of 60 seconds in symbolic tribute to the man who composed acclaimed scores for the Pulitzer Prize-winning "A Chorus Line," as well as "They're Playing Our Song" and "The Goodbye Girl." His musical ensembles and "old-fashioned" style made him a favorite with Hollywood elites, theater-goers and dignitaries, and earned him three Oscars, four Grammys, four Emmys, a Tony and three Golden Globe awards -- one of only 11 people ever to do so, according to The Broadway League, a trade group for the industry. -- Broadway's bright glow will dim for a moment on Wednesday in memory of the late Marvin Hamlisch, a prolific American composer who died this week after a more than four-decade long career that spanned film, music, television and theater.
