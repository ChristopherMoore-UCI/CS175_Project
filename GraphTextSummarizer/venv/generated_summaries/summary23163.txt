-- Afghan police have intercepted 41 children whom insurgents were planning to use as suicide bombers, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Tuesday. Four suspected insurgents were about to smuggle the children across the mountains into Pakistan from eastern Kunar province on Friday, said Sediq Seddiqi, the spokesman. Earlier this month Afghan forces rearrested two children in Kandahar province on suspicion of planning to be suicide bombers. The two were from a group of would-be suicide bombers who were pardoned by President Hamid Karzai last summer, according to a press statement from the Kandahar governor's office. Afghan and foreign forces have arrested many would-be suicide bomber children in the past.
