-- An earthquake shook southern Iceland on Thursday, reportedly causing injuries and damaging roads and buildings. Although Iceland is seismically active, its last major quakes were on June 17 and June 21, 2000, with quakes of 6.5 and 6.4, respectively. It was unclear exactly how many people were injured or the severity of their injuries, Olli Tynes, a journalist with Reykjavik's Channel 2, told CNN. A seismograph at the Institute of the Earth Sciences, University of Iceland, shows earthquake activity. "They thought they were going to die." There have been no reports of homes collapsing, as most homes in Iceland are built to withstand earthquakes, he said.
