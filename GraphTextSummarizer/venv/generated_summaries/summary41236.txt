For example, TeliaSonera rolled out LTE services in major Nordic and Baltic countries including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Sweden last year with speeds that blow US 4G offerings out of the water: "In normal circumstances, the average download speed is 20-80 Mbit/s." German mobile provider Vodafone is offering LTE service with 7Mbps speeds on the low end while also offering downloads up to 50Mbps on more expensive plans. The whole country is moving to 4G -- next generation wireless -- and according to some carriers, this is our chance to beat the world in broadband. That's not to say wireless speeds in the United States aren't improving; indeed, they are beginning to match the speeds of lower-end broadband connections. While these speeds do bring next-generation mobile broadband up to the standard of wireline broadband connections, the FCC found that the average wired broadband speed is between 3 and 4 Mbps. Driving adoption of next-generation technology is essential for America's communications to catch up with the rest of the world; our broadband networks, by most standards, stand in the middle of the pack on speed.
