-- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Friday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who asked for the latest news on the hurricanes plaguing U.S. coasts in recent weeks. Condoleezza Rice and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi discussed the weather Friday at their initial meeting. European companies have had much greater access to Libya's energy sector, but Libyan officials say the improved relations with the United States will result in more deals with American oil companies, including exploring vast areas of the country that remain untapped. The two are expected to meet in the leader's Bedouin tent he favors for high-profile meetings Rice's visit marks a 180-degree turn in relations between Washington and Tripoli, which for more than three decades have been marked by personal animosity and insults, Libyan terror attacks and U.S. airstrikes. In her meetings with Libyan officials, Rice is expected to raise the issue of political prisoners, especially Fathi al-Jahami, a leading Libyan reformer held in detention since 2002.
