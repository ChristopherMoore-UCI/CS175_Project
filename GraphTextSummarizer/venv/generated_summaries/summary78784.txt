In what his campaign billed as a "major foreign policy speech" Monday, lasting about 20 minutes, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney took on President Obama's handling of protests in Iran after disputed elections three years ago. CNN's Christiane Amanpour, on the streets of Tehran, reported on "riot situations, lots of marches, people shouting 'Down with dictatorship.'" Scores, or even hundreds, of riot police were deployed, and there were "running battles between some of the street protesters and some of the riot police," Amanpour reported. It is "up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be," he said, adding that "we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran." The facts: Obama's initial response to the protests became a source of controversy at the time, and his political enemies have brought it back up at various times since. Conclusion: During the first couple of days of the protests and violence, Obama did not weigh in publicly, but by a few days in, he was not "silent" -- and a week later, took a tougher stance.
