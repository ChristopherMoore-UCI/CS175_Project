It was also a show about movie reviewing, movie embracing, movieGOING. But well before "Sneak Previews" and well after Siskel's death, Ebert reveled in film and shared his enthusiasm with others. More than once, Ebert wrote about the experience of seeing films as a reverie and escape. They reveled in film in ways that appealed to the aficionados -- folks who knew who Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael were -- and to the masses, popcorn-loving audiences who didn't care so much about art as wanting to be entertained for two hours. When TV viewers first saw Ebert -- whether it was on "Sneak Previews," his and Gene Siskel's national PBS movie review show, or "Siskel & Ebert & the Movies," the widely syndicated version -- they latched on to the look: a slightly rumpled, sweater-vested guy with glasses, paired off with the much taller, balding Siskel (who, of course, was "the bald one").
