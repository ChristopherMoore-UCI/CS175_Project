Writer and director Kevin Smith recently gave an update on the project while speaking with "Clerks" star Jeff Anderson (aka "Randal") on his podcast, saying that if all goes well, "Clerks III" will have a June start for production. After confirming that he nailed down financing earlier this year, Smith said during his podcast that "there's plans in motion," and that Jay (Jason Mewes) and his own Silent Bob will be in the third installment of his 1994 cult classic. Smith wrapped up the script for "Clerks III" last May, but struggled with finding support. Anderson has also read the script, and added that the third "Clerks" is a mix of the previous two. -- The news about "Clerks III" just keeps getting better.
