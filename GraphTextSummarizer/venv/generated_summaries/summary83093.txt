The romantically challenged, conspiracy theorist, temperamental Munch was a cop concerned with civil rights and a penchant for self-deprecation. Between the reprisal of the role on various "Law and Order" spin-offs and his many guest spots in character, Belzer parlayed Munch into one of the longest running roles in TV history. Munch appeared in nine different television shows, and that doesn't even include the time "Sesame Street" turned Munch into a muppet to solve alphabet-related crimes in the Special Letters Unit, or when he popped up on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Fear not, Munch fans, this isn't completely the end of the line. The original character, like much of "Homicide," was at least partially based on a real-life detective, but Munch was given an edge by comedian-turned-actor Belzer.
