Facebook looked at photos that are reported for removal by all ages, flagged for offenses like being pornographic, containing hate speech or depicting drug use. There are links to catch anyone who may be feeling suicidal and direct them to professionals and Facebook's own suicide chat hotline. "Language really matters and design really matters for this stuff," said Jake Brill, a Facebook product manager. By expanding the options and directing people to ask the person who posted a photo to take it down, Facebook is putting its members in charge of their own issues and saving itself some resources as a bonus. -- Communication on Facebook started with the simple, emotionally vague "poke."
