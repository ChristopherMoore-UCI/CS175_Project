By Saturday night, snow accumulations had reached up to 7 inches in some areas and had slowed down operations at Will Rogers World Airport. Last year, there were 10 reports of property damage, Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said Saturday. The flooding began last week when warmer weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, causing the Red River to swell. Waters had reached 36.8 feet -- just two-tenths short of cresting level -- by Saturday night, the National Weather Service reported. Near one area of the river bank in Moorhead, a mound of packed snow several inches high sat across from a flooded and impassable underpass.
