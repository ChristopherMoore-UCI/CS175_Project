In time for hurricane season: Furloughs in forecast at NOAA U.S. airports don't stack up with global competitors CNN's Kevin Bohn and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report. -- After a typo-related delay, legislation was signed by President Barack Obama Tuesday to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs that caused widespread travel delays last week. Thousands of flight delays were attributed to the furloughs last week. The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts that allows it to stop furloughing controllers. In rare bipartisan accord, U.S. lawmakers passed the measure Friday, capping a major congressional initiative as delays snarled traffic at airports.
