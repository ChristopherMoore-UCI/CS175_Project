At least 2,500 people have been reported killed in drug violence this year in Ciudad Juarez. Twenty-seven people were killed in September 2009 in two attacks at separate drug facilities in Ciudad Juarez, the bloodiest city in the nation. Officials said the previous attacks were done by drug gangs killing members of other gangs. The attack in Juarez was reminiscent of an incident in January, when drug cartel gunmen stormed a house party and killed 15 people.
