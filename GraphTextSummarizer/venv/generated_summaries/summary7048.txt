The U.N. report says several statements from Taliban leaders in 2011 pledging greater efforts to avoid civilian casualties "neither resulted in improved protection of civilians nor minimized civilian casualties." In addition to casualties, the number of Afghan civilians displaced by conflict soared last year. Altogether, the U.N. Assistance Mission concludes that "the unremitting toll of civilian casualties coupled with pervasive intimidation affected many civilians directly, and many more indirectly, by fueling uncertainty, tension and fear. While NATO can take comfort from the fact that its forces -- and its allies in the Afghan National Army -- caused fewer civilian casualties last year, it is clear that overall security for civilians has not improved. -- A United Nations report blaming a record loss of Afghan civilian lives last year on insurgents and the Taliban was dismissed as "untrue" by a Taliban spokesman Saturday.
