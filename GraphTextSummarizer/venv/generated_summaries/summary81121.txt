In addition to Tebow, the Patriots said Saturday that they released 12 other players and placed veteran safety Adrian Wilson on injured reserve. -- Backup quarterback Tim Tebow was released by the New England Patriots on Saturday after failing to make the final roster for the new season. NFL teams had until 6 p.m. ET Saturday to reduce their rosters to a maximum of 53 players before the season kicks off Thursday. In three NFL seasons, Tebow, who was waived by the New York Jets in April, has played 35 games and completed 48% of his passes. Tebow, who was signed to the Patriots in June, made the final 75 earlier in the week but lost out in the final cut.
