The fight has exacted a heavy toll in the North Caucasus region where Chechnya is located, and has now spread to other regions of Russia. In addition, Chechen rebels held 700 audience-members hostage in a Moscow theater in 2002. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly different cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians. A Chechen rebel leader took the responsibility for the deadly bombings that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow in March. Local Russian news agencies reported from the Chechen capital, Grozny, that the parliament resumed its work hours after the incident and held a planned session to discuss the republic's budget.
