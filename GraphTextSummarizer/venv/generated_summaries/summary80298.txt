The cross-party royal charter follows months of talks between the industry and lawmakers on how to establish a system of independent press self-regulation, following an inquiry last year into press ethics led by Lord Justice Leveson. -- UK newspaper and magazine publishers lost a High Court bid Wednesday to block the progress of a government-backed royal charter on press regulation. The Pressbof challenge was made "in the context of a wholly unfair and irrational process leading to a recommendation and decision that has the potential profoundly to affect the nature of press regulation in this country," according to a statement filed with the court. "Now is the time for a proper complaints system which is effective and independent of press and politicians which does not infringe the freedom of the press," she said. The newspaper publishers argued that they were not properly consulted about the rival royal charter, which has cross-party political support.
