McConnell also made clear that he opposes generating more revenue through higher taxes to tackle the deficit and debt problems. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, suggested mandatory caps on government spending and a balanced budget amendment as possible reforms to accompany a measure raising the debt ceiling. A few minutes after McConnell spoke, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, noted that Republicans and Democrats have widely differing views on how best to strengthen the nation's fiscal situation. "We're going to require as a condition for raising the debt ceiling something really important about the debt," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters. "We're only talking about doing this if we can be assured there are guarantees in place that spending doesn't get out of control again," Cantor said of allowing more borrowing by the federal government.
