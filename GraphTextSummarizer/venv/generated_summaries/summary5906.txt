Huffington Post now has editions in six countries, launched a HuffPost Live streaming network last year and has plans to expand into Japan and Brazil. "I am obsessed with stress reduction," said Huffington. " In more than three decades since moving to the United States, Huffington's influence on public life has grown exponentially. She rejects political definitions of left and right (although she is widely viewed as a staunch liberal these days), but has plenty of advice for President Barack Obama. The Huffington Post has a new "Less Stress More Living" lifestyle section and the company recently launched an iPhone app called "GPS for the Soul," at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
