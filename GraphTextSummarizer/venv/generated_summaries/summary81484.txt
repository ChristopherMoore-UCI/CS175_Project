News of the party had gone viral on social media before Friday, authorities said. "Last night, scum wreaked havoc in our community," Haren Mayor Rob Bats told CNN affiliate NOS. Prior to Friday's mayhem, Oscar Dros, the town's chief of police, said he had contacted authorities in Germany to discuss their own experiences with riots. Prosecutors said 34 people were arrested Friday night and Saturday morning after rioters torched at least two cars, threw stones and smashed storefront windows. Prosecutors said revelers began arriving Friday afternoon, though some appeared "ready and prepared for confrontation."
