Sending astronauts that far into space would be too challenging, costly and grueling without it, says space engineer John Bradford, whose Atlanta-based company SpaceWorks wrote the study for NASA. " Mars rover reaches key destination Lighter, easier, happier Getting astronauts to hibernate like bears makes the mission much easier and more affordable, Bradford says. MAVEN spacecraft enters Mars orbit to explore its climate change A short-cut Therapeutic hypothermia would also allow space agencies to pack more astronauts into one ship. But doctors usually induce it for only three or four days at a time, not the 180 days it would take for astronauts to get to Mars, nor the 180 it would take to get back to Earth.
