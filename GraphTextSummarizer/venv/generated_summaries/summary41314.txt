"From what I'm understanding, they thought they were going to elope," Obermiller's father, James Obermiller, told HLN's "Nancy Grace" on Wednesday night. An anonymous tip alerted investigators early Wednesday to a New London apartment rented by Obermiller's boyfriend, identified by police as Robert "Bobby" Young, three weeks ago, according to police. Young had denied knowledge of Obermiller's whereabouts, according to police, saying the messages were a week old and were sent over Memorial Day weekend while the couple coordinated a swimming date. According to Fulton, Obermiller repeatedly sent messages to Young asking, "How much longer?" Abbi Obermiller has been charged with obstructing official police business and being an unruly child.
