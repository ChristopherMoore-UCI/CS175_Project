For years after Dean's death, there were young men all over the United States who went to Penney's for one reason: They believed -- the rumor was widespread -- that the T-shirt for which Dean was known was a Penney Towncraft T-shirt. Their conviction about Dean and the Penney Towncraft T-shirt was like the unshakable conviction among young Americans in the early 1960s that the lyrics to "Louie Louie" were dirty. James Dean did it once for Penney's, without even trying. It was what James Dean -- born in Marion, Indiana, smack dab in the middle of J. C. Penney country -- favored. Penney's, at least in their minds, was James Dean Land.
