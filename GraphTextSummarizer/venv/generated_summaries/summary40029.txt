Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. He recently transitioned from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas to outpatient care, the Army said on June 22. Bergdahl, the U.S. soldier held captive for five years by militants before his release in May, has ventured several times off an Army base in Texas as part of the effort to get him used to everyday life in America, a military spokeswoman has said. Still, Bergdahl has hardly left the care of military health professionals. Yet while investigating circumstances surrounding his departure, the military has also said it's focused on making sure Bergdahl gets better mentally and physically, so he can gradually readjust to normal life.
