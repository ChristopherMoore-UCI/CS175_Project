-- Lego boss Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, who pulled the iconic toy brand back into profit, says Europe needs to face up to its harsh economic reality. However, he says, Europe is entering a phase where raw material costs could increase while the availability for cheap labor around the world will decline. Lego lost its way in the late 90s and went deeply into debt before rebounding to double digit growth under Knudstorp's leadership. " Knudstorp says Lego went too deeply into debt, as Europe has also done. At Lego, Knudstorp will be focused on ensuring the company adapts to the changing economic conditions, which he believes are crucial to ensure survival.
