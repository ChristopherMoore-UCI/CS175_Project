"This was, put simply, the killing of our citizen while in the custody of Pakistan jail authorities," the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. -- A man from India died in Pakistan early last week from a beating he took in jail there days before. Sarabjit Singh was incarcerated in Lahore, after a Pakistani court convicted him of spying for India in connection with terror attacks in Pakistan in 1991. Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry reacted to Ranjay's death with indignation. Late last month Singh was hurt in "a scuffle with fellow inmates," according to Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry.
