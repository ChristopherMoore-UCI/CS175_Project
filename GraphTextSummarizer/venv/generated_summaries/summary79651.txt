According to the Trevor Project, an organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ youth, suicide is the third leading cause of death for 10- to 24-year-olds, and its the second leading cause of death on college campuses. This is why an openly gay NBA player should be news, because it busts stereotypes, normalizes homosexuality and gives kids of all orientations a positive role model of self-love and professional excellence. It is vital to the situations in which it's important — namely, in looking for a mate — but it has nothing to do with job performance, whether your job is as a secretary or a professional basketball player. Opinion: Here's to Collins -- and the NBA I applaud his career and his bravery, and I look forward to the day that sexual orientation is a non-issue. I'll bet that Jason Collins will be the first in a string of professional athletes to openly acknowledge their homosexuality.
