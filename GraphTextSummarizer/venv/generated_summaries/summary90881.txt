The 26-year-old has been joined on the sidelines by France striker Karim Benzema and Brazil defender Marcelo and the trio look certain to miss this weekend's match as well as the clash with English Premier League Spurs. Ronaldo, who has scored 27 goals in 27 league matches this season, has a hamstring problem which could see him miss Tuesday's European Champions League quarterfinal first leg against Tottenham Hotspur in the Bernabeu. When asked whether the duo, who have been ruled out of Saturday's English Premier League clash with Wigan, would feature against Real, Redknapp told Spurs' website: "We'll have to wait and see. Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp also has injury worries, with winger Gareth Bale and central defender William Gallas both doubts for the Madrid clash. " Tottenham, currently fifth in England's top flight, are battling with Roberto Mancini's Manchester City for fourth position and a place in next season's Champions League.
