The proceeds from both the festival and the album go back to Johnson's Kokua Hawaii Foundation to promote conservation efforts in Hawaii. Johnson and his wife, Kim, are natives of Hawaii, and for years they have been champions of conservation, environmental awareness and education both in their native state and around the world. Another element that mirrors Johnson's efforts on tour: There are free water refill stations to encourage the use of reusable water bottles. The Kokua Hawaii Foundation supports environmental education in schools and communities throughout Hawaii. More than 50 eco-friendly businesses and local environmental groups set up shop in the Kokua Village, which is much like what Johnson does on tour.
