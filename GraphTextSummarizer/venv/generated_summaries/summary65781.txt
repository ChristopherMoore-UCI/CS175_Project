-- A leading figure in the party poised to head Italy's next government says a return for the country's previous Prime Minister, controversial politician Silvio Berlusconi, would be a "disaster." Democratic Party Vice Secretary Enrico Letta's comments come as Berlusconi's popularity surges in the Italian electoral polls after seemingly being out of the race. With a contracting economy and GDP falling 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012; Italy is still grappling with the economic mess Silvio Berlusconi left in his wake before resigning in late 2011. A victory for Berlusconi "would create mistrust between Italy, its European partners and the markets," Letta told CNN. She rejected Letta's assertion that a return for the 76-year-old Berlusconi would destabilize Italy's economy.
