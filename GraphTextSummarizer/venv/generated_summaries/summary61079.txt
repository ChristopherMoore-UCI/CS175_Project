It's a species of fungi that can be found in many regions of the world and can decompose polyurethane, a common plastic that is used to make things like insulation, synthetic fibers, plastic for electronics and sealants. The Yale students had discovered that Pestalotiopsis microspora fungus can break down plastic. "Growing up in a world where pollution is going to be a big issue in the future, coming up with creative ways to tackle it, gets me excited," Russell says. Scott Strobel, the Yale biochemistry professor who instructed Anand and Russell during these experiments, says because of this discovery, the future looks promising for all types of plastic pollution. However, Russell warns that this is not the ultimate solution to solving plastic pollution.
