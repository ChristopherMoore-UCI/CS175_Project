Prior to his opening round Woods spoke publicly for the first time about his romance with Vonn, which the couple confirmed on Monday with statements and photos posted on social networking site Facebook. Woods carded an opening round of three-under-par at the Bay Hill course in Florida, to sit in the chasing pack behind leader Justin Rose, who shot 65 to finish on seven-under. The Englishman fired six birdies and an eagle in his round and though Woods' performance was more solid than spectacular he scrambled well to remain within striking distance. "Those were key because I had just thrown away a couple of shots I gained on 16," Woods said. The recent focus may have been on his new relationship with world champion skier Lindsey Vonn but Thursday saw the start of Tiger Woods' quest to reclaim golf's world No. 1 ranking.
