The Romanian third seed, who was runner-up to Sharapova at Roland Garros, will play Zarina Diyas from Kazakhstan. Only an handful of matches were completed on Saturday as rain swept across the grounds at SW19. Compatriot Nadal dropped the opening set for the third straight match before steamrollering Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan 6-7 (7/4) 6-1 6-1 6-1. The five-time champion, who lost in the second round at Roland Garros last month and in the fourth round at the Australian Open in January, looked to be on course for another routine win after taking the opening set 6-1 in a rain-interrupted match. -- Serena Williams continued her miserable run at grand slam tournaments in 2014 crashing to defeat against France's Alize Cornet in the third round at Wimbledon on Saturday.
