Felix Magath's side clinched their fourth straight victory and fifth in the last six games to return to second place in the table, just one point behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen. However, Kevin Grosskreutz popped up to win it in injury time with a shot that deflected past Cologne goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon. -- In-form Borussia Dortmund made it five straight wins on Sunday with a topsy-turvy 3-2 Bundesliga victory at Cologne having looked like they had thrown the three points away. Meanwhile, Kevin Kuranyi's goal early in the second half was enough for Schalke to beat Nuremberg 1-0 at home to continue their good recent form. That goal sealed victory for the visitors -- who remain fifth in the table, five points off the pace.
