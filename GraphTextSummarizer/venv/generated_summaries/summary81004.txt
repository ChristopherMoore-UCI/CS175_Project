Kim Sears, the fiancee of finalist  Andy Murray, was caught on camera mouthing off -- apparently about his semifinal opponent, Czech player Tomas Berdych. The match was a tense one from the beginning, with much of the pre-game narrative focusing on Murray's ex-coach, Dani Vallverdu, who is now in Berdych's corner. The outburst, which came during Murray's ill-tempered four-set (6-7 (6) 6-0 6-3 7-5) win against Berdych, has been making the rounds. Murray's opponent dismissed talk of bad blood between him and the Scot, saying he was simply trying to pump himself up after winning the first set. "When there's a lot of tension surrounding something, which you created, it's completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight," he told media following the match.
