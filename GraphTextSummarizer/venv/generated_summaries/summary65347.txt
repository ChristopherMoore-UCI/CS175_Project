"Anti-trafficking researchers targeting street children estimate that Pattaya hosts about 1,500 to 2,000 homeless and impoverished children per year, while numbers are increasing. Thailand's immigration bureau revoked the visa of Mikhail Pletnev because it believes he poses threats to the country, according to Maj. Gen. Pansak Kasemsan. "Pattaya in particular has developed an international reputation for child sex tourism," the nongovernmental organization says on its website about the town two hours south of Bangkok. Children search for work, migrating -- alone or with their families -- from Thailand's northeast provinces, Cambodia, Burma, Laos and Vietnam. Pletnev was arrested and charged July 6 with raping the teenage boy in the Thai beach town of Pattaya, where he owns a house.
