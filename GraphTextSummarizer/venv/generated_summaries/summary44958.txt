And China is a major obstacle, resisting pressure on the North on human rights because of fears it may increase refugee flows across the Yalu River, which runs along its border with North Korea. First, we should remain consistent in highlighting the North's record in all diplomatic discussions, including with the North Koreans. Americans and other foreigners have also opened a window to the suffering of the North Korean people, including Mike Kim, a young Tae Kwon Do expert who opened a string of martial arts studios in China as cover to help North Koreans defect. His book, "Escaping North Korea," is a stunning story of tragedy and heroism. American, Japanese and South Korean governments have all at one time or another decided that pressure on human rights might distract from diplomatic negotiations over the more dangerous threat from the North's nuclear weapons program --which is, of course, one of the reasons the North wants nuclear weapons.
