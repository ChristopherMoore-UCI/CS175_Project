Karman is a leader of the protest movement in Yemen that is calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. Authorities arrested Tawakkol Karman over the weekend, accusing her of organizing anti-government protests in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. Known as one of the most-prominent rights activists in Yemen, she has helped to organize several protests that have drawn hundreds of demonstrators. Karman was arrested under a warrant for leading unlicensed student protests in Sanaa last week, according to a statement from the interior ministry. People in Yemen are upset because the parliament is considering loosening the rules on presidential term limits.
