As the crisis hit developed economies, investors turned to emerging markets, which promised higher returns than depressed Western markets. The government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, now a presidential candidate, was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from Europe and emerging markets such as Russia and China.

Many developed countries struggled with growth after the global financial crisis. That forced Turkey's central bank to ratchet up its interest rates from 7.7% to 12% -- showing the bank's determination to prevent foreign capital outflows.
