The men police believe were responsible for his attack -- Marvin Norwood, 30, and Louie Sanchez, 29 -- pleaded not guilty last month to felony charges related to the beating. The critically injured man also was able to give his birth date and say he wanted to see Tabitha and Tyler. Stow was also able to say the name of his son, Tyler, the family said. In the parking lot, two men confronted Stow and -- unprovoked -- began kicking and punching him while yelling profanities about the Giants, police have said. According to the family, when speech therapists asked Stow his first and last name, he responded.
