Words were uttered such as "France is our oldest ally" (a historical fact but a hurtful truth to hear for the British, the U.S.'s most loyal ally), however, they didn't manage to hide the increasing discomfort felt by public opinions both in the U.S., France and the world at large. So far though, despite the fact that 68% of the French oppose the participation of their country's troops in an intervention in Syria, FranÃ§ois Hollande has stood firm with strong words coming both from the ElysÃ©es Palace and France's foreign affairs minister Laurent Fabius. Although applauded by the wider world community, France's statement was attacked by American Republicans with a violence that both astounded and saddened French opinion. A debate over the question of Syria in French Parliament last Wednesday, granted by the president but without a vote, furthermore revealed how divided within itself France is. Many observers in France can't help thinking that Hollande seeks on the world stage the charisma and legitimacy that he lacks at home.
