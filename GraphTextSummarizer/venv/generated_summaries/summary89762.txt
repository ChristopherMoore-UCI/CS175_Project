This debate followed testimony Wednesday by Thomas Pontarelli, a Bolingbrook, Illinois, neighbor of Peterson's ex-wife Kathleen Savio and one of those who found her dead in a dry, clean bathtub on March 1, 2004. Later, prosecutor Kathy Patton brought up the time Peterson questioned Pontarelli about whether he'd changed the locks of Savio's front door, asking him, "Did there come a time when you felt intimidated by him?" "Yes," Pontarelli responded. Peterson's letter to the media Peterson, now 58, was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Kales, who later became Peterson's fourth wife. Pontarelli testified Savio had asked him to put a lock on her bedroom door and also that Peterson had once challenged him about the front door locks at Savio's house being changed, which Pontarelli insisted he didn't do. The night of March 1, he said Peterson -- a police officer in Bolingbrook who was barred from seeing Savio by a protective order -- called the Pontarelli house to say a locksmith was coming to get in his ex-wife's house.
