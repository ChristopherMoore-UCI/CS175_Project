On Saturday, Carter will meet with U.S. military leaders, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the nation's CEO, before going to Bagram to meet U.S. troops. He will visit U.S. troops in Kandahar on Sunday and then leave for Kuwait, where he'll meet American military leaders, troops and Kuwaiti leaders. The new U.S. secretary of defense, Ashton Carter, arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday morning and plans to meet with U.S. troops and Afghan leaders. When asked about ISIS activity in Afghanistan, Carter replied: "I've seen the reports of people essentially rebranding themselves as ISIL here in Afghanistan as has occurred in other places. "The reason for this destination, Afghanistan, in my very first week in office as secretary of defense is because this is where we still have 10,000 American troops and they come first in my mind always," Carter told reporters on the plane before it landed in Kabul.
