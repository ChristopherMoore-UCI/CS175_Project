Incoming Republican Senate Foreign Relations committee chairman Bob Corker will be a vital player, as he has voiced skepticism of the president's Iran diplomacy in the past, while being more pragmatic than other Obama critics on sanctions. "At the end of the day, the president needs to lift sanctions through Congress in order to make a deal possible." The politics on Iran are getting trickier for Obama by the day. U.S. and Iranian negotiators are quickly approaching a November 24 deadline to reach an agreement that would freeze Iran's nuclear program in return for lifting international sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Russia steps up nuclear plans in Iran as talks near deadline Obama would be sure veto any legislation that could threaten the agreement. "Like North Korea in the 1990s, Iran will use a weak deal as cover to get nuclear weapons," said Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, a prominent skeptic of the negotiations.
