Morsy said no one has visited him except for EU Foreign Affairs Representative Catherine Ashton, a delegation of the World Elders Organization and four investigators, "whose questions I refused to answer because their interrogation is a violation of the constitution. "I am still the legitimate president of the Egyptian republic," Morsy said, according to the statement read by a lawyer who was part of a team of Muslim Brotherhood attorneys who visited with him in prison. Under Egyptian law, criminal courts appoint a lawyer if a defendant refuses to engage one. Lawyers plan to challenge the court's jurisdiction on the grounds that the country's president shall not be tried without the consent of parliament, El-Damaty said, according to Ahram Online. Egypt's state-run news agency Ahram Online said Tuesday that the five-member delegation included his son, Osama, and that they urged Morsy to name a defense lawyer.
