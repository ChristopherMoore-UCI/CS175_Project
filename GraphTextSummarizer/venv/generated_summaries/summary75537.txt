The motive behind the killings at Oikos University in East Oakland remained a mystery Monday night, Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told reporters. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said most of the victims appeared to be from the city's Korean-American community, and the city was working to find multilingual counselors to help survivors. The college, which caters to the Korean American Christian community, offers degrees in theology, music, nursing and Asian medicine, according to its website. The suspect took one of the victims' cars and drove off, but surrendered to police at a Safeway grocery in the Oakland suburb of Alameda a short time later, Jordan said. Jordan said the relationship between the suspect and any of those shot remained unknown Monday night, as detectives combed over "a very bloody scene with lots of evidence.
