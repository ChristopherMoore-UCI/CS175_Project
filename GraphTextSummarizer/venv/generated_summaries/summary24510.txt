Brenner's final request, according to family spokesman Jeff Abraham, was to have $100 in small bills tucked in his sock -- "just in case tipping is recommended where I'm going." Comedian Joan Rivers, a longtime friend of Brenner's, tweeted about the news of his passing Saturday. Comedian David Brenner, a regular on Johnny Carson's "The Tonight Show," has died after a battle with cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday. "RIP David Brenner. His gravesite will read: "If this is supposed to be a joke -- then I don't get it!," according to Abraham.
