Now authorities are investigating the case as a theft, arson and hate crime, police said Tuesday. Annibali, the police chief, said his agency moved quickly over the weekend following the cross burning, which occurred on a Friday, and is now working with the FBI, the California Department of Justice, San Luis Obispo County District Attorney's investigators and the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Department. At 12:30 a.m. on March 18, local police and firefighters were called about the cross-burning. The mystery of who stole the cross and set it afire has deeply disturbed the small coastal town of Arroyo Grande, located midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. " Annibali said police never called the cross-burning a "prank," saying that word was misattributed by local media.
