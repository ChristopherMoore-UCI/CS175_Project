"As a result of the efforts made by Israel and Egypt, and accommodated by the United States, Egypt has agreed to release Ilan Grapel," the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. After Grapel's arrest in June, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel Radio he had no idea why Grapel was detained. Grapel speaks Arabic, which he studied at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and he spent his junior year at Ben Gurion University in Israel. Israel denies Grapel is a spy. The U.S. State Department said in June that Egyptian authorities provided the United States with "almost immediate consular access" to Grapel.
