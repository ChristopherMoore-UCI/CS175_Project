Fernandez, who is in his 80s, was the U.S.-trained head of the Cuban military force that defeated the U.S.-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs, said CNN analyst Carlos Alberto Montaner. Diaz-Canel who, was minister of higher education, Granma said, was replaced by First Deputy Minister Rodolfo Alarcon Ortiz, Granma said. Miyar is considered the last Fidelista -- or loyalist to former Cuban president Fidel Castro -- in Raul Castro's government, Montaner said. As president, Raul Castro has been creating a communist government of technocrats rather than political leaders, Montaner said. The communist government's state council announced Thursday the removal of Jose Ramon Fernandez Alvarez as vice president of the council of ministers, according to state-run Granma.
