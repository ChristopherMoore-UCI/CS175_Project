"That's why public financing of campaigns has not been wildly popular, as shown by the relatively low number of taxpayers who use the checkoff box on their tax forms to allocate money to the system that Obama has opted out of." Indeed, since public financing of general elections first came into effect for the 1976 campaign, the percentage of taxpayers choosing to contribute to the presidential election fund has steadily declined. For his part, Obama argues that he opted out of public funding because "the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system." Obama is the first presidential candidate to reject public funding since the creation of the post-Watergate campaign finance system. -- Sen. Barack Obama's decision to reject roughly $85 million in public financing -- as well as the strict spending limits that would accompany those funds -- did not come as a surprise to most political observers. The entire system must be updated." Common Cause issued a statement noting that "Sen. Obama did say at one point that he would opt into the system if his opponent did the same, and for that he gets a demerit."
