Michaele Gedeon, president of Haiti's Red Cross, said she heard the voices of distraught children as rescuers tried to calm them while she was on the phone attempting to coordinate emergency rescue efforts. Rescue personnel planned to continue working into the night to dig out students and teachers buried in the rubble, the Red Cross said. Claudon said hundreds of bystanders and rescue workers were digging through the rubble, but "what we need right now is heavy search-and-rescue equipment." Claudon later said, "local authorities are doing their best." Fifty to 60 patients, 30 of them severely injured, were taken to Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, said Isabelle Mouniaman Nara, the head of mission in the capital for Medecins sans Frontieres. The school is in an extremely poor part of town, and the roads are nearly impassable, local journalist Clarens Renois said. Most of the students at the College La Promesse Evangelique range in age from 10 to 20, he said, but there are younger ones as well.
