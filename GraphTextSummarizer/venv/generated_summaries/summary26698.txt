-- A New Hampshire teenager accused of killing a woman and severely injuring her daughter during a brutal home invasion was found guilty Tuesday of first degree murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Steven Spader sat emotionless as the verdict was read in the trial for the gruesome murder of Kimberly Cates in Mont Vernon, New Hampshire, last year. " A medical examiner determined Cates, a 42-year-old nurse, had died from "multiple sharp injuries to the head, torso, left arm, and left leg." Spader, 19, was convicted of breaking into Cates' home and hacking her to death with a machete, while his friend, 19-year-old Christopher Gribble, repeatedly stabbed her 11-year-old daughter Jaimie as she tried to defend her mother. "I could go on for days about the depth of your depravity," said Judge Gillian Abramson.
