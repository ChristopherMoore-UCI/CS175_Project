-- A flurry of late birdies helped American Jason Bohn secure his second PGA Tour title at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans. Both players had boycotted the event in the last two years due to the state of the greens but agreed to return after moderations to the course by South African golfer Ernie Els. Bohn fought off the challenge of fellow American Overton, who finished second ahead of Troy Merritt, on 16-under. Bohn's only other tour success came at the B.C. Open in 2005 and since then he has had a number of injuries, including surgery on his back. Bohn recorded birdies at three of the final four holes to finish on 18-under and stave off the challenge of second-placed Jeff Overton by two shots.
