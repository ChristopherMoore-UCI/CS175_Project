-- Tribal leaders in Falluja called Tuesday on people who fled weekend fighting between al Qaeda-linked fighters and government troops to return, a signal efforts were underway to dial back the violence that has raised questions about the ability of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to hold Iraq together. Even as Sunni tribal leaders issued the call, government troops took up stronger positions within sight of the city, according to a journalist in Falluja working for CNN. Some suggested the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), formerly the group commonly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, is in partial control of the city, which is situated roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad, in the volatile province of Anbar. The government said this weekend that the Iraqi army shelled Falluja in an effort to clear out the al Qaeda-linked fighters. The journalist working for CNN has seen people moving freely in and out of Falluja, though Sunni tribal forces are manning checkpoints.
