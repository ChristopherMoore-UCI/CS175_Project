This January, the EPA published emission standards for new power plants that make it all but impossible for coal plants to be built (even though few coal plants were planned, given the recent natural gas boom). Time magazine's Michael Grunwald, who wrote a book about the bill, argues that it was the largest green initiative in American history, pouring $90 billion into clean energy technologies, energy efficiency, upgrades to the electrical grid and a whole host of other efforts that could have a significant impact on carbon emissions over time. Sen. John McCain had sponsored a bill to create a cap and trade system for carbon emissions, which at the time was considered a conservative solution to the problem, as it utilized market forces to control emissions. American efforts to reduce emissions will be for naught if other countries don't take action as well -- China passed the U.S. a few years ago to become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and continues to build coal plants at a furious pace -- and Kerry's tenure will be judged in no small part by how much progress he can make in this area. Ask a climate scientist, and you'll get a depressing take on our future, where things like moving from coal to natural gas do only the tiniest bit to delay what could be catastrophic consequences of climate change in decades to come.
