Ishant Sharma gave India early breakthroughs in the morning, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan chipped in with vital wickets and Amit Mishra completed a four-wicket haul as India cantered to victory with a session to spare. But that attacking intent was nipped in the bud when batsman Mohammad Ashraful attempted to drive Ishant on the up, only for an edge to be neatly snapped up by Rahul Dravid at second slip. Mishra should have had another wicket but Yuvraj dropped a simple catch from Shafiul Islam, extending the tailenders stay. Shakib Al Hasan was Mishra's first victim of the day and Mahmudullah went shortly after, losing out to Zaheer. Tamim helped Bangladesh recover somewhat from those early blows, the opener hammering a wayward Shanthakumaran Sreesanth for two boundaries in one over and reaching his third Test half-century with a reverse sweep of Mishra.
