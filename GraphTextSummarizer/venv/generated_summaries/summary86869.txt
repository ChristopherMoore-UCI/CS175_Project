Of the blasts, the deadliest was in Rawalpindi where a suicide bomber joined a Shiite processional, police official Shahid Hussain said. At least five people were killed and 28 wounded when a bomb detonated in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood, said Wazir Khan Nasar, a police official. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for a series of bombings a day earlier that left dozens dead, primarily Shiite Muslims gathering for a revered religious mourning period.
