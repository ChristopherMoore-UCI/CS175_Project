This summer, Google took some flak for booting users who had used fake names on the 7-month-old site. If Google flags a new name as inappropriate, users will be able to appeal and provide documentation, from a driver's license to appearances in media to "proof of an established identity online with a meaningful following" -- presumably something like a blog or Twitter account. Starting this week, users will be able to add a nickname alongside their real name, Horowitz said. Facebook policy also requires users to register for the site with their real names. Only about 0.1 percent (one/tenth of one percent) submit name appeals, he said.
