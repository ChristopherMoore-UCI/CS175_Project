-- At least 10 people living in a squalid refugee camp in the capital of Bangladesh died in a riot and arson attack Saturday, police and other government officials said. After Bangladesh gained independence, Pakistan refused to repatriate most of the Urdu-speaking people and they remained stranded in refugee camps. He said about 300,000 Urdu-speaking people live on government land in around 70 shanty towns, known as "Bihari camps. Khan who heads the Stranded Pakistanis General Repatriation Committee (SPGRC) told CNN about 2,000 people were living in the camp when it came under attack on Saturday. During the partition of India in 1947, several hundred thousand Muslims, mostly from the Indian state of Bihar, came to Dhaka and other cities in what is now Bangladesh.
