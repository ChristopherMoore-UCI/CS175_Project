-- Federal jurors convicted the son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor Sr. of torture and conspiracy charges Thursday, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of Florida. Charles Taylor Sr. is standing trial in The Hague, Netherlands, on war crimes charges. Charles "Chuckie" Taylor Jr., also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel, was found guilty on one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to commit torture and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, said Alicia Valle, special counsel to the U.S. attorney. Taylor's case, tried in Miami, Florida,  was the first brought under a 1994 United States law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court. In the initial indictment, Taylor was charged with one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.
