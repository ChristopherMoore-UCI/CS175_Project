Instead, Danmell Ndonye must participate in a year-long psychiatric program and spend 250 hours in community service for lying to police about what was a consensual sexual encounter with four of the five accused men, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said in a written statement. Ndonye said she did not engage in sexual activity with Rondell Bedward, the only one of the men who attends Hofstra University. Rice said she retains the option of filing criminal charges against Ndonye if she fails to complete the course of therapy or community service. -- Criminal charges will not be filed against the 18-year-old college freshman who falsely accused five men of raping her in a dormitory bathroom at Hofstra University, an official said Friday. Hofstra University has suspended Ndonye.
