The government rejected the rebels' claim on state-run TV on a banner reading, "Damascus airport is functioning normally, and the highway to the airport is fully secure. At least 165 people have been killed Saturday across Syria, including 60 in Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. The airport is "the gate of death that supplies the regime in Damascus and its suburbs with more tools to kill the Syrian people," said Abu Eyaad, spokesman to the Revolutionary Military Council in Damascus and its Suburbs in an audio message posted late Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday called for ongoing support of the opposition's "current momentum" via non-military aid to Syrian rebels in a speech in Washington. A Syrian government information minister said Friday that "terrorists" -- which is how the Assad regime refers to rebels in a bloody, ongoing civil war -- cut the cable, knocking out Web communication with other countries.
