-- Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez wants a third clash with Manny Pacquiao following Saturday night's successful defense of his WBA and WBO lightweight titles. However, one stumbling block to a rematch is that Marquez wants it at the weight limit of 140-142 pounds, while Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach says he wants to fight at 147. However, Pacquiao doubts that the public wants to see him fight Marquez again, The Philippine Star reported on Sunday. We will put a lot of work into it, and a third fight is what the public wants to see," Marquez told reporters after beating Katsidis, whose brother Stathi -- a horse-racing jockey -- died last month. Following his win over Antonio Margarito two weeks ago, Pacquiao has been linked with a bout against American veteran Shane Mosley, who he has yet to encounter.
