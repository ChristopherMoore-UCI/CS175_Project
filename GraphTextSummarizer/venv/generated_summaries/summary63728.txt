In other ATP Tour action, fifth seed Gilles Simon beat French compatriot Gael Monfils 6-4 1-6 7-6 Sunday to win the title in Marseille. Rafael Nadal insists he is on the "right path" in his latest comeback but his defense of the Rio Open title was ended in a late night defeat to Italy's Fabio Fognini -- snapping an incredible record in ATP Tour semifinal matches on his favorite clay surface. The 27-year-old Fognini, who had himself been kept on court late Friday night in his last eight clash with Argentine Federico Delbonis, will be bidding for his fifth ATP Tour title, but has never beaten Ferrer in seven previous matches. Nadal had racked up 52 straight wins over 12 years to reach title matches, but the battling Fognini ended the streak with a 1-6 6-2 7-5 victory. But returning to clay in Brazil, the world number three was a firm favorite to repeat his success of last year and had a winning 4-0 record over Fognini going into their last four encounter.
