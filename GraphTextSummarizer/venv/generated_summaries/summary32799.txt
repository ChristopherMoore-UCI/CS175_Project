This week, cellular carriers released details about a trio of upcoming smartphones, all of which run an older version of Google's Android operating system. Customers will have to pay an extra $20 per month to use the feature, which adds 2 gigabytes of wireless internet usage, the carrier said on Wednesday. Since releasing that version, Google launched another called Gingerbread, which powers a Samsung-made phone called the Nexus S. Google held a news conference on Wednesday to say developers are close to releasing the first device that will run the next Android, called Honeycomb, this month. AT&T announced a March 6 release deadline for the Atrix 4G, a Motorola Mobility "transformer" phone that grabbed the spotlight at the Consumer Electronics Show last month. It's similar to Samsung's several other Android handsets, but this one is compatible with T-Mobile's faster data network.
