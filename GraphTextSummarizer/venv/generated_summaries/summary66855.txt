The judge could decide whether the boy stays in foster care under Arkansas state custody, goes to his grandmother's home in Florida or goes to McCready's home, CNN affiliate KARK reported. -- Embattled country singer Mindy McCready fought for custody of her son in an Arkansas courtroom Friday, a little more than a week after she was accused of fleeing with the 5-year-old and refusing to return the boy for days. On December 1, a Florida judge issued an emergency "pick up" order for young Zander McCready. This custody battle became national news after McCready took her son from her mother's Florida home in late November and had asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety. Days after the order, McCready was found by authorities hiding in a closet with her son in a home in Arkansas.
