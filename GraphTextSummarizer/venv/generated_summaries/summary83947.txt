Soundgarden were the crusty hard-rock true believers amid alt-rock's self-appointed revolutionaries: If Nirvana wanted to shred your world and Pearl Jam strove to redeem it, Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, bassist Ben Shepherd and drummer Matt Cameron wanted to take you out in the woods with a six-pack and headbang to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Naturally, its centerpiece moment is its heaviest: "Blood on the Valley Floor," where sumptuously evil riffs fall like redwoods as Cornell spools out images of war as mindless decadence. But "King Animal" was recorded by sober dudes in their forties -- the hymnlike "Bones of Birds" is about the challenges of parenting, and "Halfway There" is a matter-of-fact take on class stagnation: "Something to eat?/I would say you're doing better than most, though maybe not as well as some," Cornell observes. The album follows their root sound down all kinds of mossy paths -- from the South Asia-meets-New Orleans blues burn of "Black Saturday" to "A Thousand Days Before," a snake-hipped meditation on the impermanence of life. King Animal shows they haven't forgotten how to stomp out the jams: Thayil is still a warlock guitar conjurer of the first order, and Cornell rolls around his multi-octave vocal range like some kind of backwoods metal-Mariah.
