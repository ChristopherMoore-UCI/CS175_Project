Green and Senreich are joined in the venture by "The Bachelor" director Ken Fuchs, former president of Dimension Films, Richard Saperstein, commercial director Stephen Kessler and the full-service video network DBG. -- Seth Green and Matt Senreich, known for their maniacally inventive manipulation of action figures on "Robot Chicken," now want the viewing public to have a similar sense of control over a real person. As we watch Tristan make breakfast, click a mouse or sit in a chair, we'll be surprised most of all by the fact that we're still watching, but Green and Senreich understand that even the most mundane moments can become fascinating from a voyeuristic distance. They'll decide what he eats, where he goes, who he dates, even the frequency and duration of his workouts, all in real time. The premise of "ControlTV" is simple: For six weeks, the life of an unemployed 20-something named Tristan Couvares is documented and streamed live on the internet for 18 hours a day.
