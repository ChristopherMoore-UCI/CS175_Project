Horrifying glimpses of the brutality underpinning the rule of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi emerged Sunday with news of a warehouse full of charred corpses and a nanny to Gadhafi's grandchildren tortured. One of Gadhafi's sons, businessman Saadi Gadhafi, made another offer to negotiate with the rebels on Sunday and sounded prepared to cut loose his father and another son once assumed to be his heir. And a senior rebel military official said about 14,000 rebel fighters were ready to "liberate" Sirte but have given Gadhafi forces there until Monday to disarm and let the rebels enter the city peacefully. And with the recent overthrow of longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have called for al-Megrahi to be sent back to prison. Spokesman Shamsuddin Ben Ali said NTC forces have taken over the western Libyan city of Ben Jawad, about 100 miles east of Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte.
