One previous high-profile appearance in an all-star charity match ended prematurely when he was tackled strongly by Gabriel Agbonlahor -- leading to a wave of abuse on social media for the Aston Villa star. Tomlinson stars alongside Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Liam Payne in the band, who are managed by music mogul Simon Cowell. -- This was a not a normal reserve team fixture for English second-tier club Doncaster Rovers. "I have really enjoyed it and I can't thank the people enough at Doncaster Rovers for having me." "I had to get fit first, because a few people saw what happened last time when Agbonlahor nobbled me and that was a bit of a mare and I had to try and avoid that," Tomlinson added.
