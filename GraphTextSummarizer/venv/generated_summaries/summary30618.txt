As Bobbi Kristina Brown remains hospitalized, her father's attorney said "we are currently investigating the events that led to (her) hospitalization." Attorney Christopher Brown also said Tuesday that the 21-year-old daughter of singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown "is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon," contrary to some reports. However, Bobby Brown attorney Christopher Brown said Bobbi Kristina was never married to Gordon. " Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. " Even before her mother's death, videos of Brown singing surfaced on YouTube and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to Houston's. Bobbi Kristina Brown was found facedown in a bathtub over the weekend.
