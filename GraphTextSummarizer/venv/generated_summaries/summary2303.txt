Muifa made landfall in North Korea as a typhoon on Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and gusty winds, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The Chinese flood control and drought relief headquarters estimated the torrential rains affected the 1.74 million local residents living in Shanghai and surrounding provinces, Xinhua said. In the city of Dalian, in Liaoning, authorities were able to avert the spill of toxic chemicals from an industrial plant after 65-foot (20-meter) waves broke through a dike protecting the area and threatened to flood the plant, according to Xinhua. The plant contains carcinogenic chemicals used to make polyester film and fabrics, Xinhua said.
