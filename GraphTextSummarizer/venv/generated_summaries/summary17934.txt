The United Nations said last week that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since a government crackdown against protesters erupted in mid-March. The reported deaths came amid tensions in Homs -- a center of regime arrests -- as military troops manned more than 60 checkpoints inside the city and surrounded it, according to the Syrian National Council, a leading opposition movement. Three people were killed in the city of Homs, where a strong military presence was reported, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group also announced, in a separate incident, the killing of Dr. Ibrahim Nahel Othman, who they described as "one of the most important physicians in the Syrian Revolution." A feared full-scale crackdown did not happen Saturday, but activists posted a video Saturday that they said showed the military harassing residents of Homs.
