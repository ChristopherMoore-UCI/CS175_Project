Through a program called Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques, or SPOT, the TSA employs thousands of "behavior detection officers" who scrutinize travelers to look for signs of "mal-intent" in airport screening areas. Allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers have come not only from travelers, but also from numerous other officers. Typical airport behavior like this could make you a suspicious traveler who should be subjected to questioning and additional screening -- and possibly referred to the police for investigation, detention or arrest. Behavior detection officers look for such micro-expressions while scanning passengers' faces or engaging in casual conversation with them. The TSA has not revealed what, if any, steps it has taken to ensure that unlawful profiling does not occur in airport screening.
