-- Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II, a San Francisco man accused of having explosive materials at his home, is in custody, an FBI source said Monday. "We don't know the intent or motive yet," FBI agent Peter Lee told reporters over the weekend, stressing there was no threat to public safety. Chamberlain, 42, was last seen Saturday south of San Francisco, the FBI said. Chamberlain was arrested in Crissy Field, a scenic waterfront area where the Golden Gate Bridge spans the Pacific entrance to San Francisco Bay, a U.S. law enforcement official said. The FBI said then that Chamberlain should be considered armed and dangerous.
