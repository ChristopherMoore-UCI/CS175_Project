Obama, who made a reference to South Korea's claim earlier this year that North Korea sank one of its vessels, said the United States "will never waver in our commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea. Obama is in South Korea for Thursday's opening of the G-20 summit, which will try to stabilize the world's financial markets. -- U.S. President Barack Obama paid tribute Thursday to American troops who 60 years ago fought a Communist regime that he said continues to be a provocative threat to peace in the region. Speaking on Veterans Day at the U.S. Army garrison in Yongsan, South Korea, the president drew parallels between America's ally and North Korea. "We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy," Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
