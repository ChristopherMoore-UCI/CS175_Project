Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, had been in talks this week with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and administration officials about how to resolve the funding impasse, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN. The Republican-led House previously passed a short-term extension, but it included a number of changes opposed in the Democratic-controlled Senate. One of the changes involves language in the House bill that would reduce or kill subsidies to rural airports, specifically targeting some in Nevada, Montana and New Mexico -- three states with influential Democratic senators. Since authorization for FAA funding expired in late July, the agency has also been unable to collect federal taxes on airline tickets -- leading to a revenue loss of approximately $30 million a day. The Senate ultimately agreed to pass the House bill, but as part of Thursday's agreement, LaHood will notify congressional leaders that he has the authority to grant waivers to affected community airports, which would exempt them from the subsidy cuts.
