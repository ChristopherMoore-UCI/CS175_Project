" If Djokovic's rise to prominence in the game from 2005 onwards was steady, his leap into Nadal and Federer's place at the top table of tennis has been dramatic. " Despite his mesmerizing run during the first five months of the season, Djokovic insists Nadal is still favorite to retain his French Open crown next month and make it six wins in seven years. He reached the quarterfinals, or better, in each of 2010's four slams and again finished the year third behind Nadal and Federer, but after leading Serbia to a landmark Davis Cup triumph over France in December, Djokovic hasn't looked back. His 33 wins have included three final defeats of Nadal, the most notable coming in the recent Madrid Masters, when Djokovic inflicted the Spaniard's first reverse on clay in 38 matches. "I don't expect myself to not lose a match throughout the whole year, but I am confident that I am a different player from last year," he said.
