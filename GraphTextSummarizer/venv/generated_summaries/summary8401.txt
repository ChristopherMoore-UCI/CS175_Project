I would establish a publication house solely for the mentioned purpose and travel around the world to become more acquainted with different cultures and produce information packages and audio-visual documentaries to bring about a better understanding to people in different countries. Some people wanted to volunteer in other countries, some wanted to find new hobbies, some just wanted to relax for a change. Living costs are low, and retirees can live comfortably in Asia or Africa while participating in community work. There is not enough time for me to talk about everything I would do. I have already decided to leave my job to be able to spend time with my kids in the most valuable time of their lives and mine.
