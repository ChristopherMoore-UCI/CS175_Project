One study by Yale University recently showed that male jurors were biased against heavy women, and more likely to find them guilty than leaner women. The willingness to ridicule obesity and make fun of appearances based on weight remains more acceptable than other kinds of biased comments that are no longer tolerated. Another reason that weight and other physical health concerns have become more important is that the job of the presidency has become much more demanding. -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made headlines last week when one of his aides admitted that he had surgery to lose weight. Given that there has been ongoing speculation about his presidential aspirations for 2016, often coupled with discussions of his struggle with weight, it is certainly not unreasonable to wonder whether these are related.
