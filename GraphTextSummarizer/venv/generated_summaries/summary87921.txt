Voice could mature into a service that competes with Skype, which has become the world's largest telephone service by allowing free calls between Skype users and cheap calls from PCs and mobile devices to overseas phone numbers. Currently, Google Voice calls use the minutes of a mobile phone plan, unlike Skype, which bypasses the voice channel by making calls using data plans. Voice also has native apps for Android and Blackberry phones, while Palm Pre and iPhone users can use the HTML5 app (including to make outbound calls). Voice, which premiered in invite-only fashion a year ago, provides you with a single phone number that directs calls to your mobile, home or work phone, depending on the rules you set. To that end, Google purchased a Skype competitor called Gizmo5 last November, which lets users make calls from their PCs to other PCs or to the traditional network.
