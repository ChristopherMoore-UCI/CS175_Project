The strangulation of JonBenet Ramsey is also among the coldest of cases. When, for example, police arrived and directed John Ramsey to search his own home, Ramsey not only found his dead daughter but also picked her up and brought her upstairs, disturbing the crime scene. The investigators' working theory was that JonBenet's mother may have struck her in anger as punishment for bed-wetting, causing the little girl's death on Christmas night. Shortly afterward, Ramsey and White found JonBenet's body in a wine cellar in the basement. Crime scene photos show two small burn-type injuries on JonBenet's head.
