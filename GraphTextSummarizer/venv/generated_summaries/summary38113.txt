But we teach all the orchestral instruments, all the band instruments, group lessons, private lessons, orchestra, adult choir, children's choir, all kinds of music groups. Flea's days of rock star excess are clearly over -- unless you count the silent auction, where a Banksy drawing of a rat fetched $100,000 and a spirited bidding war erupted between actor Owen Wilson, musician Ben Harper and producer Rick Rubin over a crayon-colored cashmere blanket that ultimately sold for $2,250. Flea: The Silverlake Conservatory is a nonprofit music school in Los Angeles where we teach music, mostly to kids, but to people of all ages -- people who are old, people with beards, all kinds of people. Unfortunately, the public school system has cut the funding to music programs, and there's a big void, so we're doing our best to fill it in our community. We're academic, teaching theory and fundamentals of music and technique on a particular instrument.
