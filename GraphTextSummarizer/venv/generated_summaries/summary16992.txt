My embed on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Elm showed me the dirty, slippery and agonizingly slow process of skimming weathered Gulf sweet crude. The Gulf of Mexico and the coastline that surrounds it is a special place to me and millions of other Americans. The rescued birds were brought to the International Bird Rescue Research Center in Buras, Louisiana, where they're cleaned, given medical care and nursed back to health. Searching for, rescuing, rehabilitating and releasing oiled wildlife is also a process that requires agility, patience and, most of all, a gentle touch. I followed fellow animal lovers on a hunt for oiled wildlife.
