-- New imagery posted on Google Earth shows evidence Iran continues to build out its nuclear sites, according to a group focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology. Last month, ISIS and other groups leaked an International Atomic Energy Agency report saying Iran continues to defy U.N. resolutions aimed at curbing its nuclear program and cited "increasing" concerns it may be developing nuclear weapons. Many world powers say it aspires to building nuclear weapons but the country says it is developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes. The Institute for Science and International Security said Tuesday it had examined updated commercial satellite imagery of Iran and found evidence of slow, but continuing, build-out of nuclear facilities. ISIS says images of the Arak heavy water reactor and heavy water production facility from June 2010 appeared on Google Earth.
