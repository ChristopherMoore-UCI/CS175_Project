-- A movie about literary merit, artistic ambition, authenticity and conscience, set in New York's publishing world, featuring stories within stories and propelled by an unreliable narrator. A scene in which he teases out a yarn -- part confession, part accusation -- on a park bench is a little master class in timing and tonal variation, like watching an expert fly-fisherman reel in the catch of the day. That's why the last time Bradley Cooper played an aspiring writer with more ambition than talent -- remember "Limitless"? These qualify as high stakes for men who sit in front of a desk all day (believe me, I know!), but they don't necessarily translate into compelling drama. This is the tale of another acclaimed novelist, Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), and his prizewinning opus, "The Window Tear," which -- wouldn't you know it? -- comes with its own, troubled back story and yet another great writer, this one played by Jeremy Irons under layers of latex and an unbecoming raincoat.
