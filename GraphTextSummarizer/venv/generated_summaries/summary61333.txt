The Israeli military says it has found a "sketch" detailing "the deployment of explosives and Hamas forces" in the Al-Attara neighborhood in northern Gaza. "The important point is the disregard for human life in using entrances to civilian homes," Halmish said. "The objective is of course to hit our forces, but a local explosion also damages the houses of the civilians and causes great damage, and likely killing civilians," he said. The IDF said the map depicts sniper positions at a mosque entrance and in nearby mosques. "That's what Hamas has been doing throughout the entirety of the operation -- perversely using civilians as human shields," said Brig.
