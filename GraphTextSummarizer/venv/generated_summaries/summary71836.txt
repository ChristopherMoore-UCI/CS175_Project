Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama. The most memorable moment came from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, who shouted "You lie" after the president said that a Democratic-sponsored health care bill would not cover illegal immigrants. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Thursday afternoon that since Wilson's comment, his Democratic opponent, former Marine Rob Miller, received 11,000 individual grass-roots contributions and raised more than $400,000. Mr. Wilson has apologized. "There were folks on both sides raising issues, asking questions." Still, it might have been Wilson's constituents' anger and distrust that contributed to the outburst in Congress, O'Connor noted.
