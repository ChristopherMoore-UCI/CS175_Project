-- I'm standing in the secret Amsterdam apartment where Anne Frank and her family spent two years hiding from Nazis during the Second World War. It's an arrest I saw happen -- along with more than a thousand other people watching a spectacular new stage show that brings Frank's time in hiding to life so vividly that some were moved to tears. Its creators hope it will become a permanent fixture, attracting some of the visitors who line up for hours to see the original annex inside Amsterdam's canal-side Anne Frank Museum. 'Glimpses of a life she never had' Husband and wife co-authors Leon de Winter and Jessica Durlacher used Frank's original writings to conjure scenes of a postwar dream life in Paris -- another stunning stage set. "The level of detail is crazy," says Robin De Levita, the show's Tony Ã…ward-winning producer, as he takes me behind the scenes, where a life-sized Amsterdam apartment block is parked, ready to roll on stage.
