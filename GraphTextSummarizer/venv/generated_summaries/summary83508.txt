Learn more about the different kinds of bariatric surgery Doctors have discovered that gastric bypass procedures have a nearly immediate effect on patients with type 2 diabetes. While the researchers noted that this was still higher than the remission rate for those who hadn't had surgery, their results illustrate an important point: "Bariatric surgery is not a 'one size fits all' approach to weight loss," says Dr. Anita Courcoulas, lead author of the new JAMA study. How bariatric surgery works Bariatric surgery works in two ways: by limiting the amount of food patients can consume and/or by preventing patients' digestive systems from absorbing some nutrients. Once feared by patients and denounced by primary care physicians, bariatric surgery has become more accepted as research shows it's not only helping people lose weight, but also reducing their risk for cardiovascular disease and reversing type 2 diabetes. More research is needed to determine which patients will be the most likely to benefit from bariatric surgery, the scientists say.
