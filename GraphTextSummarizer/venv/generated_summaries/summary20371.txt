Razan Baker told CNN that International Olympic Committee, International Judo Federation and Saudi officials had agreed that Wojdan Shaherkani could wear a headscarf during her matches. Shaherkani had signed an agreement with Saudi Olympics officials that she could compete only if she wears "correct and approved" clothing that "sticks to Islamic principles," Baker said.
