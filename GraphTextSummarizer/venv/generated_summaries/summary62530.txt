Meanwhile in Tuesday's other first round matches, Germany's Rainer Schuttler defeated Brazil's Ricardo Mello, Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain beat German Michael Berrer, and world number 13 Jarkko Nieminen saw off home favorite Danai Udomchoke. But despite serving 16 aces during the match, the 2009 U.S. Open champion's return to the game was cut short by world number 78 -- Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro made a disappointing comeback from injury at the Thailand Open in Bangkok on Tuesday, where he was defeated 7-6 6-4 by Olivier Rochus of Belgium in the opening round. " The result opens up the draw for world number one Rafael Nadal, who would have faced Del Potro in the quarterfinal. A foot shorter than his two-meter, Rochus came through a close first set and a break down in the second to book his place in the second round of south-east Asian tournament where he will play Kazakhstani Mikhail Kukushkin.
