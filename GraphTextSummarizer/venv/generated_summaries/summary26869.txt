"Prices were raised less than a year ago, but for WDW (Walt Disney Resort) it's all about supply and demand," writes Deb Wills, editor-in-chief of AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. "Our pricing reflects the high quality and breadth of experiences we offer and our ongoing commitment to investing in our parks," said Kim Prunty, Walt Disney World spokeswoman, via e-mail. Many visitors to the Disney parks purchase multi-day passes, which can decrease the daily cost of visiting the parks. "We offer a variety of ticket options that provide a great value, and find that most guests select multi-day tickets that offer additional savings."
