" FAA officials said that they do not know the extent of depression among pilots but that pilots are probably representative of the larger population, in which 10 percent are believed to suffer from depression. Under the new policy, the FAA will, on a case-by-case basis, issue special medical certificates to pilots who take one of four antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro). The FAA also will begin a six-month amnesty period, during which pilots who use antidepressants can step forward without fear of penalties. Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy. Nor does the FAA know how many pilots have removed themselves from flying status because they suffer from depression, a condition that now bars them from flying.
