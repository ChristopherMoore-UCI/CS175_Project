The purpose of using cloned animals is to improve the overall value of a given herd by creating genetic copies of donor animals, resulting in a herd that produces higher-quality milk and meat. Either way, food products from cloned animals or their offspring would not reach store shelves for years, experts said. For years, heated debate over the use of cloned animals for food production has stretched from Congress to cattle farms and dinner tables nationwide. On Tuesday, opponents of using cloned animals in food production expressed anger at the move. "While the safety of any food cannot be proven with absolute certainty, consumers should have confidence that meat and milk from cloned animals and their offspring will be safe." Experts say it is unlikely actual clones would be used in food production.
