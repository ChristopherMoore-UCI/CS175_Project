Facebook recently cut back on game developers' ability to post updates to users' walls, because people were angry that their newsfeeds were filling up with "FarmVille" spam. Facebook games immediately began bleeding users. All of this makes Facebook an extremely odd platform for games. For another, it raises an important question: What if someone finds a way to make fun games work on Facebook? But because the number of Facebook users is so huge -- over 500 million, at last count -- even a small percentage of Facebook users can make a game like "FarmVille" very popular.
