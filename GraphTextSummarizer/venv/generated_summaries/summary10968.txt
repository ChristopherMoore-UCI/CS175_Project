-- The firefighter who accidentally ran over and killed a 16-year-old girl who survived July's Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco will not be charged in the case, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Friday. A California coroner ruled that Ye Mengyuan of China was alive when she was flung from the plane that crashed as it landed short of the runway at San Francisco International Airport on July 6, but was killed by "multiple blunt injuries" moments later when run over by a rescue vehicle. That month, San Francisco Fire Department Chief Joanne Hayes-White called the girl's death "a tragic accident" and apologized to Ye's family. Two other people died as a result of the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214. Asiana Airlines: We're paying $10,000 to each passenger
