The controversial casting call document, published Wednesday by the celebrity gossip site TMZ, "pulls back the curtain" on the widely known practice of casting based on skin tone in Hollywood, a longtime manager said. " Acura spokesman Gary Robinson told CNN that the company did not know about the casting description until the TMZ story was published. Longtime Hollywood manager Roger Neal said he was not shocked that a casting director would choose based on skin tone. "We apologize to anyone offended by the language on the casting sheet used in the selection of actors for one of our commercials," Acura said in a statement to CNN. " Cathi Carlton Casting, the agency hired by Acura to choose actors, declined comment.
