Evans' attorney, Michael A. Robbins, maintains his client's innocence, citing Evans' full cooperation with authorities during the 1978 investigation into the disappearance of Randy Johnson, 16, Melvin Pittman,17, Ernest Taylor, 17, Alvin Turner, 16, all of Newark; and Michael McDowell, 16, of East Orange. Evans and Hampton are being held at Essex County Correctional Facility in lieu of $5 million bail. "The magnitude of the tragedy in the case should not diminish the very sacredness of Mr. Evans' right to a fair trail." Hampton is being represented by John McMahon from the Essex County public defender's office. Evans and Hampton also pleaded not guilty to arson charges. Lee Anthony Evans, 56, and Philander Hampton, 53, were arrested Monday night.
