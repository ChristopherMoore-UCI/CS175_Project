-- The World Health Organization plans to send 2 million vaccines to Paraguay by Sunday after yellow fever emerged there for the first time in 34 years. Anxiety has gripped the South American nation of 7 million since authorities confirmed the first cases of yellow fever there last month. "I categorically reject these kinds of irresponsible allegations," said Health Minister Oscar Martinez Doldan. Yellow fever typically is found in tropical regions of Africa and Latin America. Protesters have closed roads and started fires amid news reports that health workers were vaccinating certain politicians in their homes.
