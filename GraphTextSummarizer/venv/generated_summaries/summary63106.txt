Opinion: Why UK would miss Scotland Also in dispute: an independent Scotland's ability -- and willingness -- to contribute to Western military coalitions, which have become ever-more visible as the U.S. rallies support behind its efforts against Russia and ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. UK party leaders promise Scotland new powers ahead of independence vote In rejoining the alliance Scotland would need to commit to spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense spending, which given the uncertain economic outcome of an independence vote appears unachievable. Those regions, like Scotland, would face questions about what currency they'd use and how their economies would be structured, driving the EU -- a major U.S. trade partner -- into further uncertainty and economic turmoil. Should Scotland vote to go it alone, expect fresh questions about NATO's ability to counter Russia in Eastern Europe. Thursday's independence referendum in Scotland, and with it the possible split of the 300-year-old United Kingdom, could have consequences big and small, including in the United States.
