The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has been collaborating with health officials in numerous states since late June trying to pin down what's causing the spate of cyclospora cases. Five people have been hospitalized as a result in Nebraska, where health officials say new cases of cyclospora are reported daily. Prepackaged salad mix has been pinpointed as the source of an outbreak of cyclospora -- an intestinal illness tied to a rare type of parasite -- that has sickened scores of people in Iowa and Nebraska, health authorities in those states said Tuesday. What's happening in Iowa and Nebraska may be linked to 122 cyclospora cases in Texas, that state's department of health services said. The Nebraska alert noted that it "came through national distribution channels" and that "locally grown produce is not part of this outbreak." Fruit-related hepatitis A outbreak spreads Iowa authorities found that about 80% of those who fell ill had prepackaged salad, but the allegedly tainted product was apparently no longer on grocers' shelves by the time investigators were alerted.
