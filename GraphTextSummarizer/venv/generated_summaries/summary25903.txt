Three and a half decades after calling for homosexuals to be stoned, former Bob Jones University President Bob Jones III has apologized. " When he made the comments, Jones was part of a group of fundamentalist ministers who went to the White House with 70,000 signatures on a petition opposed to extending provisions of the Civil Rights Act to homosexuals. "We are grateful that Bob Jones III has taken responsibility for these words; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows," the group's website said. " Bob Jones University has long been a center of controversy for its fundamentalist stances. "Upon now reading these long-forgotten words, they seem to me as words belonging to a total stranger -- were my name not attached," Jones said in Saturday's statement.
