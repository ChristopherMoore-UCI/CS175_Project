This comes after more than 10,000 veterans were possibly exposed to HIV and hepatitis at three VA facilities while undergoing colonoscopies and other procedures with equipment that had not been properly cleaned. VA officials decline to say where the veteran who tested positive for HIV was treated. Thousands of other veterans are being tested at the VA hospital in Miami, and the VA says it is waiting to verify results there. It has also set up a toll-free number that VA patients and their families can call, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for additional information: 1-877-575-7256. The VA sent letters to those veterans offering free testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.
