Some have cited errors with the film's account of specific instances of the civil rights movement while others expressed outrage over the way President Ronald Reagan was depicted -- apparently some view Reagan as a deity. Apparently not, because so many people feel compelled to show us how clever they are by attempting to point out factual errors depicted in film after film. And here's the biggest thing for people like deGrasse Tyson to keep in mind: it's science fiction, for God's sake! But that's nothing compared to the recent barrage of Twitter attacks launched at the film by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. But for all other movies, filmmakers should be afforded creative license to make the movie that fulfills their vision of the story they want to tell, even ones based on real events.
