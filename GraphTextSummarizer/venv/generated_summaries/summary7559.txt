Problem is, that labeling rule only went into effect in December and stores still sell inventory made prior to it, notes Dr. Steven Wang, director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. "If you think your sunscreen is pasty, thick or smelly, you have the wrong kind," says Dr. Jeffrey Dover, clinical associate professor of dermatology at Yale University. "The incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma -- the deadliest kind -- is going up, and wearing sunscreen is one of the best ways to prevent it," says Dr. Ronald Moy, a dermatologist and spokesperson for the Skin Cancer Foundation. So to be safe as possible, you still need to reapply every two hours and after a swim, even if you used the water-resistant kind, says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. While regular tanning or getting several bad burns when you're young raises your risk of skin cancer, Moy says, what's critical is that you put on sunscreen these days.
