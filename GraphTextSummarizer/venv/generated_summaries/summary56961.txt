-- High winds whipped up a spreading wildfire in northern Texas on Wednesday as firefighters battled several blazes across the tinder-dry state. Texas and Oklahoma are the worst-hit of several states in a band of severe drought that stretches from Arizona to sections of the East Coast. Firefighters in Huntsville, in east Texas, battled a 100-acre fire. "There's still a lot of work going on and a lot of stuff that's being threatened and they are doing the best they can to protect structures," said John Nichols with the Texas Forest Service. Texas is up against its worst fire season in state history, according to officials.
