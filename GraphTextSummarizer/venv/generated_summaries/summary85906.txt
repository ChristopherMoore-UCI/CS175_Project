The administration says the gas leak occurred after a propylene pipeline was damaged by heavy machinery used to dismantle factory buildings. The death toll from an explosion at a factory in eastern China now stands at 10 people, state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing a casualty count from local government officials. At a news conference, officials in the city of Nanjing told reporters that more than 120 people had been hospitalized after a blast ripped through an abandoned plastics factory Wednesday morning. The damaged pipeline that had been funneling propylene to the factory has been shut down, it said. A statement from the state Administration of Work Safety said the explosion came when a motorist started a car engine and ignited leaking gas.
