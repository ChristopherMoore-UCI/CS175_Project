Representatives of dozens of police agencies attended the funeral for Stauffer on Friday, Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre said Saturday in a telephone interview. The wounded officer, Joseph Maher, 27, has been released from the intensive care unit at North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo and moved into a private room, Aguirre said. "Do not confront this person, notify law enforcement," urged FBI Special Agent Daniel McMullen, who added that the suspect should be considered armed and dangerous. "Almost the entire city of Tupelo lined the streets for the procession," iReporter Lee Anne Grace said Saturday.
