What's missing from the extended deal instead are NBC News and NBC Sports. When the deal was originally struck in 2012, Seacrest was named a "special correspondent" on the "Today" show, which is a part of the news division, and a contributor to NBC's prime time coverage of the Olympics, which is a part of the sports division. Seacrest told The Hollywood Reporter that "he'd like to try to continue working with both divisions and has already had conversations with NBC Sports about collaborating on the Olympics coverage in Rio in 2016, as he did the London games in 2012. 'Today' is less likely, given a morning radio schedule that has him in Los Angeles while the NBC show broadcasts out of New York." Seacrest has existing relationships with ABC, to host "New Year's Rockin' Eve," with Fox, to host "American Idol," and with NBC.
