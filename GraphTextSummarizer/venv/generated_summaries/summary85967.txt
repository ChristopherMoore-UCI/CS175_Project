California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is opting out of running for retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer's seat, he announced Monday in a Facebook post. California political observers speculated before Newsom's announcement that they two might have struck a pact where Harris runs for Boxer's seat and Newsom waits to run for Governor after his two terms as lieutenant governor. A wide array of potential contenders in both parties have expressed interest in the seat, including billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer and, over the weekend, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, another of the state's rising Democratic stars. His decision not to run focuses attention on California Attorney General Kamala Harris, another California rising star who's considered a top contender for the seat if she jumps in. While I am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office, I know that my head and my heart, my young family's future, and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the State of California --- not Washington D.C," he wrote.
