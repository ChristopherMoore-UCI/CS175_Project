All of the 17 women to qualify will be making their first appearance at the U.S. Open, with another raft of events running right through until the end of May. At The Buckinghamshire course just outside London, England, 20-year-old Amy Boulden from Wales qualified first just weeks after her first professional win. Li was one of those to make it from the United States Golf Association's first international qualifying events, which took place in America, England, China, Japan and Korea. Li, from Redwood Shores, shot rounds of 74 and 68 at Half Moon Bay Golf Club to beat the field by seven shots and book her place at Pinehurst next month. The latest name to wow the sport is 11-year-old Lucy Li, who made her own slice of history on Monday. Li already has a victory at the world famous Augusta National under her belt, having won the inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship at the Masters venue in April.
