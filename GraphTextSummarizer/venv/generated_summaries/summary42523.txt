" Evans was arrested Saturday in northwest England. One man alleged he was raped and, in a separate incident, another other man alleged he was sexually assaulted, a police spokesperson told CNN by telephone. The offenses are alleged "to have been committed in Pendleton between July 2009 and March 2013," according to a statement released by police. Lancashire police did not confirm the identity of the man, but they said they had released a 55-year-old man on bail after questioning him Saturday over offenses alleged by two men in their 20s. British Prime Minister David Cameron has been made aware of the arrest, said another source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
