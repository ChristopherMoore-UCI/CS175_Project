The increase in television watching is part of a long-term trend, said Nielsen spokesman Gary Holmes. He attributed the rise to a greater availability of televisions -- the average household has more televisions than people, he said -- and to niche programming. And while Thompson and James Webster, a communication professor at Northwestern University, say the state of the economy certainly isn't going to hurt television viewership, both experts emphasized that the increased viewership trend is several years old. " "DVR has helped keep television alive and well," said Robert Thompson, the founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. Viewers are watching more television on more kinds of screens than ever.
