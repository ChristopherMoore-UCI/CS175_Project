One measure that stalled, however, is a Missouri-like proposal that would prohibit any state employee from enforcing federal gun laws -- such as capacity limitation or registration requirements -- that don't exist under state law. The recall was viewed as a battleground between gun rights activists and gun control advocates. The issue recently arose in Iowa when the Des Moines Register exposed how state law allows blind people to receive permits to acquire or carry guns in public. Federal laws don't prohibit blind people from owning guns, but some states regulate their ability to acquire firearms. But in one extreme, Missouri sought to effectively obliterate federal gun laws, which eventually failed.
