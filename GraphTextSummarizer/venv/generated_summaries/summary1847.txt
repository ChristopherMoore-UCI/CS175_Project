Last year Kazakhstan was the world's top producer of uranium, accounting for over a third of global production. Nurzhan Nazarbayev studied in the U.S. but now works at a new hydrocarbon purification plant in western Kazakhstan. The featureless plains of Kazakhstan belie what riches lie buried beneath them. "Of course revenues from raw materials are still by far the largest share of the country's budget," says energy analyst, Murat Karymsakov. Add a boom in uranium mining to the country's raw materials portfolio and government figures reveal that 70% of its economy comes from its natural resources.
