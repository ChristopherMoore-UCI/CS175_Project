Some Morsy supporters had gathered outside the U.S. Embassy on Monday but were dispersed by Egyptian security forces, who fired tear gas at them, state-run EGYNews reported. -- Supporters and opponents of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsy clashed near Cairo's Tahrir Square on Monday, leaving one person dead and 26 others injured, an emergency official said. The clashes come nearly three weeks after Morsy, backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, was forced out of office by the Egyptian military.. Egypt has been on edge ever since, with dozens reported killed and thousands injured in protests. At least some of the clashes occurred when Morsy supporters who had been marching toward the U.S. Embassy shifted toward the square, where some Morsy opponents were, witnesses said. The embassy is about 1 kilometer from Tahrir Square.
