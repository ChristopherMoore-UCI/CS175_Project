And this is only the beginning for Baby X. This month's exhibit launches Kotak's new conceptual work, "Raising Baby X," in which Kotak "re-contextualizes the everyday act of raising a child into a work of performance art," says the gallery. -- If all goes as planned, performance artist Marni Kotak will give birth to her first child within the month -- in front of an audience at a Brooklyn art gallery. "In my work, I aim to convey my real experience of life, while simultaneously engaging in authentic shared moments with my viewers who have likely gone through similar or related events," Kotak says on her website. "The long-term project will ultimately encompass the overall span of the child's life from birth through attending college and developing an independent life," says Kotak. Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood hosts Kotak's latest venture titled "The Birth of Baby X." On Saturday, she converted the gallery into a birthing room, bringing in her grandmother's bed and her old rocking chair, so through the month, she can be in the gallery preparing mentally and physically to have her child, according to Kotak.
