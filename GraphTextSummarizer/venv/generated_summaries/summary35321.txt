-- French first lady Valerie Trierweiler has left the hospital where she had checked in for stress and fatigue after a tabloid's allegations of an affair between President Francois Hollande and an actress, Paris Match magazine reported Saturday. New claims emerged Friday about the reported liaison between the President and French actress Julie Gayet, including allegations that it has been going on for two years. In its online edition, the French magazine Closer, which first published reports of an affair a week ago, says the "couple" also made use of a second apartment near the Elysee Palace for romantic trysts and went on weekend breaks in the south of France. " Trierweiler has been Hollande's partner for several years. The same magazine -- where Trierweiler is a longtime correspondent -- reported that she will recover for "several days" in an official residence in Versailles.
