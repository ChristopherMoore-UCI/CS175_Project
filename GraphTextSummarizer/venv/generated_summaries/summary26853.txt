In November, thousands of specially chosen members of China's Communist Party will converge on Beijing for the 18th National Congress. Ahead of the congress, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout sat down with three prominent China watchers -- Victor Gao, Hung Huang and John Pomfret -- to discuss the leadership change and their views on the fate of the country and its ruling Communist Party. It may not be the same as in the United States or in Britain or in European countries etc., it will be very much of Chinese characteristic, and that will set China apart from other developed countries for decades to come. Gao: Many people from outside China tend to look at the Communist Party of China as a monolithic group of people. Gao: I think that the Communist Party of China will remain the ruling party for many years, if not for many decades, to come.
