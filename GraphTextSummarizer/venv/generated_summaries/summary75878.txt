, Branstad says Iowa voters rank the federal deficit higher than jobs as an election priority -- and says Ryan is in tune with their worries about annual deficits and long-term debt. Branstad acknowledged the potential power of the issue, especially in an older state like Iowa, but predicted it would not hurt the GOP provided Romney and Ryan used every opportunity to rebut the attacks and explain their proposals. They feel like he ran as someone who was going to bring people together and reach across the aisle and he hasn't done that."

"We have a real battle going on here for the heart and soul of the people of this state," GOP Gov. Terry Branstad says during an early afternoon walk through the fairgrounds. And the Romney campaign chose the fair for the solo debut of Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP vice presidential pick.
