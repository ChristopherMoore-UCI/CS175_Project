Rule 1: Every social media platform has a very specific demographic Facebook users are a different demographic than Twitter users, just as Pinterest users are different from Instagram users. And those millennials are unforgiving -- they care more about "social expression" than "social obedience," which means they'll tweet what they feel with no filter. On Tuesday, the NYPD's Twitter account, @NYPDNews, asked New Yorkers to "tag themselves" in photos with New York Police officers using the hashtag #myNYPD. -- Whoever is running the social media strategy for the New York Police Department needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media. Rule 3: Social media is often ruled by the haters Social media is a love-hate world, and among your followers you'll have just as many fans as foes.
