Beneath the solar panels, gas pumps have been driven deep into the ground collecting methane gas, which is also used for power production. "When a landfill is (finished with) taking waste, it basically is dormant and there's not a lot of uses for the property," says David Stuart, area environmental manager of landfill owners, Republic Services, Inc. " Landfills are a constant reminder of the waste we produce but projects like these could help dispose of the view that they are simply costly eyesores. But now, with its 10 acres of solar panels, the old landfill has been given a new lease of "green" life. A similar solar landfill project is underway in Madison County, New York where the energy generated from the eight acres of panels is being used to run the recycling center next door.
