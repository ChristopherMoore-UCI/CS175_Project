When the elder al-Assad died in June 2000, it took only hours for the Syrian parliament to vote to amend the country's constitution to allow Bashar al-Assad to become president. -- He grew up as the second son of late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, deep in the shadow of his father. His official website says he has built free-trade zones, licensed more private newspapers and private universities, and fought government waste and corruption. Human rights groups say such scenes are evidence of Syrian security forces firing on their own people, though state-run television disputes the claims. Hafez al-Assad ruled with an iron fist, ruthlessly putting down dissent by jailing dissidents and crushing the opposition.
