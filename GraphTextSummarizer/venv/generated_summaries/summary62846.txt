-- Italy pushed back Wednesday against a European court ruling that crucifixes in classrooms violate students' right to freedom of religion and education. The court does not have the power to force Italy to take down the representations of Jesus on the cross, but if its ruling stands and Italy does not comply, the door would be open for others to sue on the same grounds, said court spokesman Stefano Piedimonte. Only Italy would be directly affected by the ruling if it loses the case, but all 47 countries that belong to the Council of Europe "might draw consequences from such a judgment," court spokesman Frederic Dolt added. She fought her way through the Italian legal system starting in 2001, arguing that she wanted to raise her children as secular, according to court documents. Italian courts ruled earlier that the cross was a symbol of Italy's history and culture, prompting Lautsi to take her case to the European court in Strasbourg, France.
