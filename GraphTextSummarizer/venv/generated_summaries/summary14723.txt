In the first week after the high court upheld a portion of the controversial law, eight calls were made by Arizona law agencies inquiring into the immigration status of persons suspected of being in the United States illegally, said spokeswoman Amber Cargile of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Phoenix. -- Federal authorities have seen no change in the number of illegal immigration checks sought by local Arizona police and allowed under a state law partly upheld by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, officials said Wednesday. On June 25, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Arizona law that sought to deter illegal immigration, but let stand the controversial provision allowing police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws if "reasonable suspicion" exists that the person is in the United States illegally. Critics said that law opens the door to racial profiling. The state law, SB 1070, allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws, the chief said.
