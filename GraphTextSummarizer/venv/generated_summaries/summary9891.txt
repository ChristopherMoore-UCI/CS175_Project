The documentary examines the impact on the family of activist Rebiya Kadeer as she fights for greater autonomy of the ethnic minority group, the Uyghurs, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China's northwest. "The first stage was the local Chinese embassy asking us to withdraw the film," festival director Richard Moore said Sunday. The rioting in the Xinjiang region earlier this month stemmed from a brawl between Uyghur and Han workers at a toy factory in another part of China. "The second was to find a way for other Chinese films to withdraw from the festival -- five did so. "Lots of f-words and c-words, calling us racists, haters of Chinese people."
