From 3-D movies to TV shows, digital music to augmented reality applications, the company is clearly assigning tremendous importance to non-gaming applications. While a dedicated stand-alone gaming system such as the Nintendo 3DS can't rival smartphones or tablet PCs for sheer ubiquity, consider this: If 3-D technology takes off the way manufacturers hope, Nintendo's new device may give them an instant entr√©e into entirely new areas of entertainment, a leg up in the race to legitimize 3-D content and a secret weapon in the war to reclaim the territory recently ceded to Apple and its growing gaming focus. The device will also deliver an array of other fully-connected entertainment experiences, according to Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. If Nintendo can make this portable device as common and trusted for 3-D entertainment as smartphones are for e-mail or Web surfing, it may single-handedly deliver the breakthrough that carries this technology to mainstream prominence. Nintendo hopes it will make the strongest case yet for 3-D special effects affordability and relevance.
