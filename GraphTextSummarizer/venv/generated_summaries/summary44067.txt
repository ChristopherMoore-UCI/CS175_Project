The blast Monday morning flattened homes, reduced some bodies to dust and forced a massive evacuation of the Sinai slum amid fears that big pools of leaked fuel could ignite, police and Kenya Red Cross officials said. Kenya Pipeline Co., the state-owned petroleum company that owns the pipeline, said in a statement Monday night that it had detected a spill from a bypass line in the Sinai community on Monday morning and immediately moved to shut it down. Coming to a precise accounting of the toll may be difficult because so many of the victims were found huddled together and severely burned, Carol Nduta, a Kenya Red Cross emergency medical instructor and dispatcher who traveled to the scene, said Monday. In 2009, more than 100 people died in a fire after an oil tanker overturned in Molo, in western Kenya. Red Cross officials said 82 bodies had been recovered.
