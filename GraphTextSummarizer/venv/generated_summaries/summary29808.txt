Monitoring equipment confirmed an eruption, but authorities do not know whether it has produced a column of smoke or spilled lava, Marta Cavache, an official with the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, told the radio station. The eruption amounted to a "Level Red" -- the institute's most severe designation for volcanoes -- but authorities told Caracol Radio that darkness made it difficult to gauge precisely what had happened. It stood silent for more than 400 years, releasing only columns of steam, until an eruption last year that caused damaging mud flows, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. Authorities warned of possible avalanches and urged local officials to monitor the volume of rivers near the volcano, Caracol reported. Officials urged 13,000 to 15,000 people to evacuate, according to Caracol Radio, a radio station.
