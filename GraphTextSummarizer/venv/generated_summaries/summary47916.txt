Why are more than half of all Americans shunning the vaccine? "The perception that the vaccine has dangerous side effects is the top reason," says CNN polling director Keating Holland. That works out to 4 percent of the total adult population who want to get inoculated but haven't been able to locate a medical facility that is giving swine flu shots," Holland said. "Roughly half of those who don't want a swine flu shot say that the possibility of side effects is one reason why they don't plan to get the vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for certain high-priority groups because they are more likely to have serious complications if they develop swine flu. According to the poll, 55 percent of adults don't want to get the swine flu vaccine and don't plan to get a shot.
