" Sahra is currently under the status of "suspension of deportation," meaning German immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation. " Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims. One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle. "Seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged I am." "Apart Together" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds. What drew Dumig to Sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences.
