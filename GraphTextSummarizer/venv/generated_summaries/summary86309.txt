In a Sunday broadcast of TV One's "Washington Watch with Roland Martin," Duncan was asked about the progress New Orleans schools have made since Katrina hit in 2005. -- Education Secretary Arne Duncan has spent the past couple days backpedaling from comments he made Sunday suggesting that Hurricane Katrina was good for New Orleans' failing schools. Friday evening, Duncan called New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to explain what he meant, his office said. " Duncan said in the TV One interview that New Orleans in the past "was not serious about its education" but called the school system's reform since Katrina "unbelievable. " Duncan has made several trips to New Orleans since becoming education secretary one year ago.
