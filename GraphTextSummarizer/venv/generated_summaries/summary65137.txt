Mr. Brown never seems too far from Mr. Mann. " Since Mr. Brown originated on the stage -- in Perry productions -- Mann had to adjust to the small screen. The show focuses on Mr. Brown and his daughter Cora, played by Mann's real-life wife, Tamela Mann, as Mr. Brown tries to turn his house into a home for the elderly. Perhaps the most awkward time is when he is on the set, dressed as Mr. Brown, and he wants to show his wife, Tamela Mann, some husbandly affection. "If it hadn't been for Cora, Mr. Brown and Madea probably would have killed each other by now," Mann said.
