No Coast Guard officials were injured in the incident in Grand Haven, said Petty Officer Christopher Yaw, a spokesman with the Ninth Coast Guard District. He said the man, who authorities said is 34, was confronted, subdued and turned over to the Grand Haven Department of Public Safety. The incident was initially investigated as a possible "domestic act of terrorism," said Erin Von Tom of the Department of Public Safety. A man crashed through the gates of a Michigan Coast Guard station around 6 a.m. ET on Sunday, assaulted personnel and said he had a bomb in his truck, authorities said. Coast Guard officials notified the command center for the Lake Michigan sector while ordering that all people be evacuated from the station, he said.
