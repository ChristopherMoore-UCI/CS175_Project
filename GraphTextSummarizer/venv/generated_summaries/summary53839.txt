Police: Records on '86 shooting involving professor found Prosecutors say Bishop Anderson, who taught at the University of Alabama-Huntsville, killed department head Gopi Podila and associate professors Maria Davis and Adriel Johnson during a biology department faculty meeting on February 12, 2010. -- Amy Bishop Anderson -- the professor accused of shooting six of her colleagues, killing three -- pleaded guilty to attempted murder charges on Tuesday and agreed to plead guilty to a capital murder charge in two weeks. Under Alabama law, juries are required in capital murder cases even when a plea agreement has been reached. Appearing in Madison County Circuit Court, Bishop Anderson accepted an agreement with the state and pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted murder. Bishop Anderson will plead guilty to the capital murder charge before a jury on September 24, according to CNN affiliate WAFF.
