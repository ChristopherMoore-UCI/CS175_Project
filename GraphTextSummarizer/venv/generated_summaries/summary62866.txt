Germany's Erik Lesser took silver and Russian Evgeniy Garanichev won bronze on his 26th birthday, but there was disappointment for Norwegian veteran Ole Einar Bjoerndalen. With Gus Kenworthy taking silver and Nicholas Goepper winning bronze, it was an all-American podium. Italy's Arianna Fontana, the bronze medalist from Vancouver in 2010, took silver with Park Seung-Hi of South Korea in bronze. Nicknamed the "Bayern Express," the team proved unbeatable and finished over a second clear of silver medalist Russia, with Latvia in bronze. Bjoerndalen upstaged by new biathlon star Martin Fourcade made it double gold in Sochi as he followed his 12.5 km pursuit triumph with victory in the 20 km individual biathlon event.
