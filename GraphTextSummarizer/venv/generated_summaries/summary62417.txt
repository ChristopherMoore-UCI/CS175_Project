-- A man suspected of flying with tuberculosis tested negative for the disease, according to Maricopa County health officials, meaning there was never a risk to other passengers on his flight. A firefighter then came on the intercom and announced that the passenger had active tuberculosis and was contagious and that other passengers on the flight had been exposed. Arizona health officials did not recommend passengers on Flight 2846 seek medical care because even if the passenger had tuberculosis, their risk of being infected was "very, very low," said Dr. Rebecca Sunshine, disease control director for Maricopa County Public Health. In general, airline passengers are not legally obligated to tell an airline when they are sick, said Jeff Ment, an attorney who specializes in travel law. "To include someone on the list, CDC must determine that the person 1) likely is contagious with a communicable disease that would constitute a serious public health threat should the person be permitted to board a flight; 2) is unaware of or likely to be nonadherent with public health recommendations, including treatment; and 3) likely will attempt to board a commercial aircraft," the CDC website states.
