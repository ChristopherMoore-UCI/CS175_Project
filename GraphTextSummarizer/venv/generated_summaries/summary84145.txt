Now, the date line takes a massive detour of more than 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), around Kiribati's eastern-most islands, so that the whole nation is on the same calendar day. Until last year, Samoa and American Samoa celebrated the new year on the same day. Before the mid-1990s, the international date line split Kiribati into two parts, leaving the western portion a whole day ahead of the eastern part and causing headaches when doing business. -- Just 101 miles separate Samoa and American Samoa. American Samoa, however, stayed on the other side of the border -- leaving it 25 hours behind Samoa.
