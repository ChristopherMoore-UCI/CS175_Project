After Tuesday's rest day, Wiggins had to be on his guard as he protected a lead of one minute 53 seconds over last year's winner Cadel Evans, with his Team Sky teammate Chris Froome in third place at two minutes and seven seconds. But all that was forgotten as he burst clear of a small breakaway group and held on to win by three seconds from Michele Scarponi (Lampre-ISD), with veteran Jens Voigt (RadioShack-Nissan) in third. Fourth-placed Italian Vincenzo Nibali (Liquigas) attacked on the descent of the Grand Colombier, but "I didn't panic when he attacked," Wiggins told ITV Sport. I didn't believe I could win until about five meters from the finish line," he told ITV Sport. The Europcar rider finished a battling fourth on last year's Tour, but has suffered a series of setbacks in the build up to this year's race and nearly did not start.
