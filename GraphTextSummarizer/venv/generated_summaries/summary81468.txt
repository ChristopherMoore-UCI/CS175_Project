Camping had originally said that those selected for salvation would be raptured up to heaven May 21, and those left behind would face months of judgment amid destruction before the world's end October 21. The Day of Rapture, as predicted by apocalyptic Christian broadcaster Harold Camping, passed without calamity on May 21. God has humbled us through the events of May 21, to continue to even more fervently search the Scriptures (the Bible), not to find dates, but to be more faithful in our understanding," Camping wrote in the letter dated this month. "We humbly acknowledge we were wrong," Camping and his staff members wrote in a letter to supporters posted on the website of Family Radio, Camping's California-based broadcast ministry. Though many dates are circulating, Family Radio has no interest in even considering another date.
