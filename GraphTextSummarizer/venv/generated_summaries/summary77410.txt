Bitter fighting between Muslim and Christian militia groups since a coup last year has claimed many lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. To counter attacks on Christian communities by Seleka groups, the vigilante groups known as the anti-balaka, which translates to "anti-machete," fought back. While Muslims are under threat in the south-west, in the north-east it's Muslim militias who rule and the Christians who are targeted. The long line of trucks was headed up north, snaking its way 375 miles across the country on a hard, dangerous journey from the tropical Central African forest to the open savannah bordering Chad. While international peacekeeping forces are in the country -- some 6,000 African Union troops and 2,000 French forces, as well as the first contingent of 1,600 European Union troops -- their ability to police remote communities is limited.
