Mycoskie called the company TOMS: Shoes For Tomorrow -- a name that reflects his desire to provide shoes for disadvantaged children in a sustainable way. -- Blake Mycoskie was traveling in South America when he saw, for the first time, hundreds of children without shoes. They finished the competition in third place (missing out on the million-dollar prize by just four minutes), but the experience exposed Mycoskie to the astounding amount of poverty in the world -- a problem that TOMS is tackling today, one pair of shoes at a time. Santa Monica, Calif.-based TOMS gave away 10,000 pairs of shoes in the first six months after its launch in 2006. The stylish slip-ons, which Vogue magazine declared "cool shoes for a cool cause," have become a must-have item among fashion elite and received the People's Design Award from the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt Museum last year.
