-- Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, made her first public appearance Friday alongside her husband, Prince William, just over a month after she gave birth to Prince George. The world got its first glimpse of George since he left the hospital in family photographs released earlier this month. William, a search-and-rescue pilot, has been stationed at a Royal Air Force base on the remote Welsh island of Anglesey since 2010. The two spoke to members of the public at the start of the 131-mile Ring O' Fire coastal ultramarathon in Anglesey, Wales, where the family lives. Catherine, looking relaxed and in casual dress, was not carrying her son, who's third in line to the British throne.
