" As much of "Sherlock Holmes" is set in London this means big business for museum officials and gift shop operators. "A few people do think he is a real character, particularly with the tour of his house on 'Baker Street' adding fuel to the fire so to speak," Mark Di-Toro from Visit Britain said. -- Sherlock Holmes the movie has already made more than $300 million at the box office worldwide and British tourism officials are hoping it means money for them too. Nearby, a nine-foot statue of Holmes greets visitors at the Baker Street Underground station. The Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221b Baker Street is the address where the fictional detective lived, according to the stories by Conan Doyle.
