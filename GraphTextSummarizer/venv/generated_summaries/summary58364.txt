-- Nelson Mandela was many things to many people, but when I pause to consider his life, mostly I smile and think of his sense of humor, his dry wit and his remarkable ability to render someone speechless with a well-placed one-liner. As a television reporter for the SABC, South Africa's national broadcaster, and then later as a CNN correspondent, I watched him from the sidelines, time and time again, use humor to put people at ease. Mandela then relays to his audience that after a thoughtful pause the little girl said, "You are a stupid old man, aren't you?" Mandela's good humor and jovial demeanor were not just a public ploy to charm crowds or disarm nervous guests. The cult of Mandela had become so pronounced that celebrities, world leaders and ordinary people often became tongue-tied and gibbering when they met him. Maybe you could hire me?" Self-mockery was a typically savvy Mandela ploy to ensure that people would relax around him.
