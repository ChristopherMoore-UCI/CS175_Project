-- The killing of 6-month-old Jonylah Watkins has been held up as a new low in Chicago's struggle to keep senseless death off its streets, as a rallying cry to do something about gun violence and as proof that no one -- even the most innocent among us -- is safe. Brunner said progress might start with being more willing to "snitch" to police about those behind shootings that have ravaged his city in recent months. Jeneen Thomas, an activist who did not know Jonylah's family but felt compelled to come out Tuesday, says she hoped the pointless killing of a baby girl, as she sat on her father's lap, wakes people up. "The world thinks that there's nothing but animals that live on the South Side, but we've proved to them today that we are real people ... with real experiences," he said. Some of that message involved taking personal responsibility; some of it involved coming together, as a community, to reject gun violence.
