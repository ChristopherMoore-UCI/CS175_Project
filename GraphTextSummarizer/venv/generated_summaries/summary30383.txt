So in 2010, at the age of 12, Nicholas started a program that donates new shoes to homeless children. "It bothered me that I only had used shoes to give to them instead of new shoes that fit right," he said. "By giving new footwear to homeless children, I'm making sure them and their families have at least one less thing to worry about," Nicholas said. Some didn't have a pair of shoes to call their own," said Nicholas, now 15. The children fell behind in their studies until they each received a new pair of shoes from Nicholas' group.
