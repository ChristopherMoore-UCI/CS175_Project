Today -- based on wage levels -- half of Americans live in poverty or near poverty. Fraud is a piece of grain compared with the millions of families who manage to put food on the table because of this program. But today, the food stamp program has an error rate of only 3% -- and those errors were mostly committed by the government in underpayments as well as overpayments and payments to ineligible families. But for some reason, this principle has been lost on the 217 members of the House of Representatives who decided to lace up some combat boots with rough, crushing soles to kick and kick again the 48 million Americans who count on food stamps. The average allotment of food stamps is $133 a person a month.
