The average Lamborghini, for example, will average just over 11 mpg (combined city and highway), only slightly outdoing the two-seater Bugatti Veyron's 10 mpg. An interesting side note: the traditional argument that manual transmissions deliver higher fuel economy no longer holds true. Perhaps surprisingly, it's not always the Asian-based carmakers that come up on top where fuel economy ratings are concerned. The Jeep Compass and Patriot, both with manual transmission and two-wheel-drive, are rated at 23/28 mpg city/highway. Several carmakers boast higher fuel economy with the automatic transmission than with a manual (if available).
