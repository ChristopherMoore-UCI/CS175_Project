I think the 1995 World Cup final was probably one of the best days in South African history (it was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa after the end of apartheid and South Africa won). I never really felt that I deserved it, but that was a great day, (especially) when the team arrived back in South Africa to see the faces of millions of South Africans. It has got such a big part to play in uniting the nation and was definitely the best day that we've had as a rainbow nation since 1992 (when white South Africans voted to end apartheid). When South Africa won the World Cup in 2007, it was a bit different for me because I got injured in the first game -- and ruptured my bicep. -- I made my debut for South Africa at the age of 21.
