"What's really interesting is, over just the past year, how pervasive Google has become, not just in Google data centers, but throughout the North American internet," says Craig Labovitz, founder of Deepfield, the internet monitoring company that crunched the data. Google has added thousands of servers — called Google Global Cache servers — to ISPs around the world. On an average day, Google accounts for about 25 percent of all consumer internet traffic running through North American ISPs. It also explains why Google is building data centers as fast as it possibly can. "It used to be that the focus of people like Google and Facebook was about building data centers," he says.
