Anderson's firm -- Jeff Anderson & Associates, which employs four other lawyers -- has filed hundreds of sex abuse suits against the church. Now, with the church abuse crisis embroiling Europe for the first time and raising questions about whether the pope himself did enough to respond to church abuse, Anderson is employing novel legal tactics in an attempt to take his campaign all the way to the Vatican. " In 2002, revelations of church abuse and cover-up in Boston set off a wave of priest abuse allegations that turned church lawsuits into a national industry. Last week, an alleged victim of priest abuse in Wisconsin announced a lawsuit against the Vatican itself. By that time, Anderson had shifted from his initial focus on civil rights and poverty law to take on abuse cases full time.
