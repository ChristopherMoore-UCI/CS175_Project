Coffee consumption in Italy has dropped from 5.9kg in 2008, as the crisis kicked up, to 5.6kg per person last year, according to the ICO. Lavazza boss Antonio Baravalle told CNN that "from a consumer point of view, we are facing a crisis in Italy because the market is losing 3% [to] 4%." Italy has been one of the worst hit countries in the eurozone's financial crisis. -- Italy's coffee industry is being hit by the debt crisis as consumers stay home and tap quick-fix machines for their caffeine kick. According to Galinda, people associate Italy with the espresso machine because it invented the style of coffee brewed under high pressure and with very hot temperatures. "As these machines become more popular, as they penetrate Germany and France, this could mean that people overall consume more coffee," he told CNN.
