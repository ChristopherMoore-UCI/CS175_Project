The blood donor bank based in the region of Castilla y Leon has a blood bus that travels to small cobbled towns and big cities, enticing passers-by to donate blood. For Esendex, who has been signing up more customers in Spain than anywhere else, the economic crisis has been a huge opportunity. By receiving the text message the night before, donors are more likely to remember and make time in their schedule to stop and donate blood. We receive them almost on a daily basis; text messages alerting us that our taxi is outside or our dentist appointment is tomorrow. Using Esendex's SMS platform, CHEMCYL sends text messages to donors on their list, alerting them as to when the blood bus will be visiting and where they can donate.
