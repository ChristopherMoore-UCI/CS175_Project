With 99% of votes counted, Nicolas Maduro won 50.66% of votes, National Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena said, calling the results "irreversible." More than 68% of the country's registered voters had cast ballots by 3 p.m. Sunday, elections officials said. But elections officials said Sunday evening that the day had proceeded smoothly without major incidents. But they also appeared to be bracing for a fight, with opposition leaders decrying what they said were election irregularities and Maduro's campaign vowing to defend the election results. As polls were closing on Sunday evening, Twitter accounts for Maduro and his party were apparently hacked with posts denouncing "electoral fraud."
