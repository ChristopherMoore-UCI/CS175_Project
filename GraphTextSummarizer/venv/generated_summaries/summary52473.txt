-- Prosecutors dropped drug charges against rapper T.I. related to his arrest in West Hollywood, California, last month, the Los Angeles district attorney's office said. An arraignment hearing had been set for next month, but the decision to reject charges against Harris will save Los Angeles taxpayers the expense of flying him from a federal prison in Georgia to California. "He was supposed to be living what he was preaching," said U.S. Attorney Sally Yates. He served a year of house detention before he spent nine months in prison and three months in a halfway house. "I screwed up big time and I am sorry," Harris told U.S. District Judge Charles Pannell Jr.
