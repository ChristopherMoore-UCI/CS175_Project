For Putin, this crisis is only the latest in a catalog of grievances, which includes the West trampling over Russia's interests from Kosovo to Iraq, to Libya and Syria.

Russian diplomats call it guaranteeing Ukraine's "neutral status" -- which sounds much better than "capitulation." In an interview with the Al-Ahram newspaper he rejected Russian responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine.
