-- Investigators will return to a North Carolina pond on Thursday morning as police continue their search for a missing Fort Bragg soldier, officials said. Asked whether police believe Bordeaux is in danger, Bergamine said authorities are suspicious that no one has heard from her, adding she is described as "a very good soldier, not the type of person that would come up AWOL or missing. The Army official said police searched Bordeaux's apartment and vehicle, but the official did not know where the vehicle was found. Bordeaux is from St. Cloud, Florida, and lives off base, according to Jackie Thomas, Fort Bragg spokeswoman. Records showed Bordeaux's cell phone "pinging" off a tower nearby early Saturday, he said.
