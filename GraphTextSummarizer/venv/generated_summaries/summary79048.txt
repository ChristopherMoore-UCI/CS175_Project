Investigators are trying to determine whether someone attempted to pin the poisonous letters on Paul Kevin Curtis of Corinth, Mississippi, a law enforcement source told CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. Prosecutors initially arrested Curtis April 17 and charged him with sending a threat to the president after letters containing a suspicious powder triggered security scares around Washington. However, Curtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, said Wednesday on CNN that she believes investigators are now focusing on the possibility that the letters were a direct attack on the politicians they were addressed to, not purely an attempt to get at Curtis. The letters -- sent to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi -- touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the bombing of the Boston Marathon. Authorities dropped the charges against Curtis on Tuesday after new information became available, U.S. Attorney Felicia Adams said.
