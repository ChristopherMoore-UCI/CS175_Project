Nuremberg captain Wolf hit the bar with a penalty for minutes later as his team's four-match winning run at home came to an end. Veteran Spanish striker Raul netted a hat-trick after Christoph Metzelder opened the scoring in the 23rd minute with a header that hit the bar and then rebounded into the net off the back of helpless goalkeeper Tim Wiese. Hoffenheim moved above Freiburg on goal difference, claiming fifth place on 21 points with a 4-0 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. The Togo-born teenager wrapped it up in time added on as Frankfurt dropped to seventh after the home side's seven-match unbeaten run came to a crashing halt, leaving the club on 20 points and above Bayern on goal difference. Promoted Kaiserslautern moved away from the relegation zone with a 3-1 win at Nuremberg, who remained on 18 points behind Hamburg on goal difference.
