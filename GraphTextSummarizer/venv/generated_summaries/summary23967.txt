His collection, particularly the DNA from the hair, could confirm Bolivar's remains, and for a brief period in 2007, Venezuela treated DeVengoechea like a king. President Hugo Chavez had doubts about whether the great South American hero Simon Bolivar had died of tuberculosis, as most historical accounts state, or if he had been poisoned. Bolivar gave the items in the collection to DeVengoechea's great-great-grandfather, Joaquin de Mier, the lawsuit states. His ancestors were one of Colombia's founding families with ties to Bolivar, and had passed down to him a small collection worthy of a museum: a one-of-a-kind medal from a grateful Peru, signed letters and, most unique, a lock of Bolivar's hair. When Venezuela decided to investigate Bolivar's death, a necessary step would be to confirm that the remains the government would exhume indeed belonged to the revered hero.
