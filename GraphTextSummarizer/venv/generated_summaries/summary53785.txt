-- Just about six years after his career seemed to come to a crashing halt, when Barack Obama defeated him in the presidential election of 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain is poised to re-emerge as a major player in the next two years. He has often been at odds with members of his own party, including tea party Republicans who have pushed for a sharply rightward shift in domestic policy (and challenged him in the primary in 2010 when J.D. Hayworth ran again him), as well as anti-interventionists, such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul who have given strength to GOP rhetoric about limiting the scale and scope of the nation's national security operations. Once considered the exciting maverick of Washington who could attract supporters from both parties, as a result of his pursuit of campaign finance reform and willingness to enter into bipartisan alliances, McCain won the award from many observers for running one of the worst campaigns ever. McCain will have a chance to reiterate his claims about how a passive White House has endangered the national security interest and created too much space for radical elements overseas to gain a stronger foothold in the Middle East. McCain, who is expecting a tea party challenge for his re-election bid in 2016, is going to have a huge incentive to be aggressive in promoting himself as a major player in the GOP and crafting a conservative agenda that he can feel comfortable with (unlike when he did this in 2008 on domestic issues and looked as fake as a bad Hollywood actor).
