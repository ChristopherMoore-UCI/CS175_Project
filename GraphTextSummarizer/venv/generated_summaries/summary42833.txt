Great Smoky Mountains National Park Park stats: Yosemite National Park is the third most visited national park in the country with 3.8 million visitors last year (behind Great Smoky Mountains and Grand Canyon national parks). Instead, Randolph played outside with her sister and family in Spokane, Washington, visiting Olympic National Park and other national parks for their vacations. Park ranger Randolph didn't grow up watching television or playing video games. But as seasonal ranger Kirsten Randolph can attest, the park offers many stunning settings beyond this granite dome. Yosemite National Park has almost everything a nature lover could desire: Glorious waterfalls, spectacular meadows and valleys, groves of ancient sequoias and the wildlife that call the park home.
