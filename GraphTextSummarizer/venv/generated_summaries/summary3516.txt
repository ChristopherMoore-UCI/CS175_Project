"If there is a new trial, I will be there." Judge: Defense 'constitutionally deficient' In a lengthy opinion Wednesday, Connecticut Appellate Judge Thomas Bishop ruled that defense attorney Michael "Mickey" Sherman's representation of Skakel was "constitutionally deficient. Hours after the judge's order, Skakel remained behind bars at the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, Connecticut, according to prison records. Kennedy told CNN on Wednesday that five witnesses saw Skakel 11 miles away at the time of Moxley's death. Brutal killing in an affluent community Moxley's body was found after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. But a Connecticut judge gave Skakel, 53, a chance for a fresh start Wednesday, ruling that the defense during his 2002 trial had been inadequate.
