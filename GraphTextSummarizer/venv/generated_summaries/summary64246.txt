On Friday night, the school issued a statement urging attendees not only to wear blue to raise awareness of child abuse, but to donate to Prevent Child Abuse Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape. Warning signs of sexual abuse Michael Gillum, the psychologist for the person referred to as "Victim 1" in the Pennsylvania grand jury report, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night he was "stunned" that so many individuals, after witnessing or hearing allegations about Sandusky, did not come forward sooner. Earlier, he announced the creation of a committee to review sexual abuse allegations at the school -- an inquiry that its chairman, Kenneth Frazier, promised Friday would be "rigorous, objective and impartial." Authorities in San Antonio, Texas, said they are investigating the possibility that Sandusky may have committed sex crimes in 1999 when Penn State played in the Alamo Bowl. On Friday, the lawyer told CNN that a rock had been thrown through a window at Sandusky's home.
