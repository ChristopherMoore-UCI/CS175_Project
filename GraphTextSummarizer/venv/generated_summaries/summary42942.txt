Lee was arraigned Wednesday on six felony charges, including first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, rape and aggravated assault, Dearden said in a press release. Michael James Lee, 24, of Meridian, had no previous criminal history and was fired from the department about a year ago, said Andrea Dearden, spokeswoman for the Ada County Sheriff's Office in Boise. According to the sheriff's office, Lee on Tuesday assaulted his wife, bound her with chains and tape, put her in the trunk of a car and drove to his mother's house in the neighboring city of Eagle, about 15 miles northwest of Boise. Lee's wife later said he was going to his mother's house to rob her, authorities said. The roommate "heard a noise" and found Lee with his mother, authorities said.
