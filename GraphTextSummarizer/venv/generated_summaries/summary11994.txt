Yes, there are places, like New Zealand, where 20% of men choose vasectomies, but there are countries where the rate is less than 1%. Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky. The bottom line is that all methods of birth control come with some element of risk. With all these reasons, you'd think for men who no longer wish to have children choosing a family planning option that is permanent, safe and secure would be a no-brainer. In my travels, I met men in their 20s who know they don't want children and men in their 70s who do.
