Gonzalez was about to call Las Vegas police, but decided to look up local Oregon officials. A telemarketer making a sales call from Las Vegas helped to end a domestic violence situation 900 miles away in Oregon on Wednesday evening, according law enforcement officials. Ruck was booked into the Linn County Jail on charges of assault, menacing and strangulation. The victim told officials Ruck threatened her with a rifle, shoving the stock of the gun into her chest, according to the press release. Call center workers say they heard a woman screaming for her life and yelling "please don't kill me," according to a press release from the Linn County (Oregon) Sheriff's Office.
