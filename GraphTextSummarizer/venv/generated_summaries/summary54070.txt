Contador, considered Froome's main rival, made up more than a minute to pull to within three minutes. A "really big test," as Froome put it, comes Sunday as the 15th stage is the longest of the Tour and concludes at the summit of Mont Ventoux. "It's an extremely historical climb in terms of cycling so there'll be a lot of guys going for it to try and win," Froome told the Tour's website. Belkin's Mollema remains two minutes, 28 seconds behind Froome, with Saxo-Tinkoff's Contador staying 2:45 behind. Froome, deprived of the services of injured teammate Edvald Boasson Hagen, was left behind the breakaway pack.
