Graham was in good spirits and humor and signed all admission forms, spokesman A. Larry Ross said. According to Ross, Graham has remained in good health overall. Age-related conditions -- including macular degeneration and hearing loss -- have kept Graham at home in recent years, but the evangelist is involved in writing projects, including a manuscript for a book about aging, Ross said. No date was set for Graham's release, but Ross said he hopes it will be soon. Graham had episodes of sweating and coughing overnight, according to Ross.
