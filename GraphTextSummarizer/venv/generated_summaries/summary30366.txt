It has long been (and remains) an affiliate of the PKK, the militant group in Turkey that has fought for Kurdish autonomy for three decades, a struggle that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. There were also reports that PYD militia were deployed to stifle anti-regime protests by Kurdish youth groups. Barzani, a veteran Kurdish nationalist, clearly wants to influence events in Syria, but at the same time he realizes that Turkey is important as a route for oil exports from Iraqi Kurdistan. "As the Turks see it, with identical PKK/PYD flags reportedly being raised over Ayn al-'Arab and Afrin, developments suggest that the PKK may be creating a safe haven for itself on Turkey's border with Syria," Cagaptay wrote last month on CNN's Global Public Square. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: "We share Turkey's determination that Syria must not become a haven for PKK terrorists whether now or after the departure of the Assad regime." "That could be a big disaster for Turkey, not now but maybe in two years," Cakir said.
