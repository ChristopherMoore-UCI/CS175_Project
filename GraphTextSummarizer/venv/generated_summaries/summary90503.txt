-- Iberia ground and cabin crews Monday began what they said was the biggest strike in the airline's history, but the company countered that it had already re-assigned most passengers to other flights to reduce airport chaos. Pilots are not on strike this week but are due to join in for next strikes, for the weeks of March 4 and March 18. Union leaders call it the biggest strike in Iberia's history because it's the first time that all three units -- pilots, cabin crews and ground personnel -- have joined forces to strike and it's the first time so many days of strikes have been announced at one time. Ground crews and in-flight attendants announced 15 days of strikes, during three weeks Monday to Friday, starting Monday. Iberia pilots last year went on strike when Iberia created a low-cost carrier called Iberia Express.
