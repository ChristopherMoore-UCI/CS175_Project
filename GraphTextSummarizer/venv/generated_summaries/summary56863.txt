Chelsea's new signing Eden Hazard was again influential, winning a penalty after being pulled down by defender Chris Gunter. -- Late goals from Fernando Torres and Branislav Ivanovic gave European champions Chelsea a 4-2 win over promoted Reading at Stamford Bridge Wednesday. Malaga saw several top players depart in the close season but Jesualdo Ferreira's men were too good for their Greek visitors with first-half goals from Argentine defender Martin Demichelis and Portuguese winger Eliseu. Chelsea pushed forward in search of a winner, but there was an element of fortune when Torres struck from close range as replays appeared to indicate the Euro 2012 winner was offside as he received a pass from England defender Ashley Cole in the 81st minute. Veteran midfielder Lampard easily beat Adam Federici and last season's Champions League winners looked set for a comfortable victory.
