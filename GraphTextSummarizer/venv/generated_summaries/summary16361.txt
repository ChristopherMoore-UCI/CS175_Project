But I still held on to those late nights, which were now filled with knitting and "Law & Order" reruns instead of work. This was a role that allowed me to develop a healthy balance between doing good work and living a good life. I'd seen the news reports that said insomnia can hinder weight loss. "You can sleep when you're dead," I've told myself while answering work email in the middle of the night. My disregard for a healthy work/life balance showed my dedication and loyalty to work.
