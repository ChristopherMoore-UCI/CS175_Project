Kluibert Roa Nu√±ez, a high school student, was killed Tuesday when he got caught between protesters and national police in the western city of San Cristobal. The death of a 14-year-old shot by police just blocks from his school is the latest flashpoint as political tensions mount in Venezuela and pockets of anti-government protests erupt throughout the country. A year ago, San Cristobal was the birthplace of anti-government protests that spread nationwide. He described a group of "hooded youths" who were "being violent," beating police and pelting officers with rocks before police responded with force. Already protesters opposed to President Nicolas Maduro's government are pointing to the teen's death as a fresh rallying cry.
