-- President Obama praised "the father of your nation" Mahatma Gandhi and noted his influence on Martin Luther King and the non-violent resistance that typified the American civil rights movement in his address to the Indian Parliament Monday. Promoting broader trade relations with India is a delicate balancing act for Obama, given American frustration with the outsourcing of jobs to the country. The president and first lady Michelle Obama arrived New Delhi on Monday, with the prime minister greeting them on arrival. Earlier at a joint news conference with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in India's capital, New Delhi, Obama said the relationship between the United States and India is "stronger, deeper and broader" than ever. Obama praised India's military support, saying that it had contributed to the war in Afghanistan and efforts to leave terrorists no haven.
