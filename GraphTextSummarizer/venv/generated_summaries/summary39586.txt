Romelu Lukaku was a livewire on his home debut for the Liverpool club, scoring twice and setting up English teenager Ross Barkley for Everton's second. Everton keeper Tim Howard sent the ball sailing up field and Lukaku got on the end of the American's mammoth kick to slide the ball past a flailing Tim Krul. The ball travelled from one end to the other for Lukaku's second in a perfect example of the much aligned long ball football. Substitute Yohan Cabaye conjured a wonderful strike from range to close the gap before fellow France international Loic Remy stabbed in the ball for a second with 88 minutes on the clock. Try as he might the hat trick did not come for Lukaku as Newcastle pegged back the home side in the second half.
