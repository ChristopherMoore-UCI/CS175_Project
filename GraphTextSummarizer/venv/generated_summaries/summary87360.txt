On the sister ship to the Disney Dream, Walt Disney Imagineers have created interactive experiences that can't be played anywhere else -- including Disney theme parks. With more passengers now accustomed to playing games on Facebook, including the new "Disney Animal Kingdom Explorers," Disney Imagineers are creating experiences that blend motion sensor technology and storytelling. What separates this video game machine from anything else is that it offers full touch-screen interaction and exclusive games developed by Disney Imagineers based on films like "Bolt" and "Cars." Interactivity is spread throughout the ship, including a new dinner show at Animator's Palette that allows guests to draw an animated figure and then watch it come to life with classic Disney characters. There are video games built into the different stations, which require players to turn the badge to manipulate on-screen items like lighting fireworks and tightening pipes with a wrench.
