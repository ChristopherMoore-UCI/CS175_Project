Such cooperation is as important as ever, and this meeting -- an event I have been involved in for many years -- offers an opening to ending confusion among neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region while setting the stage for vigorous economic cooperation and integration in the coming decades. Such a body would offer efficient financing for badly needed transportation, telecommunications and energy projects across the region, and it could be a strong, complementary source of financing development to institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Instead, economic integration should be seen as a vital driving force for economic growth and prosperity in the region. This shortfall is acting as a bottleneck for further development of the regional economy, a fact underscored by the Asian Development Bank, which estimates the region needs $8 trillion for infrastructure development between 2010 and 2020. Such enormous economic activity across the Pacific would in turn translate into more jobs for Americans, among other benefits.
