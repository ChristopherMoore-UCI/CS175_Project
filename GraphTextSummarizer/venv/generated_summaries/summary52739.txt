-- A federal judge in Washington state on Tuesday unsealed an indictment for airplane theft against an alleged teenage criminal known as "the barefoot bandit." Over the past month, the teen has been linked to a string of thefts and break-ins in South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa, police said. Police suspect he may also have stolen boats and cars in addition to airplanes. In the most recent case, a small high-performance plane stolen from an Indiana airport over the weekend was found in shallow waters off an island in the Bahamas, officials said, and the details surrounding the incident have people wondering if the "barefoot bandit" was involved. An FBI statement indicated that agents believe Harris-Moore was involved in the Indiana theft, with the statement saying, "Should you see  Harris-Moore in The Bahamas, please contact the nearest Royal Bahamas Police  Force Station."
