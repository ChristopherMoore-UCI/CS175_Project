"If you don't do something to stop that -- that's when there's something wrong with you." In their first-ever joint prime time interview, actress Demi Moore and actor Ashton Kutcher will be guests on Thursday's "Piers Morgan Tonight." One of the so-called faces of human trafficking joined "Piers Morgan Tonight" under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first-hand account of what Morgan called "the horrors of sex trafficking." Morgan asked the couple famously addicted to Twitter -- Kutcher has 6.5 million followers, Moore has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate. " Moore and Kutcher maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery. "We want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online," Kutcher told Morgan.
