Before Ellen DeGeneres was out and proud and dancing every day on her talk show, when heterosexual male actors wouldn't dare to play gay, and violence against gay people was the talking point of the day for LGBT activists, there was transgender activist Leslie Feinberg. I could quietly enjoy the benefits of the work done by Feinberg and other transgender activists, butch women, gay men and drag queens who could not or would not fade into the shadows. She fought for workers' rights, marched against racism, protested against the Klan and fought for abortion rights in upstate New York. It's hard to find Feinberg's 1993 classic novel, "Stone Butch Blues," today. "You're more than just neither, honey," Feinberg wrote in "Stone Butch Blues."
