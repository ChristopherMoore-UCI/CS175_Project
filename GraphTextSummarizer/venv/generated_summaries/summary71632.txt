The Brazilian government was working with local governments Friday to deliver food, cleaning materials and other supplies to the affected areas -- using helicopters to reach some areas made impassable by flooded roads. The death toll from flooding that has covered large parts of Brazil continued to rise Friday, with the government reporting seven new fatalities, bringing the total to 38. World Vision, a relief agency working in Brazil, predicted it could take 30 days for flood waters to recede. Floodwaters reach almost to the tops of some homes in Piaui state in Brazil. Brazil has been devastated by rain-swollen rivers for months.
