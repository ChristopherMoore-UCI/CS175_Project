In Workington, where Cumbria Police Constable Bill Barker died in the floods last week, the two sides of the town are cut off from each other because all bridges were either washed away or closed for safety reasons. Britain's Environment Agency said river levels across the county of Cumbria remained high but are unlikely to rise to levels seen last week. Twenty road bridges in Cumbria were closed Tuesday, including seven that collapsed in the floods, Cumbria County Council spokesman Gareth Cosslett told CNN. The rain was expected to move through the region by Wednesday, but more was set to return by Thursday, according to Met Office forecasts. Also shut were eight footbridges, which are an essential means of connecting residents in riverside towns.
