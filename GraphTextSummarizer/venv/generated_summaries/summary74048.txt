Former Inter midfielder Muntari gave Milan the lead inside 30 seconds, but Pirlo -- who spent a decade at the San Siro -- equalized after 15 minutes with a set-piece that goalkeeper Christian Abbiati could only deflect into the net. AC Milan, down to 10 men by that stage after defender Philippe Mexes was sent off for protesting his initial booking, reduced the deficit through Sulley Muntari's second of the match at the end. It left Juve in third place on goal difference behind Napoli, which also remained unbeaten following a 4-0 win at home to Livorno. Athletic Bilbao and Valencia also have 13 points following a 1-1 draw in the Basque capital, but trail Getafe on goal difference. In Germany, Hamburg moved out of the Bundesliga's bottom three with a 5-0 win at Nuremberg to give former Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk his first win since taking charge.
