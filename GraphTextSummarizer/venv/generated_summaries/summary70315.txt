And it adds, "Very little now stands between the bad guys and Yemen's nuclear material." U.S. President Barack Obama has made it a priority to secure vulnerable nuclear stocks within four years in a global drive to pre-empt nuclear terrorism. "The men did not know if the uranium was weapon-usable fissile material, highly enriched uranium, what the percentage of uranium-235 isotope or other isotopes were, or how its content was determined." In the end U.S. diplomats concluded: "This case fits the profile of typical scams involving nuclear smuggling originating from the eastern DRC." -- One of the nightmare scenarios of the 21st century is a "rogue state" or terror group getting its hands on nuclear material that could be sufficiently enriched to make a weapon. Guarding nuclear materials appears to have been a problem in Yemen, too. While some progress has been made, data from the International Atomic Energy Agency show there is plenty of nuclear material on the loose.
