"I believe it is the right policy to ban air travel from countries that have been hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak. "Even when governments restrict travel and trade, people in affected countries still find a way to move and it is even harder to track them systematically," Frieden said last week. U.S. health officials grilled on Ebola at congressional hearing Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms. A few of the neighboring West African countries have actually sealed their borders altogether while many other countries on the continent are banning travel to and from those West African countries. Anyway, there's not much evidence to suggest that travel ban was successfully enforced or effective.
