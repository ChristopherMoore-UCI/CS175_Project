It put Barca 11 points clear of second-placed defending champions Real Madrid with four games to play, meaning victory at third-placed Atletico Madrid next Sunday will be enough to seal a 22nd domestic crown. However, Betis hit back with an even better effort as midfielder Ruben Perez -- on loan from Atletico Madrid -- fired in a piledriver from long range to give his side the lead at the interval. Real Zaragoza moved out of the bottom three with a 3-0 win that left Rayo Vallecano behind Sevilla on goal difference, while bottom club Mallorca drew 1-1 with midtable Levante. Lionel Messi helped Barcelona bounce back from Champions League heartache as he came off the bench to score twice against Real Betis on Sunday and edge the Catalan club closer to the Spanish title. The Argentina star curled in a superb free-kick on 59, then hit the crossbar with another set-piece before -- in the 70th minute -- finishing off a low cross from Alexis Sanchez, who had been put in space on the right by an exquisite backheel from Andres Iniesta.
