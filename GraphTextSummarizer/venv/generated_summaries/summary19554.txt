People feel like they know you by way of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" -- because that was a personal film in many ways -- but this book is actually much more personal, much more emotional. I wanted to write about these kids and the compassionate work these social workers and adoption attorneys do to place them in permanent homes. However, I have a nagging feeling that the success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" happened because I'm supposed to be using my big mouth to talk about adoption. CNN: Adoption advocacy, particularly adoption for children in foster care, is something you've been vocal about since long before you wrote this book. I wrote this book in the same way I wrote "My Big Fat Greek Wedding": I simply sat alone and poured my guts out into a computer keyboard, not caring how it would be received, not letting my mind wander into worrying what people would think of me.
