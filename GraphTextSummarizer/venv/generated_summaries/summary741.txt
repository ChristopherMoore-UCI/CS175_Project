It was the Eagles' first win of the tournament, after a 22-10 defeat to O'Sullivan's native Ireland on Sunday, with a superb 18th-minute try from scrumhalf Mike Petri after proving to be the difference between the two sides in wet conditions in New Plymouth. The Russians, making their World Cup debut, took an early 3-0 lead through a penalty from flyhalf Yury Kushnarev , but the U.S. rallied despite several misses from goalkicker Chris Wyles and the Bears were left with just a solitary bonus point to show for their efforts. -- U.S. coach Eddie O'Sullivan said he "couldn't be more proud" of his players after Thursday's hard-fought 13-6 victory over Russia at the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. " The Americans also beat Russia by a seven-point margin the last time they met, at the Churchill Cup in June, but U.S. captain Todd Clever said Nikolay Nerush's side were making impressive progress. "It was a great victory for us," former Ireland coach O'Sullivan told the World Cup's official website.
