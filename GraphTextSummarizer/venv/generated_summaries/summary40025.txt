-- One year after the collapse of banking stalwart Lehman Brothers, the administrator of its European business says the full impact on creditors may not be known until 2010. Tony Lomas, a partner for PricewaterhouseCoopers, has been sorting through the financial remains of the banking giant's European division since last September, when it became clear the bank would file for bankruptcy. Within a week of Lehman's collapse, Lomas sold Lehman's equity trading business to Nomura. One year ago cameras caught shocked Lehman Brothers' employees leaving the building with boxes. "One of the big reasons why we retained the infrastructure here was because we knew we were going to be dependent on it for many years to come because of the complexity of what we were unraveling," Lomas said.
