"It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government," said the article, titled "Libya's Pathway to Peace," by U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. In order for that transition to succeed, Gadhafi must go and go for good." Clinton: Terms for Gadhafi "non-negotiable" At that point, they added, "the United Nations and its members should help the Libyan people as they rebuild where Gadhafi has destroyed -- to repair homes and hospitals, to restore basic utilities, and to assist Libyans as they develop the institutions to underpin a prosperous and open society." In a joint opinion piece to be published Friday, the leaders of the United States, Britain and France lay out in stark terms their contention that Libya's future must not include its leader, Moammar Gadhafi. The leaders called for an end to violence and for the regime's forces to pull back from the embattled cities of Ajdabiya, Misurata and Zintan, which have been besieged by Libyan government forces. The decision about who will replace the current Libyan leaders will be left up to the Libyans themselves, they said.
