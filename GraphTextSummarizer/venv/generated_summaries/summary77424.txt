-- Gills Onions recalled 2,360 pounds of diced red onions because of possible listeria contamination, the California-based company said Saturday. The recalled onions were distributed to retailers in Canada and retailers and distributors in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Idaho, Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida. In extreme cases, listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths, as well as serious and sometimes fatal infections, especially in people with poor immune systems. However, it can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. The voluntary recall was initiated after a routine and random test directed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Gills Onions said.
