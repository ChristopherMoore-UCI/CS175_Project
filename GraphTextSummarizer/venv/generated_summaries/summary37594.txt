Ferguson awaits grand jury decision Paffrath said he is sure the influx of folks from Homeland Security must have something to do with preparations for the potential reaction to the upcoming grand jury decision in the case of Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown in August, sparking three months of daily -- and sometimes violent -- protests. A Navy veteran in Missouri said he was fired from his job and called a terrorist for posting pictures to Facebook of Homeland Security vehicles massing near Ferguson. A law enforcement source told CNN the Department of Homeland Security does have additional resources in place to protect federal buildings, but they're also there because the world's attention is on Ferguson, which could attract attackers looking to make a statement. The pictures he took and posted on Thursday were of dozens of vehicles marked with the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Protection Services. Paffrath said the large number of federal vehicles and employees arrived last week.
