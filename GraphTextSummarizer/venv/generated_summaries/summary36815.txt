"They literally jumped up 10 inches and tipped over," said Manon, 61, a California native and former Peace Corps volunteer. " Manon's experience with the topic goes back to 1972, when he was a Peace Corps volunteer in Managua, Nicaragua, and an earthquake destroyed the center of the city, killing thousands. Manon appealed Wednesday to a nationwide convention of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association in Atlanta for help getting teams of workers and trucks to Haiti. Here's what they found: All four power plants serving the city were off line; power lines lay on the ground all over the place; the earthquake had tossed 56-ton transformers from their bases. Manon and his colleagues, Bud Stanley and Christian Ponce, worked to get live lines to critical sites, like hospitals, water pumping stations and grocery stores.
