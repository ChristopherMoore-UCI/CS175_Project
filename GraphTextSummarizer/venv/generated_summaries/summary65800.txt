According to Long Beach Unified School District spokesman Chris Eftychiou, Joanna finished her regular school session at 2:12 p.m. on February 24 and was supposed to remain on campus to begin her scheduled after-school program at 2:30. Joanna stayed in the afternoon session for about an hour but did not exhibit obvious signs of physical trauma, Eftychiou said. Authorities declined to file criminal charges Wednesday against a fifth-grade student for the death of 10-year-old Joanna Ramos, who suffered fatal blunt force head trauma after a fistfight in February. "They determined that they would not file any charges in the case." Long Beach authorities declined further comment about the case. "Only when she was at the hospital did we get word about the altercation." Joanna had been enrolled at the school for about a year and a half, Eftychiou said.
