Asked by CNN if Decerega will be getting a presidential pardon, a top White House aide just laughed. According to Gibbs, "After being inadvertently hit with an opposing player's elbow in the lip while playing basketball with friends and family, the president received 12 stitches today administered by the White House Medical Unit.
