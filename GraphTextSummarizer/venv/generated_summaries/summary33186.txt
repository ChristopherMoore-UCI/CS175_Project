Though the state is almost paralyzed by widespread poverty and poor health care, political observers say caste and religion still take precedence over development in local politics. The count from multiphased polling in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, showed the Congress party winning in less than 30 of the 403 boroughs. In the run-up to polling, the Congress-led federal government, reeling from a raft of multibillion-dollar corruption scandals, approved job quotas for minority groups in a move widely perceived as an attempt to woo the Muslim community in Uttar Pradesh -- which makes up an estimated 18% of the state's population, according to official figures. The ousted leader, Mayawati, became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2007 after leading her Bahujan Samaj Party to an overwhelming victory in this state of more than 200 million people. Meantime, Congress suffered a major setback in other states.
