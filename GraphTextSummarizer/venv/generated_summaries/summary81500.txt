Lady Gaga reached an out-of-court settlement with her former assistant who sued for unpaid overtime, according to a court filing. Details of the deal were not revealed in a document filed in court last week asking the clerk to close the case. "Every day is a work day for her, so every day is a work day for the rest of us," O'Neill said, according to court documents. U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe ruled last month against Gaga's lawyer's request that the case be dismissed. The lawsuit, which sought $350,000 in back pay from the singer, had been set for trial in New York starting next week.
