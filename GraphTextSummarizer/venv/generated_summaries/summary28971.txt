On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security released a letter from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar addressed to BPchief executive Anthony Hayward, calling on the company to state its "true intentions" for compensating those affected by the spill. Suttles said the device was hoisted back to the surface Friday for readjustments and the company expects to have it working by Saturday night. The Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the decision to use subsea dispersants is an "important step" at reducing potential damage from the spill, because dispersant can be more effective underwater than on the ocean's surface. "The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill may prove to be one of the most devastating environmental disasters this nation has ever faced," said the letter, which was dated Friday. Meanwhile, Suttles said the application of underwater dispersants -- a tactic approved for use Friday -- "appears" to be working.
