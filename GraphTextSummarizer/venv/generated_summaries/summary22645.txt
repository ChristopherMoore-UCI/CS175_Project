The affidavit, filed by the Texas Department of Public Safety's Ranger Division, details what authorities believe links Evan Spencer Ebel, who died in a shootout with sheriff's deputies in Texas, and the Colorado killing of state prisons chief Tom Clements. One is that Ebel, a former member of the 211s -- a white-supremacist prison gang -- might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements, Paula Presley of the El Paso County, Colorado, sheriff's department said. His father, Jack Ebel, an attorney and former oil executive, counts Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper among his friends. On Friday, the wreckage of the Cadillac was under intense scrutiny after witnesses reported a similar vehicle -- a black, boxy car with Colorado license plates -- near the Monument, Colorado, house of Clements on Tuesday, the day he was killed. The governor said he never intervened on behalf of the younger Ebel, and he said Jack Ebel never made such a request.
