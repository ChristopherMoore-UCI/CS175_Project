The allegations of civilian casualties reverberated through the Afghan government and Washington as U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta arrived in Kabul for talks on Thursday. While militant attacks have caused by far the greatest number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, many Afghans and coalition members have expressed concern about civilian deaths caused by air operations. " Afghan official: NATO airstrike kills 8 family members Panetta did not address the controversy over the airstrike in his public remarks while in Kabul.
