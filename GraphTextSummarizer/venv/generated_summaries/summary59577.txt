"When it is this cold down there, they hibernate." Pierce lives and works most of the year in the northern Chesapeake Bay. "But overall there is still a lot of problems with the bay from runoff, from ... sewage from sewage treatment plants, agricultural runoff. " Most of that is gone, Pierce says, and for all the commitment to "Save the Bay" he is of the view little progress has been made, and that development on the shoreline, population growth in the area and runoff from area farms and lawns have greatly outpaced conservation and restoration efforts. It is just after first light, and Don Pierce gently eases the Bri-Steff off the pier at Cape Charles harbor. His closest crab pot is nearly five miles out into Chesapeake Bay, and the bouncing -- and rocking -- starts just seconds after passing the mouth of the protected harbor.
