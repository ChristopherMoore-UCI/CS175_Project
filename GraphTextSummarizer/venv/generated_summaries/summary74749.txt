Fariq Ab Hamid, a 27-year-old Malaysian, helped fly the plane from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur, where he landed it under the supervision of a senior pilot as well as a safety captain, according to CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest, who was also in the cockpit. The first officer aboard Malaysia Airlines MH370 when it disappeared early Saturday from radar was transitioning to work on the Boeing 777-200. The airline's first officers are trained to the same standards as the captains, Quest said he was told by airline officials. He had been flying another jet and was transitioning to the Boeing 777-200 after having completed training in a flight simulator. The network was shooting video of the landing for use in a "CNN Business Traveler" program.
