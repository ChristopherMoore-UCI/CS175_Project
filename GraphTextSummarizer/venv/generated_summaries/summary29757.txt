His son, Ahmad, told the official IRNA news agency that his 87-year-old father passed away due to cardiac arrest at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, Press TV reported. Senior Iranian dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri died overnight, several state-run Iranian news agencies reported Sunday. CNN producer Shirzad Bozorgmehr saw no unusual activity in the vicinity of Tehran University, at Haft-e-Tir Square or Revolution Square in Tehran on Sunday. Montazeri, for example, took a public stand against nuclear weapons in October, issuing a fatwa, or religious edict, declaring them to be "un-Islamic" and instructing Muslims to take the lead in banning them, said Nazenin Ansari, diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper Kayhan in London. He studied under Khomeini and then acted as his representative in Iran after Khomeini was exiled by the shah for criticizing the monarchy, Ansari said.
