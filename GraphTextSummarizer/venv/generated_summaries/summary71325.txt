-- Swiss banking giant UBS is changing the way it pays out bonuses to its 6,000 highest earners to limit the firm's exposure to risk and loss. Under the new compensation model, UBS will dole out a larger portion of annual bonuses in the form of bonds instead of cash. Many financial institutions that received government bailouts during the financial crisis were contractually obligated to continue to pay out bonuses, which raised taxpayer ire. In a press release, UBS said "the changes focus UBS's employees on medium- and longer-term performance, provide them with the opportunity to benefit from the firms longer term success, and simplify UBS's compensation framework, making it more transparent." The move signals a shift in the politically-charged issue of bank bonuses.
