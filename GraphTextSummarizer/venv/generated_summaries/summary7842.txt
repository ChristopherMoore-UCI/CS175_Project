Fighting took place on Friday and Saturday near the Preah Vihear temple, an 11th century structure which straddles the boundary between Cambodia and Thailand. In July 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the U.N. believes has outstanding universal value. But Thailand says that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 square kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia. Events along the Thai-Cambodia border were being closely monitored, according to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley, and both sides were called on to "take all necessary steps to reduce tensions and avoid further conflict." The United States urged Thailand and Cambodia on Friday to show "maximum restraint" in the wake of clashes over an ancient temple claimed by both countries.
