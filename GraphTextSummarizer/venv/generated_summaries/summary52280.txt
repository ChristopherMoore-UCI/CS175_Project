The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law spotlights three potential threats: voter registration problems (3 million people were unable to vote in 2008 because of such issues and registration efforts are notably fewer than the last election), ballot "security" operations (often allegations of voter suppression or intimidation) and voting machines. In a previous posting about voting issues, I mentioned J. Alex Halderman, an assistant professor of engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, whose "resume" includes hacking into voting machines in the name of exposing security flaws. Along the way, Halderman's team "collected crucial secret data stored on the server," "modified all the ballots that had already been cast to contain write-in votes for candidates we selected," "installed a back door that let us view any ballots that voters cast after our attack," and -- best of all -- "left a 'calling card' on the system's confirmation screen, which voters see after voting. Concerns remain about U.S. military personnel stationed overseas getting ballots from their home states in time to vote and mail back before Election Day. The controversy over the Justice Department's handling of the "Black Panther" voter intimidation case in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Election Day 2008 has not faded; if anything, it's grown as an issue for political conservatives.
