Alpine Edge: Inside World Cup venues "Weather was a huge factor but hats off to Erik and Jansrud who ran in the snow and the fog," Nyman said. On Saturday Nyman celebrated his first World Cup victory since 2006, having recently returned to top-level action after missing all of last season. The two-time Olympian took advantage of improving conditions to head off Slovenia's surprise second-placer Rok Perko by 0.19 seconds, with Canadian Erik Guay finishing third from Norway's Kjetil Jansrud. " Meanwhile, Saturday's women's World Cup Super G race at Val d'Isere was called off due to heavy snow at the French resort. The Achilles last year, the knees years before that and the back -- this is the best gift I could have." Friday's race winner Aksel Lund Svindal was fifth, extending his overall lead to 177 points from absent American Ted Ligety, who will return to action for Sunday's giant slalom across the mountain at Alta Badia.
