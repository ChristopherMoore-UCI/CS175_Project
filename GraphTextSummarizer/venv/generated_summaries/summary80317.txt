Investigators recently learned forensic evidence links the February 9, 2006, killing of a pregnant Sonia Mejia and the February 9, 2008, slaying of Damiana Castillo, police in two neighboring Salt Lake City suburbs announced last week. "I'm scared for me and my daughter to be here," West Valley City resident Elizabeth Berrelleza told KTVX. Castillo, 57, was found strangled in her apartment two years later in West Valley City, about a mile away from Mejia's apartment, according to CNN affiliate KTVX-TV in Salt Lake City. Authorities are trying to determine whether the date is significant, but they want residents "to be cautious in general" and not focus just on Monday, West Valley City police Sgt. The departments had known about each other's cases and had compared information for quite some time, "but it's just recently that we've been able to link the cases," Powell said.
