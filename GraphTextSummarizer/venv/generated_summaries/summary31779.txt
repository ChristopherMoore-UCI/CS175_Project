Brahimi visits Lebanon on cease-fire mission Scrambling to find a solution to Syria's bloody civil war, international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi visited Lebanon and campaigned for a cease-fire in Syria. "People bury one hundred persons a day, and if this number is reduced during Eid, it may be a start to bring Syria out of this dangerous situation that is has slipped and continues to slip into," Brahimi said, as reported by the Lebanese National News Agency. Turkey, Syria trade fire Turkey and Syria traded artillery rounds along their borders, Turkish authorities said. The reported toll in and around Damascus was 48, with another 46 killed in Aleppo, Syria's commercial capital, the group said. Opposition activists say more than 30,000 people have been killed since March 2011, when anti-government protesters took to the streets calling for political reform and an end to four decades of Assad family rule.
