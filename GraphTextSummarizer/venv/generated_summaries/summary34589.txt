"Eliza's life was just beginning and it was quickly taken away and all due to a senseless act of violence," Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said Monday. "To the person or persons that are responsible ... please know that our police officers will do everything in their power to find you." Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna repeatedly urged anyone who may have witnessed the crime to come forward, saying the public's help will be "extremely critical to solving this case." The abduction and death of the infant has shocked the community, including police officers accustomed to seeing tragedies. On Sunday, police said San Diego authorities had found her body. Eliza Delacruz was abducted from a home in Long Beach on Saturday night after her mother, father and uncle were shot.
