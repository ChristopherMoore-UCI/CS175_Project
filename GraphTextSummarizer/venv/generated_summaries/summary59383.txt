Authorities confirmed the identity of two of four sets of remains found Monday in the California desert near Victorville as those of Joseph McStay and his wife Summer, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said Friday. Although investigators said someone had been researching travel to Mexico on the family's home computer, the McStays' sudden disappearance and the fact that their credit cards and bank accounts went unused raised suspicions. "It gives us courage to know they are together, and they're in a better place," said Joseph's younger brother Mike McStay, choking back tears. Two other remains found nearby are believed to be those of their sons Joseph and Gianni, McMahon said. The McStays lived in Fallbrook, about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and some 50 miles north of San Diego.
