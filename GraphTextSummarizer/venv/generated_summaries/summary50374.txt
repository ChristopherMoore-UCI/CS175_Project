By early Wednesday, site users insider China continued to encounter an error message: "Network Timeout. In March 2008, China blocked YouTube during riots in Tibet. " China, with 298 million Internet users, has routinely blocked access to Web sites it considers politically unacceptable, including the Voice of America and The New York Times. "We manage the Internet according to law ... to prevent the spread of harmful information." YouTube, which allows users to upload and share videos, has been banned periodically in other countries as well.
