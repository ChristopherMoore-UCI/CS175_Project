The secret recordings published last month revealed that Florence Woerth was, until late June, the deputy to Bettencourt's financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre. At the same time, police are investigating claims that Bettencourt's adviser gave envelopes of cash to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Labor Minister Eric Woerth. -- French police are searching the home of the daughter of L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, a spokeswoman from the prosecutor's office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre told CNN Wednesday. Among other claims is that Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign received money from Bettencourt in excess of campaign finance limits. Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, went to court last month accusing a photographer of bilking her mother out of a billion euros.
