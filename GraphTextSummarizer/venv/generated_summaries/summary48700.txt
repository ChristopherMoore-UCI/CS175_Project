For the record the other members of the court and their canine counterparts: Chief Justice John Roberts (German shorthaired pointer); and Justices Antonin Scalia (bulldog); Anthony Kennedy (boxer); Clarence Thomas (Rottweiler); Stephen Breyer (beagle); Samuel Alito (Portuguese water dog); Sonia Sotomayor (Boston terrier); and Elena Kagan (bull terrier). The work of the court is very important, but the current courtroom setup without cameras is "boring" to the general public, making media coverage "unwatchable," said the show's host John Oliver. "I thought it was hilarious," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said of the dog video at a Washington event earlier this week. The biggest concerns raised by the justices are that having cameras will upset the personal dynamic between them that make oral arguments so unique and useful to their later deliberations and opinion-writing. The solution-- pair each of the nine robed justices-- as well as the lawyers and court staff-- with a dog (or a duck in one case), with fake paws.
