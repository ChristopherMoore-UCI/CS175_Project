-- In late November, U.S. soldiers were supervising artillery training for Afghan troops in Nangarhar province, close to the Pakistan border. The official said cultural differences over the handling of weapons and the attitude of western soldiers to Afghan women can exacerbate tensions. Among measures being taken to prevent such attacks, commanders are told to ensure Afghan troops who've been in combat are getting adequate rest; and coalition officers are being taught to watch for warning signs.
