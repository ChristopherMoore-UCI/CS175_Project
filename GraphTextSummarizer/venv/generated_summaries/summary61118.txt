A Japanese company is attempting to remedy at least one of those wrongs with a teeny, tiny Roomba-like screen cleaner for mobile devices called the AutoMee S. The wee gadget, spotted by Engadget is a fun and cheap little invention by Japanese company Takara Tomy. Using an alcohol-based cleaner is the best way to get all of the bacteria, but it can strip off the oleophobic (oil resistant) coating found on many touchscreen devices. A sensor detects the edges of the phone or tablet so the device spins around to take another pass instead of wandering off onto your desk and accidentally cleaning unsuspecting pencils and mouse pads. Phones and tablets are teeming with bacteria such as E. coli that can cause illnesses. It takes four minutes to clean a phone and eight minutes to fully cover a tablet using the AutoMee.
