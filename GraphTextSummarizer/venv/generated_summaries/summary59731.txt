The rugged area is prone to road accidents, and road safety is generally poor in most parts of Indonesia. The crash took place Wednesday morning in Puncak, West Java, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster agency. The cool, mountainous area of Puncak is a popular holiday destination for Jakarta residents. Nugroho said there were indications that the driver lost control of the bus after its brakes stopped working. The passengers on the bus were members of different churches in Jakarta who were returning from a retreat.
