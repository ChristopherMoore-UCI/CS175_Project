-- Few can claim to have had a bigger impact on the glittering coaching career of new Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola than Juan Manuel Lillo. Lillo took his first coaching job at the tender age of 16 and went on to manage 13 clubs in his 19-year career, including Mexican side Dorados Sinaloa, where Guardiola finished his playing career. Ironically, an 8-0 Spanish league defeat by Guardiola's Barcelona lost Lillo his last coaching job, at Almeria, but the 47-year-old remains a keen student of the game. I don't know if Pep made his decision thinking in the negative aspects of other clubs. Do you think Guardiola will have a lot of success at Bayern?
