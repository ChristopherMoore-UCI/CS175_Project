The New York Hall of Science is part of network of disruptive leaders figuring out how to take this burst of maker interest and use it to improve science education. "What I'm really interested in is an alternative way of engaging kids and getting them into science and technology," Dougherty said. -- When 60,000 tinkerers arrive at the New York Hall of Science this weekend for World Maker Faire New York, kids will see original action figures designed on a 3-D printer, homemade race cars, robots and a sewing machine turned into a music box. Thanks to innovative Pittsburgh foundations that launched the Kids + Creativity Network  in 2007, the region is aligning science instruction in schools with the kinds of activities kids are doing on their own time. Elementary students receive science education for less than three hours a week.
