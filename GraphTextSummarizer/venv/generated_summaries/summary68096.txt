A year earlier, according to the Orange County district attorney, Alcala had raped, sodomized and killed two women: Jill Barcomb, an 18-year-old New Yorker who had recently moved to California, and Georgia Wixted, a 27-year-old nurse. "Losing Robin, we lost so many things," said Marianne Connelly, the mother of Robin Samsoe, 12, whom authorities said Alcala murdered in 1979. The district attorney said Alcala used a large rock to smash in Barcomb's face and then "strangled her to death by tying a belt and pant leg around her neck." Three more murders followed Alcala's appearance on the show, the district attorney said. "Based on a semi-rare blood match, Alcala was linked to the murder," the district attorney said.
