Christopher Martinez was in a deli where Elliot Rodger fired several rounds, police said. Rodger also killed three men in his apartment and two women outside a sorority house, police have said, and drove wildly in his black BMW, shooting at pedestrians and injuring some. Theirs is a meeting wrought with profound grief, spurred by shared tragedy. Peter Rodger's 22-year-old son, Elliot Rodger, went on an armed rampage in late May in Isla Vista, California, killing six people. One of them was Richard Martinez's 20-year-old son, Christopher Martinez, a University of California, Santa Barbara student.
