Brandis travels with others to developing countries to show local shellers how to use and make the machines themselves. After fiddling, cranking and grinding his way through a number of prototypes in his Wilmington, North Carolina, studio, Brandis developed a simple machine that could shell nuts up to 50 times faster than by hand. -- It was a woman's raw, bleeding hands that led Jock Brandis to make a promise. To give this "gift to the world," Brandis joined forces with a group of former Peace Corps volunteers and co-founded the Full Belly Project in 2003, a nonprofit organization dedicated to designing and distributing technologies like the universal nut sheller. Having tinkered and toiled with "gizmos" as a former gaffer in the film industry, Brandis set out to make a peanut sheller himself.
