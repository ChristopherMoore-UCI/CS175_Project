It may have been 40 years since NASA put the first man on the moon, but the number of products that use space technology doesn't seem to be diminishing. "We are fairly liberal with our application of the term spinoff," said editor Daniel Lockney. Watch some of the spin-offs developed from space technology Â» What you won't find on the list is the bright orange powered drink, Tang, or Teflon, or Velcro -- all products that have over time been erroneously linked to NASA's space mission. They are listed in detail in "Spinoff," a NASA magazine first compiled in 1976 as a definitive guide to the commercialized products whose development can be tied to space technology. "Tang was developed by General Foods before NASA was even made a federal agency, but it was popularized during astronaut tasting experiments," Lockney said.
