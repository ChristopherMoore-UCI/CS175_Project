"The people of Zambia have spoken and we must listen," outgoing President Rupiah Banda said on the website of his Movement for Multiparty Democracy. -- Zambia's incumbent president bowed out with "grace and honor" Friday after election results showed his main challenger had won, his party said in a statement. The incoming president, Michael Sata, will be sworn in Friday, party officials said. Zambia has remained relatively peaceful amid unrest in neighboring Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sata is the leader of the opposition Patriotic Front and a major critic of China's investment in the nation.
