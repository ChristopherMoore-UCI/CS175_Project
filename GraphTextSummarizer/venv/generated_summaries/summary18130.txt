It would minimize the acrimony and unrest that quadrennial elections generate at the federal and state levels, he said, adding that it would also save the government the expense of conducting party primaries and general elections every four years. "The proposed amendment bill is necessary to consolidate our democracy and allow elected executives to concentrate on governance and service delivery for their full term, instead of running governments with re-election as their primary focus," he said. -- The term of service for the president should be extended from its current four years -- renewable once -- to a single term of "a little more than four years," Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Tuesday in a statement. Though Jonathan took power in May, his hold on it remains tenuous: He has yet to form a complete cabinet; has failed to push through passage of a major petroleum bill; and has failed to quell violence in the north. Jonathan noted that "certain reports in a section of the media" had interpreted his move as an attempt to lengthen his hold on power.
