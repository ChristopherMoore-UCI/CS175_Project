-- Two members of the England coaching staff have been banned from their crucial Rugby World Cup clash with Scotland on Saturday for illegally switching the match ball during a win against Romania. "Two members of the RFU RWC 2011 team management, David Alred and Paul Stridgeon, mistakenly thought that there was an issue with some of the match balls used in the England v Romania RWC 2011 match," read the RFU statement. The Pool B contest between Martin Johnson's England and Scotland, led by former England coach Andy Robinson, is key to both team's hope of reaching the quarterfinals. Kicking coach Dave Aldred and fitness coach Paul Stridgeon will not be allowed into the match at Eden Park after changing the ball before two of flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson's conversions in England's 67-3 victory on October 24. The Rugby Football Union (RFU), the body in charge of English rugby, acted swiftly to ban the duo and Rugby World Cup Limited (RWCL) confirmed no further sanctions will be brought against the 2003 world champions.
