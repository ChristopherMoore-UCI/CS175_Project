According to the FBI, Chesimard, Clark Squire, and James Coston were stopped for a motor vehicle violation on the New Jersey Turnpike by two state troopers. Chesimard, now known as "Assata Shakur," is wanted in the killing of Trooper Werner Foerster on the New Jersey Turnpike on May 2, 1973, the FBI  said. Forty years after the grisly execution-style murder of a New Jersey state trooper, the woman convicted of his killing has been  placed on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list -- the first woman to be named on it. Chesimard and Squire were tried and convicted of the murder, and were serving time in 1979 when Chesimard escaped from prison "with help from a coalition of radical, domestic terror groups who took two guards hostage during an armed assault at the facility where she was being lodged," the FBI statement said. Rewards of $2 million -- $1 million from the FBI and $1 million from the state of New Jersey -- have been offered for information leading to her capture and return.
