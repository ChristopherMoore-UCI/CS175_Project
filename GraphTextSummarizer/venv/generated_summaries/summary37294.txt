Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock with a space station of any kind when it met up on June 4, 1998, with Russia's now defunct Mir space station. Bowen, a late addition, became the first ever astronaut to fly consecutive missions after he was assigned to take the place of Tim Kopra when Kopra was injured last month in a bicycle accident, according to NASA. Having been removed from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached to the station's truss, or backbone, the 8,235-pound logistics carrier will be used to stow spare parts, including an extra radiator that was brought up by Discovery's crew. NASA officials said they didn't foresee a problem -- explaining that, at that altitude, the flying foam was unlikely to do any damage to the spacecraft. Astronauts on Sunday will continue moving items brought up on Discovery over to the space station.
