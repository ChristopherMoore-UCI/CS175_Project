Sports Illustrated senior writer Jon Wertheim said Monday that the sheer speed of race cars, and the minimal distance separating them, means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway. She said she believes Wheldon's death will "kind of raise the bar" in terms of safety for drivers. " Wheldon's death was the first for the IndyCar circuit since March 2006, when driver Paul Dana was killed in a two-car crash while warming up for the season-opening race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Wheldon, for example, was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 miles an hour when Sunday's crash occurred. At the same time, it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside, and potentially collide with, one another.
