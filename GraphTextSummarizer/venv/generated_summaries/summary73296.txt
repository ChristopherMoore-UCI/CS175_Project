"In Aleppo, there is a huge influx of wounded in local hospitals ... less and less security and more bombing on civilian areas," Simon Schorno, Syria spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told CNN by phone from Damascus. CNN cannot independently verify daily death tolls, but the United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011. "There was a big massacre today," Dr. Ammar Zakaria told CNN via Skype on Sunday from the country's largest city and rebel stronghold. On Sunday alone, 166 people were killed across the country, 92 in Aleppo, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria. "Supplies of food and other basic necessities are running dangerously short, especially in besieged areas," said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC delegation in Syria.
