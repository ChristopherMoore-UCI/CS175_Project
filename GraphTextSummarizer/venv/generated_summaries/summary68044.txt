I'm sure no one in the White House thought my comments on Chuck Hagel's confirmation hearing were necessarily pro-Obama. For a while, it served as the Bush administration in exile, with such loyalists as Karl Rove, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton and ex-press secretary Dana Perino. Former party chairman and Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell has also become a fixture, as well as former party spokeswoman Karen Finney. Watch: Should Fox News have hired tarnished candidate Herman Cain? Now the former senior adviser and former press secretary will be holding forth on their former boss.
