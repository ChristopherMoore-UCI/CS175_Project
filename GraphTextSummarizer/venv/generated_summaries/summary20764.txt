"I would like to plead with the U.S. government, press and my family to stop worsening my situation by making vile rumors against North Korea and releasing materials related to me, which are not based on the facts," he said before video cameras in Pyongyang. Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen being held in North Korea, told reporters on Monday that he had committed a "serious crime" in the secretive nation and that he had not experienced abusive treatment by the regime. The North Korean government accused Bae of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. His sister Terri Chung released a statement that later Monday, at one point, addresses North Korean leaders. "I want to be pardoned by the North as soon as possible and return to my beloved family," Bae told journalists from several news organizations.
