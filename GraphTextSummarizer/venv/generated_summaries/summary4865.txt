Dodd attributes his commitment to public service and human rights to his parents, the late Sen. Thomas Dodd and Grace Murphy Dodd, according to his Senate biography. Dodd had also received more campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than any other lawmaker, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Despite his troubles, Dodd said he managed four major pieces of legislation through Congress in the past year: health care reform, credit card reform, the tobacco regulation bill and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act. Dodd also faced controversy when news surfaced that he had received favorable mortgage terms from now-defunct sub-prime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial. Dodd is Connecticut's longest-serving senator.
