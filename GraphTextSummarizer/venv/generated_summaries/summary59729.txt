Police crackdowns on orderly protests became rare, although the WTO meeting in Seattle in 1999 marked a shift back to a stronger emphasis on public order, at least in the United States. The perception of collective street protest as a public order problem persisted well into the 20th century and only started to change with the arrival of the middle-class based "New Social Movements" after the Second World War. At least as important as the chance to gain access to the media is the effect such protests have on supporters and sympathizers. Already the Labour Movement, whose 19th century demonstrations provided the template for all subsequent demonstrations, used them to present the public with an image of the working class in action. Although the police framed their actions as a measure to keep the traffic flowing -- an argument that authorities around the world have used since the late 19th century to regulate protest marches -- and did not arrest those who walked on the sidewalks, the detention of more than 700 people appeared heavy-handed.
