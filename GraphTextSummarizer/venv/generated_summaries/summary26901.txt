Levinson family members have met with local Iranian officials and have traveled to Iran to retrace his steps. The State Department and FBI have consistently denied Levinson was working for the government and have demanded Iran free Levinson -- if it is holding him. " Wexler and Nelson said they plan to introduce legislation in their respective houses calling on Iran to cooperate with the United States and come up with information about Levinson. Christine Levinson, wife of Robert Levinson, went to Tehran in 2007 to try to learn her husband's fate. "So, again, we call on the Iranians to provide whatever information they have on Mr. Levinson so that we can hopefully return this gentleman to his family."
