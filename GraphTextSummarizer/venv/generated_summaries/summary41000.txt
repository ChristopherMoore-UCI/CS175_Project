Whether or not it was a pointed reference to "Think Like a Man Too's" fellow new release or not is unknown, but the Clint Eastwood adaptation of "Jersey Boys" hit a bit of a flat note in fourth place with $13.5 million. With a second-week drop of 49.8% in domestic markets, and a $14.1 million pickup in international territories, Sony executives should be bumping chests. There's a couple of great jokes in "Think Like a Man Too" where the lone square fella of the core Vegas bachelor party suggests the boys eschew a night of gambling and strip clubs and catch a performance of "Jersey Boys" instead. But with a budget of $40 million, "Jersey Boys," which earned an impressive A- CinemaScore vote, still has some major singing to do for its supper. Jersey Boys -- $13.5 million 5.
