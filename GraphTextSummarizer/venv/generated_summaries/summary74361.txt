" U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to announce a new strategy for Afghanistan on Friday that includes sending another 4,000 troops to the country with hundreds of civilian specialists, senior administration officials told CNN. Britain is prepared to send more troops to Afghanistan, the head of the British Army said in an interview published Friday. The troops -- which are in addition to the 17,000 that the president announced earlier would be sent to Afghanistan -- will be charged with training and building the Afghan Army and police force. Military officials told CNN earlier that the Afghan government had requested the additional troops. Britain currently has 8,300 troops in Afghanistan.
