As the thirst for instant news has grown ever more insatiable, the "live blog" a time-stamped, regularly-updated, predominantly text-based report of breaking stories has become a staple of internet news and sport coverage. But in recent years, live-blogging has also become the default approach to covering much harder breaking news stories: the uprisings of the Arab spring, the phone-hacking scandal in the UK and the Norway shootings, for example, were all covered in live blogs on almost all major news platforms. The combined package of news and interactivity lends itself especially well to sport coverage, where it can mimic the experience of watching a match and discussing it with friends. But for all the recent proliferation of live blogs, some media analysts say that rolling coverage is not always appropriate, pointing to some notable lapses in editorial judgment. McSpurren agrees that the true strength of live blogging relies on the skills of the reporter to offer relevant analysis, publish pictures and launch appropriate poll questions.
