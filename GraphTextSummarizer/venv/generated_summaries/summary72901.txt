Doctors say 2-year-old Dax Locke is losing his fight with acute myeloid leukemia and may only have weeks to live, so parents Julie and Austin Locke put Christmas lights up outside their home for the little boy, who loves glowing things. "We don't have much time left with Dax, don't know if he will make it to Christmas, so we wanted to have Christmas early," Julie Locke told local news station WMBD. Soon, the entire block was lit up with Christmas lights. From there, she and other neighbors have helped encourage people to show silent support for the family by putting up Christmas lights at home and around the community. It's unusual to see Christmas lights up so early, but this year, there's a good reason.
