"Weightlifting is an Olympic Sport open for all athletes to participate without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin in accordance with the principles of the Olympic Charter and values," Tamas Ajan, IWF president, said Wednesday. Wednesday's rule change was prompted by an Atlanta woman, who wanted to take part in competitions governed by IWF rules but still adhere to the modest dress of her Muslim faith. "I should at least try," she said, "if not for me then maybe for other women who -- if they have my faith or another faith -- dress a certain way." CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report But USA Weightlifting informed her that those events are governed by IWF rules, which at that time precluded her dressing in keeping with her beliefs. It's what I've chosen to do," Abdullah told CNN this month about her decision to wear modest garb.
