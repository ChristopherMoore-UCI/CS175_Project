But the nation who many fancy for the title, especially given the absence of African heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt, got the job done to get off to a good start in Group B. Balboa goal stuns Libya in Africa Cup of Nations opener Ivory Coast dominated the opening half with Gervinho, who plays for English club Arsenal, squandering two good opportunities to score. The goal stirred Sudan into action against a team ranked 102 places above them in the world soccer standings, as Eltaib Mudathe's shot was tipped onto the crossbar by Ivory Coast keeper Boubacar Barry. Mateus had put Angola ahead just after half time but Alain Traore leveled the scores with a well taken free kick before Manucho's precise shot from outside the penalty area ensured Angola went joint top of Group B with Ivory Coast. In the Group's other game, Angola beat Burkino Faso 2-1 thanks to a 68th minute winner from former Manchester United player Manucho. Drogba, who currently plays for English Premier League club Chelsea, grabbed the winner just before half time but Ivory Coast, nicknamed The Elephants, struggled for much of the game.
