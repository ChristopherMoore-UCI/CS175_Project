The judge instead ordered Powell undergo psychological evaluations -- an order that came after authorities turned up child pornography in the home Powell shared with his father, Steven Powell. -- Funeral services for the sons of Josh Powell are scheduled for early Saturday afternoon in Puyallup, Washington, where authorities say Powell set his house on fire, killing all three of them. Asked whether she believes Powell's motive was the custody battle or remarks made by the children, Judy Cox told "Today" she felt it was both. In the meantime, Powell, who had not been arrested or charged, was embroiled in an ugly custody dispute with the Cox family. " Cox-Powell's sister, Denise Cox, told CNN on Tuesday she had been told by her family that Powell could be arrested within a few weeks and that authorities were attempting to build a case against him despite the lack of a body.
