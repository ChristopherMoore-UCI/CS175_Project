Missing since 2009 Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, appeared to strike a nerve Wednesday when he pressed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on why it was taking the U.S. military so long to interview Army Sgt. " Hagel: Bergdahl deal was 'imperfect' but right decision The controversy It was that sort of day. Hagel already had fielded lawmakers' accusations that the White House overstepped presidential authority and negotiated with terrorists to gain Bergdahl's freedom. Bergdahl's release became clearer, we grew increasingly concerned that any delay, or any leaks, could derail the deal and further endanger" him, Hagel said.
