The four bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine. " The four bodies were discovered on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach, "which indicates they were dumped there by the same person or persons," Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said in December. "The remains found off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach, on March 29 have been determined to not be those of Shannan Gilbert," Suffolk County police said in a statement Thursday. -- Police say human remains found on a New York beach are not those of a missing woman whose search led authorities to the discovery of four dead prostitutes. The bodies were stuffed into bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property on Long Island, New York.
