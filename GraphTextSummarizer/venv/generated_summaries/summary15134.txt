Nearly 200 million Chinese will enter child-bearing age in the next 10 years, Minister Zhang Weiqing told China Daily two years ago. Because of a traditional preference for male heirs, many Chinese also have aborted female fetuses, according to human rights groups. Sex-specific abortions have led to a large male population born since the 1980s, the China Daily newspaper said, citing a study conducted by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Even within the country, calls to overhaul the law have increased in recent years, China Daily said. The policy has prevented about 400 million births, China Daily said.
