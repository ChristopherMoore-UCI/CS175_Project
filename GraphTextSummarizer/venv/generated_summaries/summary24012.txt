Meanwhile, Premier League side Newcastle have made their second summer signing with the capture of Senegalese striker Demba Ba from relegated West Ham. They flirted with relegation last season before finishing 11th in the table and coach Manuel Pellegrini has brought in the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Julio Baptista, Enzo Maresca and Martin Demichelis over the past year to launch a challenge for a Europa League place this season. The 28-year-old Nolan, the highest scoring midfielder in the Premier League last season with 12 goals, signed a five-year deal with the London side to be reunited once again with his former manager at Bolton, Sam Allardyce. The signing makes some amends for Newcastle, who this week lost club captain Kevin Nolan, ironically to West Ham. Ba, 26, had a clause in his contract which allowed him to move on if West ham were relegated, and he joins French midfielder Yohan Cabaye in arriving at St James' Park.
