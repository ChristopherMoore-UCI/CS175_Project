As far as the lawsuit is concerned, Welton's Star Maps business is what draws the gawkers. Jackson could have lived anywhere in the world, she said, but he chose the mansion on her Star Maps corner as he prepped for his "This is It" tour. Despite the property's notoriety and the looming criminal trial, there was no pilgrimage of Jackson fans, not even a lone "looky-loo," as people in Los Angeles call curiosity seekers. Her mother fought similar attempts by the city of Los Angeles to shut down her Star Maps business through the 1970s. On August 28, the eve of what would have been the pop star's 53rd birthday, Welton was chattier when she received a visit from a crew with "In Session," a show that features Murray's trial and other court cases and airs daily on CNN's sister network, truTV.
