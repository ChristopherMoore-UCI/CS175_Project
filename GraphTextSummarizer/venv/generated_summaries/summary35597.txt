Health care costs would go up significantly to accommodate this 20% increase in the number of people over 60 who will need more health care. That's money that could be better spent on taking care of actual health care costs. That formula doesn't account for rising health care costs (remember the cost of health insurance has gone up 113% since 2001), nor does it account for the aging population. Ken Thorpe, an Emory University economist who specializes in health care costs, may have been one of the few excited by all these numbers. Discussing how "middle-income Americans have been buried" financially under the president's policies, Republican challenger Mitt Romney said health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.
