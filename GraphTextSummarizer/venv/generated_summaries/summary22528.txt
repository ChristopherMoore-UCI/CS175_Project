Almost all Orange County cities have taken a hard line against medical marijuana dispensaries, partly because officials contend that criminal activity is prevalent near the storefronts, according to a November 17 memo by Orange County Public Works Director Jess Carbajal. In 2006, Los Angeles County revised its zoning regulations to allow for medical marijuana dispensaries. But Los Angeles County officials are now concerned about a growing number of illegally operating dispensaries. Los Angeles city officials recently began a crackdown on such illegal dispensaries within the city. "Attracting crime and other nuisances, these facilities have a negative impact on the communities where they've operated -- leading more than 100 cities and nine counties in California to pass similar ordinances," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich.
