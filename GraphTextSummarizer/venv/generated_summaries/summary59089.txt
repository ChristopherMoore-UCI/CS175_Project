"This gives us an opportunity to explain how wrong it has been to deny rights to individuals on that basis." Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state's Democratic Attorney General Jerry Brown are defendants in the lawsuit because of their positions in California government. Perry and Stier, along with Jeffrey Zarrillo and Paul Katami, of Los Angeles, are the two couples at the heart of the case, arguing that California's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional. On Monday, the spotlight will be even brighter, when a trial challenging California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage, begins in U. S. District Court in San Francisco. The Proposition 8 vote is part of a long line of seesaw rulings, court cases, debates and protests in California over the issue. It also closely echoes the Supreme Court case that overturned bans on interracial marriage.
