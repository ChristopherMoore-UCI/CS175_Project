A powerful 7.4-magnitude quake shook the Pacific coast of Central America on Tuesday, causing some damage and killing at least one person in El Salvador. El Salvador's Ministry of Weather and Natural Resources initially issued a tsunami warning for the coastal regions, saying the quake was felt throughout the country. A woman was killed when an electrical utility pole fell on her, Mayor Will Salgado said. The quake was deep (70.5 kilometers or 43 miles) but close to El Salvador's shoreline -- about 64 kilometers from the municipality of Intipuca.
