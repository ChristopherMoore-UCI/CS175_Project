-- German car manufacturer Mercedes completed a takeover of the rebranded Brawn GP Formula One team on Monday, after its parent company Deimler acquired all remaining shares from team principal Ross Brawn and his management partners. "As an independent team, it was the one piece that Red Bull previously didn't have compared to the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes. Elsewhere, last year's double world champions Red Bull have announced a sponsorship deal with luxury carmaker Infiniti. In collaboration with its largest shareholder Aabar, Deimler purchased the remaining 24.9% of the team, which is now known as Mercedes GP. Aabar, a global investment company owned by the Abu Dhabi government, now owns 40% of Mercedes GP.
