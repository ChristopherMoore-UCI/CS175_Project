-- The attorney for a family who filed a wrongful death lawsuit in the death of Mark Bavis, 31 -- who died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- says new court documents offer a glimpse into airport security lapses that made the attacks possible. The documents were filed in Manhattan federal court in a lawsuit against United Airlines, a private security company and Massachusetts Port Authority -- which owns and operates Logan airport. Mark Bavis, a hockey scout aboard United Airlines Flight 175, died when his flight crashed into the World Trade Center's south tower. Schiavo maintains that the airline "had exclusive control over its aircraft and over security procedures" and are ultimately responsible for the safety of its passengers. In the filing, Massport claims the Federal Aviation Administration regulations for screening passengers and their baggage was not the responsibility of airports but the airlines.
