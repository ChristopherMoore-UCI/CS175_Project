President Barack Obama wants federal authorities to immediately take further measures to ensure that health care workers are able to follow protocols for treating Ebola patients. Of the thousands of hospitals in the United States, only four have been training for years to deal with highly infectious diseases such as Ebola: Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the National Institutes of Health in Maryland and Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana. "Stopping Ebola is hard," he said, adding that the CDC will do anything possible to protect health care workers. Hospitals should be skilled at taking travel histories of people who show Ebola symptoms and should isolate those who have been to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, Frieden said. The CDC is "doubling down" on outreach and training to increase awareness of Ebola and make sure U.S. hospitals "think Ebola," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said Monday.
