"I think whether it is Jeb [Bush], or it is Mitt or whoever it might be, adding quality people to the field raises the level." In his speech, Perry did not necessarily present policy solutions, but rather critiques of Obama on everything from the President's handling of the economy and energy policy to foreign affairs. Perry sidestepped a direct question about what type of candidate Romney would be if he decided to seek the GOP nomination again. "What is on the ballot in 2016 is a choice whether we are going to ... rise to the challenge of defending Western values or accept the decline of Western civilization, because those who had the most to lose did the least to preserve freedom." Perry, who delivered his remarks from behind a podium, reading from prepared notes, was at times halting in his speech. Rick Perry used his final public address as Texas governor on Friday to sharply criticize President Barack Obama's stewardship of the country and called on fellow Republicans to articulate a plan to voters explaining how the GOP will turn the country around. "I'm not going to go back and rehash the 2012 campaign," Perry said when asked what was Mitt Romney's biggest mistake as presidential nominee.
