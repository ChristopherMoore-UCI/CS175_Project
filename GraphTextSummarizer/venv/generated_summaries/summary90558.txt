One manager of a restaurant just down the street recalled how the alleged gangster and his girlfriend liked the privacy of a far corner table and once worked up a $192 bill, plus tip, for a steak and lobster dinner, accompanied by foie gras, vodka highballs and chardonnay. And recently, Greig had been telling friends that Bulger was showing signs of Alzheimer's and was suffering depression, unable to sleep or to get out of bed, neighbor Catalina Schlank told CNN. In September 2009, Bulger and Greig had two Grey Goose vodka cocktails, two chardonnays, and an appetizer of foie gras. Another neighbor, Denise Walsh, who lives four doors down from apartment 303, where Bulger and Greig lived for up to 15 years, said the couple often walked hand-in-hand and stopped to pet dogs, telling people they were canine lovers. It's a white-tablecloth establishment of 32 years, known for attracting Hollywood producers, said general manager Andrew Turner, 41.
