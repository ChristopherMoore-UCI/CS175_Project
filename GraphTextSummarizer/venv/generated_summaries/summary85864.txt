The FBI said that although Preciado's identifying tattoos had been surgically removed, Mexican police and FBI agents confirmed his identity through fingerprints at the time of his arrest. -- An alleged gang member who was on the FBI's Top 10 List of most wanted fugitives and sought in connection with a 2000 attack on two Los Angeles, California, officers was captured in Mexico, authorities said Monday. Emigdio Preciado Jr., who is believed to be 39, was captured Friday in the town of Santiago Escuintla in western central Mexico, north of coastal Puerto Vallarta, according to Mexican authorities. Authorities believe Preciado stepped out of a van and opened fire on two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies with an assault rifle in September 2000, according to the FBI. Preciado, a U.S. citizen, is in the custody of Mexican federal police, the FBI said.
