"Lightning is very random in terms of fatalities," National Weather Service lightning safety expert John Jensensius told CNN. Taking shelter under trees offers little safety -- nearly one-third of the people killed by lightning last year were under a tree when they were hit. " Summer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more). They are among 11 people killed already this month by lightning strikes in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.
