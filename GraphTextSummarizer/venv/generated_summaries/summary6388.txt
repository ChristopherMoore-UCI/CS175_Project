But a prosecutor added a municipal ordinance violation of annoying people on the beach during a court hearing Wednesday. -- Reality TV star Snooki must prove in court next month that she was not annoying to people when she was on a beach in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, last month. Snooki, whose real name is Nicole Polizzi, did not attend Wednesday's hearing. Police charged the 22-year-old star of MTV's "Jersey Shore" with disorderly conduct and creating a public nuisance when they arrested her on July 30. Her lawyer, Raymond Raya, appeared on her behalf to enter a "not guilty" plea on all charges, according to a Seaside Heights Municipal Court spokesman.
