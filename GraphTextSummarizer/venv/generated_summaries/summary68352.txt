The TV images also showed residents carrying off wounded people. The death toll from a powerful car bomb Wednesday morning in Buenaventura, Colombia, rose to six as the day went on, with at least 42 people wounded, authorities said. Images on CNN affiliate Caracol TV showed mangled vehicles, one with an engine next to it on the sidewalk. "It was a very powerful explosion," said Luz Morales, a reporter for Caracol TV who witnessed the blast. Buenaventura is Colombia's largest seaport, handling approximately two-thirds of its international imports and exports.
