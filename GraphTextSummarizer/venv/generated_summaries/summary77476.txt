-- Arab League members Sunday called for a joint peacekeeping mission in Syria with the United Nations and urged members to support the Syrian opposition as it faces a bloody government crackdown. One was al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri who, in a video posted online Saturday, characterized al-Assad "the butcher son of a butcher" and praising the Syrian people for waging "jihad." And it warned, "The use of violence against Syrian civilians with this extreme cruelty, including the targeting of women and children, lies under the jurisdiction of the international criminal law and requires the punishment of its perpetrators." The Arab League suspended Syria's membership in January, and the Syrian government announced that any decision made without it "is not binding." A communiquÃ© issued after Sunday's meeting called on members to "open channels of communication" with Syrian opposition groups and provide "political and financial support."
