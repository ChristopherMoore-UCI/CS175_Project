She is now director of Not in Our School, a program that works to create networks of schools that are free of bullying and offers a guide to parents on how to deal with bullying behavior. She says she hears from far too many parents who say schools are rationalizing bullying behavior, saying things like "It wasn't that big of a deal" or "You're overreacting" or "Your kid needs to learn how to deal with it." Willard, who has created her own empowerment guide for parents, says her first advice is to "document, document, document. Cohn-Vargas believes schools and school districts are "in the beginning stages of addressing bullying effectively." " Parents should chronicle what happens, what staff were around and what they did, what the impact has been in terms of emotional distress, how the alleged bullying behavior may be interfering with the child's education and after-school activities and what the school response has been, said Willard. "It just can get ugly really fast." Willard said part of the reason why she created her parent guide in the first place is because she believes parents can help schools make positive change.
