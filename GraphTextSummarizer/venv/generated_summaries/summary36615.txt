Covering Black History Ask students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history.
