During New York Fashion Week, designer John Galliano was photographed in a dress that Hikind said made Galliano look like "one of the Hasidic people I represent." Galliano was convicted of making anti-Semitic comments in a Paris cafe in 2011, a crime under French law. And Kenneth Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told CNN that Hikind "didn't take into account the history and context of what this is all about." Not all of them dress in an identical fashion, but there was no doubt in my mind when I looked at the entire picture of what Galliano was wearing that he looked like one of the Hasidic people that I represent," Hikind had told CNN. Assemblyman Dov Hikind wore an Afro wig, an orange jersey and had his face painted brown by a professional makeup artist for a weekend party celebrating the Jewish holiday at his home.
