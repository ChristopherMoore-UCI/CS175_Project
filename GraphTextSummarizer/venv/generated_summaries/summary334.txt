All I knew about the festival of San Fermín was that it involved people running with bulls, and that it took place every year from July 7 to July 14. There are so many people stretching their necks to see over the fences that line the streets of Pamplona -- not to mention sitting on the fences, too -- that it's actually hard to see people and bulls running. -- "Uno de enero, dos de febrero, tres de marzo, cuatro de abril, cinco de mayo, seis de junio, siete de julio, ¡SAN FERMÍN!" In fact, between 200 and 300 people are injured annually, according to the Council of Pamplona. Pamplona turns into one big 24-hour-a-day party for the festival of San Fermín.
