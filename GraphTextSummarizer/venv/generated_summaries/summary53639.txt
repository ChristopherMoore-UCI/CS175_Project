Speaking with Iowa reporters on Thursday, Harkin said its way "too early to speculate" about Biden's prospects, but he added "Joe Biden's always had good support among Iowa Democrats. Biden aides say he is showing up this year to honor a commitment he made to Harkin, a five-term senator who's retiring after next year. According to local reports, Harkin also said Biden "has a long history of working with Iowa Democrats, so I think that he would find - how should I phrase it? - fertile ground in Iowa if he should choose to run. He pointed to a fundraiser later this month in the nation's capital that Biden is headlining for Jim Mowrer, who's challenging conservative Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King next year, to highlight the vice president's efforts to help elect fellow Democrats in the midterms. Biden will headline the annual steak fry put on by longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
