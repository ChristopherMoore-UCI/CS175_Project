Opinion: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Indonesia has long taken a hard line on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, Widodo has made it clear he intends to be tough on those found guilty of such crimes. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are awaiting death by firing squad on Indonesia's "execution island" for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. He said his team would file a further review, asking the Constitutional Court to explain Widodo's obligations regarding granting clemency.
