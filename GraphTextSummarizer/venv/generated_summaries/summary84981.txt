Forty-four states and the federal government have laws allowing post-conviction access to biological evidence for such testing, but that number does not include Alaska, where William Osborne was sentenced 15 years ago for a vicious attack on an Anchorage woman. The high court had never before decided what role DNA can play in post-conviction appeals, despite a variety of testing that has been around for more than two decades. The Innocence Project, representing Osborne, said DNA testing has exonerated 232 wrongly convicted people in the past two decades. "He has no constitutional right to obtain post-conviction access to the state's evidence for DNA testing," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. The high court refused calls to provide an automatic constitutional right to post-conviction DNA testing for older crimes in which biological evidence is available for such testing.
