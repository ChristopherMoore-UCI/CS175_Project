Negotiators met Friday in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. North and South Korea reached agreement Friday on where to temporarily reunite families separated by the Korean War nearly 60 years ago, the Yonhap news agency said. Fewer than 21,000 family members have reunited since 2000, when North and South held their first summit, Yonhap said. They will be held from October 30 to November 5 at the two countries' joint mountain resort in the North, Mount Kumgang. Family members wept as they saw one another for the first time in decades.
