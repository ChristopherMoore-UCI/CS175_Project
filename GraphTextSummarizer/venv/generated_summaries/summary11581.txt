This dinosaur lived about 70 million years ago, say paleontologists Anthony Fiorillo and Ronald Tykoski, at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas. We know of other animals have clearly adapted to their environments by evolving in size over time, such as large Russian Arctic mammoths that evolved to be cow-sized. Scientists have announced the discovery of a new genus and species of dinosaur, based on remains found in Alaska. "It tells us that the ecosystem of ancient Arctic was a very different place, and it challenges everything we know about dinosaurs."
