But if jurors decide to spare Sowell's life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, according to Cuyahoga County court administrator Gregory Popovich. Convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell walked jurors through his life as he testified Monday in the sentencing phase of his case, apologizing to families of his victims but offering no explanation for his actions. As part of the sentencing phase, and in addition to testimony from prosecution and defense witnesses, Sowell was able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors, Visibly agitated and occasionally tearful during his remarks Monday, Sowell maintained a candid banter with members of his defense team as he recounted claims of childhood abuse -- both physical and sexual. "I'm sorry, I know it might not sound like much, but I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart," Sowell told the jury and victims' relatives gathering in a Cuyahoga County, Ohio, courtroom. He said the lack of nurturing in his home made him unable to stand physical contact or any signs of affection.
