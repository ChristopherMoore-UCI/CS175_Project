Several breeds of dogs, mainly the bull terrier, the bulldog and the American Staffordshire terrier, are commonly referred to as "pit bulls." Besides, pit bulls are not a breed of dog. "It is likely that that the vast majority of pit bull type dogs in our communities today are the result of random breeding -- two dogs being mated without  regard to the behavioral traits being passed on to their offspring. Moreauville is not the first town to pass a ordinance restricting the ownership of pit bulls, Rottweilers or other "vicious dogs." The village of Moreauville passed an ordinance in October banning pit bulls and Rottweilers as of December 1, but local officials put enforcement on hold after a national outcry.
