"I'm pleased to see Felipe Massa did a very good race weekend in Monte Carlo," said di Montezemolo. -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has refused to be drawn over speculation on the future of Felipe Massa at the legendary Formula One marque. While Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso leads the standings after six races with 73 points, his Brazilian teammate Massa, whose contract with the Italian team runs until the end of 2012, is back in 14th place having picked up just 10 points this season. "Now we are in the lead of the championship, it's only up to us to win the championship," added di Montezemolo. "In this moment my concentration is everywhere except the drivers," Di Montezemolo told CNN in answer to a question whether Ferrari were looking at new drivers.
