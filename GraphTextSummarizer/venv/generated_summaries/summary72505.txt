"When Santos was elected, we thought this was it for Venezuela, but after the election, he took some real steps to patch things up," said Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert and senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. "One thing they agreed to do was cooperate more on the FARC presence in Venezuela and it's a real debate on what's actually been done," Isacson said, referring to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a guerrilla group. Unlike Uribe, Santos has aspirations to be a regional leader, and cordial relations with Venezuela make it possible for Colombia to become less isolated from other South American countries, he said. Distrust had poisoned the relationship between the neighbors -- Uribe accused Venezuela of creating a haven for guerrillas; Chavez accused Colombia of creating a haven for the U.S. military. In November 2009, Chavez ordered his military to begin preparations for a war with Colombia, warning of a conspiracy between Colombia and the United States to attack Venezuela.
