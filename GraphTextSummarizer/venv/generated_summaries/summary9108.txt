Track the storm Forecasters say the storm was still swirling across eastern New England with gusts up to 40 mph in cities that include Providence, Rhode Island, and Boston. "This state had consequences, but nothing like our neighboring states," said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. We have our challenges here," Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee told CNN.
