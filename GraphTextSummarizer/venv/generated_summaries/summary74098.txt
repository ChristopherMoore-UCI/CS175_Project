A superb early strike from Diego Capel set Sevilla on their way and a late breakaway goal from Jesus Navas secured victory and prevented Atletico from adding to their Europa Liga triumph over Fulham last week. But their constant attacking left gaps at the back and in the final minute Sevilla broke clear, leaving Navas time and space to round De Gea before firing the ball home, sending the Sevilla fans -- who were out-numbered by the Atletico supporters -- into raptures. -- Sevilla have won the Spanish Copa del Rey for the second time in four years, and fifth time in their history, after beating Atletico Madrid 2-0 in the Nou Camp final on Wednesday. A Navas shot from the right was blocked by the Atletico defense, but the ball fell superbly to Capel on the edge of the area, who let fly with a powerful left-foot strike that gave goalkeeper David De Gea no chance. The result completes a memorable four days for Sevilla, who have added the cup to their success in snatching fourth position in La Liga on Sunday -- and a place in next season's Champions League.
