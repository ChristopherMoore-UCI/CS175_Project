By contrast, second seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia enjoyed an easy passage to the second round as she beat Stephanie Foretz Gacon of France, 6-3 6-0. Sharapova, second favorite behind Serena Williams to win the final grand slam of the season, flirted with defeat before seeing off British teenager Heather Watson, 3-6 7-5 6-3. Kvitova had been set to open on the main Arthur Ashe stadium court, but organizers switched her to the smaller Louis Armstrong court as they made changes to the schedule after Tropical Storm Irene blew through New York over the weekend. Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova crashed out and Maria Sharapova survived an almighty scare on the opening day of the U.S. Open Monday.
