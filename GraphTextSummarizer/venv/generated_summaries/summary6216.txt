Air France and British Airways introduced supersonic commercial service in 1976, but the disaster, combined with high maintenance costs and falling passenger numbers, led both airlines to retire the Concorde fleet in 2003. According to the charges, the Concorde engineers on trial could have acted much earlier to correct well-known design flaws in the plane, whose tanks had insufficient protection from debris. -- Nearly 10 years after the deadly crash of an Air France Concorde jet, a trial began Tuesday to determine who's to blame for the doomed flight. A lawyer representing Continental said Concorde's problems were apparent decades before the crash. The titanium strip that is said to have played a major role in the crash allegedly fell off a Continental DC-10, which took off just before the Concorde.
