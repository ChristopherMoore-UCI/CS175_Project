Jay Carney is stepping down as White House press secretary, President Barack Obama announced on Friday. As for Carney's successor, Obama called Earnest a "straight shooter and a great guy." Carney previously spent 21 years in journalism, including a stint as Washington bureau chief for Time magazine, and Obama noted that he went from one of those asking the questions to the person behind the podium in the White House briefing room. Obama said Carney told him of his decision in April, and Carney later said he plans to leave the position in mid-June. The President announced that deputy press secretary Josh Earnest will step into the role.
