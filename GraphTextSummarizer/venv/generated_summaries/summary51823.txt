The Food and Drug Administration must approve color additives in the United States; Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 were approved for use in foods in 1969 and 1986, respectively. Kraft has revamped its character-shaped product line for 2014, according to company spokeswoman Lynne Galia. In Europe, foods with Yellow No. 5 are required to include a warning label that says, "This product may have adverse effect on activity and attention in children." More than 348,000 people have signed Hari's petition, and she delivered the electronic signatures to Kraft headquarters in April. Two new shapes of the popular pasta -- Nickelodeon's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and "How to Train Your Dragon 2" from Dreamworks -- will also be free of food coloring, Galia said.
