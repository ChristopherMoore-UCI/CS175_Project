Michael Phelps: "I consider myself normal" Chinese swimmer Shiwen Ye won her second gold medal, taking the women's 200 individual medley in Olympic record time. " Wieber, who didn't qualify for the individual all-around competition because Olympic rules limit the entrants to two per team, said it was a team win. American Allison Schmitt won the women's 200-meter freestyle in Olympic record time. Phelps now has 15 gold, two silver and two bronze medals spanning four Olympics.
