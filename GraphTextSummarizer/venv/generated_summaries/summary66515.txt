MEMRI's website, however, has reposted Kilajyan's photographs showing him wearing Hezbollah garb and standing by a purported Hezbollah operative, MEMRI said. In the two videos, the two men appear to be addressing gang members back in the Los Angeles area while they fire their rifles. -- Two men claiming to be Los Angeles-area gang members have posted a video showing them firing rifles in Syria's civil war, apparently fighting on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Wino uploaded the video and photographs to his Facebook page, where he is identified as "Wino Ayee Peeyakan" and by his real name, Nerses Kilajyan, according to MEMRI. "This is very unique because these guys are over there, and they are with the pro-Syria forces and pro-Hezbollah forces," said Steven Stalinksy, executive director of the institute.
