While the Iraq war has seen some of the 1960s' stalwarts re-emerge, with Neil Young calling for George W Bush to be impeached and Bruce Springsteen releasing an album of thirteen covers of protest songs by Pete Seeger, none of yesterday's stars wield the same influence with today's young as they did when they were at their peek. Today Dylan really doesn't write protest songs and hardly, it would seem, does anyone else. The focus has shifted to fighting global poverty and climate change, with musical events such as Live 8 and Live Earth, and while they may not be singing songs of protest, pop stars are using their presence at these global events to push for change. Meanwhile in the UK, the punk movement took on the mantle of political protest from its folk and rock forebears, with groups such as The Clash criticizing racial disharmony in British society. Some mainstream pop stars have made stabs at political songs.
