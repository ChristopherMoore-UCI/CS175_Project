This year, the only option for poker enthusiasts was the grind of the "live" tables: plonking down a bundle of bills and dueling face-to-face. "Black Friday happened close enough to the start of the WSOP, and PokerStars players were paid out fast enough, that players could take 'one last shot' this year.
