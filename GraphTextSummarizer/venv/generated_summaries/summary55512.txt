"After three days of constant searching, covering more than 5,200 square miles, we've reached the point where reasonable expectation of survivors has passed," Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters Friday evening. But BP Vice President David Rainey said, "It certainly has the potential to be a major spill." Crews had recovered 181 barrels of an oil-and-water mixture by midday Friday, Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashley Butler said. Earlier Friday, Landry said conversations with survivors of the blast that set the oil rig Deepwater Horizon ablaze Tuesday night indicate that the missing workers "might have been in the vicinity of this explosion. Landry said crews were continuing efforts to clean up a 1- by 12-mile-long oil slick spreading through Gulf waters 40 miles offshore. The Coast Guard began notifying family of the missing that they were preparing to end the search early Friday afternoon, Landry said.
