Bawer Aksal, 49, of North Bergen was convicted of one count of sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact following a five-day trial in federal court. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over all sexual abuse cases that occur on U.S. flights, as such events are outside the jurisdiction of any state. "Mr. Aksal is very disappointed," Aksal's attorney, Robert J. Degroot. Aksal was arrested in August 2012 when he arrived aboard a flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Newark Liberty International Airport. According to the statement, Aksal was sitting in the middle seat in a row of three seats, while the victim was next to him in the window seat.
