-- U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya's rapidly unfolding political crisis Monday, in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform, a senior Obama administration official said. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation in Libya by his national security adviser, Tom Donilon, on Sunday night, the official also said. Obama officials continued to discuss with their Libyan counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters, the official added. The current unrest, spurred largely by demands for freedom and angst over high unemployment, has left at least 233 people dead in Libya, according to Human Rights Watch, citing information from hospital sources. Tripoli residents said state-run al-Shababiya TV was attacked Sunday evening by anti-government protesters.
