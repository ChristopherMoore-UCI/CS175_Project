The Iraqi government said it has not received any official request from Anbar province for U.S. military intervention and ground forces to help in the fight against ISIS, Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi's media office said Saturday. " Still, the equation could change if ISIS threatens Baghdad airport, from which U.S. Apache helicopters operate. ISIS fighters stood Saturday on the verge of taking not just a key Syrian town along the Turkish border, but also an entire province on Baghdad's doorstep -- spurring leaders of that province to urgently plead for U.S. ground troops to halt the Islamist extremist group's rapid, relentless assault. The fighter estimated ISIS forces are between 700 meters and 1 kilometer from the Mursitpinar border crossing; should they take it, the militants would control three official border crossings between Turkey and Syria and a 100-kilometer border stretch. "We cannot stop the ISIS advance from the east because they have artillery, many fighters and a good supply of ammunition," he said, adding that YPG and FSA fighters are worried because they are close to being encircled by ISIS forces.
