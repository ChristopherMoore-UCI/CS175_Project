By taking on the identity of the deceased Beth Childs, Sarah discovers that Beth was in contact with other identical women who are actually clones. As for playing multiple clones in a single scene, Maslany has acted against a double most recently. "It continues our fast pace and momentum and opens up our mysteries while giving some answers." Specifically, this means the addition of threatening characters (think religious extremists) and delving into Cosima's mysterious illness that could endanger all of the clones, while further exploring a clone we met at the end of Season 1: Rachel Duncan. Cosima isn't played as your average geek -- she's quirky, making a brilliant discovery about clone DNA one second and smoking pot the next. The witness, morally ambiguous Sarah Manning (played by Tatiana Maslany), assumes the dead woman's identity.
