At least four others were injured at the event that President Rafael Correa was expected to arrive at moments later, the state news agency ANDES said. ANDES posted a video showing a man apparently stabbing victims at random in a crowd of more than 100 people in the northern province of Esmeraldas. He sent a message of "solidarity to the families of the victims." ANDES reported that the president suspended "all political acts" and returned to the city of Esmeraldas. (But) we can not say, absolutely, that the person who is detained at this moment is the author of the unfortunate event," Serrano told reporters. Interior Minister Jose Serrano said a suspect has been detained.
