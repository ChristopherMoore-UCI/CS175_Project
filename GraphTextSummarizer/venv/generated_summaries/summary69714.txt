Brazilian lawmakers say they plan to send a commission to Russia to speak directly with former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who reportedly leaked documents cited in Brazilian media reports about the alleged espionage operations. Reports from Brazil's Globo TV over the alleged espionage have also drawn Mexico's ire, with allegations that the NSA spied on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. "What I assured President Rousseff and President Peña Nieto is...that I take these allegations very seriously," Obama told reporters. Reports from Globo TV citing Glenn Greenwald, a Brazil-based journalist who obtained documents from Snowden, claim that Rousseff and the state oil company Petrobras were among the targets of the NSA. A foreign relations committee in Brazil's Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday approved a trip for lawmakers to travel to Moscow and interview Snowden over the matter, state-run Agencia Brasil reported.
