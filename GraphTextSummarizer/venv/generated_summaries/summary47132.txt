NBA star Chris Paul has been called for many technical fouls through the years. The conversation around the technical has centered on what Paul said about rookie referee Lauren Holtkamp, one of two female officials in the NBA. Dee Kantner worked NBA games for five years and is now the WNBA supervisor of officials. The NBA said Paul was being fined for "public criticism of officiating." "Any suggestion that Chris Paul would ever conduct himself in a disrespectful manner towards women is utterly ridiculous, outrageous and patently false," she said, according to media reports.
