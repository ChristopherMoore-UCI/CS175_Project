-- A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia has indicted two people for their alleged attempts to supply Iran with U.S. materials for gas centrifuges to enrich uranium, the Justice Department said Friday. Both also face one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, two counts of smuggling, two counts of illegally exporting U.S. goods to Iran in violation of IEEPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, the Justice Department said. "This new indictment shows that we have no tolerance for those who try to traffic in commodities that can be used to support Iran's nuclear program," U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said in a statement. The indictment also accuses Khaki of seeking to obtain for customers in Iran radioactive source materials from the United States. The indictment alleges they both also caused the illegal export of lathes and nickel alloy wire to Iran, and it accuses Khaki of trying to obtain radioactive source materials.
