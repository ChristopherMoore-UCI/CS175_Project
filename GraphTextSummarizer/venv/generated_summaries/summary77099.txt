-- Hosts New Zealand edged out France 8-7 in a nailbiting finish to the Rugby World Cup final in Auckland Sunday to win the William Webb Ellis trophy for the second time. We've been the top team in the world for a long time, so it's been a long time coming," he told the official Rugby World Cup website. France, given little chance after losing by 20 points to the All Blacks in the pool phase, were pressing at the end but desperate home defense kept New Zealand ahead. Watched by a capacity 61,000 in the Eden Park Stadium, and with the hopes of a rugby-mad nation on their shoulders, the All Blacks led 5-0 at halftime thanks to a try from prop Tony Woodcock. At the final whistle the All Blacks players celebrated with a mixture of triumph and sheer relief they had finally laid to rest a 24-year litany of failure in Rugby's showpiece international competition.
