Shortly after the collision, a judge dismissed criminal charges against Delgado after concluding that he had committed no criminal infraction, the Spanish newspaper El Pais reported. Two years after the wreck, Delgado sued the family for damages to his car and for car rental costs. A traffic report said Delgado was traveling 113 km per hour (70 mph) in an area where the speed limit is 90 km (55 mph). A local prosecutor told reporters that he would take a second look at the case to see whether authorities can file fresh charges against Delgado. An independent expert hired by Trinidad's family said Delgado was going 173 km per hour (107 mph).
