The three delayed matches will resume on Tuesday, along with the two last-16 tiers that did not even start: Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer against Argentina's No. 9 Juan Martin del Potro, and unseeded American Brian Baker versus No. 27 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany. If third seed Federer gets past Youzhny, then he will next face world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who beat fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki 6-3 6-1 6-3 on Centre Court later Monday. Florian Mayer of Germany, who led 6-3 2-1 when play was halted earlier in the day on Court Three. The 25-year-old will next face the winner of the match between French 18th seed Richard Gasquet or No. 31 The cool, wet conditions didn't help Federer's back, but he said he was glad that the Centre Court roof was not closed before he completed his win over the Belgian.
