RT now has 2,500 employees, including editorial, technical and support staff, and five stations: RT International, RT America (English language), RT Arabic, RT Spanish and RT Documentary. -- Two young news anchors for Russia's RT television network -- both Americans -- have blasted Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine, and their editor-in-chief claims the announcements, and the "mainstream media's" reaction to them, are part of a media war. He also liquidated two Soviet-era media outlets, RIA Novosti news agency and Russia Today international radio. RT called Wahl's action a "self-promotional stunt" and, commenting on Martin's move, said RT staff members are free to express their views. That strategy, an RT editor told me bluntly a year ago, "was a mistake, really," because few people around the world are that interested in Russia.
