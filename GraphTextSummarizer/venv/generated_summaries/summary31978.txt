"I don't think that this is the example of a broader picture, but this could be an example of corruption ... or somebody might have been paid, somebody might have had connections," former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah told Sky News about the reports. British Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth also expressed his sadness and condolences, as did British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Initial reports show that it was an Afghan national policeman who initiated the fire on the soldiers, a ministry spokesman told CNN. -- The British Ministry of Defence Wednesday named the five troops who were killed in Afghanistan in a shooting blamed on a "rogue" Afghan policeman. The men were killed in an attack in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, the British Ministry of Defence said earlier in the day.
