Former Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, who is close to Obama administration thinking, outlined in the New York Times Monday the contours of just such a deal: "The administration needs to work on a package deal in which Hamas commits to preventing attacks from, and all smuggling into, Gaza. are pro-Hamas groups seeking to ship the material into Gaza in order to thwart future attacks on Israel. So Israel's nuclear force violates no commitments or pledges: unlike, say, the nuclear programs of Syria, Libya, Iraq and Iran, to name just four of the Middle Eastern countries that have been caught violating the NPT. A ban on exports of gasoline to Iran (Iran now imports half its gasoline) â€¢ Measures to sever Iran's central bank from the global payments system The measures adopted by the Security Council last week are not only toothless, but they even contain a loophole legalizing the sale of Russian air defenses to Iran, the better to protect nuclear facilities from action by the United States or Israel. What is news is this: The Obama administration has broken with 40 years of precedent and has affixed its signature to a document suggesting that it is Israel's weapons -- not Iran's -- that ought to be priority No. 1 in the Middle East.
