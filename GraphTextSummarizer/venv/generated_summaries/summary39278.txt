Stores are able to "pretend" to offer bargains in the immediate after-Christmas period and people feel like they "have" to spend right away with store credit from returns and that gift card dough. The show will air Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m., noon and 4 p.m. Clark Howard says there are good bargains in store for those who wait until January to shop. In a normal year when Christmas season sales are strong, retailers offer whatever they have left after the holiday, just the unloved stuff that didn't sell, at incredible markdowns. But that's not all: I love January shopping because you have the stores virtually to yourself. The bargains are mostly fake ones during those 10 days because patterns are completely disrupted by gift cards.
