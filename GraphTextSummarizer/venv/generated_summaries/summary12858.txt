Gadhafi's forces resumed shelling Misrata, just two hours east of Tripoli, where some of the most intense fighting has taken place since protests erupted in Libya last month. A witness told CNN that Gadhafi troops randomly targeted buildings and people in Misrata. By Saturday evening, advancing opposition fighters had reached the outskirts of the city of Brega, to the west of Ajdabiya, said opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani. After the fall of Ajdabiya, the fighting is sure to shift westward through cities and towns that are more loyal to Gadhafi. Coalition airstrikes targeted Gadhafi's military on the outskirts of Misrata but tanks resumed shelling Saturday, a doctor at the main hospital told CNN.
