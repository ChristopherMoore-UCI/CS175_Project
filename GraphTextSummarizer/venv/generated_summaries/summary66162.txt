"The judge who originally sentenced them had stated that the way they dressed, the way they spoke, and the fact that they drank Bailey's Irish Cream proved they were gay," their lawyer, Alice N'Kom, told global gay rights group All Out, which launched a petition demanding the men's release. Homosexuality is illegal in Cameroon, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. -- A Cameroon appeals court has acquitted two men found guilty of homosexuality because they wore women's clothes and ordered a cream-based liqueur, according to rights groups. Rights groups applauded the ruling, but called on the nation to free others imprisoned under anti-gay laws. The conviction was based on stereotypes because authorities never saw them engage in homosexual acts, according to their lawyer.
