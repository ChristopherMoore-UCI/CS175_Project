President Barack Obama wants Vladimir Putin to take steps to rebuild the trust shattered by Russia's actions in Ukraine. Putin "has a choice to make" on Ukraine, Obama said during a news conference in Warsaw, calling on the Russian President to continue to pull back troops from the border with Ukraine, persuade pro-Russian separatists to stand down and back Ukraine's recent presidential election. Obama's comment came as he visited Poland on Tuesday, the first stop on his three-country European trip which is intended, in part, to reassure allies in Eastern Europe unnerved by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Obama has billed his recent decisions against any form of military action in Syria and Ukraine as successes because they rallied multilateral responses to global challenges, without messy prolonged commitments for U.S. armed forces. Obama said he was looking forward to meeting with Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko on Wednesday, adding that his election last month "gives us some momentum to build on as we move forward."
