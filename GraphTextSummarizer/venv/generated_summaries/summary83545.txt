Late starter Born in Lohr a. Main, a town near Frankfurt, Angerer grew up playing football with the boys in the neighborhood before making her mark at junior level for the local ASV Hofstetten girls side. " Her outstanding individual performance and leadership skills didn't go unnoticed by the wider football community who voted Angerer the world women's player of the year in 2013 at FIFA's annual Ballon d'Or ceremony in January last year. In keeping a clean sheet for all six matches at the tournament in China, Angerer became the first goalkeeper, male or female, to play an entire World Cup Finals without conceding a goal. " Watching her dive around athletically on the Brisbane turf, it's easy to envisage Angerer carrying on for several more years at the top level. After playing in goal in a regional trial match, Angerer was encouraged to keep putting on the gloves.
