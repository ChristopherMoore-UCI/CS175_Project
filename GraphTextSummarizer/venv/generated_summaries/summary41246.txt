This is what it's like for gay people in so many states It was the case for Cooley. Also on Monday, House Speaker John Boehner reaffirmed his opposition to ENDA. Had he worked for a private company, he might not have been so lucky, attorneys and experts who specialize in LGBT employment law told me in March when I first reported on Cooley and his saga. Now that Cooley is openly gay at work, and has legal protection because of his court case, he's able to be himself. And that makes perfect sense for exactly one reason: To oppose this legislation, which is called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, is to support the idea that LGBT people can be fired for being themselves.
