The onstage mishap 25 years ago, in which Jackson's scalp was burned, has been blamed for leading the entertainer to prescription pain medications. Jackson, in a video statement released in 1993 to address child molestation allegations, talked about how the accident led to a painkiller addiction: "As you may already know, after my tour ended I remained outside the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on pain medication. Watch the accident unfold Â» Miko Brando, son of actor Marlon Brando and Jackson's close friend, was the first person seen reaching Jackson. This medication was initially prescribed for the excruciating pain that I was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on my scalp." The video -- posted at usmagazine.com -- also shows early takes of the commercial in which the fireworks were triggered several seconds after Jackson began dancing down the stairs, putting him well away from the blasts.
