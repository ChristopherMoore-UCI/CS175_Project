The $150,000 pearl-studded gown worn by actress Lupita Nyong'o to Sunday's Academy Awards was stolen Wednesday from her hotel room in West Hollywood, California. Nyong'o made an immediate fashion splash when she hit the Oscars red carpet in the plunging custom Calvin Klein gown encrusted with 6,000 white Akoya pearls. Detectives on Thursday were investigating the theft at the London, a luxury hotel just off Sunset Boulevard, said Lt. William Nash of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. After earning an MFA from Yale Drama School, Nyong'o won a best supporting actress Oscar last year for her first major film role in "12 Years a Slave." In a prepared statement, representatives for the London hotel said, "This is a terribly unfortunate situation and we are working with law enforcement on their investigation."
