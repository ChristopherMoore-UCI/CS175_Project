Among other things, Beeson said that there are now few major delegate prizes remaining and that most of the states yet to vote have rules requiring a proportional allocation of delegates -- a reality that makes it hard to narrow Romney's lead. "Super Tuesday dramatically reduced the likelihood that any of Gov. Romney's opponents can obtain the Republican nomination," said Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director. Romney substantially increased his delegate lead on Super Tuesday but failed by most accounts to deliver a knockout blow. Romney entered Super Tuesday off of three wins last week and a growing lead in the race for the right to face off against President Barack Obama in November. The campaign of Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney tried Wednesday to put the best possible spin on Super Tuesday's mixed verdict, releasing a memo arguing that it is now nearly impossible for his opponents to catch him in the delegate hunt.
