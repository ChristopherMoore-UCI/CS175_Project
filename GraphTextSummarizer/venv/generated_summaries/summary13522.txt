And in eastern Baghdad, a car carrying pilgrims was targeted, killing two people and wounding nine. Last Friday, bombs detonated after prayers near five Shiite mosques nearly simultaneously, killing 29 people as they were leaving the mosques. In the latest attack, a parked motorcycle bomb exploded in the marketplace of al-Khadra in a predominantly Sunni neighborhood of eastern Baghdad. Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunni Muslims. The first four attacks, which together killed 36 and wounded 124, targeted Shiites; the fifth attack was against a Sunni target.
