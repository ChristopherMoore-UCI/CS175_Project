-- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he would be willing to accept prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which U.S. President Barack Obama has said he will close, the Venezuelan government said Thursday. "We would not have any problem receiving a human being," the government release quoted Chavez as saying in an interview Wednesday with Al Jazeera TV. From Qatar, Chavez traveled to Iran, where he met with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Thursday. "I hope someday the Hebrew people will be liberated from that caste," the release quoted him as saying in the 90-minute Al Jazeera interview. President Obama has pledged to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
