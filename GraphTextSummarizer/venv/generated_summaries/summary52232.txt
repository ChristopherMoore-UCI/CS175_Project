"To suggest that spring break is a form of torture to the Castro regime, unfortunately, they are experts of torture as evidenced by the increasing brutal crackdown on peaceful democracy advocates on the island," said Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. " While a decades-long trade embargo remains in place, travel is one part of the U.S. policy toward Cuba that has changed in recent years. "The best way to foster change and progress toward democracy is to allow travel, free travel of Americans, to let them go as they wish," he said. But Cuban officials told the United Nations last year that the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power also put an end to authorities' use of torture. The relaxed travel restrictions are a good step, said Flake, who has long opposed the U.S. trade embargo and limits on travel to Cuba.
