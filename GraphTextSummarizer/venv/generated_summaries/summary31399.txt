Assad has decided to ratchet up the firepower, to crush this uprising once and for all to break their spirit, to seal these areas off so they can't get in, so that they can't get medical supplies in, so that they can't bring weapons in to support themselves. If anyone thinks that Arab League monitors backed with some semblance of United Nations training can go in and stop the kind of artillery fire and gunfire that's going on, then think again. The Serbs, after three years of standing back and shelling it, after the U.N. -- we're talking here about Arab League monitors, where the U.N. provided safety and security in Srebrenica -- the Serbs still went in and massacred 7,000 people. The young man who lost his face, he died for lack of treatment, nothing else -- for lack of treatment. Q: What about this notion that perhaps monitors on the ground or other people helping them out really plays into al-Assad's hands -- how so?
