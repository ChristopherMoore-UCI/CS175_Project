When jury selection gets underway in a Phoenix courtroom on Monday, attorneys may be hard-pressed to find jurors untainted by news of the case against Jodi Arias. "Jodi Arias is her own worst enemy. The reluctance of defense witnesses to testify may also have something to do with the aggressive style of prosecutor Juan Martinez, whose cross of defense expert Alyce LaViolette caused her such anxiety she sought medical help during the trial. While some of Arias' witnesses have abandoned the case, the defense has cobbled together a "handful of witnesses," their names kept secret and their testimony spared the pressure of live TV coverage by a court order, said the source close to the defense. " LaViolette wasn't the only defense witness raked over the coals by Martinez, who mocked the professionalism of defense psychologist Richard Samuels, suggesting his judgment was clouded by his fondness for Arias.
