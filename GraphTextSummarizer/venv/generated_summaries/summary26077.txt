The ministry could not immediately say whether babies had ever been born to British military personnel before in Afghanistan. The ministry said the baby was born Tuesday -- four days after a dramatic raid on the base by well-trained Afghan insurgents dressed in U.S. military uniforms. The mother and baby at Camp Bastion are both in stable condition in a field hospital, the ministry said. The insurgents, working in three teams of five, infiltrated the base, killed two U.S. Marines, destroyed six jets and damaged others before most of them were killed. -- A huge British military base in one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan got a surprise arrival this week as a soldier gave birth to a baby boy.
