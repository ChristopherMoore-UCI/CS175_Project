Brown was joined by Riverside District Attorney Rod Pacheco, Sheriff Stanley Sniff, Hemet Police Chief Richard Dana and Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone in the public appeal for information. Since 1997, the number of gangs in Riverside County has grown from 266 to 391, according to the task force's Web site, and total gang membership has grown to 10,620 members countywide. " Hemet is one of eight local, state and federal agencies that make up the Riverside County Gang Task Force, which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs countywide. Since the task force's inception, the number of gang members and violent crimes has decreased and the amount of arrests and warrants served has increased, Hall said. Hall said he could not say whether the Vagos were believed to be involved in the Hemet booby traps, citing an ongoing investigation.
