According to the UN's Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the Lebanese Armed Forces, the UNHCR and their partner NGOs have been able to speed up the distribution of additional emergency shelter kits - including plastic sheets, timber and tools - to thousands of refugees living in tents in the Bekaa, eastern Lebanon, so far the region most affected by the storm. Refugees brace for snow "For the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Lebanon, as well as those in neighboring countries and the displaced in Syria, a storm like this creates immense additional hardship and suffering," said Amin Awad, UNHCR's Middle East and North Africa bureau director. Indeed, one of the biggest problems faced by Syrians who've escaped the war at home and come to neighboring Lebanon is that the Lebanese government won't allow for the construction of official refugee camps. Despite continued requests from aid organizations, Lebanese political leaders are too fearful that camps for Syrians will become permanent, just as camps for Palestinian refugees, who began escaping to Lebanon in 1948, did. -- Syrian refugees in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley thought life couldn't get much harsher.
