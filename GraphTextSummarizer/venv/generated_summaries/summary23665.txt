That February morning, police have said, Valencia committed several crimes in nearby Tucson before stealing a car and driving to the Walmart in Marana. At first police in Marana, Arizona, thought the shoplifted gun Mario Valencia held as he walked through a busy office park was locked and unable to fire. Marana police on Thursday said the cable gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered. The woman told police she gave Valencia the rounds because he told her he would break the case with the bullets inside. Walmart told CNN's Miguel Marquez that  the store clerk acted appropriately, even using a code to alert security to call police.
