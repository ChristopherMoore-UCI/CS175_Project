The rating itself does not mean the movie is totally done -- films often screen well before the director is finished with technical elements like visual effects, sound design, and color timing. As a point of comparison, 2008â€²s "The Dark Knight" won its PG-13 for "intense sequences of violence and some menace"; 2005â€²s "Batman Begins" was a PG-13 due to "intense action violence, disturbing images, and some thematic elements." Beyond the obvious differences between "violence and action," "violence and some menace," and "action violence [and] disturbing images," it appears that the final film in this trilogy is branching out into some new territory for the franchise. " The MPAA handed a PG-13 rating today to "The Dark Knight Rises," for "intense sequences of violence and action, some sensuality and language."
