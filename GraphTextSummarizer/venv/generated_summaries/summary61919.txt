-- "Barefoot Bandit" Colton Harris-Moore has sold the movie rights to his life story to 20th Century Fox, a studio spokesman said Thursday. " Harris-Moore, 20, was a teenager when he took a two-year joy ride running from the cops, which ended last year with his arrest in the Bahamas. Surveillance video shows him taking off in a stolen plane from Bloomington, Indiana, heading to the Bahamas. His final journey took him across eight states, leaving behind a trail of home and business break-ins and stolen cars. Harris-Moore's plea deal is expected to result in a 10-year prison term when he is sentenced in late October.
