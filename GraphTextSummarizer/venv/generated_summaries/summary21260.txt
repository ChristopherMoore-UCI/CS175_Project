In Saturday's other Bundesliga fixtures, Borussia Dortmund's mini-revival continued with a 4-2 victory at home to Mainz. Five separate players scored as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich thrashed a woeful Hamburg 8-0 at the Allianz Arena Saturday. Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze, Arjen Robben, Robert Lewandowski and Franck Ribery did the damage with Muller, Gotze and Robben each scoring twice. However, the goal sparked scenes of anger among a group of Cologne fans dressed all in white who invaded the pitch and briefly clashed with police before order was restored. Elsewhere, an injry-time header from Borussia Moenchengladbach's Granit Xhaka sealed a 1-0 win over regional rivals Cologne.
