Remember, while a lot of '80s films were throwbacks to the 20-30 years before, the '90s and early 2000s were dotted with '70s remakes and re-imaginings, such as "Boogie Nights," "Almost Famous," "Anchorman" (By the way, Ron Burgundy's coming back -- a sequel was announced earlier this week) and TV's "That '70s Show." Shine, told CNN that '80s movies waxed nostalgic about the '50s "because the directors then grew up in the '50s and were starting to come of age and have real power in Hollywood." But what about the people who grew up in the '80s and watched movies and TV shows about the '50s and '60s, such as "Stand by Me" and "The Wonder Years"? T-shirts with '80s fonts are big, as is neon -- lipstick, shoes, handbags, Katy Perry's hair; even fluorescent household appliances are flying off store shelves. Now the people who grew up in the '80s are the Hollywood heavyweights green lighting projects.
