Single Chinese women say 'I won't' Hong Fincher argues that the term is part of a government program to upgrade population quality: "So what they want to do is promote match -making to encourage or scare educated women into having a child because that fits the government's demographic goals." "I wish that those women would speak out more on behalf of women all across China." Wu herself is an outlier among China's women. What Chinese women want Beijing is not only failing to represent the needs of women. And she is speaking out on behalf of China's women as a women's rights advocate and a founder of a school to empower rural women. According to Hong Fincher, there has been an active state media campaign to promote the term "leftover women," a derogatory term referring to spoiled food that's been used to shame China's urban educated women over the age of 27 who are still single.
