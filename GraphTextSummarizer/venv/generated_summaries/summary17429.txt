After Richard Garcia had given Germany an early scare, Joachim Low's side almost went ahead when Klose was sent racing through on goal, but he fired his shot straight at Australia goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. But Klose did not have to wait long for his 11th goal in World Cup finals. Striker, Danko Lazovic broke away from Fulham's John Pantsil on the left goal-line and managed to cut the ball back into the middle of the area which Milos Krasic then struck fiercely at goalkeeper Richard Kingson, who parried the ball to safety. The result put Joachim Low's injury-hit team top of Group D on goal difference from Ghana, who earlier beat Serbia 1-0. Ghana continued to press forward in the second half and came closest to scoring when Gyan rose high above the Serbian defense meeting a long throw from John Pantsil, only to head the ball just wide of Stojkovic's left post.
