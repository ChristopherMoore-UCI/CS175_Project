-- Veteran Los Angeles Lakers guard Derek Fisher has been praised by his teammates after helping the defending champions to a 91-84 victory over the Boston Celtics in the third game of the best-of-seven series NBA finals. " Game one: Lakers win opener Rivers' East Coast team lost the first game of the series in Los Angeles on June 3 but took home-court advantage away from the Californians, beating them in the second game on June 6. " Celtics coach Doc Rivers, whose team last won the NBA title back in 2008, also admitted that Fisher's performance played a pivotal role in the Lakers win. Play now remains in Boston for game four on Thursday, and the New England side will be hoping they can once again get the better of the Lakers, this time on their home court. But off-days from Paul Pierce and Ray Allen -- who scored an impressive 32 in game two -- allowed the Lakers to open up a lead of 12 points at halftime.
