U.S. President Barack Obama last week called the crash a "wake-up call for Europe and the world that there are consequences to an escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine," a view Clinton echoed in urging Europe to go further. Putin has argued that Ukraine bears significant responsibility, saying in a statement that if military operations had not resumed in eastern Ukraine on June 28, "this tragedy probably could have been avoided." However, Clinton joined a chorus of Western voices laying much of the blame at Moscow's door, and she lamented that the United States and Europe had been "disabused" of their earlier hopes over the so-called reset in U.S.-Russia relations that was announced during President Obama's first year in office. "I think if there were any doubt it should be gone by now, that Vladimir Putin, certainly indirectly -- through his support of the insurgents in eastern Ukraine and the supply of advanced weapons and, frankly, the presence of Russian Special Forces and intelligence agents -- bears responsibility for what happened," she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview that will air Sunday. Clinton's comments come just over a week since Flight MH17 crashed in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board. -- Russian President Vladimir Putin bears at least some responsibility for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday.
