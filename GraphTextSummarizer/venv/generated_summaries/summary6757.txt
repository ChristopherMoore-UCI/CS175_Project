Peterson Elementary School, which is on Coast Guard property in Kodiak, went into lockdown mode around 8:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) after school leaders got a call from military police, Principal Beth Cole said. Coast Guard investigators, island police, state troopers and the FBI are investigating the incident. All restrictions for the district's roughly 2,200 students were called off about 1 p.m. after state troopers called school officials and said that operations could return to normal, according to McDonald. "We're treating this as a double homicide," said FBI spokesman Eric Gonzalez, who noted that the slayings occurred inside the Coast Guard Communications Station Kodiak. -- State and federal authorities are investigating the apparent double homicide of two Coast Guard members who were shot dead on an island off Alaska's coast, prompting the lockdown of their base and at least one nearby school.
