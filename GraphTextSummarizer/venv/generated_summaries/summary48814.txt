Reveling in the expressionist, shadowy style of early sound films, Burton doesn't quite match James Whale's 1930 original "Frankenstein" in the resurrection scene, but he does have a lot of fun crafting a contemporary echo chamber in which Victor's classmates are shrunken clones of old Universal creature feature stalwarts. Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) is an introverted youngster, but also an ingenious kid who likes to make monster movies starring his best friend, Sparky. But Victor is a fine hero, immediately a more sympathetic figure than his famous namesake, and the patched-up Sparky has personality -- and limbs -- to spare. Though his recent movies retain his signature style and visual panache, they seem to lack compelling characters and stories. John August's witty screenplay is based on a short film Burton came up with nearly 30 years ago, the story of a boy who plays Frankenstein to try to revive his dead dog.
