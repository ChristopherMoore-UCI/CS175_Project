Barbour talked exclusively with CNN from a secure line at the Columbia County Prison in central Pennsylvania, where he's awaiting trial -- along with his 19-year-old wife, Miranda Barbour -- after police alleged the couple lured a man using a Craigslist ad, strangled and stabbed him 20 times, then dumped his body. According to a police affidavit in connection with LaFerrara's November 2013 death, Miranda Barbour initially denied knowing him only to later confess after being presented with evidence police had gathered. The father of Barbour's 1-year-old child is dead, and police in Sunbury, Pennsylvania -- the small city located 130 miles northwest of Philadelphia where LaFerrara's body was found in a backyard -- have said that is part of their investigation. Among claims that authorities have to corroborate is Miranda Barbour saying she was involved in Satanism. "The defendant stated that they committed the murder because they just wanted to murder someone together," police said, referring to Elytte Barbour.
