But the biggest disappointment for net neutrality supporters appears to be the fact that Google and Verizon agreed that new regulation or net neutrality laws should not apply equally to wireless networks. But FCC chairman Julius Genachowski has said previously he believes that net neutrality principles should apply to wireless networks as well as traditional wired broadband networks. That said, the nation's two biggest wireless phone companies, AT&T and Verizon, say applying the same Net neutrality rules designed for wireline networks to wireless networks is not a good idea. These companies say that wireless networks differ from wireline broadband networks because bandwidth is more limited on a wireless network. (CNET)  -- Net neutrality supporters say they're unhappy that the Verizon Communications and Google proposal for new net neutrality rules does not go far enough.
