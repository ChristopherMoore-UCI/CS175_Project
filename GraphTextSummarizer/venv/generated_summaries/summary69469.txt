Under that program, begun shortly after the 9/11 attacks, intelligence agencies could spy on communications between U.S. residents and people overseas without a warrant, if it was believed one of the parties was linked to terrorism. But critics say the law gives intelligence agencies wide latitude in carrying out surveillance, under oversight by a special FISA court whose proceedings are not public. NSA is unwavering in its respect for U.S. laws and Americans' civil liberties. "The FISA Amendments Act authorizes what the Fourth Amendment was written to prevent, which is to say, general warrants -- blank checks for surveillance." The law also established FISA as the exclusive means for authorizing electronic surveillance.
