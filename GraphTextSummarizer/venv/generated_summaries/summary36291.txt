NSA spying claims: Five things you need to know The collection of mobile phone data, or metadata -- including numbers called and date, time and length of calls -- began in 2006 and matched the NSA's collection of land line telephone data. He said European intelligence services collected phone records in war zones and other areas outside their borders and shared them with the NSA. Only 22 people at NSA are authorized to look at certain phone numbers, he said, and about 30 are authorized to look into the database that contains those numbers. Meanwhile, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, introduced legislation to limit the NSA's collection and analysis of cell phone calls and emails. He said the NSA legally collected metadata from some phone calls, and the rest of the metadata came from U.S. allies.
