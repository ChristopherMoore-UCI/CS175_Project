The ever-consistent Raikkonen has moved into second spot, one point ahead of Alonso with Hamilton in fourth, still 48 points adrift of leader Vettel. Red Bull's Vettel increases his lead in the title race to 38 points after Fernando Alonso could only claim fifth in his Ferrari. The 28-year-old Briton made full use of his pole position to finish ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for Lotus and triple world champion Sebastian Vettel. Australia's Mark Webber took fourth in the second Red Bull ahead of two-time champion Alonso, with Romain Grosjean sixth for Lotus after another incident packed drive by the Frenchman. Hamilton acknowledged how crucial the victory was at the halfway stage of a season to date largely dominated by Vettel in his Red Bull.
