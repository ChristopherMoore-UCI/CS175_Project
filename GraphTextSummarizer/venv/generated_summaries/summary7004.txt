-- President Barack Obama told Hispanic leaders and immigration reform activists Thursday that despite frustrations with the delays in fixing the country's immigration system, he's going to need them to have his back. While Obama pushed back his plans for executive action this summer and a bipartisan Senate bill on immigration reform last year failed to pick up steam in the House, Obama insisted that his administration has done a lot to benefit Latinos in his nearly six years in office. And fixing immigration reform falls under that category of "more." "Fixing our broken immigration system is one more big thing that we have to do and that we will do," Obama said. Obama rattled off a list of campaign promises that he said he has kept: from confronting "the crisis of overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools" to fixing the "broken health care system that left one out of three Hispanics uninsured." After punting on taking executive action on immigration until after the midterms, Obama pledged Thursday evening at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute that he will act on immigration before the end of the year.
