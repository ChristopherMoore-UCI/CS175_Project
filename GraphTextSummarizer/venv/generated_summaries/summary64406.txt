Princess spokeswoman Julie Benson insisted that the prospect of fog making ship channels into the Houston port unnavigable was the only factor in turning the boat around. Several passengers told KHOU that crew members wearing gloves distributed hand sanitizer throughout the ship, and passengers weren't allowed to touch items like salt shakers, tongs and forks in the ship's common areas. ImpactWeather, which bills itself as a "full-time weather department for hundreds of companies around the globe," sent Princess a report Wednesday predicting dense fog setting in late Friday afternoon, Benson said. " Are cruise ships floating petri dishes? The cruise line's official reason for ending the trip early was not the norovirus outbreak, but rather a forecast of dense fog this weekend at the Houston port that was its final call.
