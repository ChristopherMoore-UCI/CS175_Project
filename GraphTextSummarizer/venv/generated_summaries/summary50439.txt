Christmas in Ice, North Pole, Alaska Step away from patting down the lopsided snowman in your front yard and travel to the North Pole to combine two of the best parts of the holiday season: ice and Christmas lights. Alaska's Christmas in Ice park is literally a winter wonderland sure to please even the most diehard of Christmas fans. On Christmas Day, an ornate and jolly Father Christmas will pull up in front of the mansion, perched in a Victorian horse-drawn carriage. If you just can't even handle any part of the real world during Christmastime, bundle yourself away in a British mansion for a weekend of inescapable Christmas festivities. And if the usual flow of sickly sweet candy canes and maniacal Christmas songs doesn't quench your passion for the season, any of these places will fill you with Christmas until the tinsel is pouring out of your ears and you're begging for mercy.
