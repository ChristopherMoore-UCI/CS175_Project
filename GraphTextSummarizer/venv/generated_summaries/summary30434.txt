"She believed [Massaro] was the Antichrist and it was her duty to go there and injure him," police spokesman John Morrison said. It was the second run-in with Gatchell at Holy Cross Catholic Church, according to police and church workers. At the hospital, Massaro was able to pick Gatchell out of a photo lineup, police said. " Gatchell told detectives that "she remembers going over to Holy Cross (church)....and stabbing Mr. Massaro," according to the affidavit. " Massaro had just finished hearing confessions in his Florida church when he was stabbed twice in the back by a woman who later told police Massaro is the Antichrist.
