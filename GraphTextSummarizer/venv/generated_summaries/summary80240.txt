Following the earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan in March, Weber watched as the damaged Fukushima power plant quickly threw the country into nuclear panic. Canadian photographer Donald Weber has been documenting the long-term effects of the Chernobyl meltdown since 2005. On April 11, the Fukushima nuclear crisis was upgraded from a 5 to a 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, a level previously only reached at Chernobyl. What was once seen as an isolated and frankly unrepeatable incident, Chernobyl has found a twin in Fukushima.
