Meanwhile on Tuesday, top Air Force officials faced questions at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about an Air Force officer accused of sexual assault. Force support squadron addresses issues such as sexual assault coordination councils in active Air Force units, Welsh said. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri asked Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley what qualified Krusinski for the job in the sex assault prevention program. Krusinski is a personnel officer by training and has spent the last two-and-a-half years working on Air Force staff in policy, Welsh replied. He was arrested and charged with sexual battery over the weekend and had been removed from current duty, an Air Force official said Monday.
