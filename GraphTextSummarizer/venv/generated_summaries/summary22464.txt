In most states, other programs -- such as cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and state General Assistance programs -- have not responded effectively to the rising need brought on by the economy. In 2010, only 3 percent of payments went to ineligible households or to eligible households in excessive amounts. The food stamp program, now officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), provides about 46 million Americans in about 22 million low-income households with debit cards to buy food each month. SNAP reduces poverty while providing people with much-needed help to buy food. About three-fourths of SNAP recipients live in households with children; more than one-quarter live in households with seniors or people with disabilities.
