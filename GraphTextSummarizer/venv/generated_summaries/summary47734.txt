By Apple standards, Apple TV hasn't been a big seller yet. Instead, look for another update to the Apple TV system, the little box that lets users stream movies and other content from iTunes to their TVs. One report says the company will introduce a kit for third-party developers who want to build apps for the Apple TV device. And while the event is designed around presentations to help developers, its keynote address has also become an opportunity for Apple to roll out new products not just to developers, but to the world. That's the term Apple uses for its high-resolution displays on newer iPhones and iPads and suggests that Macs might be getting similar treatment.
