An annual cost of living report, released Tuesday by U.S. consulting firm Mercer, showed several Japanese cities had moved up in the rankings after the yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Researchers looked at 214 cities around the world, analyzing data from March 2011 to March 2012. The survey uses New York City, which dropped one spot to 33rd on the list, as their base city when evaluating foreign cities. Two other Japanese cities rank in the top ten: Osaka comes in third with Nagoya in 10th place. By contrast, cities in Asia and the Americas moved up as their currencies strengthened.
