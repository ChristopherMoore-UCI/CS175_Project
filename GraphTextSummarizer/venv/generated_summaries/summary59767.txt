"We make this request in order to protect the integrity of the prosecution of Mr. Stauss-Kahn, to ensure the victim's rights are not further prejudiced by deliberate acts seeking to undermine her credibility, to insulate your office from the appearance of conflict of interest, and to ensure that future victims of sex crimes, regardless of their backgrounds, are not dissuaded from coming forward," wrote Kenneth P. Thompson in a four-page letter to Vance. -- Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. will not recuse himself from prosecuting the case against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn for the attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper, his spokeswoman said Wednesday. "Such apparent leaks by members of your office is, without question, an abrogation of the duties and responsibilities of a prosecutor and will, unfortunately, have a chilling effect on other victims of sex crimes coming forward in the future for fear of reprisals from the office that is charged with protecting victims -- not discrediting them through orchestrated media campaigns," he wrote. It said, "We strongly disagree with how the office and the work of the assistant district attorneys have been characterized." Also Wednesday, attorneys for Strauss-Kahn said that the defense team had a "constructive meeting" with prosecutors, who maintained that they are not ready to drop sexual abuse and attempted rape charges even after questions were raised about the accuser's credibility. " French prosecutors have received Banon's complaint, a spokeswoman for the office said, and it is currently "under consideration" to determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges.
