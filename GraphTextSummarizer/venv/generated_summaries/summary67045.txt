Brett McGurk came under fire from Republicans and some Democrats for a variety of complaints; most notably for what senators said was poor judgment when he used an official government e-mail account to exchange flirtatious e-mails with a Wall Street Journal reporter while the two were stationed in Baghdad in 2008. Six Republican members of the committee wrote the president last week urging him to withdraw McGurk's nomination because they said he lacked the management experience to run such a large embassy and because they say he "botched" negotiations over the Status of Forces agreement for post-war Iraq. " GOP senators oppose choice of nominee for Iraq envoy It was not clear if the Foreign Relations Committee would have approved McGurk. In an e-mail to friends Friday, she said the e-mails she traded with McGurk "which were exposed just before Brett's confirmation hearing reflected flirtatious banter and nothing more." In his resignation letter, McGurk said his withdrawal "is in the best interests of the country" because "Iraq urgently needs an ambassador."
