-- Lionel Messi scored his 33rd and 34th goals of the season as Barcelona crushed Valladolid 4-0 to retain their Spanish Primera Liga title by three points from Real Madrid, who were held 1-1 at Malaga on Sunday. Speaking to reporters after the match, Barca captain Carlos Puyol said: "Real Madrid had a great season and made life tough for us but we fought hard to win this title with a huge points tally. The 22-year-old Messi put the icing on the cake of a memorable campaign for him personally, helping Barca finish the season on 99 points, the most points gained in Spanish league history. The final day results mean that Valencia (third) and Sevilla (fourth) join Barca and Real Madrid in next year's Champions League. The victory also meant Real's result became redundant, although their failure to win now increases the pressure even further on coach Manuel Pellegrini.
