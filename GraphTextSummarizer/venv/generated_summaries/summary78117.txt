It is only through engaging with other groups and establishing greater visibility for CEO Champions that we can drive real change. What is clear is that business leaders must commit to champion change -- to be transparent about their goals for change, to align their incentives systems to drive the change, and to make sure their work environments are flexible in a way that allows men and women who choose to work to be able to achieve all of their potential. Just recently, Booz & Company published new data outlining compelling evidence that women can be powerful drivers of economic growth. Over the next decade, the impact of women on the global economy -- as producers, entrepreneurs, employees and consumers -- will be at least as significant as that of China's or India's one-billion-plus populations, if not greater. Change needs to be driven from the top of organizations, and peer groups like CEO Champions are so important because they are designed to create and gradually expand a group of leaders to act as champions of women's empowerment, helping to achieve what I like to call "visibility with teeth."
