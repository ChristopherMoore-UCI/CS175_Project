Campaigning is a new thing for people in the Delta, and for that matter, everywhere in Egypt, and Moussa is determined to meet voters, go places where Mubarak never did. "They have to select and elect a president who can do the job, not a president beginner who will just get into learning or quarreling with others," Moussa says between campaign stops through Egypt's Nile Delta region. -- Amre Moussa sweeps through chaotic crowds in Egypt's Beheira province, hailed in the pandemonium by his supporters as "ar-rayis," the president. Moussa was popular in that role, channeling anger at Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in his favor with vociferous criticism of his Jewish neighbors. He served as Egypt's ambassador to the United Nations as well as to India before Mubarak named him foreign minister in 1991.
