Champions and city rivals Manchester United had gone a point clear with an earlier 2-0 win over Queens Park Rangers, but City responded with their eighth straight league victory in their home stadium. "It was massive for us, we didn't underestimate the importance of this game and we're happy with the result and to keep a clean sheet," said City captain Vincent Kompany. -- Manchester City retained their leadership of the English Premier League as a David Silva goal settled a high-class clash against Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium Sunday. Liverpool maintained their push for a Champions League spot with a 2-0 win at Aston Villa whose fans vented their frustration at manager Alex McLeish. Midfielder Michael Carrick grabbed his first goal for United in 70 games to wrap up the win in the second half.
