"When considered in the context of the offender's age and the wholesale forfeiture of all liberties, the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on a juvenile homicide offender is strikingly similar, in many respects, to the death penalty, which this court has determined is unconstitutional," the Massachusetts court wrote Citing "current scientific evidence," the judge wrote that the "discretionary imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole on juveniles ... under the age of eighteen when they commit murder in the first degree violates the prohibition against 'cruel or unusual punishment.'" -- The highest court in Massachusetts Tuesday struck down down life sentences without parole for juveniles as unconstitutional, ruling that applying such sentences against minors was "strikingly similar, in many respects, to the death penalty." At the time of high court ruling, about 2,500 prisoners were serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles. In Massachusetts, the court ruled that "the imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the commission of murder in the first degree by a juvenile under the age of eighteen is disproportionate not with respect to the offense itself, but with regard to the particular offender." Diatchenko was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
