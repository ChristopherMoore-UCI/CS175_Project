Wrona, who has worked for LOT Polish Airlines for 20 years, was at the controls of a Boeing 767 en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Warsaw on Tuesday when he realized there was a problem with the landing gear. After notifying Warsaw's airport that there might be an emergency landing, the crew had time to perform checks and various functions, Wrona said. "I've maybe flown this plane 500 times, and the landing gear deployed every time," Wrona said during a news conference in Warsaw on Wednesday. Wrona's wife and two adult children beamed when they were interviewed by Polish media on Thursday. Marzena Wrona found out about her husband's troubled flight on television while the plane was still circling Warsaw and raced to the airport to watch the emergency landing, she told the program DzieÅ„ Dobry TVN.
