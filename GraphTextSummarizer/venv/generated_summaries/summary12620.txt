And yet the man whose name it bears -- Erno Rubik -- only ever intended it to be a teaching aid for his small class of design students. ER: Usually structures are pieces that are connected in some way or another, and usually these connections are stable things. So, I was looking for a mobile structure and I found the geometry of a cube very exciting because of the high level of symmetries it has and the fact that you can do a lot of things with it. ER: It took more than a month of research, facing the problem, trying to understand it, building up theories, testing them, thinking to myself things like: "I have one side and one turn is 90 degrees and if you turn it four times I'll be back where I was," and so on. Are you still discovering things about it?
