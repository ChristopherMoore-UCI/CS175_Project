Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova out-fought Victoria Azarenka in three tough sets to win the season-ending WTA Tour Championships in Istanbul. Del Potro is up to 11th place in the points chase and also still has a chance of reaching London, with more points to be had at next week's Valencia Open. The never ending women's world tennis tour Kvitova told the official WTA Tour website: "It was unbelievable tennis. The 21-year-old Czech has been totally dominant this week, winning all three of her group games before recovering from a set down to beat U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur in the semifinals. It was Kvitova's sixth WTA Tour title of the season and in securing victory she became the first Czech to lift the coveted trophy since Jana Novotna in 1997.
