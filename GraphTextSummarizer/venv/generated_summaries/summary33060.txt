The Red Knights' announcement comes just hours after the most vocal protest yet from Manchester United supporters against the Glazer family, during Wednesday's European Champions League last 16 victory over AC Milan. -- The group poised to launch a takeover bid for English Premier League side Manchester United has signaled its intent by appointing a major international bank to act as its financial adviser. The "Red Knights" consortium, made up of wealthy businessmen, has employed Japanese investment bank Nomura to help with its $1 billion move for the club, currently owned by the American Glazer family. In a statement confirming the appointment of Nomura, the group said: "The Red Knights are pleased to confirm that Nomura, the global investment bank, has agreed to advise on a possible acquisition of Manchester United. The Knights say Nomura will now work closely with the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) and other potential investors to "coordinate and formulate the proposal to be put to the Glazer family," according to a statement.
