But it's a more level playing field in terms of actual deliveries, with Airbus delivering 331 aircraft into Asia Pacific last year, representing 51% of all new carriers entering service here. With Tuesday's announcement, competition just stepped up a notch in this critical market and both Boeing and Airbus are keen to get as much leverage as possible out of this year's Singapore Airshow. It's a low cost carrier, numbers of which are growing rapidly across Asia Pacific, fueling demand for single aisle planes. Thirty percent of orders have come from Asian airlines including Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines. The airplane maker has long dominated the wide body market, with customers including All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and some Chinese airlines.
