" "Everyone wants a safe place to fall, and you're mine," Elizabeth Shea wrote in the song for Graham, months before Graham would be accused of shoving her husband, Cody Johnson, off a cliff during an argument. But, in retrospect, even the songwriter acknowledges that the words to "You're Mine" -- written months ago for Montana bride Jordan Linn Graham -- are "a little creepy. According to investigators, Graham had been having second thoughts about the relationship and had gone for a hike at the park with Johnson to discuss her reservations. Graham even worked extra hours to afford the songwriting and recording fee for the custom song, Shea said. Shea said Graham seemed like any other bride, nervous, stressed and excited -- if a bit reserved.
