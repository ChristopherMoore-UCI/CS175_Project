Mr. Petit is a coward; he ran away when he thought his life was threatened, and ran away to leave his wife and children to madmen. With relatives packed shoulder to shoulder in the two rows closest to the jury, Dr. William Petit testified in detail about the tragic events at his Cheshire, Connecticut, home on July 23, 2007, beginning with him being awakened by being hit by a bat. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. Komisarjevsky's defense attorney, Walter Bansley, told jurors that his client never intended to kill anyone, that his sole purpose in breaking into the Petit home was to steal. The first person on the stand Monday was Mona Huggard, a registered nurse at Petit's medical practice who said Hawke-Petit had called in to say her husband was sick -- only the second time, in her recollection, that he'd ever done so.
