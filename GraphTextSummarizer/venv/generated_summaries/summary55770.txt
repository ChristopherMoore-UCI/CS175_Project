Cyclists need to understand bike laws; to not ride on the sidewalks and to obey traffic signals," wrote Amanda Goebel, who also commented that "cuter bike helmets" would encourage her to bike more often. Some said cyclists should use them in the absence of bike lanes, while others bristled at the thought of them stealing the space from pedestrians. " Cyclists also had advice for other cyclists: Earn the respect of drivers by following the rules and making your presence seen. Bicyclists are allowed to use most roads with the exception of high-speed limited access roads such as highways or interstates, which have few interchanges, Clarke said. A shorter commute and more bike lanes were by far the most common responses.
