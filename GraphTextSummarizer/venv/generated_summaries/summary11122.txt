Opponents of the law next filed a federal challenge, saying the law violated 14th Amendment constitutional protections of due process and equal protection. " Same sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the District of Columbia, while civil unions are permitted in New Jersey. -- A federal appeals court in San Francisco, California, has blocked same-sex marriages in that state from resuming immediately, until the three-judge panel hears broader questions over the constitutionality of such marriages. That came after the judge ruled a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage violated federal civil rights laws. Opponents of Proposition 8 seeking to overturn the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages will not appeal Monday's ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to spokesman Yousef Robb with the American Foundation for Equal Rights.
