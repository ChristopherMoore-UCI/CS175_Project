A widespread demand for rational use of health care can lower costs and increase the number of people getting high quality care and save lives. The most important question we can ask is, "How can we provide all Americans with good high quality care to include preventive care? America spends more per person on health care than any other country. Medical gluttony, the inappropriate use and overuse of medical treatment, is not just adding unnecessary cost to health care. The cold hard reality is America does not need to reform health care, we need to transform health care.
