There have been no claims of responsibility for the attack, and the United States is not aware of a specific threat made against the consulate, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. The FBI is investigating an arson fire at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, an incident that has China's diplomats calling on the United States Thursday to "take all measures to provide adequate protection." "We urge the U.S. side to take all necessary measures to provide adequate protection for Chinese consular personnel and properties." "We take this incident very seriously," Harf said, adding that the United States is "deeply concerned" about the reported attack. There were no injuries reported in the fire, though a small number of employees were in the building when it began, Chuan told CNN affiliate KGO.
