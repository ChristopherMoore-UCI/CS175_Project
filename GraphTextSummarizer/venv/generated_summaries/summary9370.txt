Sources close to MEND told CNN that the two men are "not known to be MEND operatives or known to be active on the Niger Delta issue." But he said it had nothing to do with Niger Delta issues or MEND. MEND, which represents militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta, is an umbrella organization of several rebel groups. A judge in Johannesburg court ruled Tuesday that Henry Okah will have his bail hearing October 14, said attorney Rudi Krause. Charged in South Africa under terrorism legislation, Okah is suspected of being a leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, known as MEND, which took responsibility for the bombings that killed 12 and injured 50 in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, on Friday.
