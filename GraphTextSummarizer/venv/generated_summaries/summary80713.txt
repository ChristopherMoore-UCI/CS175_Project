For the first time, the threat to Greece's democracy comes from the club of western democratic states, who treasure liberty, promote and assist democracy and use their normative soft power in international politics. Greek democracy is not in danger of falling into the hands of the military because the Greek military is confined to its barracks, is well under civilian rule and military rulers have no interest in political intervention -- not that there is any political power left to seize anyway. For the first time since the 1974 transition to democracy, Greek democracy has experienced an unprecedented level of development and consolidation which is inter-connected with the country's membership of the European Community. As usually happens during political instability, the extremists are the ones that gain in strength while those in the center become most vulnerable. The European Union has been the beacon of constitutional practices, human rights, party political competition, and the main source of strength of the international standing of its member states.
