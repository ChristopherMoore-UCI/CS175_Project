The home favorite and three-time time Madrid Open champion will now face fellow countryman Roberto Bautista on Saturday after the the world " Williams has won the title in Madrid for the last two years and used the event as a springboard to take the French Open crown at Roland Garros last May. She added: "It's beyond words. Fortunately, I have a bye next week so will have an extra day of rest. The remaining men's semifinal will see another Spaniard, David Ferrer, take on Japan's Kei Nishikori after Ferrer defeated Ernests Gulbis 7-6 (7/3) 6-3 and Nishikori eased past Feliciano Lopez 6-4, 6-4. "I have a left thigh injury and, unfortunately, have to withdraw from this year's Madrid Open," Williams told the WTA website.
