The cast this year includes child stars such as Danika McKellar (aka Winnie from "The Wonder Years") and Candace Cameron Bure (D.J. Tanner from "Full House"), plus "The Real Housewives of Atlanta's" NeNe Leakes, comedian-TV host Drew Carey, and champion ice dancers Charlie White and Meryl Davis. The 76-year-old "Star Wars" actor not only pulled off a cha-cha with pro partner Emma Slater to the movie's theme music, but he did it with two Stormtroopers and R2-D2. But to shake up the process, "DWTS" is now allowing viewers to vote for stars to switch pro partners midway through the season. With a combination of votes from viewers and scores from the judges, each celebrity competing vies to be the star with the highest score weekly so he or she can advance to the next round. Carey, Leakes and McKellar, whose fox trot got thunderous applause, all earned scores that landed them in the middle.
