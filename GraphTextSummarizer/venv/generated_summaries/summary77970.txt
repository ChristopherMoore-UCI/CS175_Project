-- Christian Dior has started proceedings to fire designer John Galliano after he was filmed making anti-Semitic comments in a Paris restaurant, the fashion giant said Tuesday. Before the video surfaced on Monday, Christian Dior already had suspended Galliano for allegedly making anti-Semitic remarks in another incident. Police arrested him on charges of assault and making anti-Semitic comments after a couple pressed charges. Announcing Galliano's suspension, Dior President Sidney Toledano said, "The House of Dior declares with the greatest firmness its policy of zero-tolerance regarding any anti-Semitic or racist statement or attitude." Galliano's lawyer, Stephane Zerbib, said Tuesday that Galliano formally denies that he is anti-Semitic.
