How flight attendants keep flying after air disasters World unrest raises travel tension Opinion: Despite plane crashes, it's safe to fly -- France has declared a three-day mourning period to commemorate the victims of the Air Algerie Flight 5017 crash, French President Francois Hollande declared on Saturday. There were no survivors on the flight, which took off Thursday from Burkina Faso bound for Algeria. A team from the U.N. mission to Mali, known as MINUSMA, is assisting the Malian authorities, at the request of that country's government, spokeswoman Radhia Achouri said. Following a meeting with families of the victims, Hollande said flags will fly at half-staff on government buildings from Monday through Wednesday.
