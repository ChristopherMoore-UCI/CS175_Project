Judge approves Aaron Hernandez jail move The case against Hernandez: Where's the weapon? The Patriots are locked in a salary dispute with the NFL Players Association, which is reportedly taking Hernandez' position. However, the court's written ruling also means the Furtado and Abreu families can pursue the Patriots to try to learn more about Hernandez' contract, including what he was paid and what he may be owed. In a separate civil lawsuit filed before the Boston case, the family of slaying victim Odin Lloyd also has a court attachment on Hernandez's home pending the outcome of the murder charge against Hernandez filed in June 2013. In court testimony, the Patriots have taken the position they don't owe Hernandez any more money.
