Really, though, "The Dark World" should have given Jane a better reason for hanging around than the fact that she's playing host body to a glob of extraterrestrial protoplasm. Portman plays her like a petulant schoolgirl, and that's the movie's notion of a joke: Jane just wants a boyfriend, while Thor, who loves her back, has weightier concerns. Having done his time as a magical Norse hunk-out-of-water in "Thor" (2011) and "The Avengers" (2012), our hero (Chris Hemsworth) now finds himself back on Asgard. In the film's rather desperate attempt to personalize the plot, the Aether, which requires a host organism, has leaped inside the body of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the astrophysicist who fell for Thor and has been waiting two years for him to return. And though its images can be exciting (the Oz-like palace of Asgard, airships that glide like daggers), the battles have a videogame medieval dazzle that temporarily heightens the senses, then leaves you numb.
