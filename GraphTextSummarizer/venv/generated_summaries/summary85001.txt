I consulted David Yang, a writer at Sports Illustrated China who also serves as editor of the blog site China Sports Review, and we came up with seven athletes worth watching in London. "We made a calculation that in the last five Olympics, the host country has a reduction of 32% of gold medals and medals in total won at the next Games," Xiao said. Chinese sports officials reportedly asked Li Na to play doubles as well in London, but she balked, saying she has not played doubles in years and would rather focus on her singles event. Given the time difference between London and Beijing, will Chinese sports fans stay up late at night to watch Olympic events? Chinese sports fans are expected to watch the world's best athletes compete for medals and fame at the 2012 Summer Games.
