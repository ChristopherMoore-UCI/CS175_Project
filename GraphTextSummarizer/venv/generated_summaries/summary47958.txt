Political leaders serving in times of great anxiety face a choice, she said: "The purpose of leadership is not to speak to fears, but to speak to people's hopes." Others argue that political rhetoric has its place in the national debate. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, said the recent political tone "takes me back to that period in the civil rights movement when we were called un-American." Lewis, who was beaten in Selma, Alabama, while leading a civil rights march, said rhetoric turns dangerous when groups go beyond the war analogies common in political speech and imply their foes are enemies of America. Long before the January 8 shootings in Tucson, Arizona, sparked debate about the role of heated rhetoric, Hayden and other civil rights veterans worried about the nation's recent political tone -- and what it might wreak. Thomas said he and other civil rights veterans have been discussing the dangers for some time. For some civil rights veterans, the debate over political rhetoric isn't academic -- it's personal.
