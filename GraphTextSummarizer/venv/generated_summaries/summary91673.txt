Some 36 residents of an assisted-living facility there had to be moved after heavy winds caused structural damage and forced the facility to rely on generator power, said Lt. Dan Klatt of the Racine County Sheriff's Office. The worst of the storm hit around 3 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), knocking down power lines along a country road and hitting the village of Caledonia especially hard, said Boone County, Illinois, emergency management director Sandra Rogers. -- Severe thunderstorms moved through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois Monday, bringing reports of tornado touchdowns and significant damage. The worst of the storm appeared to have passed by 8 p.m. (9 p.m. ET), though thunderstorms prompted the service to warn of a "severe weather threat" for much of central Illinois. The winds also peeled shingles from houses and downed power lines, according to Klatt, saying he expected power to start returning around 10 p.m.
