"It's been a tough night," said Morgan County executive Tim Conley. In Ohio, two people died in Bethel and another in Moscow due to the storms, Clermont County Commissioner Bob Proud said. The National Weather Service received two reports of tornadoes Saturday in Lanier County, which is about 30 miles north of the Florida border. In Lakeland, Georgia, strong winds "destroyed" several houses, felled trees, spurred major outages, and caused what appears to be minor damage to several buildings behind a hospital, Lanier County Sheriff Wesley Studstill told CNN. A tornado was believed to have struck north Georgia's Paulding County, damaging two elementary schools, a small local airfield and an undetermined number of homes, said Ashley Henson, a sheriff's spokesman.
