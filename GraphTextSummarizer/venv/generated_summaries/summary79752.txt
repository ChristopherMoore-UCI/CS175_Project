Euskaltel Euskadi was famous for only employing riders born in the Basque region of northern Spain -- as well its bright orange cycling lycra team kit. "The agreement guarantees the continuity of the Euskaltel Euskadi team in the elite of world cycling from 2014. The team confirmed to CNN that Eustkaltel, the leading telecommunications company in the Basque region, had paid more than 7m euros to keep the team going in 2013 but could not afford to continue to fund the team alone next season. But the team feared it would have to quit cycling's World Tour at the end of the 2013 season after losing sponsorship from the Basque authorities because of the economic downturn in Spain. The double Formula One world champion, who earns over $30 million a year according to Forbes, has decided to save the cash-strapped Spanish Euskaltel Euskadi cycling team.
