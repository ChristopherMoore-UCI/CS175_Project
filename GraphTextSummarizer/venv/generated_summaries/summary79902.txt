It added: 'While the NPA continued to maintain that no link was established between these animated images and child victimization, other experts suggested children are harmed by a culture that appears to accept child sexual abuse." The U.S. report noted that no national law addresses the "unfettered availability of sexual explicit cartoons, comics and video games, some of which depicted scenes of violent sexual abuse and the rape of children." However, it doesn't include possession of anime or manga depicting child abuse, no matter how sexually explicit. While no link has been made between anime, manga and child abuse, Japan is facing a  "serious" child abuse problem, according to a White Paper issued by e National Police Agency in March. The paper said the number of child abuse victims jumped 20% between 2011 and 2012, and the number of victims, arrests and cases are at their highest levels since they started compiling statistics in 1999.
