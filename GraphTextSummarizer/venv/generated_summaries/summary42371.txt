Paranormal shows like "Paranormal State" on A&E Television; "Haunting Evidence" on truTV (which, like CNN.com, is owned by Time Warner); "Dead Famous" on the Biography Channel; and "A Haunting" on the Discovery Channel are trying to mimic the success of "Ghost Hunters." Paranormal investigators aren't just chasing ghosts anymore; they're chasing television gigs, Schrader says. Wilson, the  "Ghost Hunters" co-host, says he's more leery of people than ghosts. Some of the incidents recorded by "Ghost Hunters" are mystifying: Ghostly forms appear on camera, chairs lurch across rooms by themselves and voices of people long dead are played back to their wide-eyed relatives. "Ghost Hunters" has made creepy cool, says David Schrader, a paranormal investigator and co-host of "Darkness Radio," a radio show that investigates paranormal activity. Every day is Halloween for Wilson, co-star of the Sci Fi Channel's hit show, "Ghost Hunters."
