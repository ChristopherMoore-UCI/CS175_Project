In David Boies, Sony hired one of America's most famous and successful lawyers to advance the suggestion that those who reveal Sony's stolen emails and computer data may face lawsuits for damages. This private conversation would later be blessed by the SCOTUS majority of Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer as a "matter of public concern" fully protected by the First Amendment despite the criminality and invasion of privacy clearly associated with the way the recording was obtained. Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a man who loves movies but bans virtually all contact between computer, videos and his own starving citizens, is apparently unamused at the film, which makes a joke of his imaginary assassination. In the aftermath of a clearly criminal invasion of Sony's computer system and the cybertheft of thousands upon thousands of documents, emails and related data, the press immediately started publishing the stolen goods. The law and the U.S. Supreme Court have been outrun by technology's rapid advance and we need a more carefully calculated balance between privacy, property rights and the First Amendment.
