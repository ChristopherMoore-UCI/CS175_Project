-- Somali government forces and African Union troops pushed al Qaeda-linked militants out of its last outpost in the western part of Mogadishu, opening the main artery to the famed Bakaara Market, the African Union Mission to Somalia said Friday. The capture Thursday of Damanyo, a militant outpost in western Mogadishu, opens one of the city's main arteries to the famed Bakaara Market, the African Union said in statement released Friday. African Union peacekeeping forces, who have been operating under a U.N. mandate, say the military action is designed to inhibit al-Shabaab's ability to hide behind civilians and limit civilian casualties, the African Union has said. Raging street battles in the capital since February have pitted government troops, backed by the African Union, against the jihadist movement al-Shabaab, which controls much of southern Somalia. The peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu, including the port, airport and presidential palace.
