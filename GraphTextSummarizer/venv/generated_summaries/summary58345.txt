Can Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov deliver on the offer to have Syria hand its chemical arsenal over to international control, or is it just an effort to buy time for the Assad regime? The president will still make the case that Congress must authorize military force in Syria, a senior administration official told CNN. Although no longer a member of the administration, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will speak on Syria at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening, just ahead of the president's national address. What the French want to see is for Syria to be transparent about its chemical weapons program and to put it under international control. Three-quarters say the United States doesn't need to be the "world policeman." Also hurting the president's cause, more than seven in 10 say a strike would not achieve significant goals for the United States, and a similar amount say it's not in the national interest for the country to get involved in Syria's civil war, a separate CNN/ORC International poll shows.
