-- Samsung Electronics said Friday it is expecting weaker third quarter sales as demand for flat screen televisions and computer chips falls. As for smart phones, they are becoming comparable with Apple, they haven't surpassed Apple yet but they are catching up very fast," Lee Sun Tae of Meritz Securities in Seoul said. Analysts say Samsung's handset sales are helping weaknesses in other businesses. Profits are expected to rise though from the previous quarter by 12%. Lee estimates a small increase in the dollar's strength of less than one cent could result in an extra $250,000 profit for Samsung.
