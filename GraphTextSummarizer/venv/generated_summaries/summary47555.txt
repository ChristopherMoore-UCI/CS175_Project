"As a world leader, China must now show its wisdom and compassion, and remind the world of its rich cultural history, by permanently freeing Chen Guangcheng and his family and never allowing thuggery and corruption to tarnish China's reputation again." Chen, 40, is a self-taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices, such as alleged forced abortions, by China's family-planning officials. A U.S. Embassy spokesman and Chinese officials declined to answer questions about Chen. Noting she has raised concerns about Chen's case before, Pillay urged Chinese authorities "to investigate the treatment of both him and his family, to ensure their physical integrity and to provide redress for any wrongdoing by local officials. Fellow activist Hu said Chen scaled a high wall at night and hurt his leg after jumping off. Quoting an anonymous source, Texas-based nonprofit group ChinaAid said Chen is "under U.S. protection and high-level talks are currently under way between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding his status." "Because of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama administration must stand firmly with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the rule of law," said Bob Fu, the head of ChinaAid.
