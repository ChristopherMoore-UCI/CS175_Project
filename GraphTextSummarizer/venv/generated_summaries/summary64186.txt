According to the biography posted on the CDC Web site, Besser's last position at the CDC was as the director of the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, where he was responsible for public health emergency preparedness and emergency response activities. Gimson notified CDC employees that HHS acting secretary Charles E. Johnson had announced the appointment. He replaces William Gimson, who took over as interim CDC director at noon on January 20. Past HHS secretary Michael Leavitt said that the interim directors would take over until the next HHS nominee -- former Sen. Tom Daschle -- is confirmed and makes the permanent appointments. According to CDC sources, Besser was seeing patients when he learned of his new position.
