On "Good Morning America" on Tuesday, the ABC dancing competition revealed that Olympic champs Meryl Davis and Charlie White, who just won a historic gold medal at the Winter Olympics in figure skating ice dance, are joining "DWTS'" 18th season. In this season's "DWTS," she's going to perform with pro partner Derek Hough. Former "The Wonder Years" actress Danica McKellar is also going to perform each week, with help from pro partner Valentin Chmerkovskiy. The 64-year-old became the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a protective cage last fall, and will now bring that persistence to the ballroom with pro partner Henry Byalikov. Drew Carey: Stand-up comic and "The Price Is Right" host Drew Carey is more accustomed to making audiences laugh at his wit than dazzling them with his dance moves, but he'll show what he's got alongside pro partner Cheryl Burke this season.
