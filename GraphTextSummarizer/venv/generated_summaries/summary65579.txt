Kerry will travel to those cities on New Year's Day to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, respectively, "to discuss ongoing final status negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, among other issues," the State Department said in a statement Saturday. -- Jerusalem, and Ramallah, West Bank: two crucial stops for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in his ongoing attempt to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country's uranium enrichment program, which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes. Israelis and Palestinians are four months into a nine-month deadline given to them by Kerry to reach a peace deal, with little visible progress. Palestinians have rejected, out of hand, having Israeli soldiers within the borders of their own states.
