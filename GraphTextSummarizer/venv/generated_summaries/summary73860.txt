iPhone launch days tend to draw lines of enthusiastic Apple fans to Apple stores around the country, many camping out overnight. The rush to be the first kid on the block with the latest iPhone is on. The 16GB iPhone 5's shipping date is listed as "up to two weeks." Hands on with the new iPhone 5 Best Buy isn't taking orders for the iPhone 5 online before its Sept 21 launch, but customers can go into a Best Buy location to pre-pay for the device and return to pick it up on launch day. Target typically carries the iPhone, but at this time the site makes no mention of the iPhone 5.
