Born into privilege, Xi nevertheless spent several years in one of the poorer villages in China when his father, a top government official, was purged and then jailed during the Cultural Revolution. Since no one knows what Xi really has in mind for China and its future, a productive meeting is one in which the two can start building trust and a good working relationship. Xi will be facing a fast-changing world and a faster-changing China. The world will be watching Xi closely to see how he will govern China and navigate U.S.-China relations. -- Xi Jinping, the vice president of the People's Republic of China and presumptive next president, will visit Washington this week.
