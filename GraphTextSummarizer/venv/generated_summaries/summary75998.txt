The first of the two services was held Tuesday in St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, California, near where Ford set up a renowned alcohol and drug abuse treatment center, the Betty Ford Center, in Rancho Mirage, California. The Ford Presidential Library and Museum is in Grand Rapids, where Ford was raised. The casket holding Betty Ford's remains arrived late Wednesday afternoon in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the final of two services will be held for the former first lady. The plane carrying her casket landed from California at an airport named after her husband, Gerald R. Ford International. A welcome ceremony was scheduled for shortly after the casket's arrival, to be followed by a private prayer service at the Ford museum.
