Laksi, a district of mixed pro- and anti-government sentiment, witnessed violent protests on Saturday, when gunfire erupted during anti-government protests, witnesses said. Lead-up to gunfire Before the gunfire broke out, protesters attempted to foil elections by interfering with preparations, CNN's Saima Mohsin reported from Bangkok. Anti-government protesters in Thailand can consider this round of resistance a success, after getting Sunday's national elections delayed in the Bangkok district of Laksi. Anti-government demonstrators say they will keep up protests and attempt to shut down Thailand's capital city during elections. Political battles The political elbowing goes beyond Bangkok's streets and has spread dirty politics into many provinces, where some constituents have no candidates to represent them in the election, Mohsin reported.
