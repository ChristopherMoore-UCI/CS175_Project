Cao's "yes" vote ended up being unnecessary for House Democrats, but it gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi license to tout bipartisan support for the controversial measure. The House voted 220-215 late Saturday, with 39 Democrats opposed and one Republican in favor, to approve what would be the biggest expansion of health care coverage since Medicare was created more than 40 years ago. "Well, it was about what I thought it would be," said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio as he quickly exited. The president called the support by many House members "courageous" in the face of "the heated and often misleading rhetoric around this legislation." Van Hollen chided Republicans for failing to confront rising health care costs harming the U.S. economy during the years they controlled the White House and Congress.
