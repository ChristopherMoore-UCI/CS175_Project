All those passengers stranded overnight will get annual passes to the Silver Dollar City theme park in Branson that, like the boat, is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment, along with a full refund for the cruise, said Rau. Marine experts onboard the ship Sunday afternoon were focusing on the boat's propulsion system, including its paddle wheel, as a possible reason the ship ran aground the previous day in a remote area of Missouri's Table Rock Lake, Rau said. The boat did have heat and electrical power, Rau said, and passengers were provided food and beverages. By noon Sunday, all 567 passengers and 76 crew members had been escorted off the Showboat Branson Belle, according to Lisa Rau, a spokeswoman for Herschend Family Entertainment. -- After a rough night spent wrapped in tablecloths and dozing on floors, stranded showboat passengers walked to safety Sunday from their disabled vessel via a 30-foot plank, a spokeswoman for the company that owns the boat said.
