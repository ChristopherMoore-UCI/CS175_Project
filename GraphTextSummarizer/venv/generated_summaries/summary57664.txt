After an "extensive" look at its records, Cleveland police said there were no calls to the Castro house "for women held or women banging on windows." And another neighbor, Israel Lugo -- Annita Lugo's brother -- says he called police in 2011 when he heard yelling in the Castro home. News reports say another neighbor called police after seeing a woman through an attic window of the home, which Castro never allowed neighbors to enter. Cleveland police deny that, issuing a statement Wednesday saying that a "thorough review of police communications records" show no such calls ever took place. Neighbors say they had called police about suspicious activity at the home in the past.
