One website called Waheaven, which says it has over three million users, lets users create online memorials by uploading images of their deceased ancestors, after which they can pay traditional tribute by lighting virtual incense or laying virtual flowers. In China, where superstitions surrounding death are rife, new websites let Internet users leave digital imprints even after they pass away. One service is called "Life Black Box" and the idea is simple: You sign up and upload whatever you want -- be it secret photos, random thoughts, sensitive files, or final goodbyes. Since 2011, Lin has run a popular microblog account where he reposts final messages from ordinary people who have passed away. But the most melancholy may be the "Last Post" project, by Chinese social media user Lin Dongping.
