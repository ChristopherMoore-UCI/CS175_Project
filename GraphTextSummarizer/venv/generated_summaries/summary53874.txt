Liberia is one of three nations, including Guinea and Sierra Leone, at the center of  the deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said Monday that the situation over the massive Ebola outbreak in her country "remains grave." "Our health delivery system is under stress. The West African nation of Senegal confirmed its first Ebola case last week, one week after closing its border with Guinea. " Johnson Sirleaf said the solution is for the global community to work in partnership with the affected nations to help them fight Ebola. Johnson Sirleaf also extended the stay-at-home order for all nonessential government employees for another month on Monday, underscoring the still dangerous health conditions the Ebola virus is causing in the country.
