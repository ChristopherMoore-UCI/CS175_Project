The book explores the literary and musical traditions of the song, but also says that a national anthem for African-Americans can be construed as racially separatist and divisive. "To sing the 'black national anthem' suggests that black people are separatist and want to have their own nation," Askew said. I think claiming an anthem for ourselves as black people is doing just that." What troubles Askew more is that the song became an identity marker for African-Americans. "Who has the right to decide for all black people what racial symbol they should have?" "His presumption is that this song is sung instead of our national anthem -- that we are less American and we are not as committed to America because we take pride in the Negro national anthem," Shelton said. "We need to consider eliminating this alternative label of 'black national anthem' in order to promote unity," Askew said. A fellow classmate suggested Askew explore Yale's collection on James Weldon Johnson, an early civil rights activist who wrote the song decades earlier.
