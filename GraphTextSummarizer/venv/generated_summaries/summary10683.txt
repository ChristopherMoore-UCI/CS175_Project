A preliminary test showed that the woman does not have Ebola, New Jersey officials said Saturday. The governors of New York and New Jersey instituted just such a policy Friday, announcing that airport screening will be stepped up in their states and that any arriving passengers who'd recently been in the West African nations hit hardest by Ebola could be hospitalized or quarantined for up to 21 days -- sick or not. That policy shift was spurred by the hospitalization of Dr. Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who'd treated Ebola patients in Guinea and arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on October 17; he eventually was diagnosed with Ebola. Since then, a female health care worker who had recently been in West Africa developed a fever, hours after touching down at northern New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport with no apparent symptons, New Jersey Health Department spokesman Donna Leusner said. He has spent four weeks working with Ebola patients at a hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and is scheduled to return to New Orleans on Saturday.
