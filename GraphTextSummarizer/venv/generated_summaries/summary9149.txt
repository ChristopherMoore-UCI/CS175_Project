The New York City Police Department and other U.S. law enforcement agencies responded to a threat from ISIS after someone released again a September message that tells followers to  "rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians" -- specifically naming the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. Four of the victims were killed Friday at the kosher market, the latest in a string of anti-Semitic attacks that have led many Jewish families to leave the country. Said and Cherif Kouachi, blamed for Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine, are dead. Early Sunday, a firebomb was hurled at a German newspaper that reprinted Charlie Hebdo cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, though authorities haven't said whether the arson attack was connected to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. "She was astonished when she learned her husband was involved in the Charlie Hebdo attack."
