A grand jury in Franklin County, Ohio, indicted Cordle on Monday on charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. He told CNN that Cordle was familiar with his site, on which people make public pledges to help them follow through with good deeds, and reached out to him with his story. "Despite any speculation of his intentions, the video was meant to raise awareness related to the serious issues surrounding drinking and driving," he said in a statement sent to CNN. Sheen calls Cordle's confession and plea for others to avoid drunken driving, "honorable." "That he sees the video as a tactical move in a legal chess game is evident," Ellingwood writes, noting the way Cordle cites depression as a reason for his drinking.
