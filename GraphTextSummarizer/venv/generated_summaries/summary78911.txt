Baby Fatime is one of at least two dozen children holed up with mothers, grandmothers and other relatives in this makeshift shelter in the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr. Government forces have been shelling Homs since early February. "The children are always crying; the bombs are coming down like this," she laments, waving her arms for emphasis. Both men were detained and returned as mutilated corpses. Her mother gave birth to her in a makeshift shelter in the besieged Syrian city of Homs, the heart of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
