He's also been chairing The Elders, a group of statesmen and women including Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan and Mary Robinson. -- South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu announced Thursday he will retire from public life in October, when he turns 79 years old. "The time has now come to slow down, to sip Rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons, to watch cricket, to travel to visit my children and grandchildren, rather than to conferences and conventions and university campuses," he said. Since then, Tutu has continued to travel the world, lecturing and advocating for various causes. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, formally retired as Archbishop of Cape Town in 1996.
