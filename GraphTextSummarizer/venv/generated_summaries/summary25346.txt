"I invite Colombians to maintain confidence in the process, in our negotiating team and that we will continue to do exactly what we said," President Juan Manuel Santos said. -- The government of Colombia has reached an agreement with FARC rebels in the fight against drug trafficking and cultivation of illicit crops, both sides announced Friday. The president, who is running for re-election, also announced Friday that FARC and the National Liberation Army (ELN) have agreed on a cease-fire during the May 25 presidential elections. The government also promised to step up its efforts to combat corruption and money laundering, as well as address public health issues related to drug consumption. As part of the deal, the government will launch a national program of illegal crop eradication and alternative development.
