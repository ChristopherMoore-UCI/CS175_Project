The wide distribution of the gang report to law enforcement agencies around the United States "has caused real harm to ordinary Juggalos from coast to coast." "Many people view Juggalos as nonconformists because of their musical tastes, their practice of painting their faces to look like clowns, and the distinctive Juggalo symbols -- including the 'hatchetman' logo -- that they often display on their clothing, jewelry, body art and bumper stickers," the suit said. FBI analysts, using law enforcement and media reports of crimes committed by people wearing "Juggalo" tattoos and clothing, concluded in the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment that they are a "loosely organized hybrid gang. "We're aware of the lawsuit," said Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle. " "Juggalos are a 'family' of people who love and help one another, enjoy one another's company, and bond over the music and a philosophy of life," said the lawsuit filed in Detroit Wednesday.
