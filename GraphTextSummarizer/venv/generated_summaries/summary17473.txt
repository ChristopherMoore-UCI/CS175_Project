-- For the second time this summer, a New York City police officer has been stripped of his badge and gun after video surfaced showing what community leaders call a heavy-handed police response. The scene grows tense, with witnesses taking video of the pushing and shoving and civilians tussling with officers. The latest incident to highlight lingering tension with the nation's largest police force occurred Sunday when a handful of officers attempted to disperse a group of vendors in order to reopen traffic after the conclusion of a Brooklyn street fair. In a video taken by an onlooker and posted to Facebook, words are exchanged and officers attempt to arrest a man. Later, once officers have the young man on the ground, one officer punches him while another kicks him in the back.
