" Rolling Stone: See vintage shots of Stephen Malkmus and more nineties rockers Pavement hopped from songs everybody likes ("Gold Soundz," "Summer Babe") to songs hardly anybody ever notices ("No More Absolutes," "Starlings in the Slipstream"), dipping into psychedelic jams like "Grounded" between sing-along raves like "Silence Kid" and "Unfair." Malkmus and Scott "Spiral Stairs" Kannberg traded guitar leads in the countryfied ballad "Father to a Sister of Thought," giving it a whole new flavor. (RollingStone.com) -- "Sing it if you know it," Pavement's Stephen Malkmus told the crowd Sunday night in Brooklyn, on the Williamsburg Waterfront, as the band prepared to play "Stop Breathing." Sunday night they blasted through "Silence Kid," with a melody swiped from Buddy Holly ("Everyday," to be exact), plus a throwaway guitar hook swiped from Jimi Hendrix ("Bold As Love," to be exact), and made it crest and surge for three wildly emotional minutes of punk rock. So "Loretta's Scars" was the best Dinosaur Jr. song ever, just as "Zurich Is Stained" was the best Nikki Sudden song ever -- yet these were just another couple of great Pavement songs.
