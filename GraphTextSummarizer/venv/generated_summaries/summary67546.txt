The return was harshly criticized by some in Israel, who compared it to last year's exchange of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups on the Gaza border captured Shalit in 2006. " Mohammad Shtayyeh, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's central committee and a senior Palestinian negotiator, noted in comments to CNN that although 91 sets of remains were received, "we did not receive all of them, and it is with great bitterness that we received their remains."

He said many Palestinians were hoping prisoners still alive in Israeli jails would also be released.
