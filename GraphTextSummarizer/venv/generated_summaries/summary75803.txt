Durkee, who appears to have signature authority over more than 400 bank accounts, including those for political campaigns, allegedly moved "substantial" sums of money from client campaign committees to her firm's accounts or other campaign accounts, Coleman said in the affidavit. In the wake of the charges, U.S. Rep. Susan Davis, D-California, has accused Durkee of stealing "upwards of $250,000 in campaign funds," according to a letter that Davis sent to her supporters on Saturday. Durkee is accused of filing false disclosure reports to hide the misappropriations, according to an affidavit by FBI Agent Reginald Coleman. "As this scandal emerges, she may well become known as the Bernie Madoff of campaign finance treasurers," Davis said about Durkee in the letter to supporters. In an interview with the FBI on September 1, "Ms. Durkee admitted that she had been misappropriating her clients' money for years, and that forms she filed with the state were false," Coleman wrote.
