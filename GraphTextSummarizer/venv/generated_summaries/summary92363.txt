-- Hundreds of hawkers and beggars, quite often seen on Dhaka's major roads and at traffic stops, will be driven out next month ahead of the Cricket World Cup scheduled to begin in mid February, officials said Wednesday. Three South Asian nations ннн-- Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka -- are jointly hosting the grand gala ICC World Cup 2011 and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka on February 17. I don't know what I'll do for the living of my family in February and March," Mohammad Suman, who sells pirated copies of foreign books at one of the busiest traffic signals near the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka's Karwan Bazar, told CNN on Wednesday. Officials said the beggars would be taken to government asylums for the time being from the first week of February. Sahara Khatun, junior minister for home affairs, and other top government officials Tuesday had a meeting to ensure fail safe security for the more than a month-long cricket event.
