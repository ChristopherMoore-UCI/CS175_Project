The IBF, IBO and WBO heavyweight champion is set to face WBA champ Haye in Hamburg, Germany, on July 2 in a bid to unify four of the division's five belts. -- Boxing world champion Wladimir Klitschko has told CNN that David Haye will become the 50th knockout victim of his career when the two face-off in July. When Wladimir was asked what would happen if Haye was to win their July bout, he replied: "(Defeat) is not an option -- myself and Vitali are going to unify all the belts. He won a lot of fights by knockout, so I will not underestimate his speed or his punching power. Londoner Haye can also point to an impressive record in the sport, having won 25 of his 26 fights, 23 coming via knockout.
