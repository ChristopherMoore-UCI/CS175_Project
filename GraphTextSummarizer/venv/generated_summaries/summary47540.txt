Although the state already is considering options for new work at the New Orleans shipyard, Jindal said he is asking Secretary of Navy Ray Mabus and the federal government to prevent jobs at Avondale from being lost. -- Northrop Grumman Corp. plans to close a New Orleans, Louisiana, shipbuilding operation in 2013 and consolidate its Gulf operations, affecting thousands of jobs, the company announced Tuesday. "The roughly 5,000 direct jobs at the Avondale site support about 6,500 additional indirect jobs in the New Orleans region, meaning a total of roughly 11,500 jobs are at risk due to this change in the Navy's procurement program. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who has been meeting with company officials, said he will do everything possible to keep the Avondale yard open. "The consolidation will reduce future costs, increase efficiency, and address shipbuilding overcapacity," Wes Bush, chief executive officer and president, said in a statement.
