German police have released a photograph of the 17-year-old known only as "Ray" who turned up at Berlin City Hall last year after claiming to have been living in the woods for five years. After his father also died last August, the boy roamed north for five days until he arrived to Berlin City Hall and asked for help last September 5, authorities said. "They were hiking with the help of maps and a compass only and stayed in tents or caves overnight," Berlin authorities said in a statement released Tuesday. The boy named Ray told authorities upon his discovery last September that he had been living in the woods with his father, Ryan, but decided to come out of the wilderness after his father had died, investigators said. In releasing a photo of the boy, taken last September, authorities also provided a physical description of him: 16 to 20 years old; about 5-foot-11 or 180 centimeters; dark-blonde medium length hair; blue eyes; athletic physique; teeth, fingernails and hands all conveying a neat impression; three scars on his forehead; three small scars on his chin; one scar of 1 centimeter in length on his right arm; and a complete set of teeth with no dental work obvious.
