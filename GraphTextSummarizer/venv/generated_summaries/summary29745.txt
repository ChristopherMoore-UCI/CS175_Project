" Hirsch, whose Sweet Home New Orleans focuses on helping musicians and members of New Orleans' famous Mardi Gras krewes, said there's value in celebrity support, not just in their ability to raise or donate funds, but to spread the word and keep the story of New Orleans alive. U2 guitarist The Edge helped form Music Rising, a group initially dedicated to providing instruments for New Orleans musicians who had lost their own during the floods. "Anybody, whether they're a performer or not, who has studied or been touched by American music has been touched by New Orleans," said Jordan Hirsch, director of the nonprofit aid group Sweet Home New Orleans. "The New Orleans tragedy was a twofold tragedy," Edge said in 2006 during the city's JazzFest. Before the images of a crowded and toxic Superdome and desperate survivors waving down help from rooftops, entertainers the world over had a special place in their hearts for New Orleans -- the sultry Louisiana city that served as muse to musicians, playwrights and novelists for more than a century before Hurricane Katrina roared into the city four years ago this week.
