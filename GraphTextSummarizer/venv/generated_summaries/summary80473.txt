If there is no Democratic challenger, Clinton might not do enough to prepare for the onslaught she would face from a GOP, a party armed with tea party activists and a huge network of campaign donors ready for battle. In the 2008 primaries, the Clinton campaign faltered in dealing with the political ground war, the job of mobilizing and organizing local activists and deploying social media to bring out supporters. Warren's candidacy would force Clinton to put herself on the record over how she would help the middle class -- committing to the kinds of policies that will be desirable to many voters, including some independents and even moderate Republicans who are struggling in this economy and who are uncomfortable with the solutions offered by a GOP that continues to lean hard to the right. If Warren forces Clinton to confront these issues and to articulate a stronger response to the economic issues of our days -- creating countervailing pressure to the political experts who will implore her to stay away from these questions -- it would only make the former first lady and secretary of state a stronger candidate. The biggest challenge that Clinton faces right now, assuming that she decides to run, is that she might be unable to generate enough excitement among Democrats that would mobilize voters and excite the media in the general election.
