A 13-year-old boy was one of the many rescued, Australia Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. The others that were rescued were all adults, Clare said. And Clare said four more ships would be in the area Friday to help the ships and aircraft that are already searching. "Over the course of 36 hours from the time the boat capsized, my advice is that people can survive out there if they've got either life jackets or they are able to hold onto debris, as a lot of people did through the course of yesterday," Clare said. Authorities believe all the passengers in the ship were male, according to Clare. Christmas Island has been the scene of another recent boat capsizing.
