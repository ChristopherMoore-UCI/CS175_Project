"This particular case, it does have some of the earmarks of a targeted attack," Chief Randy Wright of Portland told local station KZTV. Wright told CNN on Monday night the two friends were "found by two visitors to the park Saturday morning. "We are a very close-knit community and when news of the shooting spread through our town, everyone wanted to help," said Mary Lankford, who taught Chapa at Sinton High School. "We have not been able to take a formal statement from Chapa as she is receiving medical care," Wright said. Authorities believe they were shot sometime late Friday night or early Saturday morning.
