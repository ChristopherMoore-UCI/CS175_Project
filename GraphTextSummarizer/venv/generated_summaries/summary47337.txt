The motorcade, carrying Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region -- site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August -- when shots were fired Sunday, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. "It is not the first time that such things have happened: First they mastermind everything themselves and then accuse the Russian or the Ossetian side." Eduard Kokoity, president of the breakaway region of South Ossetia, added: "Today's event was a deliberate provocative act of the Georgian and Polish presidents targeted at regional destabilization." Tensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, said there were "unpredictable people" in the area.
