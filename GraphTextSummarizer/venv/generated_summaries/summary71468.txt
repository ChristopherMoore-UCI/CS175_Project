The last inquest was in 1995 and since then there have been a number of significant dingo attacks," Tipple said. Chamberlain served four years of her sentence before the Northern Territory government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence; a baby's jacket, believed to be Azaria's, found half-buried near a dingo lair at Uluru. "We want a finding that Azaria was taken by a dingo," said Stuart Tipple, the lawyer representing Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton and her former husband Michael. Where once many people -- including the jury that convicted Lindy and Michael Chamberlain -- believed that it was unlikely that a dingo would kill a baby, evidence in recent years shows that it is indeed possible. It adds: "These dingoes display aggressive or dangerous behaviour such as nipping and biting, and in some cases this escalates very quickly to attacks and serious mauling." Tipple says that, if nothing else, the couple hope a change in the official cause of Azaria's death makes "public authorities more aware of their responsibilties.
