On a freezing cold Sunday in the north of England, around 14 kilometers from Manchester, Oldham produced one of the greatest results in its recent history to defeat the seven time FA Cup winners. But after completing his studies, he rejoined Oldham and etched his name into FA Cup folklore by scoring twice before dislocating his shoulder in an enthralling contest. Leeds, which was relegated from the top-flight in 2004, now faces an away game at Premier League champion Manchester City. Facing the likes of $35 million man Luis Suarez and a whole host of international players, Oldham turned to a man who up until 18 months ago had given up on playing professional football to try his luck at university. It was a return to the glory days for the club, which reached the 1994 FA Cup semifinals where it was eventually beaten by Manchester United in a replay.
