That was the start of social business -- a new type of business that focuses on solving social problems, rather than just making money, which I later elaborated in my book, "Creating a World without Poverty and Building Social Business." But my ambition remains the same: Can I empower the poor to change their circumstances and bring the power of business to solve problems by reorienting people from profit-seeking to enjoying the pleasure of being a creator of a better world? We select the most promising business plans created by local people that are designed to solve local problems in a sustainable way. The economic theories that I had learned stopped ringing true for me when I saw the misery of people all around me. The essence of social business is to create a business that is focused on solving human problems rather than making a personal profit.
