-- Film composer John Barry has died after an award-winning career spent writing the score for many movies, including 11 James Bond films, a friend said. He also wrote the theme songs to 11 James Bond movies, according to United Agents, the agency that represented him. "There was something elegantly effortless about the way John created seemingly simple tunes that were in fact very complex," said David Arnold, a friend and fellow Bond composer. Barry won Academy Awards for his work on "Dances with Wolves" in 1990 and "Out of Africa" in 1985. He also won for "The Lion in Winter" in 1968 and "Born Free" in 1966, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
