Aside from taking his belt it was good to just show him the way to behave properly -- it was kinda reality rehab for David Haye to become a better person," Wladimir told Don Riddell. "I'm very happy to achieve my goal as a therapist, as Doctor Klitschko for David Haye, and everything that is happening to him is good experience that he cannot buy in a shop," added Wladimir. Wladimir Klitschko has told CNN Sport that he believes he has put a touch of reality into David Haye's life, after winning their heavyweight unification fight in Hamburg earlier this month. " Wladimir also revealed that the victory over Haye was the highlight of his career so far, made even more special by the atmosphere generated by the 45,000 supporters in the Volksparkstadion. Both brothers are still angry with the way Haye bad-mouthed them before the fight, but Wladimir believes that his unanimous points victory might now lead to the Briton altering the way he behaves in the future.
