" And last but not least -- well beyond the holster-loaded conventions of mere pulp sci-fi skirmishing -- the NIF laser is about puzzling out something called "fusion ignition": the point at which nuclear fusion reactions become self-sustaining, to, in the NIF's words, "provide abundant and sustainable clean energy. The NIF, located in Livermore, California, came online in March 2009, and its goals are manifold: Its primary mission, given funding by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) -- "a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for enhancing national security through the application of nuclear science to the nation's national security enterprise" -- is to duplicate what happens in contemporary nuclear weapons, in part to render underground nuclear testing unnecessary. The July 5 shot was actually the NIF's third in a series of test fires, a series that's seen power ramped up by nearly 100 terawatts since March 15, when the NIF fired a shot that delivered 1.8 megajoules and peak power of 411 terawatts. "NIF is becoming everything scientists planned when it was conceived over two decades ago," said NIF Director Edward Moses of the July 5 shot. " Fusion reaction is arguably the most exciting of the NIF's goals: to catalyze self-sustaining nuclear fusion, wherein two light atomic nuclei "fuse" together and produce a single heavier nucleus while converting some of that mass to incredible amounts of energy.
