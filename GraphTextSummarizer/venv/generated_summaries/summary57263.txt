Matt Bevin, who is running for Senate to replace top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, said in a statement that he would support "conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz in his fight to defund Obamacare. "President Obama and Senate Democrats told the American people just try Obamacare. "Senator Cruz came to Washington to advance conservative policies, not play by the same old rules that have relegated conservatives, and their ideas, to the back bench," Michael Needham, president of Heritage Action, recently said about Cruz. But Senate Democrats are not about to allow the health care bill to be unraveled, therefore putting at risk a government shutdown. As the hours dragged on, Cruz addressed his daughters, apologized for not being home to read them a book, and read to them from the Senate floor.
