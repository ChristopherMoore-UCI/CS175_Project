-- Kanye West is a suspect in a misdemeanor battery assault probe in Beverly Hills, police said Monday. The alleged battery happened near Wilshire Boulevard at 12:15 p.m. Monday, a Beverly Hills Police Department statement said. West already faces charges of battery and attempted grand theft in an altercation with a photographer at Los Angeles International Airport last summer. Rob Wilcox, spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney's office, said each of the two charges carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. "The named suspect was identified as Kanye West by the victim and several witnesses," police said.
