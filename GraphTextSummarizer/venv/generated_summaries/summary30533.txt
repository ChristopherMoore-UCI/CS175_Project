A goal from Leon Osman (25th minute) and a quickfire brace from Nikica Jelavic (32nd and 38th minute) earned three points for David Moyes' team after Gaston Ramirez had given Southampton the lead in the sixth minute. The Chelsea captain announced his retirement from international football on Sunday, before being handed a four-match ban and a Â£220,000 ($356,000) by the English Football Association (FA) on Thursday for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a match in October 2011. Two goals from Peter Crouch saw Stoke City beat Swansea City 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium -- a win which lifts Tony Pulis's side to 12th. Sergio Aguero equalized for City two minutes before halftime with Dzeko scoring the winner in the 87th minute, moments after coming on for Francisco Javi Garcia. Alex Ferguson's men are now third with 12 points, level with Manchester City who had Edin Dzeko to thank for their 2-1 win against Fulham at Craven Cottage.
