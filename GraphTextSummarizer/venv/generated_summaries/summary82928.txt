I started my career as a gender specialist working in many countries where "honor" murders and other acts of violence against women often found considerable public support. British court convicts parents of murder in "honor" murder Expressing my horror and repulsion of "honor" murders with like-minded colleagues made me feel righteous and involved. It's a job that has exposed me to the dehumanizing effects of war, poverty, economic disasters, and natural calamities. For the feudal elite to eradicate poverty and ignorance, they must conjure the political will to create equality by pushing for land reform. I believe every human being instinctively yearns for a sense of significance -- a reason why their absence or presence matters.
