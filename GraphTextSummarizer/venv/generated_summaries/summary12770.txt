The Zhaojiagou area of Gaopo village had not experienced landslides before, according to Li. The landslide struck  Friday morning, triggered by rain and snow that had saturated the largely rocky area for 10 days,  Li Lianju, deputy director of the Yunnan Land and Resources Department, told state media. The landslide killed 46 people in the southwest China village, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. "We pulled out several people, one of whom was breathing weakly," said Li Yongju, 50, a resident  of the neighboring community of Zengjiazhai. Video from state-run CCTV showed what was once Gaopo, the small community in China's Yunnan Province.
