Kalsi is not the only Sikh asking permission to keep his hair, beard and turban while serving in the Army. The Sikh Coalition said Kalsi and Rattan had been assured when they were recruited to join the Army's Health Professions Scholarship that their unshorn hair and turbans "would not be a problem." "Both are concluding their training and are slated to begin active duty in July 2009. " Amardeep Singh, the head of the Sikh Coalition, told CNN in the spring that the issue affects observant Sikhs, not those Sikh-Americans who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair. The Pentagon public affairs office later confirmed that Kalsi would be allowed to keep his turban, beard and uncut hair. She said her ruling applies only to Kalsi's case, and is not a change of Army policy.
