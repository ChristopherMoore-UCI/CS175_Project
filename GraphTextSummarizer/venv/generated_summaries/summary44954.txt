"We hope that leaders in Beijing should be able to listen and ... respond to the demands of Hong Kong people." The activists are open to talks with Chinese or other Hong Kong leaders, but not with Leung, one of the movement's figureheads, Lester Shum, said Wednesday. Sophie Richardson, from the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, said that Hong Kong authorities have shown restraint, aside from Sunday, isn't surprising. This marks a shift, in location and strategy, in the movement that's had a large, constant presence in downtown Hong Kong. But tensions have risen after a late August decision giving Beijing control over the slate of Hong Kong chief executive candidates in 2017.
