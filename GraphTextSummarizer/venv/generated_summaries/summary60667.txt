"The doctor said they are in critical condition," father Liao Guojun told CNN by telephone, as his babies cried in the background in a hospital intensive care unit. The babies have been moved from Suining to Xin Qiao Hospital in the city of Chongqing for further examination. Liao said he worked as a cook in Guangdong province before the babies were born, and his wife was a factory worker for a cotton clothing manufacturer before she returned to Suining. The hospital has classified them as "high risk," as they suffer from conditions including anemia, pneumonia, jaundice and neonatal sepsis. At a final pregnancy examination three days before birth, doctors told the parents they were having "one baby with two heads," Liao said.
