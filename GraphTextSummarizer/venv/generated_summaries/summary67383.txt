Presumably, a mall, hospital, grocery store or convention center could create its own app using indoor GPS. Apple has bought a company called WiFiSLAM, a 2-year-old Silicon Valley-based startup focused on indoor GPS, the company has confirmed to the Wall Street Journal and other outlets. WiFiSlam, which up until now had been shopping out its system to independent app developers, is one of several startups that are marrying traditional GPS coordinates with smartphone tools like accelerometers and compasses to get more precise coordinates. The last several versions of Google Maps have included indoor navigation, at least for locations that have been mapped by the computing giant on its expansive database. Theoretically, indoor GPS could be used to let the grocery store know where you are and digitally shout at you that those bananas in front of you are two bunches for $1 today only.
