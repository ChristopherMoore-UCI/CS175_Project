"While applying for public aid, the mother of 14 children allegedly failed to disclose that she was also getting checks for personal appearances and residuals from videos," said a news release from Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey on Monday. Suleman, 38, performed in adult videos and danced topless at a Florida strip club last year. The criminal complaint, filed by Deputy District Attorney William Clark with the public assistance fraud division, said Suleman applied for public assistance in Lancaster, California, in January 2013. Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman faces welfare fraud charges as she's accused of not reporting money earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress. Suleman -- known in tabloids as "Octomom" -- has not been arrested, but she has been ordered to appear before a Los Angeles County judge for her initial arraignment Friday, according to the district attorney's office.
