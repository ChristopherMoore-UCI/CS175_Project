Taiwan police clash with students over trade deal Critics claimed the deal would threaten small businesses in Taiwan and give China greater influence in the island state. The election came months after protesters from what Taiwanese media dubbed the "Sunflower Movement" occupied Taiwan's parliament and hit the streets to rail against the trade agreement between Taiwan and mainland China, its longtime adversary, which was signed in Shanghai last year. The premier of Taiwan announced his resignation on Saturday after losing the first election since protests erupted over a controversial trade deal with mainland China. Six years ago no direct flights existed between the island and the mainland; today there are hundreds of flights a week and tourists are flooding in. The public uproar held up the trade agreement, and soured relations between China and Taiwan -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China.
