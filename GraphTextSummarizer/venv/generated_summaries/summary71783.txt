Marissa Chavez told CNN that she was in a car with Hannah and DiMaggio, 40, a few months ago when he told Hannah he had a crush on her. Father of missing teen pleads for daughter's release Witness: DiMaggio had crush A friend of Hannah Anderson detailed the relationship she observed between DiMaggio and the teen. Ultimately, DiMaggio was spotted and killed not far from where he left his car, said Andrea Dearden, spokeswoman for Idaho's Ada County sheriff's office.
