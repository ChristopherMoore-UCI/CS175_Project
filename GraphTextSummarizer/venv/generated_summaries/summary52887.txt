While the Yosemite Conservancy says the Rim Fire has consumed tens of thousands of acres inside Yosemite National Park, it has so far had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the park's iconic attractions, including the El Capitan rock formation. "There's a lot of concern, and there's a lot of work to be done," U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley said. Hermanson, a 30-year-old artist and air conditioner repairman from the San Diego area, knows Yosemite National Park like the back of his hand. Stoked to be back in the park again, Hermanson and three of his buddies loaded up the llamas and embarked August 20 on what was to have been a 60-mile hike from Leavitt Meadows to Lake Eleanor. An evacuation advisory was lifted Thursday for residents in Tuolumne City, a picturesque community in northern California threatened by an historic wildfire, as firefighters worked to get a grip on the blaze.
