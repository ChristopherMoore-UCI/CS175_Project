Diamond and Schutz drove away from the bar and were stopped by police, who said they found a "stiletto folding knife with a 3.75-inch blade, which uses a thumb stud and assisted opening mechanism." One witness told police a woman was upset because people were taking pictures of her and her boyfriend. Schutz was charged with disorderly conduct and released, police said. Diamond said he and his girlfriend, Amanda Schutz, 27, were inside the bar when a group of intoxicated people started behaving in a rude and insulting manner, leading him to believe "there was going to be a brawl," the report said. Other people in the bar said the fracas started when women started shoving each other, the police report said..
