On Wednesday, police weren't disclosing what was the relationship between the dismembered man and Andrus, said San Francisco Police Lt. Albie Esparza. "Andrus was our primary person of interest who was subsequently arrested and booked for the crime," San Francisco Police Department spokeswoman Officer Grace Gatpandan said earlier this week. "We are very disturbed by the facts of this case and are working with the San Francisco Police Department to secure the evidence necessary to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law," the San Francisco District Attorney's Office said last week. The body parts found inside a suitcase on a San Francisco sidewalk were identified as the remains of a 58-year-old man who resided in the Bay Area, authorities said Wednesday. One person was arrested and later released in connection with the discovery of the dismembered body, but that person, Mark Andrus, 54, died Saturday after admitting himself to a hospital the same day, San Francisco Police said.
