On a Victory Tour of the 12 districts, she and her fellow champion, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), have to carry on the charade that they're in love, and the first sign of Katniss' insurrectionary fever is that she's not very good at faking it. Last year, in the avidly faithful but ultimately rather flat-footed screen version of "The Hunger Games," we saw Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) triumph in a Survivor-meets-gladiator teen war to the death. Lawrence plays her as a riveting icon of girl power, but I hope that in the upcoming sequels, Katniss gets to show another dimension or two to go along with her precocious, defiant strength. So the ruling powers, led by the velvet-voiced fascist President Snow (Donald Sutherland), figure it's time to nip Katniss — and the rebellion — in the bud with the Quarter Quell, a special, once-every-25-years edition of the Games in which past winners compete against each other. In "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Katniss has become a star, a lightning-rod symbol of the early stirrings of a people's rebellion.
