The bodies were found about 1,500 yards apart in a heavily wooded area, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Saturday afternoon. Earlier Saturday, Geller told reporters the effort had transitioned from rescue to recovery. Ginny Doyle, associate head basketball coach, and Natalie Lewis, director of basketball operations, were on the balloon, the university said in a statement. Weather conditions are one of the elements investigators are looking at, Moats said, though there was no inclement weather at the time and, so far, officials don't believe those conditions played a role in the crash, Geller said. But then there was an explosion and the basket and balloon separated.
