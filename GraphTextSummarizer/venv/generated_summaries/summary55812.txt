The manager of the largest  private security provider, Watan Risk Management, said he  complained to U.S. military officials that his  company had to pay bribes ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 monthly to Afghan  governors, police chiefs, and local military officials whose territory the  convoys traversed. Addressing  those who believe that the problem  is due to insufficient planning and poor management on the part of the military,  Schwartz said, "the solution may be to develop an effective strategy for using  PSCs (private security companies),  improving operational planning, and enhancing oversight." Schwartz  acknowledged that the Defense Department has taken steps to improve its management and  coordination of private contractors, and but warned more needs to be done. Investigators found no  direct evidence of payoffs to the Taliban, but many military officials  overseeing the contract believed that the Taliban did receive protection  payments, based on information provided to them by contractor representatives,  the report said. The results of the six-month  investigation indicate that outsourcing the Afghanistan supply chain to  contractors has resulted in "significant unintended consequences, fueling  warlordism, extortion, and corruption, and it may be a significant source of  funding for insurgents," the report's  executive summary said. The U.S military outsources  much of the security for truck convoys carrying food, water, equipment, fuel and  ammunition to remote and dangerous areas in Afghanistan, and those contractors  hire local Afghans who pay bribes for safe passage, according to investigators.
