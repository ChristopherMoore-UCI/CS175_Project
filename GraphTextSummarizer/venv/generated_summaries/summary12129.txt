The Boxmasters' final Canadian dates -- in Montreal and London, Ontario -- were canceled because "one of the band members and several of the crew have the flu," said Thornton publicist Arnold Robinson. " "It's mashed potatoes with no gravy," Thornton told CBC host Jian Ghomeshi. Thornton's publicist says Boxmasters band member, crew, have flu; will rejoin tour on Tuesday. " Thornton, apparently upset with any reference to his movie career, was unresponsive to Ghomeshi's questions until the men finally declared a truce to talk about music. Thornton promotes a mythology that his "cosmic cowboy" music came together years ago after a fight over coleslaw at a Los Angeles chicken restaurant.
