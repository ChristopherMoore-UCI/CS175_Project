In 2002, following a brutal midterm election when many Democrats were skewered for being "weak on defense" after 9/11, Congress created the Department of Homeland Security. The practice of Congress passing bills after elections had frequently infuriated members of the minority party who believed that their colleagues, some of whom had lost their seats, were making decisions regardless of the democratic will. But as long as members of Congress are back they should try to make some incremental progress, given that the midterms were as much an act of protest against Washington as an act of protest against President Obama. Four years later, House Republicans inflamed partisan tensions by voting to impeach President Bill Clinton. While there have been times when a lame duck Congress has had a breakthrough, it would take a miracle for this to become one of those moments.
