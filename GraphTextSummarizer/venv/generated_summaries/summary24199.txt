Frank Schaefer, 51, the pastor at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, was found guilty by a jury of 13 ordained clergy members on two counts: officiating a same-sex wedding and being disobedient to the discipline and order of the church, according to Cathy Husid-Shamir, a Schaefer family spokesperson. "I gave the jury every excuse to take my credentials when I was honest with them and said that I must continue to serve all people -- no exceptions." Schaefer previously told CNN's Zoraida Sambolin that his son, Tim, asked him to officiate his wedding seven years ago, and he decided to do it "out of love for him. "We ask for prayer." "Today, grace and love won over a controversial church law," Schaefer told CNN. " Despite at one point believing that homosexuality was incompatible with his Christian beliefs, Schaefer told CNN his views on the controversial topic began to change over time. The complaint was filed by one of Schaefer's church members, and the church leadership decided to act upon it, according to Schaefer.
