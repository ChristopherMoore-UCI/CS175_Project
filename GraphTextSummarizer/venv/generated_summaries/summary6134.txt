In total, 19 states permit recall elections for governors and other state officials, including Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and, of course, Wisconsin and California, the center says on its website. Walker's fate in Wisconsin comes down to ground game Dollars roll in from far beyond Wisconsin for recall Does Obama's absence portend outcome of Wisconsin recall vote? If Wisconsin voters toss out Walker in favor of Milwaukee's Democratic mayor, Tom Barrett, it will be only the third such electoral ousting of a governor in American history. The District of Columbia also permits recall elections, and Virginia allows recall by trial, according to the center. North Dakota kicked out Gov. Lynn Frazier in 1921, and California got rid of Gov. Gray Davis in 2003, according to the Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics.
