Writing the regulations has been a ferocious battle, particularly over something called the Volcker Rule, after former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. It's not like this company is jeopardized -- we hurt ourselves and our credibility, yes, and we've got to fully expect that and pay the price for that," CEO Jamie Dimon said on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday. "Bear in mind, the Dodd-Frank bill, 2,300 pages, they've already had 400 rule-making sessions, and this is where you have so much government regulation coming in that you can't see the forest for the trees," Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said on ABC's "This Week." -- JPMorgan Chase announced last week that it lost $2 billion as the result of some complicated trades intended to hedge against economic risk, which according to its top executive is apparently not as bad as it sounds. After the meltdown three years ago that nearly took the country over a cliff, Congress passed Dodd-Frank, a regulatory law to rein in risky investments and prevent the need for future government bailouts.
