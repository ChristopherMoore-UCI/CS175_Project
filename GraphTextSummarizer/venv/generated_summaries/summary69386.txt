"Elvis was the king of stamps," said Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders, who said the runoff nearly 20 years ago was conducted using only post cards obtained and mailed at 40,000 post offices nationwide. But in deciding to discontinue the rule, Kearney explained it was limiting the number of worthwhile, relevant candidates, especially those considered meaningful by young people who might be encouraged to buy stamps. "We wanted to make sure the people we suggested had stood the test of time," said Stephen Kearney, the Postal Service manager of stamp programs. "What we don't want to do is let stamps get involved in the political process," Kearney told CNN, "so it's very unlikely we would do politicians who are still in the game right now." Kearney said, "We're not ruling out sports stars, musicians, writers and artists." Kearney said "when it gets to a final stage, we do complete research" into the person who may become the first contemporary honoree, potentially ruling out anyone with questionable background since, in Kearney's words, "surprises are not good in the world of stamps."
