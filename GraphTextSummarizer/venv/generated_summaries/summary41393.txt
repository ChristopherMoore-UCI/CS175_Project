A recent poll shows that American sports fans are not surprised that many athletes will squander their shot at education -- because they or someone else has decided that football should be the No. 1 priority while they are in school, because their classes must fit into practice schedules or because their goals are set by athletic departments rather than academic advisers. Last year, when football players at Northwestern University -- a school with one of the more admirable academic-athletic reputations -- went to the National Labor Relations Board in an attempt to unionize, it was discovered that during the season, athletes devoted 50 hours a week to their sport. "I think the UNC example stands as a testimony to what little opportunity these athletes have for a real education," said Gurney, who is current president of the Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport. We ain't come to play SCHOOL classes are POINTLESS." While the average in-state public school scholarship is worth about $15,000 a year and the average private university scholarship is worth about $35,000 annually, according to the NCAA, top-notch football programs stand to make millions by shipping their teams off to bowl games.
