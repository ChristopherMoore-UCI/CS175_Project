-- "Mass Effect 3," the final installment in the tale of Commander Shepard and his fight to save the universe, brings the series to a resounding and satisfying crescendo with tight combat, excellent storytelling and majestic visual effects. As in other "Mass Effect" games, players take on the role of Shepard and have many options to craft him (or her) any way they want. Players who have played "Mass Effect 2" can import characters from older games, allowing pre-existing story lines to continue and for choices made in those games to be reflected in the new one. The game will have players hopping around the galaxy as Shepard recruits allies and builds up supplies from the multitude of races in the Milky Way. As in previous games, the way Shepard talks to and treats others is measured in "paragon/renegade" bonuses.
