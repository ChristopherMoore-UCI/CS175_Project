That was the bold declaration from India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as he delivered his first full-year budget since his party won a resounding victory at the polls last May. India's budget is a closely-watched TV event, with pre- and post-game analyses on every TV news channel. Speaking of Jaitley's boss, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said "Modi was elected to control inflation and create jobs. As CNN has reported, India's states have a myriad of different taxes, making trading between them a nightmare. Tarun Das, who ran India's Confederation of Indian Industry for 30 years told NDTV that he couldn't find a negative in Jaitley's presentation. He also promised a universal social security plan -- a vital need for India's millions of poor who have no access to pensions or health care.
