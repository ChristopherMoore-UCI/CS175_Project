All they did was take a look at you." States that already allow gender changes on birth certificates without proof of surgery include California, Vermont, Oregon, Washington, the District of Columbia and the state of New York -- but not New York City, says Chase Strangio, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT project. "There's no such thing as one surgery related to gender surgery," Strangio said. Worse, Strangio said, NYC's language about the kind of surgery it requires to make a legal gender change isn't specific. In New York City, for Prinzivalli to get her gender changed on her birth certificate, she would have to show proof of "convertive surgery," or what some call gender reassignment surgery. Strangio pointed to the fact that some people making transitions choose to do full genital reconstructive surgery, others do what is called "top surgery," where only the chest area is changed, while others simply take hormone therapy.
