Yucca Mountain -- 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas -- was to be the solution to the U.S. nuclear waste problem: a final destination for the tons of hazardous nuclear waste accumulating at commercial reactors in 33 states. And Congress, of course, is under no obligation to appropriate additional money for the Yucca Mountain project," the court order read. -- A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission must make a decision on whether to issue a permit for the long-term nuclear waste storage project at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, throwing into question plans to shutter the facility. In March of 2009, following the election of President Barack Obama, the secretary of energy announced plans to terminate the Yucca Mountain project. In 2008, the Energy Department submitted a license application to the NRC seeking to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, with a goal of opening it in 2017, a date later delayed until 2020.
