-- Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. called his lawyer Monday night to come back to prison and pick him up. Confusion arose when Hoffler's office issued a news release on Monday evening saying Jackson had reported to prison in North Carolina. " Jackson, 48, was sentenced in August to 30 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to misuse of $750,000 in campaign funds, money that went to personal expenses like vacations, fur coats and movie memorabilia. But prison officials said Jackson didn't become a prisoner until Tuesday morning. She told reporters Tuesday in Atlanta that Jackson, once a rising Democratic star and son of the famous civil rights figure, wasn't trying to duck the media by sneaking into prison early.
