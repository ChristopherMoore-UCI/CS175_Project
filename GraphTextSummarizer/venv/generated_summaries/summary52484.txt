Pratt framed the first half of the bet: If the Patriots lose, Evans must come to Seattle and visit a children's hospital in his superhero duds and waving a Seahawks fan-club flag. Chris Pratt and Chris Evans -- two of the hottest actors in Hollywood because of their superhero roles in recent Marvel Studios movies -- are waging a friendly feud on Twitter, resulting in an epic bet over the Super Bowl. And Evans responded in turn, daring Pratt to come to a Boston pediatric cancer center dressed as Star-Lord from "Guardians." Evans landed the first blow Monday with a tweet to Pratt that said in part, "For the next 2 weeks, you are not my friend, you are my enemy. " In the other corner, we have Pratt, the "Guardians of the Galaxy" star, who roots for the Seattle Seahawks.
