Private exchanges get paid by insurance companies for the customers they sign up. -- Private health insurance exchanges still are not able to directly enroll consumers in subsidized health plans offered through Obamacare even though the government has said problems doing so should have been cleared up weeks ago. Through private exchanges, consumers can compare plans offered by multiple providers, filter them by coverage features, and even get free advice as to what kind of coverage they may need. Other private exchanges are also using their call centers as a workaround, but one official said companies are still working towards the "holy grail," when customers can enroll online from start to finish. Launched in 2010, GoHealth has been participating in an alternate form of direct enrollment since late November, but visitors to the site still cannot complete the entire process online as CMS officials promised.
