North Korea said in November that it had it had arrested an unidentified South Korean intelligence agent in Pyongyang who was planning to "rally dishonest elements" in North Korea and "use them for undermining the stability of the social system." Pyongyang said the agent had engaged in "espionage and plot-breeding activities in a third country" that borders North Korea while "disguising himself as a religionist." The South Korean Unification Ministry said Thursday it had been asking North Korea for information about the South Korean citizen since Pyongyang's announcement in November. He said he had worked as a missionary for several years on the Chinese side of the border with North Korea, running a church that sought North Korean converts. Merrill Newman, an American veteran of the Korean War detained by North Korea last year, said that he was made to deliver an "apology" on state media that was not his own words. "People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination," the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said.
