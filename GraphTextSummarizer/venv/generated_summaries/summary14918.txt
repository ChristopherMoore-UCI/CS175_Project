Venker paints a most unyieldlingly awful portrait of men, one that is happily belied by actual, real, American men. In her screed against women, she argues that women are their own worst enemy, and that the rise of women has caused the "end of men," that men are wilting into angry, resentful bachelorhood because women are demanding so much from men. Women aren't letting men be men. Women, Venker writes, have been seduced by feminists into pushing men off their pedestal to "take what they were taught to believe was rightfully theirs." If women didn't tame men, the anti-feminists argued, all hell would break loose.
