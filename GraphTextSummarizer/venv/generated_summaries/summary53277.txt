Still it's better than sleeping against a wall of Terminal E in bright lights which dozens of people did last night. The person I have come to look for is Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency computer contractor who spilled details of U.S. surveillance programs to reporters. We are thinking of going to one of two TGI Friday's for dinner in Terminal D. My first morning at Moscow Airport's Terminal E consisted of an indescribable burger at Burger King. President Barack Obama says he won't take extraordinary measures to track Snowden down.
