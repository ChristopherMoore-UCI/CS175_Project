Last year, Apple announced the latest version of its desktop operating system, OS X Mavericks, and a heavily redesigned update to the mobile operating system, iOS 7. Because it's a conference for application developers, the big unveilings tend to focus on operating systems and software, so don't bet on any major iPhone or iPad announcements. Barring a surprise, the next big round of Apple announcements are coming June 2. The company has announced the dates for its next Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), an annual event where Apple gives the press and developers a peek at its latest projects. They get one-on-one time with Apple engineers and work hands-on with the new platforms.
