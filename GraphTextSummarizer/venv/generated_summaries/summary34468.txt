In the shadow of the nation's oldest operating nuclear power plant, Alfonse Esposito fishes along Oyster Creek in central New Jersey, where he's caught and eaten bluefish and kingfish for 37 years. Not only is it concerned about tritium entering the underground aquifers, but analysis also shows a plume of tritium headed toward Oyster Creek surface water. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and former instructor for the NRC, claims the commission is playing what he calls "regulatory roulette," sanctioning plant owners and demanding a clean-up in some cases, such as the Braidwood spill, but not in other instances, like Oyster Creek. " In the case of Oyster Creek and other similar plant leaks, however, the NRC argues it did the right thing in not sanctioning the plant operators because the radioactive water remained on the property of the nuclear plant. "Once that water moved off the plant into the water supply of the state of New Jersey, we felt that it was in our responsibility to go after and protect that water supply," said New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Martin.
