The 43-year-old former student at the college "does not appear to be remorseful at all," Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan said. The suspect was arrested a short time after the shooting, when he surrendered to police at a grocery store in the Oakland suburb of Alameda, Jordan said. "He planned this several weeks in advance," Jordan told KTVU on Tuesday. Of those killed, six were women and one was a man, but Jordan said investigators do not know whether Goh was targeting women. After the shooting, the man left the classroom, reloaded his semiautomatic weapon and returned, firing into several classrooms, Jordan said.
