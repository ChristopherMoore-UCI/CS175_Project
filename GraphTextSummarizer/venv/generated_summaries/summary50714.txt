"If you can speak to the media directly, my concern for me is Caylee," a tearful Anthony tells her brother, Lee Anthony, on July 25, 2008, from an Orange County jail. Casey Anthony responded sarcastically when her mother brought up media accounts then circulating about the possibility that 2-year-old Caylee Anthony had drowned in the family pool, according to a recording of a jailhouse conversation shown to jurors on Friday. In testimony offered Friday, an Orange County sheriff's detective and a missing persons investigator spoke about collecting evidence from the Anthony home and an impound lot where Anthony's Pontiac Sunfire had been towed, and two crime scene investigators discussed mostly technical aspects of collecting evidence. Anthony's defense team explains her behavior in the weeks following Caylee's death by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and had taught to conceal her pain. In the interview, investigators pleaded with Anthony to tell the truth about what happened to Caylee.
