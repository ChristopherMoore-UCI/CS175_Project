Unless black America owns up to this problem -- and fast -- we are going to see another generation of young black men who are angry with their lot in life. A friend of mine suggested more black men need to mentor young black men. We can spend all day talking about the ills afflicting urban America -- and there are plenty that are institutional -- but the decaying value of life in inner cities clearly can be traced to the exodus of fathers from the lives of so many young men. The rampant poverty that exists has led many young blacks to a life of crime, choosing to sell drugs and involve themselves in gangs as opposed to focusing on education as a way out of the cellar of life. Teenage black girls and black boys should be focused on picking colleges, not the names of babies.
