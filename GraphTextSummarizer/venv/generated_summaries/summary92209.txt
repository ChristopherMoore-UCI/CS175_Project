" Sathar says many people are unable to make informed decisions because support services such as family planning are lacking. "It's a huge concern that we're growing at one of the fastest rates in Asia," said Zeba Sathar, Pakistan country director for the Population Council, a non-profit organization that specializes in public health research in developing countries. He admitted the government has to share the blame as not enough is done to offer effective family planning services and teach people about birth control. It said thousands of Health and Family Welfare centers have been upgraded nationwide, while Family Welfare Assistants provide door-to-door visits giving millions of couples family planning support and sexual health education. Experts say those countries started with the political will to do something and spent a lot of time and resources on family planning efforts.
