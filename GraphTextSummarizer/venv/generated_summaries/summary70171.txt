Neither Thomas nor Bliss seemed surprised or anxious when Wolf was arrested shortly after the video was released. Recently, Wolf was featured in a fundraising video created by Rob Bliss for Dégagé Ministries. Her brother, Jim Wolf, suffers from depression, alcoholism, unresolved grief and chronic homelessness, she says. Thomas says Wolf has started on that path before. Thomas says Wolf trained to deploy with an infantry unit but never deployed.
