When he arrived in New York on December 22, his suitcase with the instruments and materials he purchased in Morocco to make new instruments was not there. Customs agriculture specialists at JFK discovered "fresh bamboo canes approximately three to four feet long inside of unclaimed baggage arriving on a flight from Madrid, Spain on Sunday December 22, 2013," the Customs spokesperson said in a statement. While visiting family in Morocco, Razgui traveled to seven cities to find the right materials to bring home to make additional flutes, he said. In the past, he said, his instruments have been subject to increased scrutiny by Customs officials, but he has never had his instruments confiscated. Razgui says Customs destroyed 13 flute-like instruments: 11 neys and two kywalas, a shorter flute.
