In Sunday's other match, Birmingham City moved up to eighth place as veteran striker Kevin Phillips came off the bench to score both goals in the 2-1 win at home to Midlands rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers. Chelsea successfully bounced back from the shock draw with lowly Hull in midweek, which came as speculation about the future of England captain John Terry reached fever pitch. The visitors took the lead on manager Mick McCarthy's 51st birthday when striker Kevin Doyle reacted fastest to score after City defender Roger Johnson diverted a low cross onto his own post three minutes before halftime. And it was Terry who helped Drogba score the eighth-minute opening goal, heading a corner to the far post where his unmarked teammate coolly slotted the ball into the net past exposed goalkeeper Manuel Almunia. Chelsea reclaimed the lead in the English Premier League as Didier Drogba continued his hot scoring run against title hopefuls Arsenal with both goals in a 2-0 victory on Sunday.
