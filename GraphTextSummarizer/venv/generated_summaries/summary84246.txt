The spiraling conflict between Sudan and South Sudan poses a threat to world oil prices, the prime minister of neighboring Kenya has warned. Oil fuels the economies of both nations and Heglig oil facilities account for about half of Sudan's production of 115,000 barrels a day. South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. South Sudanese forces withdrew days later after Sudan lodged protests with the United Nations and African Union, but South Sudan said it continued to come under aerial and ground attack. Odinga said neighboring Kenya wants the matter "to be dealt with as quickly as possible so the humanitarian crisis is avoided." He added: "The previous conflict in the Sudan had a very devastating effect on Kenya because we hosted the majority of the Sudanese refugees in Kenya.
