Steps were also taken to ensure that top Gadhafi officials don't steal Libyan financial assets in what may be their final days in power. In addition to pushing both unilateral and multilateral sanctions, Washington will use the "full extent" of its intelligence capabilities to monitor Gadhafi's regime and gather evidence of atrocities committed against the Libyan people, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. In separate phone conversations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama "expressed his deep concern with the Libyan government's use of violence which violates international norms and every standard of human decency, and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond," a White House statement noted. As U.S. citizens continued to flee the spreading unrest, clashes between Libyan security forces and protesters were reported in Tripoli, which has been a Gadhafi stronghold. The U.S. government announced Friday that it will impose sanctions against the regime of Col. Moammar Gadhafi -- part of a series of measures designed to isolate the Libyan regime and loosen the dictator's grip on power.
