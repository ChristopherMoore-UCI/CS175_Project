The tabloid's website includes the caption: "Nigella Lawson attacked in public by Charles Saatchi. "About a week ago, we were sitting outside a restaurant having an intense debate about the children, and I held Nigella's neck repeatedly while attempting to emphasize my point," Saatchi, an art dealer and former advertising mogul, told The Evening Standard.
