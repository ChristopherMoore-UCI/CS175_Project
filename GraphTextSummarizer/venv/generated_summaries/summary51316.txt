-- Actor Charlie Sheen checked into a rehab clinic "as a preventive measure," his publicist said Tuesday. Sheen will "take some time off" from his acting job on the CBS series "Two and a Half Men" while he undergoes rehabilitation, publicist Stan Rosenfield said. The announcement comes a day after a lawyer for Sheen's wife, Brooke Mueller, confirmed she had switched rehab facilities in her battle with substance abuse. In a joint statement, executives from CBS and Warner Bros. Television and "Two and a Half Men" creator/producer Chuck Lorre said they "support Charlie Sheen in his decision today to begin voluntary in-patient care at a treatment center. The couple split soon after the incident and Preston married actor John Travolta in 1991.
