-- Malawi's high court ruled in favor of pop superstar Madonna on Friday, saying she will be able to adopt a young girl from the country, said Zione Ntaba, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office. Madonna, 50, took her effort to adopt the three-year-old to Malawi's highest court last month after a lower court ruled the adoption did not meet local law. Meanwhile, child rights group Eye of the Child told CNN it agrees with Friday's high court ruling. Madonna has been involved with Malawi for several years and made a documentary, "I Am Because We Are," to highlight the poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating children in the country. The young girl at the center of the current case is Chifundo James, whose first name translates to "mercy" in Chichewa, Malawi's national language.
