The CIA had accused the committee staffers of getting access to internal agency documents and of improperly handling classified material. Senators on the committee have indicated the report is critical of the CIA's treatment of terrorism suspects saying it amounted to torture, something CIA officials have denied. "The director subsequently informed the (committee) chairman and vice chairman of the findings and apologized to them for such actions by CIA officers as described in the (inspector general's) report," the statement said. CIA Director John Brennan apologized to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday and admitted the agency spied on computers used by its staffers who prepared an investigation of the controversial post 9/11 CIA interrogation and detention program. The documents that prompted the dispute related to an internal review by former CIA Director Leon Panetta and, according to the agency, were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee for its investigation of the program.
