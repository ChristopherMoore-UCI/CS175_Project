-- The space shuttle Endeavour landed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Wednesday, completing its 25th and final mission -- the next-to-last mission for NASA's 30-year-old space shuttle program. "It's sad to see her land for the last time, but she really has a great legacy," said shuttle commander Mark Kelly after Endeavour rolled to a stop in the darkness of a warm Florida morning On July 8, space shuttle Atlantis is to make NASA's final shuttle flight. "The retirement of Endeavour and the shuttle fleet will not end the human need to explore," Kelly said in comments from space that were posted on NASA's website. "Look how majestic it looks rolling out to the launch pad," said astronaut Sandy Magnus to reporters.
