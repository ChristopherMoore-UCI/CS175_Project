Anti-government protesters leaving noon prayers Saturday at Misratah's Al-Sheikh mosque were confronted by pro-Gadhafi demonstrators, two witnesses told CNN. Medical sources at Misratah Medical Complex said that at least three died and 70 were wounded in clashes Saturday between security forces and anti-government protesters. " Other eyewitnesses told CNN that anti-government demonstrators used a bulldozer Saturday to tear down part of a wall at Alfadeel Abu-Omar military camp, and were fired upon as they retreated. " Lt. Col. Mohammed al-Majbari, who helped lead Libyan military forces in Benghazi before deciding early this week to join the opposition, claimed that government forces, aided by mercenaries from other African countries, "caused a massacre." A Libyan woman supportive of the protesters, who was not identified to protect her safety, told CNN that army soldiers on Saturday initially claimed solidarity with the demonstrators, only to reverse their tack and open fire on the crowd.
