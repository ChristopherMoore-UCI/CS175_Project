-- Muslim community leaders in Australia say sectarian tensions are soaring, as radicalized Sunni youth, inspired by ISIS, seek to import the religious conflicts wracking the Middle East. The attack was only one incident in a string of attacks and threats against Shia Muslims by Sunni extremists who sympathized with ISIS, he claimed, and had followed an incident where a group of men had driven past the Islamic center, yelling comments such as "IS lives forever" and "Shia dogs" in Arabic. " Jamal Rifi, a Sydney-based GP and Sunni community leader, agreed, saying sectarian tensions were at an unprecedented level as a result of the brutal Syrian conflict, and the appeal of ISIS to radicalized Sunni youth in Australia. Rifi said that from the early days of the Syrian conflict, Sunni extremists had inflamed community tensions by attempting to "name and shame" businesses on social media that were run by members of Alawite sect, to which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad belongs. "There's high tension between Sunni and Shia, but these extremists, they threaten and attack Sunnis too," he said.
