-- Israeli police are restricting Friday prayers at Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem following intelligence reports about possible riots in the city, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Hatem Abdel Qader, a Fatah official in Jerusalem, told CNN that such restrictions have become common in recent years. When Israeli officials have concerns about possible violence, it is not uncommon for them to limit the access young men have to the mosque. Israeli officials have said public safety concerns prompt the restrictions, but Qader said the motivation is religious. The mosque, which is located on the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem, has been a site of clashes between Israelis and Palestinians.
