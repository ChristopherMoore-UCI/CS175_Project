International longhaul pilot Justin Schlechter says he's seen the effects of flight fatigue firsthand. During his 19 years as Boeing's chief engineer for human factors, pilots nicknamed Graeber "Dr. Sleepgood" because he helped them manage fatigue on longhaul flights. "Everyone I talk to who uses it says it's an important stopgap measure to improve safety and reduce sleep loss."

"Longhaul flights require relief crews," the FAA said in a written statement to CNN. Amazing advances in technology now let nonstop flights fly farther and cheaper for airlines than ever before.
