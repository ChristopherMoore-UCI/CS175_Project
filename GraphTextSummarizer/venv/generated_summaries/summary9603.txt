The National Hurricane Center in the United States warned Ingrid could dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over Mexico's eastern region, with 25 inches expected in mountainous areas. At least 16 people were killed when Manuel, downgraded later to a tropical depression, hit the Pacific coastal state of Guerrero, including a group of six tourists from Mexico City who died in a highway accident Saturday as the storm struck, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said. Rivers overflowed their banks, mudslides buried houses and roadways flooded as fierce tropical storm systems hit opposite sides of Mexico, killing at least 21 people, an official said. Residents of Mexico's central state of San Luis Potosi felt the first signs of Ingrid's outer bands Saturday. Another news conference is scheduled for Monday morning.
