Camuti, 69, confessed to putting potassium cyanide in an iced coffee that he provided to Stephen Rakes, 59, according to a testimony by a Massachusetts state trooper at hearing in Concord District Court on September 10. The two men met that afternoon in a McDonald's in Waltham, where Camuti allegedly bought two iced coffees, laced one with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide and gave it to Rakes, authorities said. Camuti and Rakes were longtime business associates, and Camuti allegedly poisoned Rakes at a time when Camuti owed Rakes money. -- The Massachusetts Medical Examiner's Office officially determined that the cause of death of an alleged Whitey Bulger extortion victim was homicide by cyanide poisoning, according to MaryBeth Long, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. He did in fact purchase potassium cyanide, which had been delivered and stored," said Trooper Michael Banks.
