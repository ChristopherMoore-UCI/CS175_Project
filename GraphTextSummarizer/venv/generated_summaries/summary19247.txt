Lufthansa Flight 411, an Airbus 340 packed with 286 passengers and crew, was cleared for takeoff by air traffic control shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. -- A Lufthansa jumbo jet nearly collided with another plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport Monday after an EgyptAir flight apparently veered into its path just as the jet barreled down the runway, according to air traffic controller tapes. After a brief inspection at the gate, the Lufthansa flight continued on its flight to Munich, Germany, and arrived safely, according to Lufthansa spokesman Martin Riecken. The near miss was captured on audio recordings, revealing an air traffic controller communicating with the Lufthansa pilot, yelling "Cancel takeoff! A spokesman for EgyptAir said the flight was delayed 40 minutes because Lufthansa's departure was delayed.
