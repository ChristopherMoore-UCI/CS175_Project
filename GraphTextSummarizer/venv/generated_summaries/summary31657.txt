-- Donald Sterling has filed a new civil lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking damages from his wife, the NBA and NBA commissioner Adam Silver in their attempt to sell the the L.A. Clippers for $2 billion to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Donald Sterling has said he believes the team may be worth twice the record $2 billion price his wife negotiated with Ballmer, said Maxwell Blecher, another attorney for Sterling. Donald Sterling revoked the family trust back in June, and Tuesday's lawsuit contends that the move reverted the Clippers back to his sole ownership and therefore, Shelly Sterling has no power or right to sell the team. No trial date has been set for the case to be heard, and it's unclear how long Ballmer will be willing to keep his offer on the table as the Sterling saga continues. "Donald's latest lawsuit is a frivolous, last ditch act of desperation by a delusional, bitter man," said Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly.
