Bombings in Baghdad Convulsions of violence in Iraq leave more than 20 dead CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report. Bombings account for many of the deaths, but U.N. officials warn that they're seeing a surge in execution-style killings that "have been carried out in a particularly horrendous and unspeakable manner," said Nickolay Mladenov, the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Iraq. -- Acts of terror and sectarian violence killed 659 Iraqis and injured almost 1,400 in November, according to casualty figures released by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. So far this year, 7,157 civilians and 952 Iraqi security forces have died in sectarian violence, according to U.N. figures. "The Iraqi authorities should take immediate steps to find and hold accountable the perpetrators of these crimes and to implement effective measures to ensure the protection of all citizens," Mladenov said in a statement.
