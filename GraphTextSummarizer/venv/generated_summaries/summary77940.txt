The 21-year-old finished runner-up behind compatriot Jorge Lorenzo -- and crucially ahead of the legendary Italian Valentino Rossi and Dani Pedrosa -- to take an unassailable 82-point lead in the championship with three rounds to go. The landmark means Marquez beat Mike Hailwood's record, set in 1963, to become the youngest ever rider to win consecutive titles. -- It took a little longer than most people expected but MotoGP whiz kid Marc Marquez wrapped up a second world title in Japan. Rossi blasted into the lead, while a muscular pass from Lorenzo saw Marquez fall back to seventh place on the race's first corner. For Marquez the key was to finish ahead of Pedrosa and Rossi, and gradually he settled into the task.
