-- Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher on Saturday denied that he is the man shown pointing at the Google Street View camera as it drove past his local pub in London last summer. Gallagher was apparently spotted outside The Queens pub in Camden, in north London, a place he's known to frequent. Liam Gallagher says the figure captured on Google Earth outside a pub in London is not him. Though available for a while in the United States, Google Street View only launched in Britain last week. Though the man isn't wearing legwarmers, Gallagher is apparently talking about the man's ankle-high shoes and thick black socks.
