Authorities received a tip Thursday morning that Souvannarath and a 19-year-old Timberlea, Nova Scotia, man planned to go to a public location in Halifax with "a goal of opening fire to kill citizens, and then themselves," Brennan said. A Canadian man and an American woman have been arrested in what authorities said Saturday was a foiled plot to carry out a mass murder-suicide at a Nova Scotia mall on Valentine's Day. "This group has been stopped and Halifax is a safe place," said Brian Brennan, Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police commanding officer. Souvannarath and Shepherd were arrested at about 2 a.m. Friday at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, Brennan said. The alleged plot, to spray a busy Halifax mall with gunfire, appeared to be motivated not by culture or ideology but by a small group's desire to carry out a heinous crime, according to Canadian investigators.
