" With O'Connor's own grandparents, though, "it's less often an indication of how much they've had to drink and more often just who they are." Because it's a role that's virtually paint-by-numbers -- drunk grandmothers are nearly always wealthy, white and cruelly witty, with poor parenting skills -- it demands a strong actress who can keep the potentially two-dimensional from falling flat. " "Hopefully, it's not the drunk grandmother [character] that have made it better for older actresses, but you never know," O'Connor said. The talent of the women who have taken these minor roles and turned them into iconic characters is what has kept the "drunk grandma" role from veering into clich√© territory, O'Connor said. " "She's the comic relief in this very deep, very hard movie; she comes in and the movie gets lighter," said movie reviewer Kit Bowen. "Even with the criticisms people had of '90210,' they liked Jessica Walter and what she was doing," O'Connor said.
