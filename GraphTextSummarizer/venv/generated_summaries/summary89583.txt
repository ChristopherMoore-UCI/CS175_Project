Ryanair has complained to OFT about its ongoing row with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority. Last week, Ryanair complained to OFT about its treatment by the ASA. -- Budget airline Ryanair faces an investigation from the UK's consumer and competition authority following allegations of misleading and unfair advertising. "It is very disappointing, but absolutely necessary, that we have had to take this course of action," said ASA director general Christopher Graham, whose authority last referred a company to OFT in 2005. It said Ryanair had exaggerated claims about the availability of flights at advertised prices, and it advertised prices that did not include taxes and charges.
