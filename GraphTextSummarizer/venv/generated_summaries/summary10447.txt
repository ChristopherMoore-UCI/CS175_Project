Asked for additional information, Arizona DPS spokesman Bart Graves said, "This is a very complex investigation, we are still sorting things out and there are a lot of witnesses to talk to, so we are in the early stages." "We believe they are from Idaho because of the license plate on their vehicle,"  DPS spokesman Bart Graves told CNN. What's known, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety statement released by spokesman Raul Garcia, is that someone at the store called the Cottonwood Police Department a few minutes before midnight Saturday to report that a woman who worked at Walmart "had been assaulted in the store by multiple suspects." The 31-year-old officer who suffered the gunshot wound was flown to Flagstaff Medical Center, where he underwent surgery. "I heard about eight to 10 shots," Louie Solano, an eyewitness, told CNN affiliate KPHO.
