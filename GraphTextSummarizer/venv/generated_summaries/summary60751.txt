Even before Nisman became the lead investigator, previous Argentine prosecutors suspected Iran's involvement in the terrorist attack. Everyone agrees -- the mysterious death of Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman has all the twists of a thriller. Nisman's own investigation also pointed at Iran, and in 2007, Argentina issued new arrest warrants and went back to Interpol. In the wake of Nisman's death, the government has suggested that rogue intelligence agents fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and then killed him after he filed the accusations in court. Argentina also asked for red notices for three others --  former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Hadi Soleimanpour, the former ambassador of Iran in Buenos Aires.
