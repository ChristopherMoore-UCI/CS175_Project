-- President Barack Obama firmly laid out his plan Thursday to "degrade and ultimately destroy" ISIS, the terrorist organization that now controls large swaths of Iraq and Syria. It seems the President's assurances that U.S. forces will not "have a combat mission" and the U.S. would not get "dragged into another combat war in Iraq" didn't make the troop buildup any more palatable. And the lowest point in the President's speech came when he announced he was deploying an additional 475 U.S. military advisers to Iraq. Overall, Americans gave the President's speech high marks, but party lines bled through as Democrats had a consistently more favorable perception throughout the speech.
