"Many people with epilepsy do lead normal, productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder," Kobau said. One in six (16.1 percent) adults with active epilepsy with recent seizures said they were not taking their medication and two-thirds (65.1 percent) said they had had more than one seizure during the prior month. A follow-up survey is planned to determine why so many people with seizure disorders said they had not seen a specialist in the past year, Kobau said. "When you have a head injury, it's common for epilepsy to develop after a gestational period -- it could be a couple of months or it could be years," he said. If the findings translate to the general population, that means a stadium filled with 60,000 people would contain 480 people with active epilepsy, Kobau noted, adding, "Epilepsy is not rare."
