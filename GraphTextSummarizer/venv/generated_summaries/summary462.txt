Gbagbo has imposed a curfew until Monday morning. Ivory Coast has been in crisis since a late November election that ended in dispute. Hundreds of pro-Quattara supporters gathered on the first day of rallies calling for Gbagbo's ouster when the security forces moved in, said police Lieutenant Djedje.
