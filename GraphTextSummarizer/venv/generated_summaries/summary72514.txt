Over the weekend, Johnson said police had expanded the search radius at the apartment in Redmond where toddler Sky Metalwala lived with his mother, Julia Biryukova, and the wooded area where she told police she last saw her son nine days ago. -- The search for a 2-year old boy who went missing in suburban Seattle more than a week ago continued Monday with no new suspects or information in the case, Bellevue, Washington, police said. Mike Johnson said his department had received 900 tips in the boy's disappearance, but none "have led to any high-priority actionable evidence." Though none of those leads has led to a breakthrough in the investigation, Johnson urged the public to continue providing information in the case. According to Johnson, Biryukova initially reported that she'd run out of gas early November 6 in Bellevue, just east of Seattle, leaving the toddler in the car while she took her 4-year-old with her to get help. Other than the boy's mother and his 4-year-old sister, no one has reported seeing the toddler in the past two weeks, police spokeswoman Carla Lafrate said last week.
