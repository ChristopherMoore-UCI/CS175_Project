-- A private marketing firm has been temporarily blocked from using President Obama's familiar "Rising Sun" campaign logo, after the Obama campaign committee filed a trademark infringement lawsuit. Obama officials said the issue was time-sensitive, since this kind of merchandise is typically sold in the six months leading up to the November elections. In his three-page order, the judge said that for now, the company cannot use the trademark or "confusingly similar" images in its products, including "engaging in any course of conduct with respect to the 2008 Rising Sun Trademark that is likely to mislead the public into believing that the products marketed and/or offered for sale by defendants are, sponsored, authorized, or otherwise approved by" the Obama campaign. On Tuesday, the DemStore.com website still featured products with the "Rising Sun" image, including a "Veterans for Obama" button listed as a "top seller." The company denies any wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that the Obama campaign had known of the alleged trademark infringement since 2007 and cannot now claim "immediate harm" from continued use of the logo by private companies.
