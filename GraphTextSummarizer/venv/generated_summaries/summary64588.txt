A suicide bomber detonated explosives outside a Shiite Muslim mosque in the northern Pakistani city of Rawalpindi on Wednesday evening, officials said, killing at least two people in what is the third such deadly attack in Pakistan in three weeks. The bombing killed two people and injured seven others, said Dr. Aisha Isani, a representative of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, which was treating people injured in the blast. The spokesman said that the group attacked because of a months-long Pakistani military operation against the Taliban and other militant groups in the country's North Waziristan area, and that Jundallah would continue to target Shiite Muslims. On Friday, a suicide bombing and gunfire attack on a Shiite mosque in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar killed at least 19 people, officials said. The Pakistani military campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people.
