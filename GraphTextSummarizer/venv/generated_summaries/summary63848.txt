The Islamic militants battling Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government have threatened attacks on Uganda and Burundi, which contribute troops to an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. -- The U.S. Embassy in Uganda is warning its citizens in the east African nation that regional terror groups "remain actively interested in attacking" American interests. Somalia-based al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attacks. The embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid large, public gatherings, "especially those with large numbers of westerners and/or no visible security presence." Uganda is holding presidential elections next month.
