According to its website, the film chronicles how a "a small and embattled team of park rangers -- including an ex-child soldier turned ranger, a carer of orphan gorillas and a Belgian conservationist -- protect (Virunga National Park) from armed militia, poachers and the dark forces struggling to control Congo's rich natural resources. Netflix announced Friday that it will team up with DiCaprio -- who it described as a "an actor, producer and philanthropist" -- to distribute a documentary film entitled "VIRUNGA," about the quest to save endangered mountain gorillas in the eastern Congo park by that name. -- What do you get when you combine gorillas, Leonard DiCaprio and Netflix? "Through grantmaking, public campaigns and media projects, DiCaprio has worked to bring much-needed attention and funding to three focus areasâ€”protecting biodiversity, ocean and forest conservation, and climate change," that organization says on its website. DiCaprio, its executive producer, called the partnership with Netflix "an exciting opportunity to inform and inspire individuals to engage on this topic.
