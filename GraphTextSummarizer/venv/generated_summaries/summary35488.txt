Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes. Obama added: "If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country." U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who invited Netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of Congress earlier this month, plans to visit Israel at the end of the month. But Obama told the Prime Minister that the United States would "reassess" aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Regarding comments Netanyahu made Tuesday about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls "in droves" -- comments described by some as racist -- Obama told The Huffington Post that that kind of "rhetoric" was "contrary to what is best of Israel's traditions. It doesn't matter how many times Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now says he still wants a two-state solution with the Palestinians.
