The damaged aircraft was still parked at Charleston's Yeager Airport on Tuesday, when NTSB officials arrived to inspect the plane, airport spokesman Brian Belcher said. Marilee McInnis, a Southwest spokeswoman, said the jets were inspected during non-operational hours overnight, and the cause of the incident remained unknown Tuesday morning. The airline is "doing things" for the affected passengers on Monday's flight, but McInnis would not say whether they would receive refunds. Bryant praised the flight crew and ground personnel for keeping passengers informed and for giving clear instructions. "There is no responsible way to speculate as to a cause at this point," Southwest said in a statement Monday night.
