-- Kraft is recalling 96,000 pounds of hot dogs because packaging labels were incorrect, federal officials said Sunday. The Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners packages may have contained cheese dogs, officials said, but the packaging doesn't advise consumers that they contain milk, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement. Kraft notified federal officials the next day, the statement said. In a statement on its Facebook page, Kraft said it was voluntarily recalling the hot dogs "because they may be mislabeled." The product labels "do not reflect the ingredients associated with the pasteurized cheese in the cheese dogs," the statement said.
