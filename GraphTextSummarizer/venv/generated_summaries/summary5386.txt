A magnified image of marine plankton has won a prestigious international photography contest for tiny works that exist, in the words of the winning photographer, in the "limbo between art and science.

The winning entry was created using software to combine various images focusing on different areas of the plankton. By combining images where some areas were in focus and others were blurred, he could create a 3-dimensional effect, he said.
