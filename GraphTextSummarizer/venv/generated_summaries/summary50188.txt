It's been a long old road to recovery for U.S. skiing star Lindsey Vonn. The Olympic gold medal winner and four time overall World Cup champion has been sidelined for much of the last two years after undergoing separate bouts of surgery on a recurring knee injury. A poor summer meant Woods dropped out of contention for a place in the U.S.'s ill-fated Ryder Cup team. A promising returning to action in late 2013 was cut short by a fall in training which meant she missed out on defending her downhill crown at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Now, after knuckling down in the gym and overcoming that bitter disappointment, the 30-year-old Vonn is finally set to return to competitive action.
