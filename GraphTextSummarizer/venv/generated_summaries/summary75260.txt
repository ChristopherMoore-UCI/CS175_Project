But since this week's announcement that the Higgs particle has been found, there's been a wave of Higgs humor on Twitter, a lot of it curated by Boing Boing's Xeni Jardin, whose battle with breast cancer led her to tweet: "Gonna start calling my post-mastectomy, science-rebuilt cyberboob the "Higgs Bosom." " @scullymike tweets: "There's an easy-to-understand video online that explains Higgs boson & creation of the universe, but it's like four minutes long. McDonald's to offer 1800 caolorie Higgs McBoson. I thought I'd nailed it, when I wrote what could be the first original Higgs Boson joke ever here. The humor can get a little deeper once we understand that the Higgs particle is responsible for all things having mass.
