And I was able to discuss learning with TED curator Chris Anderson, who has described how the Internet is encouraging people around the world to develop skills, such as the ability to learn to play musical instruments, that might have previously been out of reach. Music teachers there are in great demand and tend to focus only on Western classical or Eastern classical music. Apart from my classical training in piano, I have learned everything I know about music by watching other people -- many of them the best in their fields -- play online. Through my work in music, I want to show people that the Internet can not only break down barriers but also redefine the limits of what is possible. TED.com: Raul Midon plays "Peace on Earth" On the Internet, I can manufacture my own philharmonic orchestra, with string sections and woodwinds playing my music from all over the world, as I did with my orchestral album "Circus in the Sky," which is a full representation of my approach to music and storytelling.
