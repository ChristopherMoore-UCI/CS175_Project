-- Photographer Thomas Nybo has captured images of some of the toughest issues facing Africa, from child mortality to access to education. He recently visited five countries in 11 days as he traveled around West Africa with New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. In another of his pictures Nybo also captured a young woman with facial scarification, a common practice in the area. While in West African countries including Niger and Burkina Faso, Nybo says no matter people's hardships, he found an unbreakable spirit in everyone that shines through in his pictures. An experience photographer and filmmaker, Nybo has documented life in more than 65 countries including Sudan, Lebanon, Congo and Yemen.
