In the past, some electronics companies have been suspected of intentionally limiting the supply of new products to create the appearance of strong demand. In an e-mail to customers, the company said some versions of the 7-inch tablet are in the mail and others would be on the way to customers by Thursday evening. -- Google says the Nexus 7, its hotly anticipated new tablet computer, is shipping to customers who preordered it this week, amid reports of heavy demand. But, in an unusual move, Google has not announced an official date they'll go on sale in retail stores. Orders placed after July 11 will ship next week with overnight shipping."
