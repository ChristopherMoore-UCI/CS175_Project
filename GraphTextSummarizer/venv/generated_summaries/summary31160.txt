He wanted to make government smaller, and his overall success with that notion prompted President Clinton to famously tell Congress "the era of big government is over." And there's an inherent conflict in current public thinking, as scholars William Galston and Elaine Kamarck point out: While people want government to solve big problems like health care, they don't trust the government to do it. After Bill Clinton lost health care reform -- and control of the Congress -- trust in government in 1994 was at an all-time low: 21 percent. The question is whether President Obama can convince us that more government is what we want -- and need. Gloria Borger says President Obama's plans are running into Americans' widespread mistrust of government.
