I have had the privilege of interviewing Ronaldo various times, and spent some one-on-one time with him in Italy and France. While he was helping Barcelona, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Brazil win a multitude of titles, he also found himself in the headlines a multitude of times for all the wrong reasons. However, that last personality trait has contributed to a turbulent career and lifestyle. You may not have recognized him when he came on as a substitute for Corinthians in a Brazilian Cup match, though. Comeback Brazilian: Ronaldo is playing competitive football again -- but will he reach his former glory?
