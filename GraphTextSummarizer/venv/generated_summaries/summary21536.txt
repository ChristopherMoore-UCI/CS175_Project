In a first for Manchester United, the English professional football club today announced major sponsorship deals with not one, but two, popular Chinese companies -- each in a three-year deal. China Construction Bank, the country's second largest bank by market value, will be the club's first deal with a Chinese financial institution. While the value of those agreements have not been revealed, Chinese beverage giant Wahaha will become Manchester United's first official soft drinks partner in the country. United's Chinese sponsorship deals are just the latest in a series of at least a dozen agreements with global brand names in 2012 as the club has tried to pay down debts from a 2005 takeover. Under the second deal, China Construction Bank gains exclusive rights to market the official Manchester United-branded credit card in China.
