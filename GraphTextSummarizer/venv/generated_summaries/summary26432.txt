-- Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced some far-reaching proposals Monday for restructuring the massive budget at his agency, including getting rid of the U.S. Joint Forces Command. It grew out of the old Atlantic Command and became the Joint Forces Command in 1999. Others include: -- Eliminating some of the 65 military boards and commissions to cut the budget for them by 25 percent in fiscal year 2011; -- A review of all Defense Department intelligence to eliminate needless duplication; -- Eliminating the Defense Department's Business Transformation Agency, which has day-to-day oversight of acquisition programs that would be handled by others in the department; -- However, the recession caused the department to propose a 1 percent budget increase for next year, and the cuts announced Monday were intended to help hold down overall costs. Eliminating the Joint Forces Command is just one of a wide-ranging series of proposals presented by Gates.
