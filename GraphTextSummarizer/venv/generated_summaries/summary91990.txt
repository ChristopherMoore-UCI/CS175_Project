It is not the first time the Bantams, under the management of Phil Parkinson, have caused cup upsets against EPL opposition, reaching the final of the 2012-13 English League Cup before losing 5-0 to Swansea at Wembley. Third-flight Bradford City claimed another English Premier League scalp to reach the quarterfinals of the FA Cup, football's oldest cup competition Not content with coming from two goals down to stun Chelsea in the previous round, Bradford followed up Sunday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland at Valley Parade. Aston Villa, with new manager Tim Sherwood in attendance, had a welcome distraction from its league woes with a 2-1 win over fellow EPL relegation candidates Leicester City. Bradford was then in the fourth-flight of English football and has since been promoted to the tier above, but still ranked 37 places below Sunderland. The Gunners might have added to the tally after dominating the tie, but Boro, chasing promotion to the EPL, had an effort hit the woodwork in injury time.
