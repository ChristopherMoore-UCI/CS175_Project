-- I write this piece with some trepidation, because people are understandably troubled by the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 and want to know why it happened. Did Asiana pilot have enough 777 experience? For that reason, we need to study carefully what went wrong on Asiana Flight 214 to minimize the risk of recurrence. Had Asiana Flight 214 been warned seven seconds earlier, we might never have heard about it. Under the circumstances, it is heartening that the National Transportation Safety Board will painstakingly study everything that happened on Asiana Flight 214, and will identify indirect as well as direct causes of the crash.
