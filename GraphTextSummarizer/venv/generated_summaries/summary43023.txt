Most Canadians are already asked to pick up letters at community mailbox clusters in neighborhoods or apartment buildings; soon, everyone will. A man or a woman, carrying a satchel, walks from house to house, from apartment building to apartment building. In Canada, the postal service has informed citizens that, over the next five years, it will stop all door-to-door delivery of letters and concentrate on delivering packages. The Postal Service reports that it lost $5 billion in the last fiscal year -- and this is being presented as good news. The Postal Service, like UPS, FedEx and other private delivery companies, is a stand-alone  business.
