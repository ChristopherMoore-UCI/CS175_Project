While many of her fans lamented the fact that Houston's service was invitation-only, Pastor Marvin Winans, who delivered the eulogy, thanked Cissy Houston, Whitney's mother, for having the service at New Hope. -- Whitney Houston went to church one last time Saturday. Oprah Winfrey, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Spike Lee, and Houston's former husband, Bobby Brown, were among those in attendance. Saturday's homegoing service was held at New Hope Baptist Church, where Houston, nicknamed "Nippy," was soloing in the junior choir by age 11. At the conclusion of the service, Houston's iconic recording of "I Will Always Love You" was played as her coffin was removed from the sanctuary.
