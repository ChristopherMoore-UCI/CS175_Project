"Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease," said Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA medical center, and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. Scientists announced Monday that Duerson's brain tissue showed "moderately advanced" evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. Duerson suffered a minimum of 10 known concussions during the course of his career, some of them involving loss of consciousness, said Dr. Robert Stern, co-director of the Boston University center. In February, former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest, but not before leaving behind a note requesting that his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players. Duerson's ex-wife said that while playing professionally, the head trauma he bore on the field would become plain after games ended.
