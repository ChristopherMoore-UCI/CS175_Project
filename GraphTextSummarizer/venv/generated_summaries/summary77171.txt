-- International soccer star Lionel Messi has paid â‚¬10 million ($13 million) in taxes to cover the tax period 2010-2011, prosecutors in Barcelona, Spain, told CNN Tuesday, but efforts to prosecute him for alleged tax fraud from 2007 to 2009 are still going ahead. Messi's payment does not affect the existing investigation into the alleged tax fraud, said Jose Miguel Compan, a spokesman for the Barcelona prosecutor's office. The four-time world player of the year and his father Jorge Horacio Messi are suspected of defrauding Spanish tax authorities of more than $5 million between 2006 and 2009. Compan said Messi's lawyers had not approached prosecutors about making a deal to settle the earlier tax claim. Messi's lawyer, Cristobal Martell, is not taking any calls from journalists, his office said Tuesday.
