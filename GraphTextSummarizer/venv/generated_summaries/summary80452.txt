The moves come days after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about "the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program," the British Treasury statement said Monday. Iran's nuclear program, the French president said, risks nuclear proliferation and "could spark a military escalation in the region with catastrophic consequences for Iran and for the world. France recommended that the European Union and its member states, as well as the United States, Japan, Canada and other willing countries, freeze the asset of Iran's Central Bank and suspend purchases of Iranian oil. -- Russia called new sanctions against Iran "unacceptable," saying the new punishments would hurt efforts to talk with Tehran. Also Monday French President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to various leaders and heads of state, urging "new sanctions of unprecedented magnitude to convince Iran that it must negotiate," according to a statement.
