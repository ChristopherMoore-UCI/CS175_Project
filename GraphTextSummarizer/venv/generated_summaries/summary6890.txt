Gen. Horoho is also investigating whether PTSD evaluations at other Army medical facilities are being done properly. Statistics showed staff at Madigan Medical Center on JBLM had reversed the PTSD diagnoses of 40% of the troops they'd evaluated, according to Sen. Patty Murray, Washington-D, who raised the issue at a hearing on Capitol Hill. -- The Army is conducting "a wholesale re-examination" of soldiers whose post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis was reversed by the military hospital at Joint Base Lewis McCord, Army Sec. He said the Army Surgeon General, Lt. Gen. Patricia Horoho, immediately asked the unit at JBLM that was evaluating PTSD cases to step down and the reversed diagnoses are being re-examined. Some concerned soldiers said the JBLM re-evaluation was based on the extraordinary cost of potential lifetime care for a soldier diagnosed with PTSD.
