A small passenger plane crashed in the mountains of western Nepal, killing all 18 people on board, authorities said Monday. "Police have reached the crash site and no survivors have been found," said Bam Bahadur Bhandari, regional police chief of Pokhara. "The aircraft seems to have hit a mountain" said Bimlesh Karna, deputy director of Nepal's civil aviation authority. The Twin Otter aircraft left Sunday afternoon from the tourist town of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu. The crash has once again raised concern over Nepal's air safety record.
