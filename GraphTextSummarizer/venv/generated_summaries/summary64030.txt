"All of (Beyonce's) previous albums were released on a Tuesday, the traditional day when albums are released each week," he writes. " Claire Suddath from Bloomberg Businessweek wrote, "The mechanics and philosophy behind the star's album release aren't groundbreaking" given that acts such as Radiohead have released albums with only a few days' notice while David Bowie quietly released his first album in a decade via his website. Her most successful first week performance so far was her second album, "B'Day," which debuted at No. 1 with 541,000 sold in 2006, according to SoundScan. "Firstly, the fact that she recorded and then released it completely unbeknownst to everyone means that the reception it'll receive is going to be even more jubilant, more outrageous than it would've been, which is actually hard to imagine given the veracity and enthusiasm of Beyonce fans to begin with," writes Dale Neuringer of the site Bustle. Billboard's Keith Caulfield notes such sales are a huge achievement given that the album has only been available for a few days.
