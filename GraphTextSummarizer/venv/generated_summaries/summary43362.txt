Jerome David Salinger was born January 1, 1919, in New York City, the son of Sol -- a wealthy meat importer -- and Miriam Salinger. -- J.D. Salinger, the famously reclusive author whose 1951 novel, "The Catcher in the Rye," became a touchstone for generations of readers, has died. Thursday's statement from Salinger's literary agent acknowledged the writer's isolation. "The family asks that people's respect for him, his work, and his privacy be extended to them, individually and collectively, during this time." Though he wrote more than 30 short stories and a handful of novellas -- many published in The New Yorker and collected in works such as "Nine Stories" and "Seymour: An Introduction" -- Salinger's fame rests on "Catcher," his only novel. Salinger's daughter, Margaret, wrote a memoir, "Dream Catcher," which was published in 2000.
