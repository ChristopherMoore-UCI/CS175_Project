-- A brown bear and her cub mauled a group of teenage boys deep in the Alaskan wilderness, forcing rescuers to scramble early Sunday to help the injured. A man was killed weeks earlier in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park. Megan Peters, a spokeswoman for the state police, said those four are in critical condition, while three others had minor injuries or exposure-related issues. Two of the teens, participating in a survival skills course, suffered life-threatening injuries, Alaska State Troopers said in a press release, and two had injuries that were labeled "serious, but non-life-threatening." The rescuers then determined that two of the victims were too hurt to be safely transported by the helicopter for medical aid.
