Oculus has drummed up more than $90 million in funding and, in August, brought in legendary gaming developer John Carmack, the lead programmer behind classic games like "Doom," "Quake" and "Wolfenstein 3D," as chief technology officer. The system, announced Tuesday at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, joins Oculus Rift, a similar full-immersion VR system that has captured the imaginations of gamers since its $2.4 million debut on Kickstarter in 2012. "Oculus is still in a great position with its head start in development, both in hardware and software," Hsu said. Despite a multitude of other dramatic changes through the decades, the way console gamers have interacted with visuals has remained virtually  unchanged. It all raises the question of whether top-tier game developers will be willing to make the considerable investment of time and resources it will take to create games for a new, untested system that will only be owned by some gamers who own one particular console.
