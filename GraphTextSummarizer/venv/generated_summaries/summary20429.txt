" David Bushman, a curator with The Paley Center for Media in New York City, said the amount of programming is to be expected, given the magnitude of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. "It's such a major event and story in our history that it's very hard to ignore it and seem relevant," he said. The show was inspired by the events of 9/11 and followed the lives of New York City firefighters. The programs seemingly cover every aspect, from Animal Planet's "Saved," about how the bonds with their pets helped two New York City families cope with 9/11, to Paul McCartney's documentary "The Love We Make," about the benefit concert he organized after the tragedy. Anniversaries have always been important culturally, he said, and he points to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, which famously celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World. The National Geographic Channel will feature a week of programming starting August 28, including an exclusive sit-down with former President George W. Bush, who was in office on 9/11.
