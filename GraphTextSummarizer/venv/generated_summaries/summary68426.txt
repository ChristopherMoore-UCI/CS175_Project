CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reported from Jordan and Ben Brumfield wrote this report from Atlanta. The planes overflew the slain 27-year-old lieutenant's home in the village of Ay in Karak governorate, saluting him, as they returned from the fresh bombing operation named after him -- "Moath the Martyr." Since ISIS announced it burned a captured Jordanian pilot to death, his country has mourned him as a martyr, but his family has mourned him as a son, a cousin. The King said he'd bombard ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria, al-Kasasbeh said. The King confirmed his promise to al-Kasasbeh's family with the thunder of fighter jets over their heads.
