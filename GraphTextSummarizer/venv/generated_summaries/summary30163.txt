Guevara was born in Argentina in 1928 and met Castro in 1955 in Mexico City, where he was plotting his return to Cuba to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. Some of Guevara's other diaries have been commercially successful, most notably "The Motorcycle Diaries," the memoir of a 23-year-old medical student on a road trip in Latin America. "Diary of a Combatant" recounts Guevara's experiences after coming ashore in Cuba on December 2, 1956, until shortly before the rebels declared victory on January 1, 1959. During the guerrilla fighting in the mountains, Guevara was the first subordinate to be promoted to the rank of "comandante" by Castro. -- More than 50 years after the fact, Cuba has published the diary that Ernesto "Che" Guevara kept during the armed struggle he waged alongside Fidel Castro from the Sierra Maestra mountains.
