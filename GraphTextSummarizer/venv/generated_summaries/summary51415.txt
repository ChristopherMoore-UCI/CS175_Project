-- FBI Director Robert Mueller pointed Monday to recent terror attacks in Mumbai, India, and Somalia to highlight the FBI's concern that small groups or individuals could carry out such attacks on U.S. soil. FBI Director Robert Mueller says he worries the Mumbai attack could be replicated in the United States. "This type of attack reminds us that terrorists with large agendas and little money can use rudimentary weapons to maximize their impact. Mueller cited the first-ever suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen last October. The idea that Shirwa Ahmed, 27, was radicalized in the United States raised red flags throughout the FBI.
