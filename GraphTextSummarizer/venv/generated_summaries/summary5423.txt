House Speaker John Boehner said President Barack Obama could get "burned" if he uses executive action to help undocumented immigrants. Advocates of immigration reform want the president to provide deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants since Congress has so far failed to pass a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws. In a November poll by Latino Decisions, two-thirds of Latino voters said immigration was either the most important or one of the most important issues driving their vote this year and 60 percent of Latino registered voters who were not planning to vote said the delay in executive action made them less enthusiastic about the president and the Democratic Party. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, long an outspoken advocate for executive action,has already set up a "Getting Ready for Administrative Action" website with advice to help prepare undocumented immigrants for the president's announcement. And at least one former top Obama adviser urged the President to hold off on executive action in exchange for an up or down vote in the House.
