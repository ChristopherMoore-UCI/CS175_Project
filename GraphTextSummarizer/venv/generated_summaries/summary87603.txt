The border region is key for anti-terrorism efforts and the U.S. military has been working with both Pakistan and Afghanistan as part of a crackdown against militants along the border, with U.S. troops operating on the Afghanistan side, the defense official said. He said it would be "next to impossible for a group of people to enter Pakistan to chase al Qaeda and Taliban militants." According to that book, by the end of a 2009 strategy review, Obama concluded that the task in Afghanistan could not succeed without wiping out al Qaeda and Afghan Taliban havens operating with impunity in the border tribal areas of Pakistan, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. The CIA created and controls a paramilitary force of 3,000 Afghans that conducts clandestine missions targeting al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Pakistan, a U.S. official told CNN on Wednesday. "We are constantly in contact with our allies in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as our U.S. inter-agency partners," the official said.
