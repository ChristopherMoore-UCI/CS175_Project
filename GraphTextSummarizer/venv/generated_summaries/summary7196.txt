And last month, Boko Haram militants kidnapped 80 people in northern Cameroon, Said Abdulkarim, a journalist for the state broadcaster, told CNN. Nouma said his forces squared off Monday with Boko Haram fighters and beat them decisively. Authorities in the landlocked African nation of Niger have arrested 160 suspected Boko Haram militants allegedly involved in deadly attacks near that country's border with Nigeria, a national police spokesman said Tuesday. Those taken into custody include Kaka Bunu, who police spokesman Adil Doro said was "involved in the recruitment of (Boko Haram) members." Cameroon, meanwhile, is holding hundreds of suspected Boko Haram militants in prisons in its Far North Region.
