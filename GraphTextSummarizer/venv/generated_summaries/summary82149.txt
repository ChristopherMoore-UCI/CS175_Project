Dotcom holds a German passport and two Finnish passports, under the names of Kim Tim Jim Vestor and Kim Dotcom. " In addition, Dotcom "is entitled to hold both his German passport and his Dotcom Finnish passport," he said. Under one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever, the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to have Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, and three co-workers extradited to face charges including conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit copyright infringement. Last month, U.S. authorities shut down Megaupload's websites and announced indictments against Dotcom and six other people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an "international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works. But on Wednesday, District Judge N.R. Dawson said that "fresh and new" information had emerged since and that there was no longer "just cause" to keep Dotcom in custody, providing satisfactory bail conditions were imposed.
