These days, African fan culture gravitates towards many of them supporting European teams. Many international fans wonder why African stars would accept such conditions. The travel costs are also very expensive and sometimes connections between African countries are easier with a stopover in Europe. So much so, that the English Premier League means much more to African fans than AFCON. African football, therefore, has a real struggle competing against the major European leagues, with Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar now the true idols of African fans.
