The European Footballer of the Year has been constantly linked with a transfer to the Bernabeu, speculation which increased following recent claims that Real had reached an agreement with United over his eventual sale. " Ronaldo was widely quoted during a turbulent summer that he was keen to play for Real and it appeared only a matter of time before the move became a reality, but now the 23-year-old is pledging loyalty to the Old Trafford faithful. Ronaldo is crucial to their continued success and he used the interview to pay tribute to the role manager Alex Ferguson has played in his development into a world class player.
