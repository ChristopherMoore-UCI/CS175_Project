" Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University, pointed to Social Security, Medicare and key pieces of civil rights legislation that were opposed by many, including conservatives, but passed anyway because of support from members of both parties. "You can go through history and there has been bipartisan support for bad things," said Curtis Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University. "A lot of unfortunate things have been passed because both parties can get swept up in the fear and urgency of the moment and nobody's willing to or brave enough to stand up and say this is wrong," said James N. Gregory, a history professor at the University of Washington. Another example of bipartisan acquiesce was in civil rights. "In wartime, you know, that was clearly unjustified and clearly a basic violation of everything we stand for in terms of human rights," Gans said.
