Get her look Makeup To create Adams's smoky eyes, makeup artist Molly R. Stern pressed Shu Uemura in AI ($20; shuuemura-usa.com) on the eyelids. I love Jo Malone's scents -- the Nectarine Blossom & Honey, the French Lime Blossom, and the Orange Blossom. Hair To build Breck Girl bouncy waves, hairstylist Andy LeCompte set Adams's hair in pin curls for 20 minutes after winding 2-inch sections around a curling iron. She applied beige lip pencil and finished with a slick of Cover Girl Wetslicks Fruit Spritzers in Guava Splash ($6; drugstore.com). I got a callback, and a producer said he'd like to see me with more makeup.
