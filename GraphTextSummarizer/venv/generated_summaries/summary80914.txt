As with Twitter, Vine users can create and search hashtags (#CNN, #news, #tech, for instance) to share posts with a wider audience or find lots of content about the same subject. Amid concerns over adult content popping up on its new Vine video app, Twitter appeared Tuesday to have restricted how users can share sexually explicit clips. On Tuesday, there were still some workaround-style hashtags on Vine with which users were sharing adult videos. Rolled out last Thursday, Vine is a mobile app that lets users create six-second video clips and share them through the app, on Twitter, or both. While Vine has already been used to post some creative videos, like virtually any Web tool that allows user-created content it has also been used for the mass display of naughty bits.
