The result leaves Kenya bottom of Group A, with Canada one place above them in seventh after picking up their first points of the tournament. Canada responded superbly though, and a fourth-wicket stand of 132 runs between captain Ashish Bagai and Jimmy Hansra helped them towards their triumph. Meanwhile, England were hit with an injury blow after it was announced that key batsman Kevin Pietersen will miss the rest of the tournament. The match in the Indian capital of Delhi was between two nations searching for their first victory of the tournament, and it was Pubudu Dassanayake's Canada who came out on top after they reached a target of 199 with 27 balls to spare. Canada's next match is against New Zealand, who are currently fourth in Group A with four points, on March 13.
