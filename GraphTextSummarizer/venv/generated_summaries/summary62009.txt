Albino whales are rare and Migaloo is one of only a small handful of documented all-white humpback adults, according to Oskar Peterson, who runs a website that tracks sightings of white whales around the globe. Migaloo passed by Cronulla in Sydney's south on Thursday afternoon and would soon be seen by whale watchers at Bondi Beach, Peterson said. "We have photos of a junior Migaloo from a few years ago, but we haven't seen him since so we don't know if he survived the South Ocean," said Peterson. " But whale watchers may be able to enjoy Migaloo for decades. "The helicopter crews are all out photographing him today," said Oskar Peterson.
