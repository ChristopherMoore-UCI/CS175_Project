Family members said a man, woman and their adult son died in the fire, according to CNN affiliate WATE. Dangerously cold conditions continue to grip a large part of the Eastern United States, CNN meteorologists said, with more than 125 million Americans under a wind chill warning or advisory. Other people in Tennessee died from hypothermia and in auto accidents, WATE said, and a dialysis patient died after he was unable to get treatment because of weather. Three of those people died in a fire in Knox County, Tennessee emergency management officials said. More than 2,700 people are without power as more severe cold, freezing rain and snow are predicted for the next few days, Tennessee officials said.
