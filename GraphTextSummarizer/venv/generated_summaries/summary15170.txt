A month after being released to mostly positive reviews, Samsung's flagship phone is getting some validation from Consumer Reports. Consumer reports bases its ratings on a number of extensive tests and rates the devices in categories including ease of use, display and voice quality, portability and battery life. The publication said the device's camera was "among the best phone cameras for photo quality." The Galaxy S4 is an update to Samsung's wildly popular S3 phone, which was one of the best selling smartphones of the past year. The abundance of features were seen as appealing to more advanced users without complicating the phone for more entry-level users. Samsung was the leader in the smartphone market in in the first quarter of 2013, according to research firm IDC, and it looks like its latest offering will help it hang on to that top spot for the time being.
