"We express our deepest condolences to everyone who have been affected by this senseless act of violence," said Walmart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan. "I am devastated by the news today of two officers and an innocent bystander who were murdered in an act of senseless violence," added Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police spokeswoman Laura Meltzer says the attackers -- one male and one female -- opened fire inside of a CiCi's Pizza location at 11:30 a.m, killing the officers as they ate lunch, she said. "This was a senseless and cruel act killing three innocent people, two who dedicated their lives to protecting all of us in our community and one who was innocently going about her daily life" said Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman. "We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and our hearts go out to the families and friends of the officers," said Geoff Goodman of CiCi's.
