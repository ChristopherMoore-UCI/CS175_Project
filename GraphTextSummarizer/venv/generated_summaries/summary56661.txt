"We found all kinds of really exciting things," says expedition leader Piotr Naskrecki, associate director of the soon-to-open Biodiversity Laboratory in Gorongosa. All this indicates that Gorongosa National Park is successfully recovering from the damage caused by the 17 years of civil war, which left many of its species decimated. Sitting at the southernmost tip of the Great Rift Valley, Gorongosa used to be one of Africa's richest wildlife refuges, a natural wonderland teeming with large populations of buffalo, lions, elephants and hippos. In mid-April, a team of 15 local and international scientists ventured into the park's spectacular rolling woodlands, deep gorges and riverine forests to conduct the first comprehensive biodiversity survey in a remote and largely unexplored area that was ravaged by years of war and poaching. "We've at least doubled the number of species that is known from the national park, probably closer to tripling it," he adds.
