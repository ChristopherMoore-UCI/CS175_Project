Houston belted out chorus after chorus on hit after hit, demonstrating white-knuckled control over this parameter of her "singer's toolbox" with an aplomb that seemed unfair to lesser vocalists. Houston became a pop star the old fashioned way -- not through a virile YouTube video or as a contestant on "American Idol." So what made "The Voice" so glorious in the transcendent musicianship that Houston displayed in her recordings and concerts? Sent by my 25-year-old daughter, the announcement shocked me but soon triggered fond memories of the days when she and her younger sister would belt out Houston's latest hit along with the radio. Beyond the gift of her instrument, Houston's musicianship comprised an uncanny way of handling the material she was given with such expertise and attention to detail that the songs became hers and hers alone.
