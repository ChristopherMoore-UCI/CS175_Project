While all those gestures are thoughtful, the results of a new survey led by sex and relationships researcher Kristen Mark and the experts at Good in Bed suggest that most couples have something a little more intimate in mind. "I advise some of my clients feeling anxious about the holiday to get together with people they love, like close friends or family members, with whom they have formed positive and supportive relationships," advises psychotherapist Allison M. Lloyds. While flowers, chocolate and lingerie still top the list in gifts, 30% of people plan on a more specifically sex-oriented gift on Valentine's Day, says Mark. To learn more about the way both couples and single people feel about the holiday, Mark and her colleagues polled more than 2,000 men and women between age 18 and 70, 66% of whom were in long-term committed relationships. "Yet only a small amount of scientific literature has been dedicated to the attitudes, perceptions and participation in Valentine's Day celebrations."
