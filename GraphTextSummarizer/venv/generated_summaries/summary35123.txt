Players act as techno-agents -- with super-charged chips designed to make them incredible warriors This DART-6 chip technology is implanted in the brain of your character, Miles Kilo. Kilo also gets upgrades by stealing important chips from other people's skulls. These upgrades add to Kilo's health and recharge his power, shields and other skills and tools you'll need to complete your missions. The "suicide" ability causes a brain chip to explode, possibly injuring surrounding people. This version drops you into a future where corporations, not countries, control the world, and most of Earth's population has been implanted with chips in their brains.
