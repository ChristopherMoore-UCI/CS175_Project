Japanese naval authorities spotted two Chinese patrol boats late Sunday near islands that have been at the center of recent diplomatic tensions, Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported Monday. The Japanese government lodged a protest with the Chinese government Monday about the alleged presence of Chinese patrol boats near disputed territory, according to Japanese media. But Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku said in the protest message to China that seeing Chinese patrol boats made his government feel "uncomfortable," according to Kyodo. Anti-Japan protesters in China turned violent over a week ago, vandalizing Japanese businesses and cars. The boats were in Japan's "contiguous zone" but did not cross into Japanese territorial waters, Kyodo reported, sourcing Japan's coast guard.
