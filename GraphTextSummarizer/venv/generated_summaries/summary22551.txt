Liu said she received a call from mall security advising store employees to lock store doors for their own safety. Every shopper's nightmare was lived out on Thursday when a horde of rowdy teens stampeded through a New York mall -- screaming, wreaking havoc and banging on shop doors. Police arrived after mall security called for backup at around 9 p.m., said a New York police spokesman. Police were reviewing mall security video as part of their investigation. The rambunctious crowd turned what is usually a quiet mall into a terrifying place, said mall employee Charmaine Chen.
