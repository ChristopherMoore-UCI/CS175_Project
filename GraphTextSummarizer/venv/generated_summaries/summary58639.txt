" And when one reporter reeled off a long list of questions, Obama jabbed with a smile "do I have to write all these down?" Often in presidential news conferences. Underlying Obama's message was a clear and deliberate attempt to lift the country's mood after a six-year trudge back from the worst economic slump since the 1930s and with American power assailed as never before by rising states, stubborn foes and terror groups abroad. 'We are better positioned than we have been for a very long time," said Obama who has for years been reluctant to publicly tout his achievements on the economy because the recovery has been uneven and so many Americans have been left behind. The GOP contends that much of what Obama has done by wielding his executive power in recent months is illegal and flouts the Constitution, and has left the United States less safe at home and abroad. Obama opened the 50-minute session with a 'Morning in America" moment -- making his most explicit case yet that his leadership has led the nation out of the darkness of economic pain to sunnier times.
