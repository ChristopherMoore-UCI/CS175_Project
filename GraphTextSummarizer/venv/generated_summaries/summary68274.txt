"You can hardly put into words how important the work Dori and the Maynard Institute did to train young people of color for careers in journalism and how the institute trained the media to write fair stories about communities of color," wrote Bob Butler, a San Francisco radio reporter and the president of the National Association of Black Journalists, in a comment on the Maynard Institute's website. Dori J. Maynard, who as president of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education was dedicated to expanding diversity in newsrooms and excellence in journalism, died Tuesday, according to a statement on the institute's website. The Maynard Institute had a variety of programs to address these issues, including a "diversity framework that looks at diversity through the prisms of race, class, gender, generation, and geography," she told Harvard's Shorenstein Center. "She's the kind of person who understood how this idea of diversity was so vital today and continues to be vital and needed to change from our old ways of thinking of what that meant and how to implement it in the production of news and the way we think about news," longtime friend Sally Lehrman told the Oakland Tribune. But it was as the head of the Oakland-based Maynard Institute -- co-founded by her father, a longtime journalist who became the first African-American to own a major metropolitan newspaper -- that she had the greatest impact, colleagues said.
