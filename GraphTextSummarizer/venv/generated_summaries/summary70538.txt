Authorities said marshals and Fulton County police arrested the suspect at Lenox Mall in the Buckhead community of Atlanta, about 25 miles from the church. The man suspected of killing one person at the World Changers Church International in suburban Atlanta was arrested Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Marshals said. Dollar has built an international religious empire, with broadcasts of his sermons beamed worldwide and speaking engagements in Europe. Since he started his ministry in an elementary school cafeteria in 1986, Dollar has earned praise and criticism. The golden-domed megachurch, which claims about 30,000 members, is led by well-known prosperity minister Creflo Dollar.
