Defending Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic and six-time winner Roger Federer will meet in the last four after both came through quarterfinal matches with comfortable straight sets victories Wednesday. World No. 4 Murray kept fans on Centre Court on tenterhooks for nearly four hours before he got past Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer. Djokovic has beaten Federer in their last three meetings, but the Swiss maestro was even more impressive in seeing off Youzhny on Centre Court, never allowing his opponent the chance to get a foothold in the match. World number one Djokovic had reached this stage of a grand slam for the ninth successive time, with only Federer, Rod Laver and Ivan Lendl surpassing that record. After dropping the second set, Tsonga, who beat Federer in the quarterfinals last year, emerged a 7-6 4-6 7-6 6-2 winner.
