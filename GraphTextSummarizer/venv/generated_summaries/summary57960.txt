Both the House and Senate bills would permit the creation of nonprofit private insurance cooperatives to increase competition. In place of a public option, the Senate bill includes a provision allowing private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage overseen by a government agency. "We want a public option to do basically three things: create more choice for insurers, create more competition for insurance companies and to contain costs," Clyburn said on the CBS program "Face the Nation." Supporters of a public option say it would provide nonprofit competition to private insurers that would bring down costs, but opponents contend that it is the first step toward a government takeover of the health care system. The House bill contains the public option as a competitor to private insurers in a national heath insurance exchange open to people now unable to get coverage, but the Senate version lacks a public option.
