Sri Lankan soldiers patrol the frontline on the Jaffna peninsula, the scene of fierce fighting. Until Wednesday, the heavy fighting had remained focused in the western coastal town of Mannar and the northeastern coastal area of Weli Oya. Their ultimate aim was to reach Kilinochchi -- the power center of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil, better known as the Tamil Tigers. The village is on a thin isthmus linking mainland Sri Lanka to the Jaffna peninsula. -- More than 100 Sri Lankan soldiers were killed and another 400 wounded Wednesday when troops attempted to advance toward a stronghold of the Tamil Tigers rebel organization, highly placed army sources told CNN.
