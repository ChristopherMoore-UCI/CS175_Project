Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Brown University and the Planetary Sciences Institute say they may have found the answer: It's been "effectively painted black," in the words of Megan Bruck Syal, a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore. People spend more time on Google searching for Queen singer Freddy Mercury than planet Mercury ... and Freddie's been gone for nearly a quarter-century. "We show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent," said Peter Schultz, a professor emeritus of geological sciences at Brown University. Over the eons, the researchers argue in a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, microscopic meteorites spawned from carbon-rich comets may have contributed enough dark-hued carbon to reduce the amount of reflected light. As planets go, Mercury doesn't get a lot of love.
