The French foreign minister said on his blog Wednesday that several Arab countries would be willing to participate in a targeted attack on Gadhafi's air assets. Gadhafi's battles to recapture a number of rebel-held towns and cities come on the day the United Nations Security Council considered imposing a no-fly zone over Libya. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said late Wednesday that envoys were considering a variety of options to protect civilians in Libya, not just a no-fly zone or a cease fire. Libya's deputy ambassador to the U.N. expressed this fear Wednesday. Wednesday ended with no agreement on a draft resolution, but several diplomats expressed optimism that a vote would come soon.
