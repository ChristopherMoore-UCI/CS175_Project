The moves come amid an ongoing shakeup in the government, which is under pressure to speed up the pace of reform since President Hosni Mubarak resigned on February 11 after protests. Sharaf appointed Hazem El-Beblawi, a newly-named deputy prime minister, to replace outgoing Finance Minister Samir Radwan, said ministry spokesman Ibtisam Saad. -- Egyptian Prime Minister Esam Sharaf shuffled his Cabinet Sunday, amid protests calling for the interim government to quicken the pace of reform. Several people working within the current government have been criticized for allegedly being too close to the former leader and those who helped suppress demonstrations last winter. The prime minister accepted the resignation of Industry Minister Samir Al-Sayyad, according to Ahmed Saman, spokesman for Sharaf.
