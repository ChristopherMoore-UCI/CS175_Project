Betting exchanges that take novelty bets are nothing new -- Paddy Power has a long-running book on whether it will snow on Christmas Day and the next pope -- but what makes Long Bets different is that it will only accept bets that advance our understanding of science and the future. Novelty bets Thanks to websites like Longbets.org and professional gaming sites like Paddy Power, oddball bets on everything from the next pope to the life expectancy of the universe have a running book. In the case of its current highest profile bet -- a million dollar bet between billionaire investor Warren Buffett and alternative investment group ProtÃ©gÃ© Partners, LLC - the two parties had already agreed the terms and had come to Long Bets to find a platform for the wager. Predicting the future So far, Long Bets has taken long-term bets on whether drones will do battle as part of protests, whether commercial flights will become pilotless and on the future of level of the world's population. For mainstream punters, meanwhile, betting exchanges like Paddy Power have been taking novelty bets on everything from the next pope - more than Â£300,000 ($450,000) was placed after Pope Benedict's resignation -- to parents betting on their sons becoming soccer World Cup football captains.
