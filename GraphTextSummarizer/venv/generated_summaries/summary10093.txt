The telecast featured the usual "In Memoriam" slideshow, plus five break-out tributes scattered throughout the evening honoring talents such as James Gandolfini, Jonathan Winters and â€” most controversially â€” Glee co-star Cory Monteith. -- "Modern Family creator" Steve Levitan said Sunday night's Emmys were a buzz-kill due to producers over-stuffing the ceremony with tributes to fallen celebrities. Poor Neil Patrick Harris, who was so brilliant, had to keep digging himself out of the holes dug by these sad moments, time and time again. Levitan first made a reference to the ceremony being the "saddest Emmys of all time" while on stage to pick up his award for Modern Family winning best comedy series. Later he told EW the endless tributes dragged down the emotional flow of the show â€” particularly for host Neil Patrick Harris.
