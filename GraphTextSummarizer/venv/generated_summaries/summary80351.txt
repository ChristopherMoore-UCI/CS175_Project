This move allows Apple to continue to avoid offering a netbook, which is wise, because an Apple netbook would have cannibalized MacBook sales, according to ThinkPanmure analyst Vijay Rakesh. According to Tim Bajarin, principal analyst with Creative Strategies, Apple's new pricing for its MacBook line and the price drop on its lightweight MacBook Air will not compromise much on its profit margins. Thus, Apple's MacBook price cuts are a strategic move to reclaim growth while the netbook market is shrinking. Regardless, Apple's MacBook price tags are still well above the cost of the average notebook -- $860 in the United States, according to Shim. The pseudo reality-TV commercials denounce Apple computers as too expensive and even implies Mac users are simple-minded snobs who buy gadgets as a fashion statement.
