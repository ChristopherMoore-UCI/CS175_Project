The decision was "left for as long as possible in the sincere hope that ongoing events -- resulting from recent unrest in the Kingdom of Bahrain -- might have improved, leaving me able to join the celebrations of the House of Windsor and the family of Miss Middleton, without being overshadowed by issues in Bahrain," Al-Khalifa wrote. Al-Khalifa ended his note to the British royals by wishing "Prince William and Miss Middleton all good wishes for Friday and every possible happiness for the future ahead." Prince William is set to marry Kate Middleton on Friday. Bahrain, where the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet anchors, is a small, predominantly Shiite country governed by a Sunni royal family. -- Bahrain's Prince Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa has decided to decline an invitation to the royal wedding in London, citing the unrest in his country.
