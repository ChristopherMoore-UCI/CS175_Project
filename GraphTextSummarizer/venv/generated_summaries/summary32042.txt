Did these people -- faced with their own mortality -- express their disappointment over not putting in more hours at work? (Which is tempered slightly by my mother's Italian culture that emphasizes enjoying life.) I think it's best put by a famous line from the movie, "Inception": "Do you want to take a leap of faith, or become an old man [or old woman], filled with regret, waiting to die alone? Did they lament over work-related e-mails they wished they had answered or express remorse over business meetings they missed attending? More work, more e-mails, more meetings?
