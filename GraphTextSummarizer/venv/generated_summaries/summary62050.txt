Israeli police struggle to remove Jewish settlers from a disputed house in Hebron on Thursday. Ambulance services reported 20 people -- settlers and Israeli security forces -- were injured in the struggle, none seriously. The latest round of violence comes hours after Israeli police and military forcibly removed a group of settlers from a disputed home in Hebron. Hollander noted that there is a small group of settler extremists who do not abide by Israeli law nor the council's demands. A line of Israeli forces stood outside the disputed home on Thursday, as specially trained Israeli police pulled the settlers out of the home, according to Israeli military spokesman Maj.
