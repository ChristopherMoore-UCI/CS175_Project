The attacks in Gori, about 50 miles northwest of the capital Tbilisi, occurred before Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced a plan late in the day for ending the conflict in Georgia. A woman who lives in the building was in tears as she showed a CNN crew pieces of what she said were Russian military munitions. Rockets made craters in Gori's central square, shop windows were blown out from the force of explosions, and many storefronts were pocked by bullet holes, CNN Producer Mike Sefanov said. He added that Russian troops entered the conflict last week, because "it was crucial to weaken the military potential of the aggressor, so that it could never think about repetition of this. Although Georgian officials and witnesses said Russian jets shelled parts of the city Tuesday morning, a Russian general denied it.
