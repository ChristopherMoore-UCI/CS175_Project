"But her real break came with Harry Belafonte's 'Strolling '20s,'" Allen said, referring to the 1966 television special that included Duke Ellington, Sidney Poitier, Nipsey Russell, Sammy Davis Jr. and Diahann Carroll. Born in New York in 1929, she sang as a child in church, then won an amateur contest at age 15 at Harlem's Apollo Theater, said her son, P.J. Allen. Lynne was also an accomplished writer, said Allen, who cited her autobiography and said she was working on a sitcom to have been called "Bus Buddies" at the time of her death. " Though her songs were widely popular, Lynne made her living neither through her writing nor through her nearly 400 recordings, but through live performances, Allen said. " "Gloria Lynne was one of the great female jazz vocalists & lyricists of our time," said blues legend B.B. King.
