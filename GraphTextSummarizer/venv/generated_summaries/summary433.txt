European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie, second to Woods on the Old Course in 2005, also believes Woods can do a 'three-peat' at St.Andrews if he can use his new putter to good effect. " Woods won at St.Andrews in 2000 by eight shots and five in 2005 but missed the cut in last year's British Open at Turnberry. Tiger Woods will have a new putter in his hands as he bids to make golfing history by becoming the first player to win the British Open at the same venue three times in a row after earlier triumphs at St.Andrews in 2000 and 2005. The American took part in a charity pro-am event in Ireland at the beginning of last week and would normally have gone straight to St.Andrews, but instead flew home to see his two children. " Woods is without a win since his return to the circuit in April, but has finished shared fourth in both the U.S Masters and the recent U.S. Open.
