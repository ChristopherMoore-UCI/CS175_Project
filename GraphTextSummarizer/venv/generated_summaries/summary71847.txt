The crash occurred on Interstate 30 outside Sulphur Springs, and the bus driver was trying to negotiate heavy rains and winds, said Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Sylvia Jennings. -- A tour bus transporting Willie Nelson's band spun out of control in a storm and crashed into a Texas bridge pillar before dawn Saturday, injuring three of five band members, according to police and the band. The bus was swept off the road and crashed into a bridge pillar, Jennings said. Nelson's website said the band believes the accident occurred "due to icy conditions on the road." Willie Nelson and Family was scheduled to perform in Robinsonville, Mississippi, on Saturday, and in Jackson, Mississippi, on Sunday, the band's website said.
