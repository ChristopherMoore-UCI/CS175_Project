Honduras returned to democracy in January, and the newly installed government of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa bears responsibility for safeguarding civil liberties and human rights, the commission said. " Honduras' top law enforcement official said he "laments and deplores" violence that resulted from the coup that removed President Jose Manuel Zelaya from power and installed interim President Roberto Micheletti. "Any allegation of violations of human rights has to be taken very seriously, especially in a country with a history of human rights violations," Reich said. Human rights will be respected under Lobo, who was elected in November and assumed the presidency January 27, national Police Commissioner Leonel Sauceda said Monday. "People from all political sectors have the right to fully and freely exercise their right to freedom of expression and their right to assembly, without violence and in accordance with the law and with inter-American standards for the protection of human rights," the report said.
