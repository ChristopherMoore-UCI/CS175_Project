While the Italian marque's president Luca di Montezemolo was the initial leader of FOTA, since late 2009 it has been headed by McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh. Ferrari wants to work with all parties for the future of a sport that expresses the highest level of motorsport technology," the 31-time world champions said in a statement on Friday. "The team will remain committed to finding a solution regarding cost saving in Formula One." "Red Bull Racing can confirm it has served notice to withdraw from FOTA," the UK-based Austrian outfit said in a statement on Friday. "Now however, it is necessary to find some new impetus to move it along because FOTA's drive has run its course, despite the excellent work of current president Martin Whitmarsh in trying to reach agreement between the various positions for the common good."
