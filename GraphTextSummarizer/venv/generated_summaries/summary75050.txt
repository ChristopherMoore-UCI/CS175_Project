That's according to Twitter Counter, an online tool that charts the number of followers that Twitter accounts have over time.

Green's analytics didn't show any increase in Twitter mentions, retweets or other signs that typically would accompany organic growth on the site, he said. Green told Mashable, a CNN content partner, that someone else may have added fake followers in an effort to embarrass the Romney campaign. The Republican presidential nominee's account on the site, which had been gaining followers at a clip of about 3,000 to 4,000 a day, appears to have gained more than 116,000 followers Friday and another 24,000 on Saturday.
