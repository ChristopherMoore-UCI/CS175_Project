The United States is providing millions of dollars to fund the trial of Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president charged with war crimes for his alleged role in a civil war that killed tens of thousands. It's the first time an African head of state has faced mass atrocities and war crimes charges at an international tribunal. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that include five counts of crimes against humanity and five counts of war crimes. "By all calculations, the court would have run out of money by early December, which could have jeopardized the continuation of the Charles Taylor trial before the court reached a verdict," the State Department said in a news release Tuesday. Taylor is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone that led to widespread murder, rape and mutilation.
