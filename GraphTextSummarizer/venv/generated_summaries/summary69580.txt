But in the two years since latency for cancers was spelled out -- and many cases later -- Kushlefsky says, it has become "an inescapable fact that the latency period has to be wrong." Wrong, he says, because of the sheer number of oropharyngeal cancer cases he is seeing cross his desk. The minimum latency period for oropharyngeal cancers -- in other words, the minimum time period required to prove a link between exposure to toxins at ground zero and a diagnosis of that type of cancer -- is four years. (Absent this type of dramatic environmental exposure, oropharyngeal cancers in most cases take one or two decades to develop, although recent studies suggest that cases are being diagnosed at younger ages and more frequently.) A growing number are being diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer, but some -- including Meyers -- are being denied insurance coverage because their cancers were diagnosed too soon after 9/11. " Advocates for responders, including medical experts, say that they will petition the institute to amend its rules concerning coverage for oropharyngeal cancer.
