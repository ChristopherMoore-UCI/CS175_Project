-- Six people have died after a garbage truck collided with pedestrians in the center of the Scottish city of Glasgow, police confirmed Monday. Speaking to the BBC earlier Monday, Superintendent Stuart Carroll said it appeared the "bin lorry" had struck one pedestrian before going up onto the sidewalk and colliding with a number of others. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, said her thoughts were with "everyone involved in dreadful #GeorgeSquare incident." Diversions and road closures are in place and police have asked people to avoid the area. Scottish police also promised further updates in a tweet Monday.
