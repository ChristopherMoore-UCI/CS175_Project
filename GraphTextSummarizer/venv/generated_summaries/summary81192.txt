With arrow straight driving, big hitting Dustin Johnson powered his way clear of the field at the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai Friday while first round leader Rory McIlroy paid the price for wayward play from tee to green on his back nine. But coming home it all went wrong for the 24-year-old Northern Irishman -- let down by errant tee shots and approach play to give up three shots to par. McDowell, second in the European Tour's Race to Dubai, shot a second straight 69 to share fifth with England's Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, Spanish pair Sergio Garcia and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and South African great Ernie Els. "I just hit a couple of bad shots, and then I guess I let it affect me a little bit, and then I started to doubt myself sometimes," McIlroy said. Texan Johnson overpowered the Sheshan International course with a nine-under 63 to go five clear of McIlroy and fellow Americans Bubba Watson and Boo Weekley on 12-under 132 after two rounds.
