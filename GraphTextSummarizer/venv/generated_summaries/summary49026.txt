"We have done absolutely nothing for months upon months. With another investigation yielding no direct ties between Gov. Chris Christie and the George Washington Bridge scandal, critics are questioning the purpose of continuing the Democratic-led probe, when yet a third investigation — run by the U.S. Attorney's Office — is also ongoing. Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman is still conducting a federal probe into the incident, where lanes to the nation's busiest bridge were closed for alleged political reasons, causing major traffic gridlock in the town of Fort Lee, New Jersey for four days in September 2013. Former Gov. Tom Kean, a widely esteemed figure in New Jersey politics who co-chaired the commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks, is accusing the state legislative committee of partisanship and acting in a "purely political" fashion. Kean, who was once a mentor for Christie, had a falling out with the governor after Christie's re-election, and as the news about the bridge scandal made national headlines in January, Kean issued sharp criticism about the Republican governor.
