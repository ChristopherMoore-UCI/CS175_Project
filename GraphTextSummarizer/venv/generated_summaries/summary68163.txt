"While respecting the right of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, preventing access to U.N. offices hinders the vital work being carried out by the United Nations each day to help the people of Sri Lanka," U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters in New York. -- Protesters led by a Sri Lankan cabinet minister laid siege to the United Nations compound in Colombo on Tuesday, demanding that the world body drop a probe into alleged human rights abuses in the final stages of the separatist war that ended last year. Ban named a three-person advisory panel last month to look into possible human rights violations committed during the war between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Scuffles erupted Tuesday when U.N. staff tried to leave the compound. "The secretary-general remains convinced that accountability is an essential foundation for durable peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka," a statement from Ban's office said.
