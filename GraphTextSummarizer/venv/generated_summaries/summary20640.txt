He joined the Small Faces in 1965 and the band had a four-year run of hits, including "Sha La La La Lee," "All or Nothing" and "Afterglow of Your Love," the latter from their UK No. 1 album, "Ogden's Nut Gone Flake." " The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer's resume was varied and eclectic, his soulful and often joyous organ fills heard on such albums as the Stones' "Some Girls," Lucinda Williams' "Car Wheels on a Gravel Road" and John Mayer's "Battle Studies." Ian McLagan, a fun-loving keyboardist who played on records by such artists as the Rolling Stones, Lucinda Williams, Bruce Springsteen and his own bands -- the Small Faces and its successor, the Faces -- died Wednesday, according to a statement from his record label, Yep Roc Records. McLagan recorded a handful of albums on his own, including "Troublemaker" (1979), "Bump in the Night" (1980) and "United States" (2014), and in recent years led the Bump Band from his adopted hometown of Austin, Texas. When lead singer Steve Marriott left the band in 1969, the height-challenged group reformed around the much taller Rod Stewart and Ron Wood and dropped the "Small" from its name.
