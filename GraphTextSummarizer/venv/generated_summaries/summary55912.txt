After 10 years of marriage, the couple announced their separation and divorce filing on a special one-hour episode of their TLC reality series "Jon & Kate Plus 8" in June. TLC says the new show, which debuts November 2, will be "Kate Plus 8." Jon Gosselin is scheduled to appear on CNN's "Larry King Live" on Thursday to discuss his reduced role on the TLC show. "Given the recent changes in the family dynamics, it only makes sense for us to refresh and recalibrate the program to keep pace with the family," TLC President Eileen O'Neill said. -- Kate plus eight minus Jon equals TLC.
