The Kentucky-bred 3-year-old had run only a handful of races prior to Saturday, none of them on dirt. Velazquez is a racing veteran, but his best finish in 12 previous Kentucky Derby tries had been second in 2001. "This is an amazing horse, a very special horse." Two horses with much better 9-1 odds -- Nehro and Mucho Macho Man -- finished second and third, respectively. The colt's owners tapped John Velazquez to ride Animal Kingdom earlier this week, replacing jockey Robby Albarado after he got hurt while riding another horse. -- Jockeyed by a man who'd never ridden it in a race, Animal Kingdom made a late charge Saturday to win the 137th edition of the Kentucky Derby.
