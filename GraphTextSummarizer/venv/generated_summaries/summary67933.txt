-- Shortly after 10 a.m. Blair Scott sent a text to his daughter Rose, a junior at Buckhorn High School in northeast Huntsville. He was one of thousands of Americans unnerved Friday by a swath of severe weather that extended from Alabama to Indiana. Similar storms ripped through the Huntsville area about a year ago. The staff had gone into storm mode at about 8:45 in the morning, huddling the students in the safest place of all, the hallway, Scott said. Rose had even chased tornadoes with her dad -- both father and daughter are fascinated with science and meteorology.
