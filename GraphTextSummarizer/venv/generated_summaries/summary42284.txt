In his native Brazil, Neymar is being counted on to lead the South American nation to World Cup glory on home soil next year. Even after topping France, Brazil had won just two of its past seven matches and manager Luiz Felipe Scolari was being criticized for his less than free flowing style of play. Neymar, hailed as the "modern successor" to Pele, netted with a stunning half volley in the third minute to help Brazil beat Japan 3-0 in Group A. Paulinho and Jo added the other goals in the second half. Neymar gave way to Lucas in the 74th minute because of a slight injury and Brazil made it three when Jo slotted home from Oscar's pass in injury time. On Sunday, world and European champion Spain plays Uruguay in Group B and Mexico faces Italy in Group A.
