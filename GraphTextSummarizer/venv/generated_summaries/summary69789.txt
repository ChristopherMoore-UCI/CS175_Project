I believe coal mining will be with us for a very long time, considering our enormous thirst for energy and our slow transition to renewable energy. The situation here, before this disaster, had already compelled me to become an environmental activist, committed to doing everything I can to stop the destructive practice of coal extraction known as mountaintop removal. -- I am West Virginia born and raised, and I come from a long line of coal miners. My father, grandfather, brothers, husband and son-in-law either are or were coal miners. Their numbers are small and it is considered to be political suicide to do anything in West Virginia that appears to be anti-coal.
