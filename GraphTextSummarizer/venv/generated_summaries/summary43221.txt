Even though she was also an American citizen, Spear loved traveling through Venezuela and exploring the country and wanted to see the security situation improve, Rafael Spear said. Spear was Miss Venezuela in 2004 and represented her country in the Miss Universe pageant the next year. Spear, who studied theater at the University of Central Florida before winning the Miss Venezuela crown, appeared on the Telemundo soap operas "Flor Salvaje" (Savage Flower) and "Pasion Prohibida" (Forbidden Passion). -- Beauty queen Monica Spear posted scenic photos and videos of the Venezuelan countryside online in the days before her death. Police found the camera inside the home of one of seven suspects authorities have arrested in connection with the slayings, the head of Venezuela's national crime investigation agency said Thursday.
