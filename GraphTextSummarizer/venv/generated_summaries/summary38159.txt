"I wondered if I could take similar pictures of historical sites, and so through my trips all around Iran, I began to find old mosques suitable for taking interior pictures." Their fine detail has been captured in a series of breathtaking photographs by Mohammad Reza Domiri Ganji, a 24-year-old physics student from Babol, a city in Iran's northern Mazandaran province. Ganji says his project to document mosque interiors and other Iranian landmarks began in 2008 after he was inspired by images taken inside Egypt's pyramids. Ganji uses fisheye and other wide angle lenses and panoramic tripods to create his photos, sometimes digitally stitching several images to create composites. " Ganji says he prefers capturing the interiors of mosques with symmetry, interior columns, good lighting and beautiful mosaics.
