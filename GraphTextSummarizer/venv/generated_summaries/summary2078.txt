-- A man and woman pleaded guilty to participating in a Romania-based Internet car sales scam that cost U.S. victims more than $4 million, federal prosecutors said Friday. Corneliu Weikum, 38, a Romanian national who lives in Germany, and Yulia Mishina-Heffron, 24, of Russia, entered the pleas Thursday in Las Vegas, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, which helped prosecute the case. "After negotiating with members of the conspiracy in Romania, victims of the scam were instructed to deposit the money for the cars into bank accounts established at the direction of Weikum and Mishina-Heffron," according to the statement. According to prosecutors, more than $1 million was seized in October 2009 from Weikum's luggage at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. "Associates withdrew the money and gave it to Weikum and Mishina-Heffron, who would then smuggle the money out of the United States in the form of cash and wire transfers."
