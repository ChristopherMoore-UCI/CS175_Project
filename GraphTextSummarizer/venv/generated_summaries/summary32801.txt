MacFarlane-Barrow: Many new people have made contact with us from all over the world, wanting to be part of Mary's Meals, wanting to help us provide daily meals for children in schools. Because of that, we are trying desperately to expand our program to reach more children at risk, and we will do that as funds allow us to. We have a real crisis, a real situation of life and death facing those people and children. Berger: As someone who works every day to save impoverished children, how does a situation like this make you feel? In (Malawi and Liberia), we are rolling out a program in primary schools to reach hundreds of thousands more children.
