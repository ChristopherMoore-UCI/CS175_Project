Popovich found out through San Antonio Stars head coach Dan Hughes that Hammon was interested in coaching. In what many sports fans view as a historic move, the reigning NBA champion San Antonio Spurs announced the hiring of Becky Hammon as assistant coach. "I very much look forward to the addition of Becky Hammon to our staff," Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich said. "I'm just incredibly grateful, obviously, to the Spurs organization and Coach Pop and (Spurs General Manager R.C. Buford)," Hammon said. That led to Hammon spending time with Popovich and the rest of the Spurs team at practices, and a feature on "NBA Inside Stuff."
