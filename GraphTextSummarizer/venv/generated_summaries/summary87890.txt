Coneys had spent much of his youth studying dance and teaching himself to do gymnastic tumbling moves before taking martial arts lessons aged 16 -- ultimately earning a first degree black belt in taekwondo. "I'll watch gymnastics, I'll watch martial arts movies or competitions, I'll watch dancing, even drawing and art and other artistic forms of expression. Bratter -- a veteran tricker in his own right, who has been competing since tricking's early days in sport karate tournaments -- says the incredible growth in popularity owes a lot to YouTube, where videos of popular trickers have accumulated hundred of thousands of views. "I pick up moves from action sports like skateboarding or bmx or motocross, and I'll start to break it down and change it into something I can do, on gymfloor or on grass, and put it in a different format for tricking." This is "tricking" -- a lightning-fast mix of martial arts, gymnastics and breakdancing that has spent 20 years quietly spreading across gymnasium floors and internet video sites, but is now set to burst out.
