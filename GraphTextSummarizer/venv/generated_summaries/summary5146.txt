How Apple snookered Proview to get iPad trademark "Using shell companies is not uncommon but usually the conduct is honest," Ma said. But Apple dropping iPad name also could be bad for Proview -- or, more exactly, Proview's creditors. Round two is scheduled Wednesday as the Guangdong Higher People's Court is expected to hear an appeal of a lower court decision in favor of Proview Technology Shenzhen, a company which trademarked the IPAD name in China in 2000 -- 10 years before Apple's iPad hit global stores. Proview refuses to honor their agreement with Apple in China and a Hong Kong court has sided with Apple in this matter. Apple could throw up its hands and decide to rename the tablet in China, but Proview could still sue for damages on past use of its trademarked name, Wong said.
