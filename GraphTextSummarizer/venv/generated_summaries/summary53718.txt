A 51-year-old private security guard was arrested Monday night in Los Angeles and booked for grand theft, according to Culver City Police Lt. Ron Iizuka. Both as a solo artist and leader of the Heartbreakers, Petty is one of America's top recording artists, selling more than 57 million albums, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. -- Classic rockers Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were thrilled to get back five guitars stolen less than a week before the start of an international tour. The instruments were stolen late last week from a soundstage where the Heartbreakers were rehearsing for their tour, which is set to start Wednesday in Broomfield, Colorado. "Sometimes people make mistakes, but we'd like these back," Petty said on his Twitter account Friday.
