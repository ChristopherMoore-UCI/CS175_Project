But historical circumstances won't permit Obama to push through his own Great Society, Weisbrot says. A scholar says President Obama could learn from Lyndon Johnson's Great Society mistakes. Robert Weisbrot, co-author of "The Liberal Hour: Washington and the Politics of Change in the 1960s,'' says the Great Society revolution was "tremendously liberating" for members of the most vulnerable groups in America. The Great Society was President Lyndon Johnson's sprawling legislative attempts in the mid-1960s to lift Americans out of poverty, erase racial injustice and clean up the environment. He says Johnson framed the Great Society as a war to defeat poverty and racial injustice.
