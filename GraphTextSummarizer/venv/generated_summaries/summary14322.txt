Indian officials will hope the Mumbai venue does not have the same problems as Kolkata's Eden Gardens, which was stripped of a World Cup match after it failed an inspection by the International Cricket Council due to a delay in construction work. Wankhede Stadium will stage two Group A matches next month, with New Zealand playing Canada on March 13 and the Kiwis again facing Sri Lanka five days later. India is co-hosting the four-yearly tournament along with sub-continent neighbors Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, with the opening match taking place in Dhaka on Saturday. Lalchand Rajput, joint secretary of Mumbai's cricket association, told CNN on Friday that fire inspectors visited the city's Wankhede Stadium two days ago. Rajput insisted the venue had already been given a no-objection clearance by Mumbai authorities.
