On Sunday, protesters vacated Kiev's City Hall, unblocked a major street and left other government buildings in exchange for the government dropping charges against those arrested. If Ukraine didn't, and instead joined a Moscow-led Customs Union, it would get deep discounts on natural gas, Russia said. Why have thousands of protesters staked their lives, seemingly, on their desire for political change? Russia threatened its much smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if Ukraine forged ahead. The deal, the EU's "Eastern Partnership," would have created closer political ties and generated economic growth.
