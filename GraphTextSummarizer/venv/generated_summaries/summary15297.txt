The Obama administration will scrap the controversial missile defense shield program in Eastern Europe, a senior administration official confirmed to CNN Thursday. Is the U.S. right to scrap plans for a missile defense shield in Europe? The missile shield issue came up in July during a meeting between Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow.

The comment followed similar statements from officials in Poland and the Czech Republic -- where key elements of the system were to be located -- but was the first confirmation from an American official.
