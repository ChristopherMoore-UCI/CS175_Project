Human Rights Watch said it has documented the routine use of torture by Bahraini security officials during similar interrogations in political and security-related cases. "Sources told Human Rights Watch that when the defendants asked to speak about the abuse they allegedly experienced in detention, security forces forcibly removed them from court," it added. " Human Rights Watch noted that Bahrain is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits torture, and that Bahrain has ratified the Convention Against Torture. The rights group called on Bahrain to suspend prosecution of civilians in special military courts, to grant them access to lawyers, relatives, and medical care, and to set up an impartial commission to look into allegations of torture. -- A human rights activist who was active in Bahrain's pro-democracy street protests appeared Sunday before a special military court showing signs of ill-treatment and perhaps torture, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday.
