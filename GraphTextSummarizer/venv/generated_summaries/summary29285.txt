We need to explore new innovative retirement models that provide guaranteed retirement income for all workers if we are going to be a country where once again working people can reasonably expect to be able to retire. Almost daily, we hear stories of the crisis stemming from the breakdown of the three-legged stool of retirement: traditional pensions, Social Security and individual savings. This risk continues to spread as the job of planning and managing retirement savings continues to be transferred to workers who have to learn in their spare time to do what professional money managers are trained and paid to do full-time. The biggest problem with defined contribution plans is that alone they do not provide retirees with guaranteed retirement income. If workers continue to be forced to play the dual role of employee and retirement actuary, stories of older workers like Edwards will not change for the better.
