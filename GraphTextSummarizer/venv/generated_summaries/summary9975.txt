So, as a multitude of Hollywood stars and average folk seek to adopt children cross racially, the question moves away from the "right and wrongs," and then becomes: "How best to do it?" In 2008, the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York released a study that suggested foster parents of minority children should receive special training and preparation for the challenges inherent in interracial foster care. In the United States  in 2010, black children left the care system at a rate of 24 percent,  while white children left at a rate of 43 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Indeed, the American 1994 Multi-Ethnic Placement Act "affirms the prohibition against delaying or denying the placement of a child for adoption or foster care on the basis of race, color or national origin of the foster or adoptive parents or of the child involved." Having spoken to adults who were fostered or adopted by different races in the past, I hear them speak with a deeply-embedded emotional scar connected with feelings of detachment from their roots and holding onto inaccurate preconceived ideas about their culture. And until recently, UK guidelines on adoption have made it difficult to adopt between races.
