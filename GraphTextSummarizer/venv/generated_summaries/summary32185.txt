On Southwest Airlines, which does not have assigned seats, unaccompanied minors are seated near the front of the cabin, according to Whitney Eichinger, Southwest Airlines spokeswoman. "Airlines are acting as custodians of unaccompanied minors, and therefore have the ability to move them to a different seat if they believe that is in their best interest," a U.S. Department of Transportation spokesman told CNN. Australian airline Qantas also has come under fire for a similar policy prohibiting men from sitting next to unaccompanied minors. "I am an emergency service worker when I'm off that plane, but as soon as I boarded it I was a presumed pedophile," firefighter Johnny McGirr told CNN Australian affiliate Network Ten. In the United States, no major airline prohibits men from sitting next to unaccompanied minors.
