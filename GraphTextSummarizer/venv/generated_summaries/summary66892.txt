That's how long Travis Alexander suffered in pain as Arias attacked him, Prosecutor Juan Martinez said. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state. -- Jodi Arias could face the death penalty, nearly five years after she stabbed, shot and almost decapitated her ex-boyfriend. The jury then will deliberate for a third time to determine whether Arias should be sentenced to life or death. "I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life, and that still is true today," she told Phoenix television station KSAZ.
