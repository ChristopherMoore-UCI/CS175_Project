-- A U.S. diplomatic cable written five years ago concluded that the government of India condoned torture of suspects held in detention centers in Jammu and Kashmir, a region that has seen a long guerrilla war by Muslim separatists, many supported by Pakistan. "At a time when many nations appear to be losing ground to extremist movements, India's trendlines are pointing in the right direction, bolstered by strong indigenous traditions of communal co-habitation, non-violent political protest" and other factors. The cable concludes that ICRC data on "ill-treatment and torture in detention centers are very disturbing, because the practice continues unabated. A leaked cable said the group was "notorious for its use of torture, extra-judicial killing, rape, and extortion of Kashmiri civilians suspected of harboring or facilitating terrorists." Another cable the following year acknowledged the security challenges India faced in Kashmir.
