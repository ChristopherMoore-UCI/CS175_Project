Greek police say the raider, or raiders, also made off with Piet Mondrian's "Landscape with a mill," and a pen-and-ink sketch of San Diego de Alcala in ecstasy by Renaissance artist Guglielmo Caccia. " Athens' National Art Gallery showcases works from the 14th to the 20th centuries, and is best known for its collections of Greek and Renaissance art, including paintings by El Greco, Tiepolo and Brueghel. The raid led Citizen's Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis to criticize security at the gallery, which is home to works by Auguste Rodin, Henri Matisse and Peter Paul Rubens. The theft took place on the final day of an exhibition entitled "Unknown Treasures," which had featured prints and etchings by Albrecht Duerer and Rembrandt van Rijn. "Landscape with a farm," a second figurative painting by Dutch artist Mondrian -- who is better known for his abstract works -- was left behind as the burglar ran away.
