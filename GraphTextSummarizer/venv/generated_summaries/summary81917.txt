Newtown Police Department Chief Michael Kehoe requested the analysis after media reports indicated the response time was greater than Kehoe knew it to be, said Jack Daly, president of the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association. According to the report, the first call to police was at 9:35 a.m; the first officer arrived two minutes and 41 seconds after the first radio broadcast of a shooting. The review references a CNN report that said, "Police and other first responders arrived on scene about 20 minutes after the first calls. A review of police response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has found that officers "responded to the scene rapidly, positioned themselves appropriately, and followed their department policy," according to a report by the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association. The elapsed time between the first police officer's arrival and police entry to the school was just under six minutes.
