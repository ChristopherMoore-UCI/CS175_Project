The whole time he and the others were down there, Santos said, "As much as we were praying for ourselves, we were also praying for the people of Haiti and of Port-au-Prince. " IMA World Health provides health care services and supplies in poor countries including Haiti. Santos said only one of his colleagues could move, and she looked for air spaces and light. While Santos is relieved to be reunited with his family in the United States, his thoughts are with the people of Haiti. "We had one Tootsie Pop and we did share that," said Rick Santos, president and CEO of IMA World Health.
