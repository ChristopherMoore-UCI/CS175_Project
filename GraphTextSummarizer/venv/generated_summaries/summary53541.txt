A recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that doctors reading mammograms miss an average of two in every 10 cases of breast cancer. "I think we have to rely on having a clinical breast exam once a year at a health care provider and doing your self-breast exam on a monthly basis." Reddy recommends having mammogram screenings at a reputable facility that is certified. "I wish I could say the mammogram could find 100 percent of breast cancers," Reddy said. Younger women may be advised to be screened earlier if there is a family history of breast cancer. It's a scene that's been repeated more than 35 million times in the past year at certified mammogram facilities around the United States.
