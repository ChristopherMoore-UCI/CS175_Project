These are just some of the objects confiscated by Polish customs officers and documented by Adam Lach, a photographer and filmmaker at Napo Images. " Polish customs officers have done well in combating the trade, Lach said. " One story that stood out in particular for Lach was that of a rapid decline in a seahorse species surrounding Indonesia. For Lach, the illegal wildlife trade symbolizes the devastation that can result from human thoughtlessness, "which, like locusts, can destroy all we have around us." But it was seeing an exhibit of trafficked animal goods -- items seized by customs officials at an airport in Warsaw, Poland  -- that prompted him to embark on his photographic project "Human Tsunami."
