As the warring parties have grown increasingly fractured, reports say Turkish military units have fired at Syrian government forces, rebels groups, and even Kurdish militias. -- Turkey's top diplomat angrily rejected U.S. newspaper reports alleging the Turkish government leaked Israeli intelligence secrets to Iran. On Thursday, Turkish officials suggested that the Washington Post report was part of a broader effort to discredit Turkey's top spymaster, Hakan Fidan. This was not the first time Turkish army has engaged in cross-border artillery duels along the frontier with Syria. The article suggested Fidan was the architect of a policy that has funneled weapons and money to rebels in neighboring Syria.
