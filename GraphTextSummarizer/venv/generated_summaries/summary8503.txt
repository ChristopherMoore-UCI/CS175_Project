For the third generation 32GB New iPad with AT&T and Wi-Fi, the site offers $260 if it's in good condition (visible signs of use), $300 for flawless condition (looks like it's never been used), and $90 if it's broken (does not turn on or has serious damage). Sure, your third-generation iPad is great and all, but after Tuesday's announcement of Apple's iPad Mini and iPad 4, perhaps you wish you could trade-up. The company experienced a deluge of customers this past February who were trying to sell their iPad 2s after Apple's announcement of a mysterious event on March 7 (which turned out to be the unveiling of the third generation iPad).

In addition to traditional auction-style eBay, with eBay Instant Sale you can get the Apple iPad 3 Wi-Fi 16GB ($286).
