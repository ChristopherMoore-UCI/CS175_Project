"Pollen levels are increasing, pollen seasons are getting longer, and more people are developing allergies," says Estelle Levetin, Ph.D., chairwoman of the aerobiology committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The seasons are longer Spring allergies now start sooner and fall allergies end later, thanks to global warming, says Jeffrey G. Demain, M.D., director of the Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Center of Alaska. This makes temperatures rise, prompting plants and trees to flower—and release pollen—earlier each spring; in the fall, they delay the death of ragweed plants from frost, extending the pollen season, Levetin explains. The worst plants for your allergies There's more pollen than ever Higher amounts of carbon dioxide not only kick-start pollen production, they also boost the amount of pollen each plant generates, too -- especially in urban areas, where the gas is more plentiful. Fall allergies go from mid-August through the first autumn frost, and are chiefly set off by pollen from the ragweed plant, mold, and dust mites.
