A boater reported the whales early Thursday afternoon near Kice Island, south of Naples, said Blair Mase, NOAA's Southeastern stranding coordinator. Their bodies were found above the normal tide line, suggesting that seas whipped by strong westerly winds may have led to their running aground, Mase said. -- A total of 20 pilot whales have been found dead on an island off southwestern Florida, possibly driven ashore by high seas, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. Of the 14 whales that were found off a state park near Fort Myers on Monday, eight died, including one pregnant female, NOAA said. About 2,400 pilot whales are believed to live in the Gulf of Mexico, according to NOAA.
