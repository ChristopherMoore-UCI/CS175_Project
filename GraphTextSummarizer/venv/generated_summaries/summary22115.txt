Cat Café opened its doors Thursday, for cat lovers and the cat-curious to enjoy complimentary "cat'achino" cappuccinos, talk cat health and learn about cat adoption with 16 cuddly cats. " As cat people sipped cappuccinos with cat faces drawn in the foam and flicked furry, feathered balls attached to sticks by string at feline guests, Roberts said the café featured a "Cat Chat" speaker series with discussions led by a cat behaviorist, a veterinarian and other cat experts. "It's a great thing because dogs are very publicly social -- you can take your dog out and go for a walk, talk to people at the dog park -- but that's not a luxury most cat owners have, so this is a place you can talk with likeminded people about cat health and be among cats. We thought if people are going to be talking about cat health, you should be among your subjects and have cats all around you," said Niky Roberts with Purina ONE. "So far I think we've had about four cats adopted, but on Saturday we're having an event here where we'll have our mobile unit that will have additional cats available for adoption, and we're always encouraging people to come over to the shelter in Long Island where we have over a hundred adoptable cats," said Christina Travalja, shelter director for North Shore Animal League America.
