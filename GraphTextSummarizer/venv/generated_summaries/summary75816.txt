Other iPad competitors have not sold well, but the new Kindle will likely have a different fate. This Kindle's operating system is based on Google's Android, but Amazon has changed it so extensively that I barely noticed the similarities. Because the Kindle is significantly smaller than the iPad -- with a 7-inch-wide screen versus the iPad's 9.7-inch more boxy display -- it weighs about a third less. But the Kindle's battery loses a charger much faster than the iPad. That Amazon skimped on some of the components becomes evident when swiping through menus, switching the screen's orientation or playing games, which can all be jerky at times.
