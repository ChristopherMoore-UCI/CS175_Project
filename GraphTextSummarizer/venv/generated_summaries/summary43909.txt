-- On Friday, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry said the Senate is prepared to vote on a nuclear arms treaty with Russia. Under Senate rules, 30 hours of debate are needed before taking up a vote. Senate Democrats were trying to make progress on considering the treaty despite a Republican threat to block any legislation brought up before the Senate acts on a measure authorizing continued government spending. " Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the committee, added that the Senate needs to get some sort of an amendment or "perhaps move to close off debate and have our last 30 hours." Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, told reporters Wednesday that a rushed schedule to debate the treaty would prevent Republican senators from being able to offer substantive amendments that require serious debate.
