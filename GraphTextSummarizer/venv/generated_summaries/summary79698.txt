In the midst of praising California Attorney General Kamala Harris on Thursday, President Barack Obama described her as "by far the best-looking" AG of all. "What would the response have been if a female politician with tremendous power had remarked that a male politician with less power was the 'best-looking so and so'? If a comment like this is made between people that are only meeting recently, or for the first time, in this type of forum -- not appropriate at all, regardless of political affiliation and/or position of power." By Friday, the uproar over the remark was such that the president called Harris to apologize for the "distraction created by the comments," according to his spokesman, Jay Carney. I don't see much harm in that especially coming from a man who is surrounded by strong women and clearly has the highest respect for them.
