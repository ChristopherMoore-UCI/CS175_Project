Dunham, who had a second heart attack in 2002, wore red Friday to spread awareness about heart disease. Others who wore red have family members who succumbed to heart disease. Robin Savage, 42, of San Juan Capistrano, California, said her grandfather, father and mother all had heart disease. Her message to others at risk for heart disease is to watch their weight. Now 64 years old, she said she wants women everywhere to know that heart disease, the No. 1 killer for women, can affect women in all walks of life.
