Party people might typically start their evening at the "little bar" at Riche, which has good DJs and attracts an arty crowd, then shift to Berns at midnight for flirting and dancing, and if they know the doorman or are feeling lucky, party in the early hours at celebrity hot-spot Spy Bar. He has lived in Stockholm for more than 20 years and writes the blog "Cool Stockholm," which looks at the hottest trends in the Swedish capital. People get together in groups and put on conical hats and paper napkins and eat crayfish, drink hard liquor and sing drinking songs. This season men are wearing red pants and women are wearing gladiator sandals -- it's almost mandatory. In the winter, the sun sets at four o'clock, but in summer you get incredibly long, beautiful days.
