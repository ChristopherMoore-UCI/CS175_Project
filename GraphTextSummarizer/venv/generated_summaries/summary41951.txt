Filling out the million-dollar club last week: "Once" ($1.17 million), "The Phantom of the Opera" ($1.13 million), "Mary Poppins" ($1.12 million), "Newsies" ($1.11 million), "Evita" ($1.01 million), and "Jersey Boys" ($1.01 million). As a result, its haul last week was just $853,737, down from $1.16 million the previous week. In its first full week since its Nov. 15 opening, the show scraped up a thin gruel of $194,511, less than 16 percent of its potential gross, and played to houses that were less than one third full.
