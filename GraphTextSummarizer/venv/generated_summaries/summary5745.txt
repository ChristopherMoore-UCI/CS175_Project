A local clinic alerted emergency officials Friday when 15 children suddenly showed up at their facilities with similar symptoms -- vomiting, diarrhea and fever, Ibarra said. At least 38 children ages four and five became sick after lunch at a state-run school in San Luis Rio Colorado, which sits right on the border across from Yuma, Arizona, emergency dispatcher Carlos Ibarra said. Officials suspect the horchata was responsible for the food poisoning, Ibarra said. The food was prepared by the sister of one of the teachers who had been contracted by the school, Ibarra said. Some of the children were released from the hospital on Friday night.
