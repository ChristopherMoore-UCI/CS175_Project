There was Kardashian, dressed in her custom white Givenchy gown with lace, kissing her new husband (also in Givenchy). Kardashian posed with the man who made her wedding gown, Givenchy creative designer Riccardo Tisci, and Tisci in turn posted a picture of the back of Kardashian's dress showing its detail. Adding to the curiosity factor: Smith is photographed with Joe Francis of "Girls Gone Wild" fame and Kourtney Kardashian. But the real fun apparently happened at the reception, where a wedding booth captured various images, including the now-Mr. and Mrs. West sporting matching leather jackets with the words "Just " on his and "Married" on hers. The social media site has turned into the unofficial wedding album of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.
