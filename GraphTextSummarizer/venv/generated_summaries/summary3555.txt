Charlie Hebdo is far from the only publication whose depiction of Mohammed sparked controversy. And although the motive behind Wednesday's massacre is not yet clear, Charlie Hebdo's notorious cartoons satirizing the Prophet Mohammed in recent years have angered some Muslims and made it a target for attacks. " Thousands of people took to social media in the attack's aftermath to express solidarity with Charlie Hebdo, posting images with the words "Je Suis Charlie" in white on a black background, or paying tributes to the magazine on Twitter using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag. Newspapers in Norway and Denmark prompted furious demonstrations around the world in 2005 when they ran Mohammed cartoons. Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger defended the magazine at the time, saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence.
