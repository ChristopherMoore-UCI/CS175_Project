Obama, however, blamed a polarized political climate for an inability to make progress on such key issues as deficit reduction and entitlement reform, arguing that Republicans have shifted to the right and dropped support for moderate proposals acceptable to Democrats. In a speech to a media luncheon, Obama described the measure -- prepared by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and passed by the House -- as a "Trojan Horse" that is disguised as a deficit reduction plan but actually imposes a "radical vision." "He said that he's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous, which is a word you don't often hear when it comes to describing a budget." Ryan and other Republican leaders immediately criticized the Obama speech as a politically motivated appeal to populism, rather than a serious approach to budget deficits. "Instead, he has chosen to campaign rather than govern, and the debt crisis he is presiding over is only getting worse." Obama, however, called the Ryan budget an attempt to shift the burden of deficit reduction to the middle class and the needy. Obama also criticized tax cuts in the Ryan budget that he said would cost $4.6 trillion over the next decade.
