In addition to the changes in safety procedures, the NRC is also seeking information from every operating U.S. nuclear power plant regarding risks caused by earthquakes and flooding and the plants' emergency procedures in the event of prolonged power loss. Among the recommendations, plants must install improvements to protect safety equipment and devices to monitor water levels in spent fuel pools. -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday ordered U.S. nuclear power plants to begin implementing safety recommendations made in an effort to prevent a crisis from occurring as it did in Japan after last year's devastating earthquake and tsunami. "These reactors must improve venting systems that help prevent or mitigate core damage in the event of a serious accident," the NRC said in a news release announcing the orders for U.S. plants. A third order applies only to plants with boiling-water reactors that have so-called Mark I or Mark II containment structures.
