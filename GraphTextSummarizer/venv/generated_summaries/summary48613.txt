-- "Who's the treasurer?" Brothers Brant and Dylan Ozanich and Wyatt McCall were at a motorcycle shop in Hamilton, Montana, ordering a part for Dylan's bike when they met two old bikers from Texas and talked with them about their trip across the country. Dylan rode a 1982 Yamaha XJ 750 Seca ($500 cost); Brant rode a 1980 Yamaha XJ 650 Maxim ($500); and McCall rode a 1985 Honda V65 Magna ($1500 cost). "For the first six days back, McCall was at his girlfriend's house, and Dylan and I sat on the couch watching movies," said Brant. "We didn't know motorcycles were going to be that much of a connection between people, but they were," said McCall. Although they had no treasurer, Brant pointed to McCall to answer the question.
