Supporters of opposition leader Andry Rajoelina attend a rally in Antananarivo on Monday. While Rajoelina has tapped into popular discontent, Madagascar watchers say that to call this a popular revolution over simplifies the takeover. Both men gained popular support by reaching out to the masses as a leader for the youth of Madagascar. Trouble has been brewing in Madagascar since January, when Ravalomanana sacked Rajoelina from his post in the capital. The military handed power to Andry Rajoelina, the 34-year-old former mayor of Antananarivo.
