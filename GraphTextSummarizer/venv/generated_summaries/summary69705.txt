The report emphasizes the public health implications of high stress levels, with caregivers reporting greater rates of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and depression. "People who care for loved ones tend to take on a lot, but don't take care of themselves," said Beverly Hills psychologist Fran Walfish, who helps look after her 90-year-old father. Those results were higher among caregivers, who were also more likely than the general population to report doing a poor job at managing and preventing stress, according to the survey's findings. As the country braces for the prospect of providing health care to roughly 72 million adults, the impact on caregivers is coming into focus. Oftentimes, their house is a mess, they're financially burdened and they no longer have outside ties to the community because all their time is spent caring for the mom and dad," said Amanda Gois, marketing director of St. Paul's PACE.
