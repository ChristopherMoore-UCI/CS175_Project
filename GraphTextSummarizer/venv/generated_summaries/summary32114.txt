On any ordinary workday, the scene in Sydney would have been packed with people crisscrossing Martin Place on their way to work, home and shops. Dramatic scenes ended a tense hostage situation early Tuesday in Sydney, with sounds of an explosion and gunfire as Australian police stormed a cafe where a gunman had hours earlier taken more than 10 people hostage. "We've shut off the monitors that face onto Martin Place for fear that people inside the cafe might be able to see the pictures broadcast," Byrne said at the time. He said hundreds, if not thousands, of people had assembled in nearby Hyde Park after being told to leave the area around Martin Place. Martin Place is a paved traffic-free zone, a pedestrian-friendly promenade a few blocks from the ferry terminal at Sydney Harbor.
