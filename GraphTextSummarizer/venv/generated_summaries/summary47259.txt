Despite the absence of serious damage or injuries, some Los Angeles-area residents were left rattled. " "In the U.S. particularly in California, buildings are generally built well enough that it takes about a 5.5 for there to be some damage, so we do have the potential for damage," said Don Blakeman, an analyst for the USGS. Los Angeles police said a downtown hotel sustained some structural damage, but no one was injured and the building was not evacuated. The quake was felt as far south as San Diego, California, and the USGS said it received reports of light shaking as far north as Rosamond, California, about 55 miles north-northeast of Los Angeles. But most Southern California earthquakes tend to be fairly shallow, officials said.
