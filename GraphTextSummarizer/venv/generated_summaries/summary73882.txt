State party Chairman John Wisniewski tells CNN that "it's a slap in the face to New Jersey voters not to have a say in who represents them for a year and a half." Wisniewski says New Jersey Democrats expect the election to be this November, pointing to what he says is the most recent statute by state lawmakers on the timing of such a vote. -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he had some "pretty good fights" with Sen. Frank Lautenberg. If Christie decides to hold the Senate contest in 2014 with a hand-picked replacement serving 18 months by Election Day, it could invite legal action from New Jersey Democrats. One top name to emerge is state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, a longtime Christie ally who last November lost to the state's other U.S. senator, Democrat Bob Menendez, by 20 percentage points. "In fact, it probably is more honest to say we very often didn't agree, and we had some pretty good fights between us over time -- battles on philosophy and the role of government." Lautenberg: The last 'swamp dog' As Christie, a Republican, runs for what is expected to be a relatively easy re-election, he now invites unwanted attention as he decides on a temporary replacement for Lautenberg.
