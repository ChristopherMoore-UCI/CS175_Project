At a time of playground bombings in Syria, kidnapped schoolgirls in Nigeria, girls' schools shuttered under threat in Afghanistan and conflicts descending into chaos in real time, the attack on the Pakistan's Army Public School brought home once again the danger children face simply for the act of heading to school. "In 2013, 78 attacks against schools, teachers and schoolchildren were reported to the United Nations in Pakistan," a news release from the U.N.'s special representative for children and armed conflict noted. And yet, today in Syria millions of refugee children remain out of school. In a wrenching interview, a girl named Margaret tells of being abducted from her girls' school in northern Uganda in 2004 at 14 by soldiers for Joseph Kony. She was forced to become his sex slave and to bear his children, one of countless children forced into soldiering and slavery by Kony's Lord's Resistance Army.
