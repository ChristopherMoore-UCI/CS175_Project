Gov. Chris Christie canceled three scheduled media appearances with reporters in London on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the New Jersey Republican made controversial comments about vaccinations and after a new report revealed lavish travel by Christie that was paid for by others. The same law was referenced when Christie's expenses were covered by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to an NFL game last month in Dallas. And he declined to talk after stopping by the Globe Theatre to watch Rutgers students rehearse William Shakespeare's "Henry V." When pressed by reporters, according to a Washington Post reporter, Christie responded,"Is there something you don't understand about 'No Questions'? He signed an executive order in 2010 that allows New Jersey governors to travel at the cost of foreign governments. " A New York Times story Monday night disclosed new details about travel and gifts that Christie has accepted from foreign governments and wealthy donors, including a weekend trip paid for by King Abdullah of Jordan.
