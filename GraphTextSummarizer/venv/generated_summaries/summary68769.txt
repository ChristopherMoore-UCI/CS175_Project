"When you exhale the smoke, you send back the evil spells to the sender," says RaphaÃ«l Verona, a Swiss photographer who has just released a new book of photographs of traditional Aymara communities. Many of the Aymara -- an ancient, indigenous race found in Bolivia, Peru and Chile -- suppose that on Tuesdays and Fridays, ordinary people become vulnerable to harmful spirits and the evil eye. Moreover, from the point of view of the Aymara, the terrifying appearance of spirits like Supai, who is depicted with horns and a scarlet face, did not simply signify evil. The early missionaries tried to encourage indigenous people to accept the Catholic God by reinterpreting their own spirits:  Pachamama, they said, was Mary, and Supai was the devil. The paradox of the Aymara "The Aymara people have an approach to life that seems paradoxical from the outside," says Verona.
