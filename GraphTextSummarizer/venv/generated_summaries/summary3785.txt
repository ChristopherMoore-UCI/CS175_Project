But as more information came in out about the shooter's troubled past with mental illness, lawmakers started talking more about mental health. With the expansion of Medicaid—the largest public coverage provider for mental health services—in about half the states, an estimated 2.7 million people with mental illnesses could qualify for insurance, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Another part of the Affordable Care Act requires small group and individual health plans to cover mental health services at the same rate as general medical care, a practice that's already been in place for larger group plans since 2008. On the other side of Capitol Hill Thursday, a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, Tim Murphy, became the latest lawmaker to introduce new legislation specifically tailored to mental health. The White House has also been highlighting mental health in the week leading up to the December 14 Newtown anniversary.
