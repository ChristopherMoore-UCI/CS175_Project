"I fear anarchy happening in Tacloban City," said CNN iReporter Maelene Alcala, who was on vacation in Tacloban where the typhoon struck and was evacuated to Manila. -- Desperate pleas for food and water forced aid organizations and nations around the world to scramble Wednesday to deliver supplies four days after Typhoon Haiyan flattened areas of the Philippines, where bodies still litter the streets in one devastated province. At least 29 nations or government groups have sent or pledged aid, according to the Philippines government. They were able to make it onto a Philippines Air Force C-130 making a return flight to deliver aid to the devastated community. The Philippines Armed Forces has increased troops and military engineers in Tacloban, and the army will fly aid to survivors in remote areas around the city with 11 helicopters and as many trucks.
