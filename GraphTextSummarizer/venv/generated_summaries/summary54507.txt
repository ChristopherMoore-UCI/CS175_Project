For Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti it was his third Champions League triumph as a coach, equaling the record of Liverpool's Bob Paisley. It was Real's first Champions League title since 2002 and to the milestone of 'La Decima" -- extending its record number of wins in Europe's premier club competition. Three quickfire goals in extra time gave Real Madrid a 4-1 win over city rivals Atletico in Lisbon Saturday to win the European Champions League for the 10th time. Atletico held out until the second half of the added time until Gareth Bale headed Real ahead after superb work by Angel Di Maria. The Real fans in the Stadium of Light looked skywards in disbelief but they were soon in total despair after a mistake by Spanish international goalkeeper Iker Casillas.
