Both sides over the weekend discussed details that players wanted resolved, including the contractual handling of player injury, an opt-out clause in the 10-year deal and, "most pointedly, the potential timeline for the recertification of the NFLPA (NFL Players' Association) as a union," the NFL said. -- NFL player representatives and the league's owners on Monday signed a collective-bargaining agreement to end a lockout that threatened to derail the 2011 season. Sets mandatory contracts lengths at four years for players drafted in the first seven rounds; -- Guarantees contracts against injury for up to three years; -- Creates a $610 million Legacy Fund for players who played before the 1993 season; -- Allows the NFLPA discretionary use of $20 million per year for health, safety and "former player issues;" -- Calls for a three-member appeals panel, including at least one former judge, to resolve disputes. Under the old agreement, NFL owners took $1 billion off the top of that revenue stream. The rest of the week will be dominated by the deferred business of expanding rosters, signing drafted rookies, reopening facilities and starting camps in preparation for preseason games, the first of which are on August 11, according to an updated league schedule released Monday.
