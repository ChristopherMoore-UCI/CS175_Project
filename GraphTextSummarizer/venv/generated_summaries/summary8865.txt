The front was wrecked and its air bags deployed, said Bangkok Police Maj. Gen. Parinya Jansuriya. -- The family of a Thai police officer killed in a car crash in Bangkok expressed shock and grief Tuesday over his death, which the grandson of the creator of the Red Bull energy drink has been charged with causing. The police subsequently arrested Vorayud Yoovidhaya, 27, a prominent member of one of Thailand's richest families whose wealth is connected to Red Bull, and charged him with causing a death with negligence and hit and run. The man who had claimed to have been driving the car was fined 6,000 baht, about $200, the Police Chief Kumronvit Thoopkrachang said. Vorayud admitted driving the car and hitting the motorcycle, but he claimed he was suddenly cut off by the bike, according to Police Maj. Gen. Aunuchi Lekbumrung.
