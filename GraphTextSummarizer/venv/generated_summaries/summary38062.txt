-- A satellite whose orbit is degrading will fall back to Earth Friday afternoon, but only some of its pieces will survive the fiery ride through the atmosphere, NASA scientists said Thursday. The FAA said warnings of this sort typically are sent out to pilots concerning specific hazards they may encounter during flights such as air shows, rocket launches, kites and inoperable radio navigational aids. NASA says space debris the size of the UARS components re-enters the atmosphere about once year. NASA has identified 26 pieces they expect to survive, ranging in size from around 10 pounds to hundreds of pounds. Because water covers 70% of the Earth's surface, NASA believes that most, if not all of the surviving debris will land in water.
