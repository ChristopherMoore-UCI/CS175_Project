"There's very clear evidence for people who do this kind of work that when you provide women access to education, that when you provide them access to independent abilities to support themselves, and then when you provide them with health care, maternal and infant health go up in correspondence with each other," she said. The gap between the level of care and commitment to mothers and children in the top 10 nations -- all developed countries -- and the bottom 10 is growing, Miles said. "Unlike other industrialized nations, we lack the kind of state-level protections and policies that would reduce some of that stress," she said, speaking of "family-friendly entitlement programs" like universal health care. The report's ranking of 165 nations factors in measures of education, health and economic status as well as the health and nutrition of children. A new mother needs a lot of help, Simon said, and other countries provide more government assistance than the United States does.
