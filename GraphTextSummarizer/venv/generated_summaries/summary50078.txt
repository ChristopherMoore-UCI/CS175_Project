In the meantime, activists have called for symbolic funeral protests to be held in other cities across Turkey. Istanbul police denied using tear gas to disperse crowds that gathered Tuesday at the hospital where Elvan died, Anadolu reported. More recently, riot police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators holding a vigil outside the hospital where Elvan was being treated. News of Elvan's death sparked a fresh round of protests in other parts of Istanbul, as well as in the capital Ankara, where riot police reportedly intervened using tear gas. When Elvan's mother attempted to make a public statement about her son's ordeal in central Istanbul in July 2013, CNN journalists witnessed and filmed Turkish riot police hitting demonstrators with pepper spray and beating one man with a club in an apparent effort to break up the demonstration.
