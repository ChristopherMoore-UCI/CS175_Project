Netanyahu said Israel would respond with steps of its own if the Palestinians pressed ahead with unilateral actions toward statehood. "If Netanyahu considers the Palestinians committing themselves to international law -- including committing themselves to empowering woman and protection of children -- is a provocation that calls for Israeli punishment, then what the Palestinians are saying all of these years have been proven beyond doubt that Israel considers international law to be hindrance for peace," Hussam Zomlot said. Attempts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to put peace talks back on track unraveled in the past week -- Israel reneged on a scheduled release of Palestinian prisoners, and the Palestinians responded by signing on to join 15 international bodies, reversing their commitment not to seek international recognition as a state. -- Israel is willing to continue U.S-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians but "not at any price," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday. A senior foreign policy adviser for Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said his party was not surprised by Netanyahu's remarks about statehood.
