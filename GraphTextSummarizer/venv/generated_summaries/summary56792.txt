Also at Monday's press conference, the AFA announced sweeping changes to the structure of league football in Argentina. It is also spells the end of the Primera Division's current relegation format, which sees teams relegated based on their points over three Apertura and Clausura seasons. The new format will see teams compete for the title over a full season, eliminating the Apertura and Clausura system. "The national teams committee has decided to rescind the contract that attached Mr. Batista with the Argentinian Football Association," AFA spokesman Ernesto Cherquis Bialo told reporters. Each team plays each other once to decide the winner of the first competition, known as the Apertura, with the return fixtures making up the second championship, the Clausura.
