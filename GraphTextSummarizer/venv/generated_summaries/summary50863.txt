The first officer on Air Canada flight 878 from Toronto to Zurich, Switzerland, was tired and needed a nap. "I was sleeping and I was literally and violently thrown out of my seat and was slammed into the ceiling," passenger Louisa Pickering told the CBC. "Some people were working on their laptops and had their seatbelts on," passenger Ashlyn O'Mara said in a CBC interview. There was also a U.S. Air Force C-17 nearing the Air Canada 767. The captain saw what was happening and immediately pulled back on the control column in a frantic attempt to increase altitude.
