Hezatullah, a 23-year-old who goes by one name, was a trusted member of the border police and had been receiving training from coalition forces, said Aminullah Amarkhil, commander of the border police in eastern Nangarhar province. But the Taliban claimed that Hezatullah had been a member of the militant group who joined the border police precisely to launch an attack on U.S. forces. "Afghan and NATO forces have launched a joint investigation into this incident, and preliminary reports suggest that there is no reason to believe that Hezatullah was not trustworthy," Amarkhil said. -- A gunman in an Afghan Border Police uniform who killed six U.S. troops was a reliable officer who had been with the force for three years, a senior official said Wednesday. The shooting broke out during a training mission in eastern Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force said in a news release.
