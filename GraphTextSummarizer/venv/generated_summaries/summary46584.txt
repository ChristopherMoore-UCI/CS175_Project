Obama's popularity with Latino voters in Florida is credited to the growth in the Puerto Rican population in central Florida. "When Mitt Romney brought on Kris Kobach as his adviser for his campaign, that really made an impact on the Latino community," said Leo Pierson,  a campaign surrogate for the Ohio Latino Leadership Council to Re-Elect President Obama. The lowest percentage of Latino voters won by a Republican was in 1996, when Bob Dole garnered only 21% of Latinos compared with then-President Bill Clinton's record 72%. " Pew Hispanic Center's analysis of exit poll data stated that 77% of Hispanic voters said undocumented immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 18% said such immigrants should be deported. After he made that statement, his opponents were able to characterize his support as being for the entire law, and that alienated many Latino voters.
