A strong earthquake damaged hundreds of homes in southern Mexico Tuesday and rattled residents hundreds of miles away in the nation's capital. "In light of today's earthquake, we can confirm that Malia Obama is safe and was never in danger," said Kristina Schake, a spokeswoman for first lady Michelle Obama. Residents rushed into the streets after feeling the temblor in Mexico City. Residents in the southwestern states of Oaxaca and Guerrero and the eastern state of Veracruz reported that phone service had been knocked out. Nine of the injuries occurred in Oaxaca state, which borders Guerrero and also suffered damage from the quake, he said.
