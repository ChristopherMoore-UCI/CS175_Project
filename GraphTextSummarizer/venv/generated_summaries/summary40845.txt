Club staff members do this by emphasizing the importance of education and high school graduation, recognizing academic successes, and reinforcing those habits and skills needed to be successful in school. The most profound impact is the eventual outcome -- young people equipped with the attitude, confidence and motivation to finish high school, prepared to succeed beyond. No single snapshot better illustrates the dilemma our country faces than the high school dropout crisis: -- One-third of America's children do not graduate from high school. Nearly two-thirds said that club staff contributed to their success in high school. Nine out of 10 of our club members graduate from high school or obtain a GED, according to a Harris Survey of club alumni.
