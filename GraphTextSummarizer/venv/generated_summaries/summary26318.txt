The scientific community has overwhelmingly scorned creationism and its latest incarnation, intelligent design, as a pretext for biblical explanations of how the world came to be, and asserts that there is no weakness or doubt in the scientific community about evolution. For example, skeptics of evolution point to what they contend are fossil record gaps casting doubt on the scientific evidence of common ancestry. For decades, the teaching of evolution in public schools has been flashpoint in some states, with proponents of ideas such as creationism and intelligent design trying to gain a place in science classes. Proponents of evolution say the dogma is on the other side, with the Discovery Institute and others purposely distorting and ignoring scientific evidence to reach their desired conclusion. -- The Texas Board of Education this week will vote on science standards that critics say seek to cast doubt on the theory of evolution.
