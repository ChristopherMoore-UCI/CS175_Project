Israel, Austria, Poland, Russia, and Kazakhstan -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on Oscar night, and the Academy points to the quality of those on the list, rather those that are not, as ultimate proof that the system works. A third French film, "Persepolis" won the special jury prize at Cannes and it received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but yet again, this was not a nominee for Best Foreign Film. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and its American director Julian Schnabel was nominated for an Oscar. "The Kite Runner" may have proved an international success at the box office, but it didn't fly with Oscar watchdogs. But Oscar judges ruled there was too little Taiwanese involvement -- none of the lead actors are from Taiwan.
