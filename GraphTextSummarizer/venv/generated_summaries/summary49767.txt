Her first album, 2003's "Frank," earned rave reviews in her native Britain for her unique voice -- an instrument that featured touches of Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington and Ray Charles -- and clever songwriting, attributes that were enough to put the jazz-inflected album on the shortlist for the UK's prestigious Mercury Prize and win Winehouse a top British songwriting award. And that doesn't even address her other problems: her sometimes contentious relationship and marriage with the equally troubled Blake Fielder-Civil, currently serving time for assault and obstructing justice after brawling with a pub manager and then offering him $400,000 to keep quiet; her uneven concert appearances, which have included drunken behavior and fan assault; her battles with various authorities, ranging from the American Embassy in London (which denied her a visa to travel to the U.S. to perform at the Grammys) to her father. A number of her mother's relatives were jazz musicians, according to Allmusic.com, and Amy grew up listening to Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington. She's forever working on new material, Mitch Winehouse told the Times of London. In June, she was rushed to the hospital after fainting; her father, Mitch Winehouse, told reporters that cigarettes and crack have jeopardized her lungs.
