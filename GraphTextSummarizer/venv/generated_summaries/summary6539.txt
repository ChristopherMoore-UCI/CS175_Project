"it's very hard to specifically quantify" what Beckham has meant to the U.S. game's growth, said Sunil Gulati, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, but several milestones followed his arrival: MLS attendance is up, there are more live games -- MLS and otherwise -- on television, the L.A. Galaxy has become a global brand, and most important, a sport that commanded only a few column inches of coverage 20 years ago now enjoys widespread coverage by the nation's sports media. Beckham wasn't even the best player to grace MLS, he said. "He was still a bit more successful as a celebrity than as a soccer player, which makes sense, because we're more of a celebrity culture than a soccer culture," said Sports illustrated senior writer and Fox Soccer analyst Grant Wahl. Gulati said he believes it's that combination of unique player and grand persona that makes Beckham Beckham. About 3 million people attended MLS games in 2006, with an average attendance of about 15,500 per game.
