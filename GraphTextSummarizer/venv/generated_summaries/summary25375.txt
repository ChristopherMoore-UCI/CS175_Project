-- A pizza deliveryman is accused of selling more than $45,000 in cocaine, hidden among pizza boxes, to undercover agents in New York. Undercover agents said Rodriguez sold a kilo of cocaine, worth $27,500, to an agent on Wednesday outside the Papa John's restaurant where he works in Brooklyn. Ramon Rodriguez, 45, was arrested Wednesday after more than a yearlong investigation by the New York City Police Department's narcotics bureau in Brooklyn. Rodriguez has been charged with multiple counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance, according to a statement released by the Special Narcotics Prosecutor in New York. Rodriguez was arrested as he placed the bag of cocaine inside the trunk of the undercover officer's car, prosecutors said.
