The vehicle has also been signed by a host of F1 stars, from current drivers including McLaren's 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari's two-time title winner Fernando Alonso, to legendary past champions such as Briton Jackie Stewart. The "art car" was driven by Italian Giancarlo Fisichella for 16 races during the 2008 season and has been decorated by motorsport artist Dexter Brown. " Force India's finances have recently been boosted by a $100 million injection from new part-owners Sahara, after team principal Vijay Mallya sold 42.5% of his stake. "When I was approached to paint an art car, I was immediately excited by the project as it's the first time I've had the chance to work with a modern Formula One car," said Brown, who has been involved in motorsport art for three decades. "Seeing one of my Formula One cars transformed into a painting is a wonderful initiative that combines two of my greatest passions: cars and art," billionaire Mallya said.
