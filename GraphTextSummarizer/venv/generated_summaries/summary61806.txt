The jury began deliberating Monday in the trial of Aafia Siddiqui, who is charged with attempted murder and assault for allegedly shooting at U.S. officers while she was in Afghan custody. Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi. The warrant officer returned fire with a pistol, hitting Siddiqui at least once Afghan police had arrested her a day earlier outside the Ghazni governor's compound after finding her with bomb-making instructions, excerpts from the "Anarchist's Arsenal," papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks, and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars, according to a September 2008 indictment. The indictment said Siddiqui had "handwritten notes that referred to a 'mass casualty attack'" listing several locations in the United States, and "construction of 'dirty bombs.'" The notes also "discussed various ways to attack 'enemies,' including by destroying reconnaissance drones, using underwater bombs, and using gliders," the indictment said. But in May 2004, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members.
