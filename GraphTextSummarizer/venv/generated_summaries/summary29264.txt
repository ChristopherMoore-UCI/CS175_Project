In 2004, after several allegations of rape at get-togethers designed to woo prospective players, the NCAA passed a rule that said that students who host recruits during campus visits "must be either current student-athletes or students consistent with the school's policy for providing campus visits or tours to prospective students generally," NCAA spokeswoman Emily James told CNN. It goes on to request interviews, police records, medical records and communication records. The prosecutor in the criminal case has said that Franklin cooperated with police and "There's no evidence whatsoever where Coach Franklin was involved in any way in the cover-up or has done anything inappropriate. Vanderbilt declined to comment on an ongoing investigation, and so did Penn State, where Franklin was hired in January and is preparing for a much-anticipated first season. The NCAA did not say if it will look into the claims made against Franklin in this court filing.
