Jordan, which is being inundated by a wave of Syrian refugees, will receive nearly $43 million, which will support United Nations humanitarian programs in the region. Kerry also said that he is working to bring all parties together to create a transitional government and that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be part of that government. The minister said he was "encouraged" by Kerry's meetings in Moscow this week, at which the U.S. and Russia agreed to push for an international conference on Syria that would possibly be held by the end of the month and include, for the first time, representatives of the Syrian government as well as the opposition fighting that government. -- Meeting in Rome with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, Secretary of State John Kerry announced Thursday that the United States would provide an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance for refugees fleeing the fighting in Syria, bringing the total amount of aid to $510 million. Kerry said he had asked Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, to travel to Istanbul to confer with opposition leaders.
