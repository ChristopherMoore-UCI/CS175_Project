The 26-year-old will miss the rest of the English Premier League season, as well as Liverpool's Europa League semifinal against his former club Atletico Madrid, after picking up the injury in a game against Portuguese side Benfica. Torres expressed his disappointment at missing the European clash with his former club, Atletico Madrid, who he left to join Liverpool in 2007. -- Spain striker Fernando Torres has rejected accusations he put the World Cup before his club Liverpool after he was ruled out of action for six weeks. He told his official Web site: "I picked up the injury in the second minute of the Europa League clash at home to Benfica, and I went onto to play for another 85 minutes with an injured knee. Torres traveled from England to Barcelona by car to see a specialist, due to the ongoing disruption to flights caused by the ash emanating from a volcano in Iceland, for an operation on his knee.
