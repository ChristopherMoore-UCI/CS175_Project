West will drive the original Batmobile to a Beverly Hills, California, art gallery for the opening of the first exhibit of his paintings and drawings depicting his vision of Batman and his crime-fighting world Friday evening. West is a "cultural pop art expressionist," said gallery owner Streets. "Batman saw his parents murdered in front of him as a little boy and, of course, he had to train for many years to create the kind of avenger crime fighter that he is," West said. West has kept busy in recent years attending fan conventions, but he still is in demand as an actor. " Another frame holds what West said is his "sense in some kind of dream of Bruce Wayne."
