-- The suspect in Norway's July 22 terror attacks has told police he had plans to attack other targets, Norwegian police said Saturday. The first part of the interview focused on going back over what he had told police the first time he was questioned, a week ago, Kraby said. His answers will be checked against footage from video cameras in the area, Kraby added, as police seek to make sure he was not working with anyone else. Then police questioned him about his movements in the government area of central Oslo before, during and after the bomb blast there, the attorney said. Earlier Friday, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, other political leaders and relatives of the victims attended a memorial service organized by the Labour Party youth movement to commemorate those killed and wounded.
