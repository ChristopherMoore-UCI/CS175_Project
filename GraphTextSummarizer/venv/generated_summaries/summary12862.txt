"The defense is pleased that this ruling came after an analysis of supplementary documents detailing the defense's income and expenditures, which were deemed by the court to meet the legal standards for the determination of indigency for costs," Liz Brown said. "After consistent misinformation from legal analysts, bloggers, and commentators, the defense hopes this ruling ends inappropriate speculation regarding any misuse of funds and looks forward to Miss Anthony's day in court." Anthony's lead attorney, Jose Baez, and Chicago death penalty attorney Andrea Lyon said in a four-page motion that they are not asking the state to pay their legal fees. They asked for assistance with fees for the service of subpoenas, investigations, travel, experts to interpret forensic evidence, expert witness fees and the cost of depositions. The grandparents, George and Cindy Anthony, have been supportive of Casey Anthony but now are fighting foreclosure, according to a complaint filed by Bank of America. That money, Baez said, was spent on defense costs including travel, depositions and retention of experts. Defense lawyers testified Thursday that there were not any book or movie deals on the horizon for Anthony.
