Previously, hackers broke into computers and networks because they were curious and those tools were inaccessible. First, crime: Hackers around the world wrote malicious software (malware) to hijack tens of thousands of computers, using their processing power to generate spam. Hackers met on text-only bulletin board systems to talk about phreaking, share computer passwords and tips. Breaking into computer systems was now a crime of its own. Similarly, there's proof that Russia used hackers to coordinate its attack on Georgia during a five-day war in 2008, taking out key news and government websites as tanks rolled into those specific cities.
