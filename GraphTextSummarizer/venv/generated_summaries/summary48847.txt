" Norwich City were playing their first game under new manager Chris Hughton, but struggled to replicate some of their impressive form from last season. Liverpool and West Bromwich were both playing their first games under new management, with Brendan Rodgers having moved to Anfield from Swansea and Steve Clarke taking his first managerial post at Albion after being sacked from his assistant manager's role with Liverpool at the end of last season. We had wide players who didn't really score last season but Kights has come in and put pressure on them from the word go which is what we want," Stoke manager Tony Pulis told his club's website. "It's always nice to win your first game of the season and to win away from home is always important because it can give you so much confidence going forward," explained Swansea manager Michael Laudrup to the club website. Manager Arsene Wenger gave debuts to new signings Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla, and introduced Olivier Giroud in the second half for the Frenchman's first competitive showing in an Arsenal shirt.
