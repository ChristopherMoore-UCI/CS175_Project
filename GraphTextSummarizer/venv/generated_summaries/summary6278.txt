Russlynn Ali, the department's assistant secretary for civil rights, said the school's process for reporting sexual harassment had been "confusing to students" and "that records of their complaints and their outcomes were not adequately kept." The federal investigation was spawned in 2011 by a 26-page complaint filed by 16 students following a controversial video released online that showed fraternity recruits yelling chants encouraging rape as they marched through campus. Yale students were "not made aware of the resources available to victims of sexual harassment and violence," said Ali, whose investigation "revealed allegations of sexual harassment beyond what was included in the (2011) complaint. -- The U.S. Department of Education reached a settlement with Yale University on Friday, acknowledging the school "largely under-reported" allegations of sexual harassment, but has since made changes to its policies to resolve accusations it allowed a "sexually hostile environment" on campus. Those measures include increased training and staff dedicated to responding to and preventing sexual harassment and violence. " The New Haven, Connecticut-based school is not the only university recently investigated by the federal government over its policies regarding sexual harassment and violence.
