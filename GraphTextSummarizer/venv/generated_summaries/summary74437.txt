According to The Atlanta Journal Constitution, Jeezy -- whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins -- was arrested Tuesday afternoon and charged with obstruction for allegedly cursing at officers and refusing to provide his name. Alpharetta, Georgia, police spokesman George Gordon confirmed the new arrest to CNN but did not provide additional details Tuesday night. The Journal-Constitution said Jenkins refused to show his identification or give his name and instead cursed at officers, who then arrested him. Gordon told CNN affiliate WSB that police arrived at an Alpharetta townhouse because of a security alarm, but no one answered the door. A grand jury warrant was issued for the rapper, who faces charges of battery, terroristic threats and false imprisonment.
