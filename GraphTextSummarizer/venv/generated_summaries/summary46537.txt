Langran, who was interviewed by CNN about skiing safety last January, said he was "deeply saddened and concerned" on hearing of Schumacher's accident and wished him a "speedy and complete recovery," but stressed that the risk of injury from snow sports remains low. Commenting in January on skiing injuries and fatalities, Langran insisted that winter sports have had a bad press when it comes to perceptions about safety. But according to Dr. Mike Langran, a Scottish doctor who specializes in ski safety, serious accidents like the one endured by the German are uncommon. Michael Schumacher's serious skiing accident in the French Alps has once again put the spotlight on skiing safety. "As with any recreational activity however, it is impossible to completely remove all elements of risk when participating in snow sports," Langran said.
