Of course, there are still the "Terminator" touchstones: post-apocalyptic landscapes, a naked Reese showing up in 1980s Los Angeles, crazy physics-defying stunts (how about that school bus?) and a blade-equipped T-1000. And so is the whole "Terminator" universe: morphing machines, the industrious version of Sarah Connor and a sometimes-befuddled Kyle Reese. "Terminator: Genisys" has some changes in store, producer David Ellison told EW in October. The film stars Emilia Clarke as Connor and Jai Courtney as Reese. How else to explain Schwarzenegger's old-style Terminator -- who has apparently raised young Sarah -- hurtling through the air into the blades of a helicopter?
