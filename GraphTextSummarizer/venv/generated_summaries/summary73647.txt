The deal also includes emergency funding to combat the spread of Ebola both in the United States and overseas and provides additional money the Obama administration requested to fight the terror group ISIS by supporting the training and equipping of Syrian rebel groups. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill maintain that Washington city leaders should be able to carry out a policy voters supported, but Congress has authority over the city's finances. The top Democrat on the House Appropriations panel, Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, said, "I strongly oppose several policy riders included in this final agreement, but I am pleased Democrats were able to eliminate many of the most damaging provisions." House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi was non-committal on whether she would back the bill, but released a statement saying she would discuss it with fellow Democrats, adding that she is "hopeful."
