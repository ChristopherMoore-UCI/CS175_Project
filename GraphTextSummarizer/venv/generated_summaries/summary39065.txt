It went so far as to spike a recent project Google engineers had developed because of fears of potential backlash, said Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman and former CEO. "We're so sensitive on the privacy issue now." Since Schmidt handed over the CEO reigns to co-founder Larry Page in April, the goal was to create an organization that operates more autonomously, that works like a startup, Google managers say. (However, it's worth noting that in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last year, Schmidt named Microsoft, with its Bing search engine, as Google's biggest competitor, ahead of Apple and Facebook.) Regulators say Google has crossed that line before, with its camera-taking vehicles and with Google Buzz. Coincidentally, the latter is suing Google over its new mobile-payments service, called Google Wallet, which launches in Portland on Wednesday and was demonstrated at the event.
