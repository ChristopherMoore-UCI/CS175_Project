The important question isn't whether cameras solve past crime or deter future crime; it's whether they're a good use of resources. Already, people can buy surveillance cameras in household objects to spy on their spouses and baby sitters -- I particularly like the one hidden in a shower mirror -- or cameras in pens to spy on their colleagues, and they can remotely turn on laptop cameras to spy on anyone. Although it's comforting to imagine vigilant police monitoring every camera, the truth is very different, for a variety of reasons: technological limitations of cameras, organizational limitations of police and the adaptive abilities of criminals. But the data are clear: CCTV cameras have minimal value in the fight against crime. Despite our predilection for technological solutions over human ones, the funds now spent on CCTV cameras would be far better spent on hiring and training police officers.
