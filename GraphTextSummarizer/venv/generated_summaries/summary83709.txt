She has been training with Iditarod veteran Paul Gebhardt and has borrowed one of his dog teams to lead her to Nome. Asked to explain why mushers are drawn to this sport, four-time Iditarod champion Jeff King of Denali Park, Alaska, took time to reflect before answering. Dick Mackey's one-second win over Rick Swenson in 1978 set a record for the closest finish in Iditarod history. Her longest race prior to entering this year's Iditarod was only 300 miles. The 2010 Iditarod is officially under way, with 71 mushers and dog teams on the wide-open trail toward Nome.
