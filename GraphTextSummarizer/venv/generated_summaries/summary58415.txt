Internet connections are also speeding up, both though cellular networks and available Wi-Fi networks. Three-quarters of African-American and 68% of Hispanic phone owners are going online from their handsets, while just 59% of white phone owners are doing the same. Since Pew began tracking Internet and phone usage in 2009, the numbers have steadily risen year-over-year. A whopping 91% of American adults have cell phones and a little more than half of those are smartphones. According to Pew, 21% of phone owners use their devices as their primary way of accessing the Internet, more than PCs and tablets.
