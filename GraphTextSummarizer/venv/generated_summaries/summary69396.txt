But much of her speech was focused on the themes of God and the role of government -- where "there are things" that policy makers "can't touch," she said, without delving into specifics. She pointed to a statue of Moses that sits above the House chamber's doors, calling the prophet important to Judaism, Christianity and Islam "the greatest law-giver." "Here in the United States, the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses is the very foundation of the law that has given happiness and the rise of the greatest prosperity that any nation has known before," Bachmann said. Bachmann also used the speech to thank her campaign's donors, Minnesota voters, her "prayer warriors," her family, her staff, military veterans and God. "It could be no coincidence that this nation, knowing and enjoying the heights of such great happiness and such great prosperity, that it could be built upon that foundation of the Ten Commandments and by the law given by the God in whom we trust," she said. The Minnesota Republican cited to the U.S. motto, officially adopted in 1956, of "In God we trust," and saying it's "fabulous" that the United States decided to "declare, in full voice, that it is in God that we as a nation put our trust."
