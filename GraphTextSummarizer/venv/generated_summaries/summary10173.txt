While law enforcement sometimes argues that making members of the public aware that cell phone companies can track them will make it more difficult to catch criminals, it is too late in the day for that argument now that cell phone tracking is a staple of television police procedurals. If the cell phone companies can provide this information to law enforcement agencies, they can and should provide basic information about their sharing of data with law enforcement to their customers, too. In comparison with companies such as Facebook and Google, which collect, store and use our information in one way or another, cell phone companies are less transparent. Do you know how often cell phone companies turn over this information to the police and whether they first ask the police to get a warrant based on probable cause? U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, co-chairman of the Congressional Bipartisan Privacy Caucus, recently requested that cell phone companies disclose basic statistics on how our personal data is shared with the government.
