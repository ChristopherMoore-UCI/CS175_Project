Former President Nixon died in 1994, the year after Pat Nixon's death. On Friday the first in a series of handwritten love letters between a young Richard Nixon and a young Pat Ryan went on display at the Nixon Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. You stand in that structure -- you look at the bedroom, to the left of the front door, and at the bed upon which Hannah Nixon in 1913 gave birth to the child who would end up a president -- and you think of the long and tumultuous life that Nixon would go on, from here, to lead. Six people lived in the house: Mr. and Mrs. Nixon, Richard and three of his brothers. He and Mrs. Nixon are buried behind the house.
