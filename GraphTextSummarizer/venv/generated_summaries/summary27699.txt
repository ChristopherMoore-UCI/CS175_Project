It is the latest controversy to hit sumo after a gambling scandal emerged in July last year when 34-year-old wrestler Ozeki Kotomitsuki is said to have illegally bet on baseball games. Japan's Kyodo news service claimed that Tokyo Police had found suspicious messages on a number of wrestlers' phones that suggested the outcome of several fights had been planned. The messages exchanged between wrestlers discuss how fights would be arranged and also the amount of money that would change hands. "You fall when I move to tackle," read another message reported by Japanese news wire Jiji Press. -- Japan's national sport of sumo wrestling was rocked by a match-fixing scandal on Thursday after it was revealed three wrestlers had admitted to rigging bouts.
