" Tuesday's 1.5 tremor is only the second recorded earthquake in Wisconsin since 1947, according to USGS geophysicist Paul Caruso. A "swarm" of minor earthquakes amplified by the unique bedrock beneath the state of Wisconsin. Based on all the data, the USGS believes the shaking and strange sounds are the result of  "a swarm of several small earthquakes in a very short amount of time," Kuss said. Based on the data from eight seismic monitoring stations, Kuss said the USGS finally determined on Thursday that earthquakes were to blame. Caruso explained that the rock underneath Wisconsin and in much of the country east of the Rocky Mountains is "very consolidated" and without fault lines.
