-- The space shuttle program should have come to an end a long time ago, NASA administrator Charles Bolden told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday. "What is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the world, the United States of America, finds itself in a situation that we didn't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace shuttle when it lands its last landing," Bolden said. NASA originally planned to retire the aging shuttle fleet last September, but mission delays have pushed that date. Commanding that mission is astronaut Mark Kelly. STS-133 using Discovery sits on the launch pad ready to make its last trip into space Thursday.
