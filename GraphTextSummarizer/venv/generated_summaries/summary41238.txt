-- Real Madrid striker Alvaro Negredo has been sold to Spanish Primera Liga rivals Sevilla in a reported $21 million deal. Negredo completed his move after having a medical in Sevilla on Friday morning with last season's third-placers in La Liga clearly delighted with their acquisition. Negredo has signed a five-year deal at Sevilla, but Real Madrid confirmed on their official Web site www.realmadrid.com that they had the option to buy him back for the next two years. Negredo only rejoined Real last month having been loaned out to Almeria for the past two seasons, scoring 19 goals in the last campaign. The highly-rated Negredo was surplus to requirements at Real, who are looking to recoup some of the massive $363 million they have spent in the close season transfer window.
