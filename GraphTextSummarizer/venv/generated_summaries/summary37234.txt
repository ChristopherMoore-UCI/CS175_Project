The police officers appeared to have sided with the Progressive Party, which is loyal to former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled Maldives for 30 years before Nasheed defeated him. -- The president of the Maldives, one of the world's most popular honeymoon destinations, resigned Tuesday after a revolt by police officers, his spokesman said, leaving the normally idyllic chain of islands in chaos. The nation was rocked by violent protests last year that Nasheed accused Gayoom's supporters of orchestrating. Maldives is also grappling with a very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels. A peaceful standoff with members of the Maldives defense forces in the square turned violent early Tuesday morning, he said, describing the situation in Male as "chaos."
