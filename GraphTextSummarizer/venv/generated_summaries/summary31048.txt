However, the suspensions apply only to the pre-season Super Cup played between the league champions and Copa del Rey winners, and not other domestic matches. Barca's website noted on Wednesday that the Spanish Football federation's ruling indicated "the absence of injury or lack of conclusive evidence on the intention to do harm by Mr. Mourinho." Last season, Mourinho was given a European touchline ban for incidents in the tempestuous Champions League semifinal ties between the two teams. The 48-year-old was punished after being seen jabbing a finger into the eye of Barcelona assistant Tito Vilanova at the end of the second leg Spanish Super Cup in August. The August 17 match had erupted in ugly scenes in a repeat of last season's enmity between the two teams, with Barca winning 3-2 for a 5-4 aggregate success.
