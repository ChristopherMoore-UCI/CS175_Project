A former member of FIFA's ethics committee, Les Murray, says a member of the world governing body's executive committee asked a member of the Australian bid team for the 2022 World Cup for a kickback in exchange for a vote. "I am hoping FIFA will be much more careful who it awards the World Cup hosting rights to, or at least it tries to compel a future host of the World Cup to clean up its act in the area of human rights before the tournament can actually take place in that country." "Matters related to the 2018/2022 enquiry are solely handled by the investigatory chamber of the independent FIFA Ethics Committee and as such we are not in position to make any comments," said FIFA in a statement. FIFA sponsorship troubles continue While Murray refused to name the person who is alleged to have asked for a financial incentive and whether they are a current FIFA executive committee member, he says he was not surprised by the incident.
