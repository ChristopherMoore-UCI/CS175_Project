But Waggoner said Wednesday that he hopes to do more aid work in Haiti. A Haitian judge had concluded that sufficient evidence existed to hold Waggoner while investigators evaluated the father's complaint that the American kidnapped his critically-ill son from a hospital, according to Jon Piechowski, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Haiti. "Waggoner spent 18 harrowing days incarcerated in Haiti, accused of kidnapping a child despite undeniable evidence that the child in question had died at Haitian Community Hospital last February," the group said in a statement. Piechowski said Waggoner left Haiti without answering the accusations and was arrested December 12 after returning to the country. Waggoner was being transported Wednesday to a safe location to receive medical attention, according to a statement from Materials Management Relief Corps, a group that he co-founded.
