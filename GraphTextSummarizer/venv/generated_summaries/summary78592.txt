Economic issues played a large role in Sunday's vote, political analyst Carlos Germano told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Continuously weaving her role as the nation's leader with being the widow of former president Nestor Carlos Kirchner, who died in 2010, Fernandez said she carries her husband's ideals as she returns to office. -- Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became Latin America's first female president to win a second term when she sailed to victory in Argentina's elections. South America's second-largest economy has bounced back from the brink and shaped a most unlikely recovery, driven by high commodities demand from China and a series of unorthodox economic policies that worked to help shelter Argentina from much of the economic malaise that is gripping the rest of the planet right now. Binner told supporters Sunday that he had congratulated Kirchner on her win, Argentina's official Telam news agency reported.
