-- Toyota must start again, "from the bottom up," new president Akio Toyoda said Thursday. New Toyota boss Akio Toyoda says he will cut his salary by 30 percent. Analysts say Toyoda must drastically cut costs, but he offered no hints as to how or even whether that would be done at his first news conference as president. The company board formally approved Toyoda, 53, for the job on Tuesday. Toward that end, Toyoda named an executive vice president to head each region.
