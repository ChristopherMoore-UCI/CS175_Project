-- Russia's annexation of Crimea should not affect the country's sports teams, says Russian national football team coach Fabio Capello. The Italian, who previously coached England, has dismissed calls for Russia to be kicked out of the upcoming World Cup in Brazil and for it to be stripped of the right to host the 2018 tournament. When asked by CNN if he understands why people could choose to boycott a World Cup in Russia, Capello said: "I don't understand why you would boycott the World Cup or other sport competitions. If Russia is to compete when it welcomes the world, Capello says it must work on developing a new generation of talented players to replace an aging squad. " Two U.S. senators recently wrote a letter to football's global governing body FIFA calling for Russia to be expelled from the 2014 World Cup while also being stripped of its right to host the 2018 event.
