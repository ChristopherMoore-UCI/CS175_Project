"He was seen on the 15th, Friday, hanging out with his friends, talking to family members, all normal activities, nothing out of the ordinary that anyone detected," his brother Ravi told CNN affiliate WPRI on April 10. "Our concerns are first and foremost with Sunil and his family," Margaret Klawunn, vice president for student life and campus services at Brown University, said last month. The Tripathi family's search for the 22-year-old philosophy major has been detailed on a Facebook page, "Help us find Sunil Tripathi." -- The body of a young man found in the Providence River on Tuesday may be that of Sunil Tripathi, a student at Brown University who disappeared March 16, police told CNN. They temporarily took down the page after they were inundated by ugly comments when Sunil Tripathi was falsely accused on social media of being one of the Boston Marathon bombers.
