"The DEA has informed us that there was never a health risk to students in Harbin, including those on the same floor, beyond those who lived in the room," Todd Olson, vice president of student affairs, said in a statement to Georgetown students and faculty. Medical personnel evaluated seven people, including two security officers, at the scene, said fire department spokesman Pete Piringer In addition to the charges of drug paraphernalia possession, the men arrested could also potentially face federal drug trafficking charges if anything more serious is uncovered by the DEA's investigation, Payne said. MPD [Metropolitan Police Department] has arrested three individuals, two of whom are Georgetown undergraduates. Federal trafficking of Schedule 1 drugs carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, said Rusty Payne, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman.
