Doors away from the Parrot, you will find a Thai restaurant, smoke shop, kava bar, St. Barts coffee shop, tattoo parlors, bar/restaurant Cafe Bluefish, Yo Mama's homemade ice cream shop  and a couple of shops selling T-shirts and souvenirs. The strip, the section along the beach where most of the shops, hotels and restaurants are congregated, is still there, and the businesses have gone upscale over the past few years. " Fort Lauderdale, just north of Miami, is a beautiful oceanfront town known for seven miles of sandy beach. We would go to one of several restaurants, depending on our mood and how much we want to spend. A tip: Save your money on the new shirt and buy good sunscreen!
