Every day public TV in Japan encourages people to save energy, says Tokyo resident Koichi Yamamoto, who set up a blog for the posters. Yamamoto has been documenting where the posters have been appearing across Tokyo, from convenience stores to around the Tsukiji Honganji temple, and he says, the response to energy saving requests can be seen across the city. Starting this month the Japan government has called for a 15% cut in electricity use in Tokyo and the Tohoku region to avoid blackouts and power shortages. If traditional means of raising public opinion are on the rise, so too are traditional ways to combat summer heat, says Yamamoto. To complement the official "setsuden" advice, Japan's graphic designers have been engaging in some traditional means to help encourage citizens do their part -- providing public information posters.
