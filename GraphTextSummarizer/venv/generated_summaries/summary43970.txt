We exist in myriad traditions and cities throughout the U.S. Ordination in many traditions is often difficult and expensive, and finding teachers willing and able to address issues relative to being African-American is sometimes impossible. Five years ago, sangha members and I (three women of color) encountered a group of white male inmates, some of whom were white supremacists. Today, our prison group contains people from African, Latino, Asian and European backgrounds, and our conversations touch on the issues of racism and prejudice as well as the development of faith. My journey of faith began at age 11 when I began to study the Bible, inspired by Audrey Hepburn in "The Nun's Story" and enamored of Jeffrey Hunter in "King of Kings." Once I applied the concepts, I gained greater understanding that my suffering had purpose, and I could use that suffering to help others.
