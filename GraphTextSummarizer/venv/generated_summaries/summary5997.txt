The statue is part of the ancient Cherubim Monastery in the Qalamoun Mountains, a quiet, spiritual place that's very important to Syria's Christians. Many of Syria's Christians support the Assad regime, fearing that the end of the current government could lead to instability and an Islamist power grab. The dead are rebel fighters who tried to storm the monastery but were killed as they advanced, Syria's government says. Dozens of pro-Assad fighters, mostly Christians, as well as regular Syrian army forces, are stationed there. Many of the Christians in Saidnaya say they are under threat from radical Islamists among rebel fighters battling the Assad regime.
