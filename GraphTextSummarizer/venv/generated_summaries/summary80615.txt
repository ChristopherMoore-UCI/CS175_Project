She was listed in critical condition in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where paramedics took her by ambulance. "When patients have curable or treatable conditions, life support is used temporarily until the illness or disease can be stabilized and the body can resume normal functioning," the Cleveland Clinic website said. -- Joan Rivers has been moved out of the intensive care unit and into a private hospital room, her daughter said Wednesday. Melissa Rivers, who confirmed Tuesday that her mother was on life support, did not indicate if the change was the result of an improved medical condition six days after she suffered respiratory and cardiac arrest during a medical procedure. It is not clear if Rivers is still on life support, which "replaces or supports a failing bodily function," according to an explanation from the Cleveland Clinic.
