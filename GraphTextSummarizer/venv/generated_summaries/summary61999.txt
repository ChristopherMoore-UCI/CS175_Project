Inside the ferry, Lim told YTN he stayed in a room until rescuers opened a door and threw life jackets in his direction. Survivor accounts Shortly before 9 a.m. Wednesday, passenger Kim Sung-Mook was eating breakfast in the ship's main hall when he felt a tilt, he told CNN affiliate YTN. The parents of students from a South Korean high school have been clutching their cell phones, waiting for a call from their children or rescuers. He was ordered to jump into the ocean, which he described as "unbearably cold." After his rescue, Lim went on air on YTN to list the names of his classmates whom he had seen to reassure their parents that they were safe. The students who fell into the water were "having difficulties due to their body temperatures dropping, but they have blankets and changed their clothes, so they're feeling better now," Lim told YTN.
