-- A confidential report on safety conditions aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, conducted about one month before the rig's explosion, points to widespread fear of reprisal for reporting employee mistakes that could undermine safety aboard the rig. The report concluded, "Deepwater Horizon was relatively strong in many of the core aspects of safety management." A spokesperson for Transocean insisted the study of employees aboard Deepwater Horizon reflected the company's commitment to safety. "This rig did go seven years without a lost-time incident or any major environmental accidents," said spokesman Lou Colasuonno. Transocean has commissioned safety surveys of its staff aboard 20 other drilling rigs.
