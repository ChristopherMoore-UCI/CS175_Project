-- Troubled U.S. insurer AIG will end its shirt sponsorship deal with Premier League and European champions Manchester United next year. It was widely believed that AIG would not renew their £19 million ($27 million) per year shirt deal when the four-year contract expired in 2010, due to the financial troubles the company has suffered. Despite the loss of AIG, a Manchester United spokesman told the UK Press Association that the Premier League giants hoped to better the current deal it had with the U.S. insurer. World Club champions United also have strong links in both Malaysia and South Korea. "The club is in dialogue with a select number of top companies worldwide and has so far received sufficient interest to be confident it can improve on its current £19 million annual partnership with AIG.
