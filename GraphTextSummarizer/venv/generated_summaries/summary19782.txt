In 2012, samples from a 2,000-year-old stalagmite also showed that drought had afflicted the region in the latter half of the first millennium A.D. The main finding was that a prolonged drought contributed to the collapse of Classic Mayan civilization," environmental archaeologist Douglas Kennett told LiveScience two years ago. New research reinforces that theory, Rice University Earth scientist Andre Droxler told LiveScience. The Mayan civilization, noted for its advances in astronomy and agriculture (not to mention that calendar system that some believed prophesied world devastation on December 21, 2012), dominated the Yucatan in the first half of the first millennium A.D. But from about A.D. 800 to 1000, the ratio between the two elements was much smaller, indicating that there was much less rainfall.
