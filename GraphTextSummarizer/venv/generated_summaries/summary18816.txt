" European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, EU Council president Herman Van Rompuy and European Parliament president Martin Schulz will represent the 500 million citizens of the union at the ceremony at Oslo City Hall. It cited progress in peace made by EU candidate nations, such as the former Yugoslav republics. The EU will allocate the 8 million kronor ($1.2 million) prize money to support educational projects for children in conflict regions and will add to the sum to more than double it, according to a statement on the EU website. The Union does not qualify as a peacemaker as defined by the prize's founder, Alfred Nobel, said Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mairead Maguire and Adolfo Perez Esquivel. The three presidents of the EU's main bodies will take the podium together to accept it.
