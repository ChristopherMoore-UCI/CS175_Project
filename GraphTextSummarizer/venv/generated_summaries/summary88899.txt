At present, there is no financial backing for the space elevator project, and all of the Japanese group's 100-plus members maintain other jobs to earn a living. "Because we don't have a material which has enough strength to construct space elevator yet, it is difficult to change people's mind so they believe that it can be real," he said. "As the base of space elevator will be located on geosynchronous orbit, [the] space elevator ground station should be located near the equator," he said. A conference discussing developments in space elevator concepts is being held in Japan in November, and hundreds of engineers and scientists from Asia, Europe and the Americas are working to design the only lift that will take you directly to the one hundred-thousandth floor. Lift to space: This is a NASA interpretation of what a space elevator may look like. Currently, it is the only material with the potential to be strong enough to use to manufacture elevator cable, according to Tsuchida.
