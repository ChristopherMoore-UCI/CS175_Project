In Jordan, the state-run Petra News Agency reported that Prime Minister Marouf Al Bakhit had urged his Syrian counterpart, Adel Safar, "to immediately halt military operations, implement speedy reform and spare the blood of the Syrian people, expressing the kingdom's rejection and regret over the continued killing and escalation in neighboring Syria." Also Monday, a day after opposition groups told CNN that Syrian security forces backed by gunships killed at least 25 people in a crackdown on protesters in Latakia, security forces began urging residents to evacuate or risk being arrested or killed, an activist there told CNN. -- Two of Syria's neighbors joined growing international calls Monday for Damascus to halt its violent crackdown on anti-government protesters -- calls that came even as the violence itself continued. Bahrain and Kuwait also have recalled their ambassadors from Syria and called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to end the crackdowns. "Syrian people should know that we are on their side with regard to their legitimate democratic rights,"  he said.
