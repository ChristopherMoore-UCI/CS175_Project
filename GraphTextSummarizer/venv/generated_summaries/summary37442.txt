Alan Rachins: I'm married to Bochco's sister (Joanna Frank, who later played Brackman's wife, Sheila, on "L.A. Law"), which is how we were able to invite him to the L.A. film festival to see Henry Jaglom's film "Always." Co-created by Steven Bochco, hot off his success with "Hill Street Blues," the series was set at the high-priced Los Angeles law firm of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak. Most of all, it pushed the boundaries of the legal show the way "Hill Street" did with cop shows. Bochco being Bochco, the hard stuff was paired with moments of silly humor and steamy sex (or silly sex and steamy humor), making for a high-wire balance of drama and comedy. CNN spoke to Smits, now a star of "Sons of Anarchy" who played idealistic Hispanic attorney Victor Sifuentes, and Alan Rachins, who played bottom-line-oriented partner Douglas Brackman Jr. and later starred on "Dharma and Greg," about the show and its impact.
