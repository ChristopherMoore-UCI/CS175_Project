In 2005, a New Jersey law took effect requiring health care professionals or companies to notify the state Division of Consumer Affairs of concerns or misconduct of health care workers who could endanger patients. The health care industry was especially affected by the economic downturn in recent years, said American Staffing Association spokesman Steve Berchem. Scott Schnierer, vice president of business development for Comforce Staffing Services, said that most staffing firms conduct a seven-year background check on potential employees. "Hospitals are turning to staffing firms to fill those vacancies to make sure they have the employees and staff and skills they need to ensure quality care." While the hepatitis C infections have prompted concerns about whether contract workers are providing substandard care, research shows the opposite is generally true.
