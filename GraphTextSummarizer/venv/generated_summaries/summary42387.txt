Noriega and his attorneys had argued that the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989. "I received high praise from the U.S., Interpol and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs," Noriega said. While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke. Testifying in Spanish -- and standing for a total of five hours with only two five-minute breaks -- he added, "I was especially in contact with the CIA," describing himself as a "mediator." Noriega was extradited from the United States to France in April to face charges that he laundered drug-trafficking profits of 15 million French francs, or 2.3 million euros (U.S. $2.8 million). U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April after he spent more than 20 years in a U.S. federal prison.
