Next week the Spaniard -- who suffered a back injury in last year's Australian Open final and skipped last year's U.S. Open with a wrist complaint -- competes at the Qatar Open in nearby Doha. He made another one Friday at the exhibition Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi but it didn't last long, as the 14-time grand slam champion was crushed by Andy Murray 6-2 6-0 in the semifinals. Novak Djokovic -- Murray's pal and victim in both of his successes in grand slam finals -- on Saturday. He cut ties with his co-coach and good friend Dani Vallverdu and longtime fitness trainer Jez Green. While Nadal most certainly would have wanted to put up a better showing, he'll probably just be happy -- for the moment -- that he has physically recovered from the appendix surgery that forced him to skip the year-end ATP World Tour Finals in London last November.
