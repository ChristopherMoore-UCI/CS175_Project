Brandon was playing in and around his 4-year-old friend's Toms River home on Monday evening when the younger child left the yard and went inside, police explained. The father of the Toms River, New Jersey, boy -- who died earlier this week after being shot by his young playmate -- said he and his wife decided to donate Brandon's organs, in hopes some good will come of their tragedy. The next day, at 5 p.m., Brandon was pronounced dead at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune. Before the play date, the gun talk "A shot went out, and the 6-year-old was struck in the head," police Chief Michael Mastronardy said. The late boy's uncle, Randy Holt, told the newspaper that Brandon was "a gift."
