"He helped redesign the library system in the department of corrections," said Drizin, who also commended Heirens for becoming a "first-rate jailhouse lawyer." Drizin said Heirens has been eligible for parole nearly every year since the 1970s. On August 7, 1946, Heirens supplied it, describing how he killed Degnan, Brown and Ross. Heirens has been locked behind bars and walls for 63 years, making inmate C06103 the longest-serving prisoner in Illinois history, state officials say. " While Drizin, who has represented Heirens since 2001, and others passionately plead for his release and prepare to re-petition the state parole board that has consistently refused to free Heirens, others are convinced he is a manipulative murderer. Drizin said Heirens was subjected to days of brutal interrogation.
