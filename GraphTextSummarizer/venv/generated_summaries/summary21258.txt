U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a letter, obtained by CNN Friday, that federal agents would continue to enforce federal marijuana laws and warned Prop. 19, if passed, would be a major stumbling block to federal partnerships between state and local authorities around drug enforcement. His letter was a response to an August letter from several former directors of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration urging the White House to block Prop. The measure would legalize recreational use in the state, though federal officials have said they would continue to enforce drug laws in California if the initiative is approved. -- Former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders told CNN Sunday she supports legalizing marijuana. "We have the highest number of people in the world being criminalized, many for non-violent crimes related to marijuana," said Elders.
