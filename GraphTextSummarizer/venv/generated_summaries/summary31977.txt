"The demand for the iPhone is so intense in the markets where we aren't offering it that people are exporting it out of the U.S. in many different ways and then running it on local carriers," Cook said. Apple representatives declined to comment on the unlocking phenomenon and iPhones making their way overseas, referring CNN to a Wired article that quoted Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook speaking at the Goldman Sachs Technology Symposium in February. But before the phone can work on a local network, it must be unlocked or "jailbroken," tech lingo for reprogramming the iPhone to work on network carriers not affiliated with Apple. For 100 NIS (about U.S. $30), Steinman, a Russian immigrant, will unlock an iPhone in about 20 minutes, replacing the factory-provided SIM card with the customer's SIM of choice. In order to protect these alliances, Apple issues this disclaimer to customers planning to reprogram the iPhone: Unlock at your own risk.
