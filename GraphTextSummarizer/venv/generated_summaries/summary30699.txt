This isn't to say that the DRM-free tracks available at Amazon or eMusic are any less valid, but let's face it: just about everybody who carries an iPod or iPhone also uses iTunes as the gateway for purchasing music.) And most people do feel like suckers when DRM locks them out of something that they feel they have every right to use, often to the point of attempting to circumnavigate this crappy, unfair system by means that might lead to trouble. You could play 'em over and over until they were scratched beyond repair, you could lend 'em to friends, you could amplify 'em at illicit Charleston dancing parties, you could sell 'em to used record stores or you could store 'em away in a safe deposit box in hopes they'd gain value as collector's items. You see, you don't really buy music for keeps anymore.
