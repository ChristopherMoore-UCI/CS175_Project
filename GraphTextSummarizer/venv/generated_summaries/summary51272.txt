Meanwhile, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine on Friday certified a petition for a proposed amendment allowing for medical marijuana, the first step in an attempt by the Ohio Rights Group to put the issue to a statewide vote in 2014. The Illinois Senate approved the use of marijuana for medical purposes on Friday, sending the measure to the governor's desk. To be prescribed medical marijuana, patients would need to have one of 42 conditions, including cancer and HIV, according to the legislation. The move by Illinois lawmakers came the same day that Ohio's attorney general certified a petition for a proposed amendment that would allow marijuana be used for industrial, medical and therapeutic purposes. "Without passing upon the advisability of the approval or rejection of the measure to be referred, I hereby certify that the summary is a fair and truthful statement of the proposed constitutional amendment," DeWine said in a letter to the Ohio Ballot Board.
