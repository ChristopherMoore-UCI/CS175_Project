-- A Norwegian U.N. official snatched from the streets of Yemen's capital city of Sanaa by armed tribesmen nearly two weeks ago was released unharmed, officials said Friday. The U.N. official, who was not identified, had been released following negotiations by Yemeni officials, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store said in a statement. The kidnappers were demanding the release of Ali Nasser Hareekdan, whom a local council official in Mareb province said was the prime suspect behind the killing of four Yemeni troops. The victim was part of a team of U.N. election observers scheduled to oversee Yemen's presidential elections in February, officials said. Tribal sources said six men forced the Norwegian into a vehicle and drove him off to Mareb, about 170 km (105 miles) north of Sanaa.
