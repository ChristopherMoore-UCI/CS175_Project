Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 5087 was coming in for a landing at the Little Rock National Airport in Arkansas when the pilot made an emergency call at 4:38 p.m., according to FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford. The plane landed about 30 minutes later with "significant damage to the nose," said airport spokesman T.J. Williams. -- A commuter plane with dozens of passengers aboard struck a flock of large birds, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing, the Federal Aviation Administration said Friday. Photographs taken of the plane after it landed revealed a gaping hole at the tip of the aircraft, along with several dents. ASA is a regional partner of Delta Air Lines.
