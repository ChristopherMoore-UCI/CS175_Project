"That'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits." Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks. Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. A 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day.
