The country was plunged into political instability in January after thousands of people took to the streets to protest rising food prices and what they perceived as autocratic behavior by Ravalomanana. The opposition leader had called for Ravalomanana's arrest, accusing him of corruption, financial mismanagement and dictatorship. -- Madagascar's military handed over the reins of the island nation to opposition leader Andry Rajoelina on Wednesday, ending a two-month long political crisis -- but apparently creating a constitutional one. Madagascar's former president, Marc Ravalomanana, ceded power to his military Tuesday after insisting over the weekend that he would remain in control. Analysts think Ravalomanana had little choice but to step down once he had lost much of the army's support.
