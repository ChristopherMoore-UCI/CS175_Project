I'm Facebook friends with the friend of a friend of a friend I met at a birthday party last year, and the woman who sold me my wedding dress, and the girl I randomly made paella with in a cooking class nine months ago. But one of the best things about best friends is that they aren't romantic partners. My rule of thumb, which I offer to you, is this: If we can be Facebook friends, we can be face-to-face friends. What does it mean to not dive but rather cannonball into a sea of best friend prospects? So now that I've moved 800 miles away from my be-there-whenever-I-need-them friends -- which makes it a lot harder for them to physically be here whenever I need them -- I'm in the market for a new addition to the list.
