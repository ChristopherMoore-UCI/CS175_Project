Members of the public who are concerned they will be subjected to this kind of cavity search as part of a routine traffic stop can probably rest easy; it appears from the face of the complaint that Eckert was someone who was on law enforcement radar for some time. Generally, police won't be liable for bad searches if they have a good argument for probable cause. The law is well-settled in this area: For a rectal search, police need a high degree of probable cause and a warrant. Even a canine alert of someone's pants area should not automatically constitute probable cause for a colonoscopy warrant. To bolster their probable cause, police also allegedly justified the "search" by citing Eckert's reputation.
