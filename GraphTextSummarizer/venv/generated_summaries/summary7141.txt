Officials had said ground stops were also in effect at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Long Beach Airport and John Wayne Airport, all in California. Departure delays of up to two hours were reported at LAX, one hour at Salt Lake City International Airport and up to an hour and a half at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. -- Computer issues prompted a temporary ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Wednesday. All arriving flights that were inside the flight center's airspace at the time of the ground stop landed at the airport, according to LAX spokeswoman Nancy Suey Castles. The computer failure occurred at the Federal Aviation Administration's Los Angeles Flight Center, which controls air traffic for the region.
