But after this golden age, moon exploration was seen as not cost effective for international space agencies. On July 20, 1969, eight years after President Kennedy implored the U.S. congress for funding for space exploration, NASA's Apollo 11 spaceflight touched down on the moon. But it suffered a critical malfunction just half way through and bid farewell to humanity in a final report (although it is still functioning, according to Chinese press reports). "We are encouraged to see this prize pushing the industry to take risks and invest in cutting-edge technologies to support lunar exploration, which will result in an entirely new economy around low-cost access to the moon and beyond. "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth."
