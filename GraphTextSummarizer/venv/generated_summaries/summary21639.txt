-- After 100 episodes of alternate universes, monsters and shape-shifters, Fox's "Fringe" is coming to an end on Friday night. John Noble ("Walter Bishop"): "It's unbelievable to go out on our own terms. It's funny because he's been on enough times that I forget, but of course, Leonard Nimoy (was a favorite). On filming the finale: Anna Torv ("Olivia Dunham"): "We knew it would be our last season, and part of that meant that we were able to appreciate it as we were doing it. It's set to receive a proper send-off, too, thanks to the efforts of fans who fought for the show through five seasons of time slot changes and dwindling ratings.
