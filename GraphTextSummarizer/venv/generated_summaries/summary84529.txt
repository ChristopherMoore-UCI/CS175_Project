Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a possible 2016 White House contender, said Tuesday that he would not be dissuaded by recent CNN poll numbers showing him trailing badly among New Hampshire Republicans. Asked about efforts to confront ISIS in the Middle East, Jindal said Congress should back White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels. Only 3% of New Hampshire Republican primary voters backed him in CNN's September 8-11 survey. Jindal tackled a number of subjects likely to prove popular with GOP primary voters, including the need for further spending controls and complaints of a "war on religious liberty" in the United States. "If I were to decide to run for 2016, it would have nothing to do with polls or fundraising numbers," he said.
