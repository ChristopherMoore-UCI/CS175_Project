Raising animals for meat is much less efficient than growing vegetables: Think back to those food chain diagrams from elementary school. Because growing vegetables is more land-efficient than growing meat, we would need to eat far less meat in order to avoid taking over more forests for farms, said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University. Eating meat adds to your greenhouse gas footprint: Finally, eating animals, like doing almost anything, contributes to a person's greenhouse gas footprint. It started while I was doing research for a story on illegal animal trafficking, and I was reading books, including Dana Goodyear's "Anything that Moves" -- about how the American foodie scene is trending toward the bizarre and endangered (witness the 2010 bust of a California restaurant serving whale) -- and Jonathan Safran Foer's "Eating Animals," which argues, in part, that one cannot eat meat and also earnestly claim to be an environmentalist. "(S)omeone who regularly eats factory-farmed animal products cannot call himself an environmentalist without divorcing that word from its meaning," he wrote in that book. The United Nations estimates animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of human greenhouse gas emissions, with the main source of those emissions -- 45% of the total -- being the fossil fuels used while growing and fertilizing crops to feed the animals.
