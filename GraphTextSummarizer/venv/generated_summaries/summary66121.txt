See Sound Lounge (115 Blanchard Street) is a stylish bar with futuristic décor and a knack of attracting top house DJs, while Cha Cha Lounge (1013 Pike Street) is a quasi dive bar decorated with images of Mexican wrestlers. Until then, there's always Re-Bar (1114 Howell Street), which also puts on some fantastic club nights, and Chop Suey (1325 East Madison) -- a hip, and often unbearably hot, place to check out up-and-coming bands and DJs. The Elysian Brewing Company (1221 East Pike Street) and Elliot Bay Brewery and Pub (4720 California Avenue SW) are both worth checking out. Dimitriou's Jazz Alley (2033 Sixth Avenue) is an excellent jazz venue and there's live music almost every night at the Tractor Tavern (5213 Ballard Avenue). If it's a classy cocktail you're after then Zig Zag Café (1501 Western Avenue) is the place for you.
