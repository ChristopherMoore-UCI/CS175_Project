The parents of American Shane Todd, found hanging in his Singapore apartment last June, tell CNN they may exhume their son's body to conduct an autopsy in the United States. Just hours before, a key witness for the Todd family, American medical examiner Dr Edward Adelstein, retracted his original assertion that Shane Todd had been strangled by a cord and hanged. " The inquiry into the death of Todd, found hanging in his Singapore apartment on June 24, comes after Singapore's medical examiner concluded that Todd committed suicide. Testifying via video link, Adelstein agreed with other forensic pathologists in the case including two U.S. medical examiners, who reviewed the case at Singapore's request, that there would need to be evidence of internal neck injuries if Todd had been "garroted." However, Adelstein continued to assert that Todd had been murdered and speculated that he had been killed and then hanged to make it look like suicide. The Todds walked out of the Singapore inquiry into their son's death earlier this week, saying, "We've lost faith in the process" and Singapore's inquiry process was "pre-determined" to conclude their son's death was a suicide, and that police and investigators never considered evidence that may suggest Todd was murdered.
