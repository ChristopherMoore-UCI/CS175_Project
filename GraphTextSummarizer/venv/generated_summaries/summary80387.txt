As the last few weeks of military battles against ISIS show, when American assistance has not been forthcoming, the Iraqi Kurds have turned to Iran for help. In a press conference with the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, in Irbil on August 26, Masoud Barzani, President of Iraqi Kurdistan, said "Iraqi Kurds will never forget Iran's support that came at a crucial time beyond our expectation." As much as the Kurds have welcomed Iran's role in rolling back ISIS, there are fears about the longer-term impact of Tehran's larger footprint in Iraqi Kurdistan. One such partner are the Kurds of northern Iraq who regard ISIS as the biggest threat since the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. But given the imminent threat posed by ISIS, how Iranian military support has come about is for now a secondary concern for Iraq's Kurds.
