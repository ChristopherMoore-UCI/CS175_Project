The arrest comes just three months after Iowa Gov. Chet Culver honored four men for diving into the Iowa River to rescue Kehoe and her sons on a cold December afternoon last year. The attacks have rattled the community of Coralville, a suburb of Iowa City where Kehoe and her husband, Eugene, lived with their sons. Kehoe faces life in prison on charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and child endangerment resulting in serious injury. She stated that she wanted to die or be locked up where she couldn't hurt anyone." After speaking with investigators, Kehoe was taken to the hospital to be treated for her own wounds and trauma, said prosecutor Vander Hart, declining to elaborate. Scars on his neck underscore the chilling account he gave police, contained in a police affidavit filed in Buchanan County court.
