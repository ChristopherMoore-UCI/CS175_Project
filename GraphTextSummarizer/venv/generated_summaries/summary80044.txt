The cooling system for a nuclear reactor at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant lost power for hours Friday afternoon but was operational again, officials at the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the Fukushima plant, has said it is monitoring radiation contamination levels around the plant. Metal panels were to be installed Friday around the cooling system to ward off small animals, a Tokyo Electric Power Company spokesman said. The result was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, as the crippled reactors spewed enormous amounts of radioactive particles into the environment. Last month, power outages at the critical nuclear facility were blamed on rats short circuiting a switchboard, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.
