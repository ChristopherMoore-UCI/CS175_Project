-- Jared Lee Loughner was up all night before gunning down 19 people -- six fatally -- outside an Arizona supermarket, taking several trips to the supermarket's shopping plaza in between checking in at an area hotel and visiting two Walmarts to buy ammunition, according to a timeline released Friday by the Pima County Sheriff's Office. Pima County on Thursday released records saying that Loughner visited the Rio Nuevo One-Stop Career Center in September, but was asked to leave because he was using a video camera and refused to turn it off despite being asked repeatedly. The first 911 call went out a minute later, and by 10:15 a.m., Loughner had been detained -- but not before 19 people had been shot, including his alleged main target, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The incidents and disruptions continued into autumn, the records said, and college officials became concerned about Loughner's mental health. A teenager walking his dog spotted the bag Thursday in a dry riverbed near Loughner's family home, officials said.
