It left him one minute 24 seconds ahead of Qatar's Nasser Al-Attiyah with race leader Carlos Sainz over three minutes back. Al-Attiyah, who won the third stage, is two minutes 33 seconds back in third in a tight battle for race honors. Peterhansel is optimistic that he can secure his 10th Dakar Rally triumph. Sainz, who has seen his overall lead over Peterhansel cut to two minutes 26 seconds, and Volkwagen teammate Al-Attiyah, both had navigational problems in the dunes to lose time. Dutchman Frans Verhoeven, on another BMW, was third with overall leader Marc Coma of Spain on a KTM.
