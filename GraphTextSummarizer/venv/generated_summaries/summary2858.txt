Liberals wanted to give people like Clarence Thomas every right except, it turns out, the right to think for themselves. Like this one: "My sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference-conscious than I was in the 1960s when I went to school," Thomas told the audience. And yet, we can expect Thomas' observation about "northern liberal elites" to resonate with many other African-Americans and Latinos who have been criticized, attacked, or disparaged by this bunch for veering off the script of how minorities are supposed to think, speak and behave. Most Americans probably look back on Thomas' confirmation hearings in the fall of 1991, and think that what made them so messy were those unseemly accusations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill. News and confirmed by several people who attended the talk and heard the remarks firsthand, Thomas dropped a few bombshells.
