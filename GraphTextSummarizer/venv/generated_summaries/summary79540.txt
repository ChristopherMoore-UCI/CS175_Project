-- A new report by the Government Accountability Office says behavior detection techniques failed to lead authorities to at least 16 alleged terrorists who traveled through U.S. airports. The GAO also said if there is airport video of any of the suspected or admitted terrorists, that would be a valuable tool for behavior detection officers to study. The unclassified version of the report released Thursday did not name the suspected terrorists who the GAO says were able to pass 23 times through airports where behavior detection officers work. The GAO made a number of recommendations, including that TSA should have an independent panel of experts examine its scientific methods, and that TSA should do a cost-benefit analysis to see how effective behavior detection is compared with random screening and other methods. Although Mica supports behavior detection, he said the TSA has not carried out its program effectively.
