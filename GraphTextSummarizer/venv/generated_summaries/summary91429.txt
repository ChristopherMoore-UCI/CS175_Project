A 1-0 win over last year's Champions League finalist Borussia Dortmund proved Arsenal can mix it with Europe's elite when it really matters. Dortmund huffed and puffed as they searched for an equalizer but only a superb save by Roman Weidenfeller denied Ramsey a second as Arsenal broke at speed. Having lost the home fixture against the German side in north London two weeks ago, victory was essential for Arsenal to keep hold of its own destiny. Dortmund pushed forward again after the interval but it was Arsenal which struck the killer blow with 62 minutes on the clock. Chelsea looks in good shape to qualify from Group E following a 3-0 win over German side Schalke.
