The trips comes after Kim visited Russia earlier this week, where he said North Korea is ready to return to nuclear talks without preconditions, according to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's spokeswoman. RIA-Novosti said Kim's train consists of 17 rail cars, plus four Russian cars that were added in Russia's Far East to transport local Russian officials and extra security guards and service personnel. In addition to Russia and North Korea, the talks also include South Korea, Japan, the United States and China. -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Il arrived in China Thursday after a visit to Russia, the state-run Xinhua news agency in China reported. While North Korea has called for the resumption of six-party talks without preconditions before, the United States and South Korea have insisted on a tangible demonstration from North Korea that it is serious about denuclearization.
