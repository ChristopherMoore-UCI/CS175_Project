Chinese environmentalist Ma Jun says the new rollout of PM 2.5 readings in China is the direct result of online people power. A former journalist, Ma has become one of China's leading environmental watchdogs. Ma and his team at the Beijing-based non-profit Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) have launched a social media mapping program to name and shame China's biggest polluters. Social protest in China has forced the government's hand to offer better air quality monitoring. It's his personal and professional mission to bring better air to the people of China.
