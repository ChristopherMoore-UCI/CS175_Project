According to a story in the Bangkok Post, flight attendants who don't meet the airline's body mass index and waistline controls, imposed last year, have been limited to service on domestic and same-day-return flights. Earlier this year, female Thai Airways flight attendants over the age of 45 were given the option of early retirement through a buyout package instituted as part of the airline's drive to rejuvenate its image and save costs. They were told the regulation is not illegal and falls within the authority of management, which was concerned about customer service. If they don't comply after a year, they will be transferred to ground services. CNNGo: World's hottest airline crews ranked Â© 2011 Cable News Network Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
