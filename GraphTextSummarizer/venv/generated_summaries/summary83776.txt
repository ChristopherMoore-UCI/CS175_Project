"Depending upon weather conditions, mid-September is the current estimate of the most likely date by which the relief well will intercept the MC252 well," BP said in a statement Friday, using the shorthand reference to the well's official designation, Mississippi Canyon Block 252. -- A blowout preventer that may hold important forensic evidence as to why it failed, triggering the world's largest accidental oil spill, has been brought to the surface of the Gulf and placed on a vessel, officials said Saturday night. A new blowout preventer was installed atop BP's plugged well late Friday. Once the new device is successfully tested, BP will drill the last remaining feet of a relief well to intercept the damaged well. He provided details on the installation of the new blowout preventer late Friday.
