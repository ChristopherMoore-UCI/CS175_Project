-- Serena Williams came from a set down against Maria Sharapova to win the Miami Masters for a record sixth time on Saturday. Williams joins Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Chris Evert as only the fourth player ever to win any WTA event six times. Williams' win -- the 48th of her career -- means she surpasses the previous all-time title mark that she jointly held with Germany's Steffi Graf. "It's disappointing to end it like this but Serena played a great match, and I'm sure we'll play a few more times this year," Sharapova said, WTATennis.com reported. The match was turned on its head in the sixth game of the second set with Sharapova serving at 3-2.
