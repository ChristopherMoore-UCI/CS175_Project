After completing a doctorate in Cleaner Production and Industrial Eco-systems, Al Nuaimi -- whose uncle is ruler of Ajman, the smallest of the UAE's seven emirates -- joined the government as environmental adviser. CNN: What do you think the problems are when it comes to environment in the UAE? The Green Sheikh now works as chairman of the International Steering Committee for the Global Initiative Towards a Sustainable Iraq and is honorable president of the Zayed Environmental Impact Network, at the UAE's Zayed University. But, Al Nuaimi, 45, affectionately known internationally as the "Green Sheikh," abandoned a lucrative career in the petroleum industry to pursue a vocation defending the climate. Al Nuaimi: It is not what people normally think of green like (the) color of an object.
