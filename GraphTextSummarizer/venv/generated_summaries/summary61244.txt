AOL Autos: Luxury cars with best gas mileage "The average driver drives about 30 miles a day," says Tony Posawatz, Chevrolet's vehicle line director for the Volt. That's because a plug-in electric car would only cost about 12 cents per kilowatt hour to operate, said Mark Duvall, program manager for electric transportation at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) -- the research and development arm of the electric utility industry. Posawatz also noted that "one challenge has been getting the weight of the battery pack down, and we now have it down to 375 pounds." As for cost, Posawatz is also aware that "the price of the first batteries are frankly going to be unacceptable, from a long-term perspective, but we're marching ahead regardless, because we know that once we get these cars into the marketplace, and the sales volume increases, the cost will come down.
