-- One man died and another was injured after they set themselves on fire Tuesday in Egypt, the latest in a string of self-immolations in restive North Africa, officials told CNN. Now, reports are coming in from other countries in the region -- including Algeria and Mauritania -- that other people are turning to self-immolation, even though it is too soon to know how many of the incidents were sparked by political and social grievances. News reports out of Mauritania say a man set himself on fire Monday in front of the presidential palace. At Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 2001, five people lit themselves on fire in front of a CNN crew. In Algeria, security officials said Sunday that three people set themselves on fire.
