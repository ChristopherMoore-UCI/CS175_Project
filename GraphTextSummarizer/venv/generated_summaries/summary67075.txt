On Sunday evening, internet service outages affected Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana and Michigan, according to a Twitter account for Comcast customer service. The outage came on the eve of Cyber Monday, the annual online equivalent of Black Friday when internet retailers roll out their bargains for holiday shoppers. "I apologize for the down time," representative Bill Gerth said via Twitter late Sunday, adding that crews were working as quickly as possible to resolve the domain name system outage. At about 1 a.m. ET Monday, Gerth tweeted, "Everyone should be just about back online, if not should be very shortly." Last weekend, customers on the East Coast also experienced outages. -- For the second time in a week, Comcast customers found themselves offline -- this time, in the Midwest.
