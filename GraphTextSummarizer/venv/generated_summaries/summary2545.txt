"Nevertheless, I remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like Mr. Nieuwenhuizen -- is a force for good, and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs. Nieuwenhuizen's death has resonated across the globe, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter among those extending condolences. The latter is the father of a player of the Amsterdam junior side Nieuw Sloten that played in the match against SC Buitenboys, for whom 41-year-old Richard Nieuwenhuizen had volunteered to act as linesman for the December 2 game. Nieuwenhuizen's son was playing for Buitenboys when the incident occurred in the city of Almere. Last weekend, 33,000 amateur football games across the Netherlands were canceled in tribute to Nieuwenhuizen, who was buried on Monday.
