Nickerson's group is investigating a range of bacteria found in food, water and our gut flora, including Salmonella typhimurium, a common cause of food poisoning and diarrhea, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a known water contaminant. Far from just a health hazard, bacteria could be used to help sustain astronauts in space, as a source of food and oxygen. "For space missions the mass of oxygen, food, and water is high and not compatible with current launch technologies. The chosen range of bacteria not only utilize carbon dioxide but can also harness other human waste products, such as urine and feces -- a win-win given their growth results in food for the astronauts. What's more, the weightless microgravity environment of space can alter bacteria as they grow.
