When asked by reporters earlier in the week if this was true, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, "Genetic testing is a useful tool for verifying a biological relationship." Mariam -- or Abrar -- is currently hoping her that the courts will believe the story of her life as she tells it, according to her husband. "Firstly I want to say, I am the brother of the convicted woman Abrar al-Hadi", he tells CNN in his first sit-down interview since the woman he claims is his sister -- known as Mariam Yahya Ibrahim in media reports -- was sentenced to death by a court in Sudan for abandoning the Muslim faith. "Her name isn't Mariam, her name is Abrar al-Hadi. The documents -- which the court ruled to be genuine -- purport to show that the fingerprints recorded for the national identity card issued in the name of "Abrar" at the Sudanese government registry offices were an exact match to those the court took from Mariam. Al-Hadi says his mother and brothers attended their sister's university graduation ceremony in Khartoum.
