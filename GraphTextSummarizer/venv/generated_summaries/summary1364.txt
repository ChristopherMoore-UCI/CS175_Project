Ward died Saturday night from injuries suffered when he was hit on a small dirt track by the race car of NASCAR star Tony Stewart. People could see him riding his bicycle as fast as he could up and down the streets of Port Leyden, a village in upstate New York. "His dad was right there with him every time," the mayor of Lyons Falls, New York, Katie Liendecker, told the Charlotte Observer. The 20-year-old had gotten out of his car after a tangle with Stewart caused him to spin out, and he appeared to want to vent his anger at the three-time NASCAR champion. But there isn't a lot of money in sprint car racing, even for the winners.
