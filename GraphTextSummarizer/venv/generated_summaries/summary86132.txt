In his opening statement, defense attorney Tim Moore read a text Kyle sent to Littlefield about Routh as the three men rode in Kyle's pickup truck to the range. Eddie Ray Routh is accused of killing Kyle and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a firing range at Rough Creek Lodge, about 90 miles southwest of Dallas on February 2, 2013. The trial of the man accused of killing Chris Kyle, the protagonist in the top-selling book and hit movie "American Sniper," began Wednesday with a lawyer using Kyle's own words to bolster an insanity defense. So while we don't know what the conversation was, we do know what Chris Kyle was thinking at the time he was in that truck." Moore said Routh killed the two men because he suffered "a psychosis so severe that at that point in time he did not know what he was doing was wrong. ... Routh shot Kyle five times in the back and side and once in the side of the head, using a .45-caliber pistol, and shot Littlefield with a 9 mm pistol four times in the back, once in the hand, once in the face and once in the head, Nash said.
