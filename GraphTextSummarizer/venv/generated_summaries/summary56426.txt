The list intentionally includes details for places like coffee shops where, even if they're not a place you'd normally associate with health care, people can meet with advisers who can guide them toward a plan, New York state health department spokesman Bill Schwarz explained. The health insurance marketplace opened on October 1, providing a navigator with a 230-page list of agency locations and site schedules in New York state, including phone numbers to call with health insurance inquiries. There's just one problem: This week, the list included businesses whose owners have no idea how to give New Yorkers health insurance advice. But since October 1, Wu said he's personally answered more than 50 additional calls each day from New Yorkers inquiring about health insurance. On the bright side, Brooklyn Cupcake employees are hopeful the extra calls will result in more cupcake sales, he said.
