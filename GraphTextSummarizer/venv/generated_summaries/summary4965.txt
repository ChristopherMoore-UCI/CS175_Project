It consisted of chicken fried steaks, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet, a bowl of fried okra, barbeque, fajitas, pizza, and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts. To impose the death penalty, the jurors in Brewer's trial had to answer three questions under Texas law: -- Would Brewer be a threat to society in the future; -- Did Brewer mean to kill Byrd; -- And, were there mitigating circumstances that would warrant sparing Brewer's life? Brewer ate a huge final meal, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. When Brewer was sentenced to death in 1999, Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said that, while he did not personally favor the death penalty, it was necessary in Brewer's case. Brewer, 44, was one of three men convicted for involvement in the murder of James Byrd.
