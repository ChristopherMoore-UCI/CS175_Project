It comes after months of demonstrations against Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and a weekend of violence between government forces and the local al Qaeda group. Three "al Qaeda terrorists were killed" and six others were arrested in Lawdar district, Yemen's official news agency Saba reported Saturday. The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. Fighting over the past two days between Yemeni security forces and members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula left people on both sides dead, Yemeni security forces said Sunday. Saba reported that Governor Saleh al-Zawari of Abyan Province affirmed "the importance to enhance security performance to strictly confront any attempts to disturb security and stability in the governorate." Yemen has been facing protests from people citing government corruption, a lack of political freedom and high unemployment.
