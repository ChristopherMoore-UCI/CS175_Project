According to the lawsuit, Kuwaiti officials told Mohamed's family they were holding him on behalf of the United States. The lawsuit says Mohamed came to the United States from Somalia with his family when he was 3, grew up in Virginia and is now a naturalized citizen. Mohamed had been trapped in Kuwait for nearly a month, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in Virginia. His lawyers say Kuwaiti officials tried to deport Mohamed but were unable to do so because the United States had placed him on the no-fly list. U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley denied Mohamed was detained at the behest of the United States.
