The quake struck about 434 kilometers (270 miles) southwest of Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's Aceh province, and had a magnitude of 8.6, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The center posted approximate arrival times for waves in different parts of the region, which were predicted at various times in different cities throughout the day. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said on local television that there were no reports of casualties or damage in Aceh. The tsunami, which washed away entire communities, caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations. The power went out in Banda Aceh, and residents moved to higher elevations, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency.
