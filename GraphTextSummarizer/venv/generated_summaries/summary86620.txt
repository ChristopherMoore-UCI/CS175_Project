-- Demonstrators in Amman, Jordan, battled riot police Wednesday in a fury over gas prices. Ensour has blamed the gas subsidy cuts on budget slashing made necessary by the uprisings in neighboring countries, which have reduced the gasoline supply to Jordan. A wave of protests that began in Jordan in December 2010 has recurred sporadically since. Previous protests have left 14 people injured -- 10 of them by police gunfire, Jordan's public security department said. Jordanians have told CNN that while they are incensed about rising prices and government corruption, they're just as worried about the current situation.
