-- Dozens of anti-government demonstrators were wounded Tuesday when security forces fired into the air and shot tear gas into a crowd of tens of thousands of protesters who had massed in front of Sanaa University, witnesses said. Guards fired warning shots and tear gas as prisoners chanted anti-government slogans, according to the prisoner, who obtained access to a phone during the incident and spoke with CNN Tuesday. The supplies were intended for the thousands of anti-government demonstrators who have camped out in front of the university calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. "The individuals were attempting to enter the 'weapon-free area' of University Square, where anti-government protesters have been camping for days. " Al-Hasani said security forces cracked down after students defied their orders not to take food and blankets into the protest area outside the gates of Sanaa University.
