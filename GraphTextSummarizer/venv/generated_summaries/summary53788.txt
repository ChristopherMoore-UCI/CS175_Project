AMC paid itself nearly $49 million in license fees, but production costs totaled $104.5 million, the suit said. -- The creator of the "Walking Dead" television series accuses AMC of cheating him out of millions of dollars in profits from the zombie hit. Darabont and CAA -- the Hollywood talent agency that helped him pitch the show to AMC -- have been deprived of "tens of millions of dollars of profits from the series," the suit said. Darabont's complaint points to the difference between the fee AMC charges its own company for each "Walking Dead" episode compared to the license fee paid to a third party for the AMC series "Mad Men" as evidence of the company's "improper and abusive practice of 'self-dealing.' AMC, which produces the series, allegedly charged its own cable network an "artificially low" license fee to carry the show, according to a lawsuit filed by Frank Darabont Tuesday.
