But give Marvel props, even with all of its mega-success; the studio's still willing to take chances. Directed with an effortlessly light touch by James Gunn, a low-budget maestro of genre films such as 2006's "Slither" and 2010's "Super," "Guardians of the Galaxy" represents a risky proposition for Marvel on several levels: a director who's never grappled with a project of this scale before, a menagerie of comic-book characters who are hardly household names (even to fanboys), and a tongue-in-cheek B-movie vibe that's more "Starcrash" than "Star Wars."
