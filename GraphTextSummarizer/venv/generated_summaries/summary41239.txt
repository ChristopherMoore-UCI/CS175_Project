The company, citing "rising commodity prices and challenging lease economics," said it planned to close a number of underperforming coffee shop locations as part of its reorganization. "I've always loved this city, and with the purchase of Tully's Coffee, I plan to spend a lot of time in Seattle and at the stores connecting with the community and growing the Tully's brand," Dempsey said. Tully's Coffee confirmed Thursday that Dempsey is part of an investment group, but had no comment on the effort. "The (bankruptcy) auction takes place on January 3 and the final hearing is on January 11." "I'm excited about the opportunity to save hundreds of jobs, give back to Seattle and become a larger part of the economic growth and fabric of the community," the actor said in a statement released Wednesday.
