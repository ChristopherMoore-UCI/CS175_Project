As the name of the bar suggests, everything inside XtraCold is made from ice, including the walls, bar, chairs and glasses. The show takes you on a journey through clouds, under water and around ice mountains. Everything inside this watering hole is made of ice. This establishment is touted as the UK's only permanent bar made of ice and is kept at 23 degrees Fahrenheit. Drink glasses are entirely made of ice, so your order is "in the rocks, not on the rocks."
