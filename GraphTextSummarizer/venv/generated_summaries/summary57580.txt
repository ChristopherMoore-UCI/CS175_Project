Ambitious goal Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. Demonstrators demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra began their latest round of rallies -- dubbed the "Bangkok shutdown" -- in the capital Monday. The protests this week caused some disruption in central Bangkok, but large areas of the sprawling capital city remain unaffected. The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class, particularly in Bangkok.
