Last June, a top executive from Nokia Siemens defended his company's decision to supply a telephone "monitoring center" to Iran in 2008 during an appearance before the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights. "We have to make sure international corporations are not enablers of the Iranian governments' human rights crimes," said Hadi Ghaemi of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Instead, they are seeking to blame Nokia Siemens Networks for the acts of the Iranian authorities by filing a lawsuit in the U.S., a country that has absolutely no connection to the issue they are raising." Earlier this week, New Jersey-based Iranian blogger Mehdi Saharkhiz filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court against Nokia Siemens Networks on behalf of his father, Isa, who has been in an Iranian prison since July 2009. Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi previously accused Nokia Siemens Network of supplying the technology to allow the government to monitor cell phone calls and text messages. There have also been reports of boycotts of Nokia products inside Iran.
