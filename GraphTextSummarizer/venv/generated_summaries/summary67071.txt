-- Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, will step down this summer after a year on the job due to health reasons, according to State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Nuland's statement said Crocker would step down "for health reasons in mid-summer, following the Kabul and Tokyo conferences." Nuland's statement cited a series of achievements during Crocker's tenure culminated by NATO's approval Monday of a timetable for the U.S.-led military mission in Afghanistan to end combat operations next year and withdraw by the end of 2014. Crocker was named as the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan on July 25, 2011. Nuland's statement quoted Crocker as saying: "These achievements are the guarantee that as Afghanistan moves to a brighter future secured by its own capabilities, it does so ... in sovereign and equal partnership with the United States in particular and the international community generally."
