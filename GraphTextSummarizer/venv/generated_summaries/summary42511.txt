Apple vs. Samsung: A peace treaty Just under $600 million of the earlier award to Apple involving other Samsung products still stands, according to Koh. Samsung, which recently logged record-breaking sales of its latest Galaxy phone, is locked in a tight race with Apple to see who will dominate the U.S. smartphone market. Patent battle continues After sifting through 109 pages of jury instructions and their notes and memories from weeks of testimony, a nine-person jury found Samsung was guilty of "willful" violations of a number of Apple's patents and recommended that Apple get more than $1 billion in compensation. The jury had awarded Apple more than $1 billion in damages total after finding Samsung had copied both the design and software features of the iPhone. Apple accused Samsung of copying the design of the iPhone and iPad, suing Samsung for $2.5 billion. Samsung countersued Apple for $519 million, also for patent infringement.
