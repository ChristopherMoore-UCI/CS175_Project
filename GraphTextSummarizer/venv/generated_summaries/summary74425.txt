Rotenberg said he still has privacy concerns about millimeter wave machines, including what information is captured by the machine -- even if unseen by screeners -- and how long that information is retained. " Most countries do not use body scanners, he said, preferring to use a combination of metal detection and technology that can identify explosives. Airport passenger screening that produced particularly realistic full-body images using backscatter technology. Backscatter machines could return one day if the company develops required software, the TSA has said. "I think from the privacy perspective, that (the elimination of backscatter machines) has to be considered a victory," said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
