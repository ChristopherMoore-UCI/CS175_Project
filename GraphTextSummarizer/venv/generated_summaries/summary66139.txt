I know it's not exactly the Lewis and Clark journals, but such letters, written concurrently with the events of our world, are an unusual historic record if nothing else. But after I posted letters on the "AC360" blog for 10 days, a lot of readers liked them, so I extended the string to the first month. That made me laugh, because I've felt that way about other writers sometimes. I thought the idea of sending armchair advice to the Leader of the Free World was funny and my first letter was really little more than congratulations.
