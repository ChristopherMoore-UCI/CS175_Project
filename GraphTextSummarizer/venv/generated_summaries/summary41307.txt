The military's other prized fighter program, the F-35 fighter-bomber, has faced similar questions about massive cost overruns and mechanical problems. The problem-plagued F-22 Raptor took part in its first combat mission Monday night, hitting ISIS targets in Syria. A subsequent report by the Pentagon watchdog found the Air Force initially blamed the crash on pilot error when in fact a mechanical error was at fault. Originally designed and built to replace other fighter and ground attack aircraft in the U.S. military's arsenal, the radar-evading F-22 is an evolutionary dead end. Even though they formally came into service in 2005, the F-22 had been grounded repeatedly because of what were indeterminate causes that resulted in pilots losing consciousness in the air.
