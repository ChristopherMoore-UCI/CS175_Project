Onassis displays a mischievous side in a February 12, 1947, letter in which she tells Corbin to smuggle in cigarettes, chocolate "and a hip flask to shock Mrs. J." Many of the letters begin with "Dearest Bev" or "Buddy darling," and one envelope, sent via "air mail" with three 3-cent stamps, is addressed to "Mr. R. Beverley Corbin Jr." of "The Owl Club" at Harvard University. " On October 10, 1946, the 17-year-old Miss Bouvier reveals her "cooling enthusiasm" in a letter to Harvard boyfriend R. Beverley Corbin Jr., "who seems to have been badly hurt when Jackie refused to kiss him during one visit," according to Christie's. In an extraordinary life marked by staggering tragedy, she was the widowed first lady of assassinated President John F. Kennedy, slain in 1963, and became a widow again, of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who died in 1975. -- Letters by a teenage Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis to her Harvard boyfriend in the late 1940s show the future first lady writing about adolescent love, kissing and her loathing of attending a finishing school. The auction house is also selling an undated black-and-white photograph of Onassis and Corbin along with another couple.
