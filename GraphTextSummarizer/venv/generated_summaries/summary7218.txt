Gabby Douglas' success at last year's London Olympics catapulted her to fame, fortune and glory. Alongside Jordyn Wieber, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Kyla Ross, Douglas helped the U.S. women's team win gold in London -- the first time the nation had triumphed in female gymnastics since that team including Dawes in 1996.
