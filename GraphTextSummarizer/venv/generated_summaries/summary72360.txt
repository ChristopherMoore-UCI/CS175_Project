As it turns out, the "Adequate Yearly Progress" measurement, which requires all schools to meet targets for student proficiency or face the same federal interventions, is unrealistic and restricts states' and school districts' ability to effectively gauge student learning and tailor curriculum accordingly. Our legislation will call on each state to implement its own accountability system that considers the challenges and opportunities facing local schools and more accurately evaluates student achievement. House Education and the Workforce Committee Republicans are leading the way toward a better education system in which parents, teachers and state and local leaders are empowered to build superior schools and improve student achievement. Instead of placing excessive emphasis on credentials and tenure, our proposal will provide incentives for school districts to develop and implement their own teacher evaluations based on student learning. Enacted under President George W. Bush's administration with the promise to focus on individual student achievement and overall school performance, No Child Left Behind was heralded as groundbreaking.
