-- Paris Hilton left Japan late Wednesday afternoon after initially being refused entry because of a drug conviction, immigration officials said. Hilton left about 4 p.m. Wednesday, before they reached a final verdict, said an immigration official at Narita Airport. The American socialite was heading back to the United States "after a lengthy delay at Japanese immigration," her spokesman said Wednesday. She arrived in Japan on Tuesday and had been allowed to spend the night, to see whether immigration officials would reconsider their initial refusal to allow her entry. She was sentenced to a year of probation, a $2,000 fine and 200 hours of community service.
