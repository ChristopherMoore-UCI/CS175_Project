-- Charlie Hunnam didn't drop out of "Fifty Shades of Grey" because he didn't want to play the lead, Christian Grey. I loved the character, and I wanted to do it." Instead of Hunnam, moviegoers will see relative newcomer Jamie Dornan in the role of Mr. Grey. Between his work on FX's "Sons" and his commitment to Guillermo del Toro's 2015 release, "Crimson Peak," there just wasn't a lot of room for "Fifty Shades of Grey" no matter how badly Hunnam wanted it to work. But by the following month, Hunnam had parted ways with the project, citing scheduling conflicts. Fans were particularly livid about Johnson landing the part of naive student Anastasia Steele, but Hunnam also felt the pressure.
