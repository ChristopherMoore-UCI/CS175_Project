So when a 19-year-old Pennsylvania woman already facing murder charges told a newspaper reporter that she'd killed before -- over and over again, from Alaska to North Carolina -- loved ones couldn't help but sit up and take notice, said Kristy Dyroff, a spokeswoman for the National Organization for Victim Assistance. Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who police say was strangled and repeatedly stabbed by the couple before being dumped in a yard. " Barbour took credit for more than 22 but fewer than 100 killings, Daily Item reporter Francis Scarcella told CNN affiliate WNEP. "The biggest difficulty for victims is they have no control, and they're trying to regain some by doing something proactive." Murder suspect's bombshell claims raise questions On Sunday, the Daily Item newspaper in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, published a jailhouse interview with murder suspect Miranda Barbour in which she claimed a string of killings dating back six years -- to when she was 13. Even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple, Northumberland County District Attorney Tony Rosini, said he discounts Barbour's other claims.
