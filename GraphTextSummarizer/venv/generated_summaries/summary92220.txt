In sweeping discipline that one analyst called "historic," New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton was suspended without pay for the entire 2012 season and former Saints defensive coach Gregg Williams was suspended indefinitely in a series of NFL punishments Wednesday for the team's bounty program targeting opponents. Several players pledged money for bounties on specific opponents, "with defensive captain Jonathan Vilma offering $10,000 to any player who knocked Brett Favre out of the NFC Championship Game in 2010," the NFL said. But Williams was first questioned about the bounty program in early 2010, "he intentionally misled NFL investigators and made no effort to stop the program after he became aware of the league's investigation," the NFL said. Under the bounties, the team paid bonuses for knocking opposing players out of a game, the NFL said. Payments were made for plays in which opposing players were injured and for interceptions and fumble recoveries, the NFL said.
