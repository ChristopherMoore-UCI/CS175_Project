Call the governor, Britney Spears lives fancy in 'Work B***h' "It's a personal album, and all my family, they all call me Britney Jean, it's like a term of endearment, and I just wanted to share that with my fans," she told London's Capital FM yesterday. Before you go assuming that she's making some sort of awesome meta-allusion to Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean," just know that "Jean" is actually Spears' given middle name. Her new album's first single and video, "Work B***h," has already dropped, and yesterday she revealed that the new collection, which will be out December 3, is called "Britney Jean." Director weighs in "That song is a reflection of Britney moreso than the album," Will told Billboard.
