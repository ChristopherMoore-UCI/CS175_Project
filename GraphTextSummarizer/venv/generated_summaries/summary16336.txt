The United States clinched the first gold medal of Sochi's Winter Olympics Saturday, but the Dutch dominated on ice and a joint record was claimed by Norway. Kotsenburg's winning score of 93.5 edged out silver medal winner Staale Sandbech, 20, while Canadian Mark McMorris, also 20, took bronze. An upset opened the day's events in Russia when Team U.S.A's Sage Kotsenburg, 20, scooped the first gold in men's snowboard slopestyle. Saturday's second gold was taken by Norway's Marit Bjoergen in the women's skiathlon. His efforts made him the joint most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, with compatriot Bjorn Dahlie.
