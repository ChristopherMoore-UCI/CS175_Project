As nuclear talks with Iran neared the endgame, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shied away from predicting success. Negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material, and Iran has made the comments many times before, the official said, citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports. He said Iran was trying to take over the whole Middle East with the nuclear deal and its influence in Yemen. Many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran's nuclear program does not have a military dimension. U.S. officials maintain the number is not that important, because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate, which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- known as the "breakout time"  -- to at least a year.
