And Palermo doubled their lead nine minutes from half time when Antonio Nocerino turned defender Maicon before beating goalkeeper Julio Cesar at his near post. Inter Milan kept their Serie A title hopes alive as striker Giampaolo Pazzini scored twice on his debut to help them recover from a two-goal deficit to beat Palermo 3-2 at the San Siro. Goals from South Americans Christian Zapata and Alexis Sanchez sealed the three points for the visitors, who are now up to sixth in the table with Juve one point behind them in seventh position. "I never imagined having a day like this, it really was a dream to play with so many great players," Pazzini told Italian TV station SkySport. But two minutes later it was Palermo who went in front as Mattia Cassani skipped around Davide Santon and crossed for Miccoli to tap home from close range.
