Within a year, Thomas had left her job at CNN's HLN network to start a Georgia-based media consulting business with clients such as singer/actress Jennifer Holliday, former Bell Biv DeVoe singer Ron DeVoe, actor Boris Kodjoe, actress Nicole Ari Parker and former supermodel Beverly Johnson. Thomas says she's still not making as much money as she did in TV news, but she expects to reach that mark this year. Thomas was very familiar with the first African-American model to win a cover on American Vogue magazine. A journalist friend e-mailed Thomas, saying that he had connected with Johnson and suggesting that they meet. Thomas laughs sheepishly.
