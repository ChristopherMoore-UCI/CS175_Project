Mayweather had been set to go to jail earlier this year, but a Nevada judge pushed back his reporting date so that the boxer could compete last month against WBA super-welterweight champion Miguel Cotto. -- Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was booked Friday into the Clark County, Nevada, detention center to serve a 90-day sentence for a conviction last year on a domestic violence charge, police said. Mayweather, whose nickname is "Money," won a unanimous decision in the Las Vegas fight, which paid him $32 million. "He will receive one hour free time per day by himself," the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a news release. A Michigan native, Mayweather has won seven titles in various weight classes since turning pro in 1996.
