The children, who range in age from 4 months to 12 years old, have been living in SOS Children's Village, an Austrian-run orphanage in northern Port-au-Prince, since late January, when the 10 Americans they were with were arrested at the Haitian-Dominican Republic border. The 10 Americans face charges that including kidnapping of minors for trying to take the children out of the country without required paperwork on January 29, more than two weeks after the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake. The January 12 earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and flattened large portions of the capital city and surrounding areas. "Authorities wanted to ensure that the children were given back to the right parents," said Jeanne Bernard-Pierre, the general director for Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare. Authorities are still working to verify the paperwork from the parents of the remaining child, a 9-year-old girl, SOS Children's Village said.
