Storm surge Forecasters are warning that an "extremely dangerous storm surge" could hit around the same time as high tide, with the highest storm surge along the coasts of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, especially where water funnels into New York Harbor and Long Island Sound. Here's what residents can expect over the next 24 to 48 hours: Strong winds Hurricane-force winds -- stronger than 74 mph -- will pummel the coasts of Delaware, New Jersey and New York state, while tropical-storm-force winds between 39 and 73 mph will stretch from North Carolina all the way to Maine. On Tuesday, rain and snow will continue for much of the area, and surf will remain rough as the center of the system slowly drifts northward into Pennsylvania and New York. Landfall will occur Monday evening into overnight, and storm surge likely will peak around the evening high tide. State-by-state preparations Snow Extreme snowfalls totaling several feet will be likely in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia and to a lesser extent into portions of Pennsylvania and Virginia as well.
