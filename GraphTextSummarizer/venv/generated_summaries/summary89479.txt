The private suit brought in Alabama by a former USIS employee, Blake Percival, claims that USIS aimed to boost revenue and maximize profits by using proprietary computer software to automatically release incomplete background checks done at the request of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). -- USIS, the government contractor that did the background check on former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, used a practice known as "dumping" to issue incomplete background checks to the government for security clearances, according to a whistle-blower lawsuit the Justice Department joined on Wednesday. Several former employees have been prosecuted by the Justice Department for allegedly not doing background investigations that they were assigned to do under USIS's contract with OPM. OPM has said it has an ongoing investigation of USIS that doesn't relate to the Snowden background check. USIS, based in Falls Church, Virginia, has been under fire for months as lawmakers have lodged criticisms of the company for what they say is shoddy work on government background checks.
