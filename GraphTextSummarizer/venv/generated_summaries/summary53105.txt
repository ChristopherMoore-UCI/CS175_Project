A statement from Islamabad replied, "It is a longstanding practice that, prior to Pakistan-India talks, meetings with Kashmiri leaders are held to facilitate meaningful discussions on the issue of Kashmir. New Delhi called off the talks after Pakistan's New Delhi-based high commissioner, Abdul Basit, invited Kashmiri separatist leaders for consultations ahead of the summit. During his visit to Indian-administered Kashmir this month, Modi condemned "the continued proxy war by neighboring Pakistan." Hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani described the decision as unfortunate, saying it proved that "New Delhi was never serious to resolve Kashmir peacefully." Geelani also said he will be meeting with the Pakistan high commissioner in New Delhi on Tuesday. -- Kashmiri separatist leaders on Monday slammed New Delhi's decision to call off talks with Pakistan, scheduled for August 25 in Islamabad.
