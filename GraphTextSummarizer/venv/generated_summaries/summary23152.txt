"It's a lot of hard work, but it's been satisfying," he said Sunday at the Emmys, where he paid tribute to the late Gary David Goldberg, the producer behind "Spin City" and the show that launched Fox to fame, "Family Ties." On the NBC sitcom, Fox plays Michael Henry, a prominent New York news personality who put his career on pause after he developed Parkinson's. " Dealing with Parkinson's, of course, hasn't always been a barrel of laughs for Fox, who was diagnosed in 1991 at the age of 30 (he didn't publicly reveal his condition until 1999). His co-star Wendell Pierce, who plays Fox's boss on the show, said Parkinson's has not dulled the actor's comedic gifts. He does all of that, which makes it even more extraordinary, because he has to take care as to how he budgets his energy, his time, to do the work." Fox says that if anything, Parkinson's has actually made him a better actor.
