-- Iran will not be able to use alliances with Latin America to wield significant influence on security in the West, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday. On Tuesday, Biden told reporters the United States "shared responsibility," but also noted that Central American countries must work to stop drug production. Mexican President Felipe Calderon asked for additional assistance vetting local police officers, Biden said. He told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Wednesday that the leaders he met with said they were grateful for U.S. assistance. Central American leaders requested similar aid.
