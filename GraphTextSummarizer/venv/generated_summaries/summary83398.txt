-- Police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year, Human Rights Watch alleged Monday. "At least 130 men were killed by members of the very institutions charged with protecting them," said Corinne Dufka, senior West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. In the report, released Monday, Human Rights Watch says it "documented 133 of these killings but believes that the actual number of arbitrary killings by security forces may be substantially higher than these figures. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001. Police and soldiers responded to the riots with deadly force, on the same day the governor of the state issued a "shoot-on-sight" order, Human Rights Watch said.
