Coups and coup attempts are common in Guinea-Bissau since it won independence from Portugal in 1974. Naualna said the West African group agreed to send a technical mission to Guinea-Bissau as soon as possible to help find solutions to the crisis, though specific details were not released. Leaders of the nation's armed forces have taken control of the nation to ensure stability, Naualna said. After Thursday's coup, military leaders and a group of mostly opposition political parties declared the formation of a transitional national council, spokesman Fernando Vaz said. A chorus of world leaders has denounced last week's coup, which occurred just before the second round of a presidential election set for April 29.
