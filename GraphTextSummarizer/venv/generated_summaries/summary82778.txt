Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports described the expansion as a "strong endorsement of Dubai's aviation industry," and indicated the days of the Emirate's current hub, Dubai International Airport (DXB), are numbered. " As well as packing in the passengers, the expanded airport (and its construction) is set to support 322,000 jobs and contribute 28% to Dubai's GDP, according to Dubai Airports. Currently over half of passengers flying to Dubai are connecting to other destinations and the new airport will build a system of automated trains and people movers to ferry people between gates. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum approved a $32 billion plan to continue development of the eponymous Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central. The airport opened its doors to passengers last year but will be beefed up to ultimately accommodate over 200 million passengers per year and 12 million tons of cargo.
