School administrators have disputed the cavalier attitude toward sexual assault alleged by the students, noting that UNC has removed sexual violence cases from the list of concerns handled by the school's student-run honor court and appointed an administrator to deal directly with victims. Investigators from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights will look into the women's allegations that school administrators brushed aside concerns about sexual violence on campus and failed to adequately investigate complaints of sexual assault, according to a March 1 letter sent to Clark by the agency. Since the controversy burst into the open, the school has changed its policies to take sexual assault cases out of the honor court's jurisdiction and has hired an administrator to be the primary contact for sexual assault victims on campus. Clark began researching sexual assault issues on campus when she realized there was no clear reporting system for sexual violence at the school after she said she was assaulted in 2007. Clark and other students named in this report agreed to be identified by CNN, which does not typically identify the victims of sexual assault.
