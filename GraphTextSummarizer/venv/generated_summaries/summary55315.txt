China suffered a spate of knife and cleaver attacks targeting school children in 2010. Monday was the first day back at school after the summer vacation for most students in China. A number of measures were introduced at the time, including increased security at schools across the country and a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when buying large knives. A man stabbed to death three children at a primary school in central China and then committed suicide by jumping off a building, state media reported. A member of staff at the local education authority who answered a call from CNN said the only information available was in Xinhua's report.
