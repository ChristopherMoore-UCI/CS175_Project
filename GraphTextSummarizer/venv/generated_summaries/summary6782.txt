Nigerian forces battling the Islamist terror group Boko Haram have killed a man suspected of acting as the group's leader, Nigeria's Defense Ministry said. Jonathan: Destructive effects Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that Boko Haram shared a common agenda with other terror groups such as ISIS and al Qaeda -- that being "to unleash terror, mayhem, destruction, and instability around the world" -- but that Nigeria was working hard to root out the group. The soldiers and Boko Haram militants clashed several times in the past week in communities around the city of Maiduguri in the country's northeastern Borno state, the ministry's statement said. "The costs are high: over 13,000 people have been killed, whole communities razed, and hundreds of persons kidnapped, the most prominent being the mindless kidnap of our innocent daughters from Chibok Secondary School, in North East Nigeria." Several other Boko Haram fighters also died in the latest fighting, the Defense Ministry said, and a number were captured along with their equipment.
