A wife and a former colleague of prosecution witnesses are also potential jurors, prosecutors say.. With the removal of 12 possible witnesses from the jury pool, the number of potential witnesses receiving a summons could now be as high as 43, though prosecutors acknowledged in court papers "that it is likely two individuals could have the same names and not be the same person as the endorsed prosecution witnesses in this case." Holmes' family decried the need for a trial, saying it would cause additional trauma and "force everyone to relive those horrible moments in time. "In this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death," Brauchler said in court. The logistics of putting James Holmes on trial are as staggering as the carnage he allegedly committed in a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012 when 12 people were killed and 58 others injured in gunfire.
