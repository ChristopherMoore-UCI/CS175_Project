The reason why Modi has traveled all over the world in his first few months in office -- Rio, New York, Tokyo, Sydney -- is not because he wants to be a foreign policy leader; Modi wants to bring business to India. When pushed specifically on Russia's annexation of Crimea, a hostile takeover New Delhi refused to condemn, Modi pushed right back. However, Modi's point was not to admonish the U.S., but to suggest that all nations have their own value systems and perceived flaws. In the space of six weeks, with great displays of importance, India's capital will have hosted two world leaders who no longer speak with each other: the presidents of Russia and the United States. Russia is the world's second largest exporter of arms; India is the world's biggest importer.
