"The joint law enforcement action opened a new chapter in the police cooperation between China and Africa, and will safeguard the safety and other legitimate rights of Chinese citizens and institutions in Angola," said Liu Ancheng, director of criminal investigation in China. While Western countries are still important players in Africa's energy sector, the deepening engagement of China in Africa's infrastructure, mineral sector and telecommunications is creating "deep nervousness" in the West, said David Shinn, the former U.S. ambassador to Burkina Faso and Ethiopia.

China overtook the United States as Africa's biggest trade partner in 2009. It was the largest crackdown on crimes targeting Chinese nationals in Africa, officials said.
