The private event at the Curran Theatre was attended by such luminaries as Stevie Wonder, Eric Idle, Bobcat Goldthwait, Bonnie Hunt, Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal. Robin Williams received a warm sendoff from family and friends at a San Francisco tribute Saturday night. In addition, as The Hollywood Reporter noted, Williams' daughter, Zelda -- who quit social media after being harassed in the wake of her father's death -- re-emerged last week with a pair of posts thanking people for their messages of kindness. "Robin memorial beautiful & touching, tears and laughter, with Billy Crystal, Whoopie, & Stevie Wonder, & I sang a song I wrote for him," he tweeted. Robin Williams died August 11 at his home north of San Francisco.
