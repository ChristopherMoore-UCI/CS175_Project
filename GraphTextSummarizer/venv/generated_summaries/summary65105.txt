Robb, who plays teenager Carrie Bradshaw on "The Carrie Diaries," said New York Fashion Week "was an incredible introduction to the fashion world," as she prepares to fill the iconic character's Manolos. " One specific piece viewers can look out for on the show is the "Carrie bag." Carrie's purse is a really important piece, Robb said, noting that there's a chance similar bags will be available to the public one day. -- The CW's '80s-set "Sex and the City" prequel doesn't premiere until January, but series star AnnaSophia Robb has already proved she's every bit as stylish as her character. " Costume designer Eric Daman, who has worked on "Sex and the City" and "Gossip Girl," outfits the characters in the new series with "neon and big poofy skirts and shoulder pads," Robb said. Despite a shared emphasis on fashion, however, Robb said the show is very different from "Sex and the City," which featured Sarah Jessica Parker as Bradshaw for six seasons and two films.
