" "Singapore has a longstanding tradition of naming orchids after important guests," said Poon Hong Yuen, the CEO of the National Parks Board. The National Orchid Garden is also home to orchids named after state dignitaries including Nelson Mandela and Margaret Thatcher -- not to mention celebrity orchids such as the "Dendrobium Jackie Chan. "It is especially significant that we are able to name an orchid after Their Royal Highnesses, having named orchids after Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as well as the late Princess of Wales," said Poon. William and his wife, Catherine, also had an orchid -- the "Vanda William Catherine" -- named after them at Singapore's National Orchid Garden, their first stop on a tour to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee. The royal couple also viewed the "Dendrobium Queen Elizabeth II" orchid, named for William's grandmother -- who has now ruled the British Commonwealth for 60 years -- on her visit to the country in 1972.
