-- After dodging sharks and jellyfish during her swim from Cuba to Florida, Diana Nyad is now dealing with a different challenge: tough questions from her fellow marathon swimmers about the legitimacy of her achievement. No handlers' Asked about reports she had gone for hours without food or water, Nyad said she never went more than 90 minutes. The questions are significant because the answers could determine whether Nyad is officially affirmed as the first person to have completed the Cuba-Florida swim unassisted and without a shark cage. In the days since Nyad walked out of the water last week at Key West after swimming 110 miles, a stream of questions has come at her. "She acknowledged that her crew touched her when she was putting on the jellyfish suit," said Evan Morrison, a co-founder of Marathon Swimmers Forum.
