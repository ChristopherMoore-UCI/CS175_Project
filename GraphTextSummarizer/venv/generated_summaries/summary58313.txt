Reese Witherspoon has top billing, but rising stars Chris Pine and Tom Hardy call the shots as charmingly irresponsible CIA operatives FDR and Tuck. But within minutes of their first date, she bumps into FDR, a confirmed bachelor and ladies man. Taking his cue from Doug Liman's "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," director McG aims for a kind of macho rom-com, a date movie that appeals to both men and women. In the movie's breeziest patches, the two hunks eavesdrop on Lauren as she compares their shortcomings with BFF Trish (an authentically abrasive Chelsea Handler). Divorced dad Tuck meets Lauren through a dating agency.
