Miguel Angel Jimenez, playing his first tournament since breaking his leg in a skiing accident last year, missed the halfway cut along with former major champions Michael Campbell and Jose Maria Olazabal. The 38-year-old clinched his fourth European Tour win, and first since triumphing at the 2011 Sicilian Open, having been tied with Chile's Felipe Aguilar and Germany's Maximilian Kieffer after the 72 regulation holes. Jacquelin finally broke the deadlock with a wedge to five feet, sinking the birdie putt to deny 22-year-old Kieffer his maiden top-level victory and claim the â‚¬250,000 ($327,000) first prize. Sergio Garcia tied for 12th at his national event, having flown from Augusta after finishing eighth at the Masters last Sunday. -- Having played the same hole 10 times in one day, you'd think Raphael Jacquelin would be sick of the sight of the 18th at Valencia's Parador de El Saler.
