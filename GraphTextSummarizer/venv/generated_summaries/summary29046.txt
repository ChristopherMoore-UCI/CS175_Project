But after widespread opposition across the political platform, the president announced earlier this year all prosecutions would be in military courts in Guantanamo. The move comes after the Obama administration dropped plans to prosecute the suspects in federal court in New York. Charges against all five accused include conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the law of war, hijacking aircraft and terrorism, the statement said. The final decision about whether the death penalty can be pursued is in the hands of retired Vice Adm. Bruce McDonald. Later that year, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Mohammed and several other key terror suspects would face prosecution in the military justice system.
