A remake of the super-popular '80s animated series is coming to the U.S. as part of the company's strategy to attract younger viewers. "It's one of those shows where we're able to hit a few different audiences," said Erik Barmack, the company's VP of global independent content. "Inspector Gadget" is one of five kids' shows on tap for streaming giant Netflix, the company said in a release Wednesday. The 26 episodes of "Inspector Gadget" will premiere in the U.S. in March. Netflix has also ordered a revamp of the cartoon "Danger Mouse," about a secret agent rodent.
