There has been a surge in fighting between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russian separatists in recent days. Fighting between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russian separatists broke out last spring, slowing for a short-lived ceasefire agreed to in  Minsk, Belarus, in September. The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out last spring after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region and as pro-Russia separatists claimed control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. On Monday, the state-run Itar-Tass news agency reported Russian President Vladimir Putin as saying a "NATO legion" was working in Ukraine with the aim of containing Russia. Kiev will ask the Hague tribunal to investigate alleged "crimes against humanity" in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced Monday.
