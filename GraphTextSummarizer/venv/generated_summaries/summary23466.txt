"This isn't a school about technology, this is a school about redefining the norm for urban education," said Mary Cullinane, director of innovation for Microsoft Education, who is also the liaison to the school. The school is made up of students chosen by a lottery of public school students, with the majority of them coming from low-income households with limited access to technology and training. The majority-minority $63 million school was erected with school district funds in the tough Parkside neighborhood in West Philadelphia. There were times during high school that she wanted to give up. She credits the caring staff and individual attention at school with helping to keep her on track.
