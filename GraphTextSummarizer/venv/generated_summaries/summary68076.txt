A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld parts of a Texas abortion law pertaining to hospital privileges for physicians who perform abortions and protocols for abortion-inducing drugs, a decision that drew starkly contrasting reactions on both sides of the debate. "Today's court decision is good news for Texas women and the unborn, and we will continue to fight for the protection of life and women's health in Texas." Not surprisingly, Planned Parenthood had an opposite reaction, with President Cecile Richards characterizing the decision as "a terrible court ruling." "The latest restrictions in Texas will force women to have abortions later in pregnancy, if they are able to get to a doctor at all," Richards said. Moreover, the court disputed the assertion that "abortion practitioners will likely be unable to comply," noting state and federal laws "prohibit hospitals from discriminating against physicians who perform abortions when they grant admitting privileges. Furthermore, the group's lawyers surmised that it would cause women to lose access to abortions because clinics would shut down, in part because hospitals might refuse to give admitting privileges to those who performed abortions elsewhere. Not only are similar provisions in effect elsewhere, but the 5th Circuit appeals court also found that it has "a rational basis" and "the plaintiffs offered no evidence implying that the State enacted the admitting privileges provision in order to limit abortions."
