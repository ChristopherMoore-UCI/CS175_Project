Rob Stelle of the Army Judge Advocate General Corps, who worked on the Hennis case, told "Death Row Stories" that the military's ability to prosecute a case that has already been tried is "well-settled law. While on death row, Hennis received a mysterious, anonymous letter in the mail: "Dear Mr. Hennis," the letter said. Hennis, who was then a 27-year-old Army soldier based at nearby Fort Bragg, visited the home of Kathryn Eastburn and her husband, Gary, a captain in the Air Force. And that's Timothy Hennis," Maj. Matt Scott, another Army JAG attorney who worked on the case, told "Death Row Stories." Experts said the DNA from Eastburn's rape kit was consistent with Hennis' DNA.
