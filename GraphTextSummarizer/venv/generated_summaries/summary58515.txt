The cigarette trade would provide big revenue to "drug dealers," just as illegal drugs do today. Tony Newman says cigarettes kill more people than drugs that are illegal. But with all of the good intentions in the world, outlawing cigarettes would be just as disastrous as the prohibition on other drugs. On the contrary, our public health campaign around cigarettes has been a model of success compared with our results with other prohibited drugs. Instead of giving teens "reefer madness"-style propaganda, we have treated young people with respect and given them honest education about the harm of cigarettes, and we have been rewarded with fewer young people smoking today than ever before.
