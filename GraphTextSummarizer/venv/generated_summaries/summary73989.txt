Dombrovskis is "taking political responsibility for the tragedy," spokesman Martin Punke told CNN. However, Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs told CNN last week that authorities think building materials stored on the roof caused it to collapse. Dombrovskis, who has been prime minister since March 2009, is expected to address the nation in a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis is resigning in the wake of a deadly supermarket roof collapse, his spokesman said Wednesday. His decision to step down came after a meeting with the president, according to Latvia's national news agency, LETA.
