-- Norway mass killer Anders Breivik should be considered sane and acquitted for the attacks that left 77 people dead, his lawyer said in closing arguments Friday. Lippestad also argued that Breivik had chosen his targets politically, noting that he didn't attack nonpolitical people like the captain on the boat to Utoya and the youngest children on the island. " Defense lawyer Geir Lippestad argued that Breivik should be fully acquitted on the charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in Norway -- and that this should be on the grounds of necessity, not insanity. But, he said, the key question for his client was whether he acted under the legal principle of "necessity." Lippestad has previously said it is important to Breivik that people see him as sane so they don't dismiss his views. Its ruling on whether he is sane matters less than the fact that Breivik's extremist views are shared by other people
