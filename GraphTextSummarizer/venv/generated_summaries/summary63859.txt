" Suarez has a reputation of going to ground too easily, but this season the Uruguayan has been a reformed man -- being named interim captain by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers -- following last season's eight-match ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. "Suarez lost a duel with Azpilicueta ... and now he's doing an acrobatic swimming pool jump to try to get the penalty, because he's so clever because he's in the area where the Liverpool supporters are behind," Mourinho insisted at his press conference. "Last year in this period, we were out of the championship race, but in 2013, we have been quite consistent." Arsenal's win allowed London rival Tottenham to move up to seventh place above Newcastle with a 3-0 win at home to 12th-placed Stoke, as Spain striker Roberto Soldado netted a penalty before Belgium midfielder Mousa Dembele and England winger Aaron Lennon added the others. Everton climbed above Merseyside rival Liverpool into fourth with a 2-1 win at home to ninth-placed Southampton, as on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku struck the 74th-minute winner -- the Belgium international's ninth in the league this season. "The player is amazing," acknowledged Mourinho, who has yet to suffer a home league defeat in his two spells at Stamford Bridge.
