The pool is for bragging rights and has no prize money, unlike other bracket pools. He tweeted Saturday, "And that was the closest I've ever come to not winning a billion dollars." Additionally, there were no perfect brackets remaining in ESPN's bracket challenge. CBS Sports, which runs one of the bigger bracket challenges, previously reported that in the past two years the last remaining perfect brackets were eliminated in the 22nd and 23rd games of the tournament. Binder told ESPN on Saturday he was in a rush when he was getting ready to leave for work when he filled out his NCAA tournament bracket online. ESPN reports that of the roughly 30 million entrants it has had over the 13 years, no one has come close to a perfect bracket, and that only one person has had a perfect first round in the last seven years.
