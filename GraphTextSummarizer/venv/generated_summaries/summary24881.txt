While travelers continue to complain about airlines charging for everything from more leg room to window seats to snacks, airlines would have lost money this year without those fees, according to Airlines for America vice president and chief economist John Heimlich. Those cuts in domestic service are likely to continue into the new year, with Airlines for America predicting a 2.4% cut in the number of domestic airline flights and a 1.3% cut in the number of domestic airline seats for the first quarter of 2013, compared with the first quarter of 2012. Travelers who haven't yet bought their plane tickets might consider flying on Thanksgiving Day, November 22, when only 1.3 million people are expected to fly, and returning home on Friday, November 23, with only 1.6 million other passengers, according to Airlines for America estimates. Jet fuel prices continue to rise Although airlines have seen a 5.6% increase in revenues in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the same time last year, Heimlich said that the 10 largest Unites States airlines have also faced costs that are 6.2% higher, reducing profits to a margin of 0.2% -- or about 50 cents per passenger. Nearly 24 million passengers are expected to fly this Thanksgiving travel season, an increase of about 150,000 passengers over last year, industry trade group Airlines for America predicted.
