The back story I asked Carson if he could imagine the guy in his song rushing to the airport -- paying full fare to get home to his baby, who seems to have sent him packing -- if she had sent an e-mail or a tweet. " They'd ride around for hours in Carson's blue-green Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan just writing songs. To get to the bottom of the story, I made a long distance phone call to Wayne Carson, the man who wrote "The Letter." And then, one night, after one of Carson's shows, a woman comes up to him and says she has a song she'd like him to look at. There was one phrase in there that stuck in Carson's mind that he'd one day come back to.
