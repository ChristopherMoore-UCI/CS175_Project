Wilson, 28, cited security fears in his letter of resignation, which reads: "I, Darren Wilson, hereby resign my commission as a police officer with the City of Ferguson effective immediately. During this time, Wilson married a fellow Ferguson police officer. I have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow. It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me. In other action related to Ferguson, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon called for a special state legislative session to address "critical funding" needs for the National Guard and state police after violent protests in Ferguson this week.
