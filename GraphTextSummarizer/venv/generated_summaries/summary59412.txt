A third loyalist group, the Ulster Defense Association, announced it had begun the process of decommissioning, according to the NIO, which is the British government department responsible for Northern Ireland affairs. Loyalist paramilitary groups are those that want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom. The Ulster Defense Association is the largest loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland, with between 2,000 and 5,000 members, according to the U.S. State Department. Before its 1994 cease-fire, targets included nationalist paramilitary groups -- those fighting for the reunification of Ireland. Shaun Woodward, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, then said he was tired of "foot-dragging" on the issue.
