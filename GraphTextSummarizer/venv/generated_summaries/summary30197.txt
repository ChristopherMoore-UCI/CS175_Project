Hong Kong hardship The situation for refugees in Hong Kong is more complicated. A deportation letter was soon issued to me, which meant Hong Kong authorities were forcing me to leave. Hong Kong -- a one-hour flight away -- is the nearest Colombian consulate from Taiwan. [A statement from the Health Authority, the government department responsible for public hospitals in Hong Kong, said Rubashkyn "received appropriate clinical treatment and nursing care" and that "all arrangements were made based on the clinical needs of the patient."] Again, Rainbow rescued me. We are not allowed to work and study, and Hong Kong only provides us about US$150 per month for food and other basic needs.
