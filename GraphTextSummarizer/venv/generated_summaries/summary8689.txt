Like many other schools, Brown used to factor a family's ability to pay when deciding whether to accept students. Frank, though he went to Brown only one year, landed an engineering job at Pratt & Whitney in part because someone there had gone to the school, said his daughter, Cathy Halstead. As for the Brown scholarship fund, he started it because he saw that Brown had changed the course of his life, Halstead said. Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University. On Sunday, 49 students from low-income families became the first four-year Sidney E. Frank Scholars to graduate from Brown, owing virtually nothing except gratitude to the late liquor magnate.
