Stutzman's legal team put out this statement explaining what this means: A state judge ruled Wednesday that Washington floral artist and grandmother Barronelle Stutzman must provide full support for wedding ceremonies that are contrary to her faith. And if this kind of thing can be done to a 70-year-old grandmother running a small flower shop in rural Washington State, then it can be done to you. This means that what is happening to Barronelle Stutzman in Washington State could be happening to Christians nationwide in very short order. Stutzman had known this man and had done business with him for about nine years. The decision against Stutzman sets a dreadful precedent against our first freedom in the Bill of Rights: religious liberty.
