The transit system, known in San Francisco as BART, said on its website that the more recent shooting occurred July 3, after police dispatchers got a call about "a drunk who was unsteady on his feet and in danger of falling off the platform. Yet while there has been no admission of police wrongdoing, the San Francisco transit system has charged its "first-ever Independent Police Auditor," according to a statement posted Monday on its website. "It is a great relief that the independent auditor is in place to reassure the public that the investigation into the officer-involved shooting is conducted with the highest integrity and greatest level of transparency," BART board president Bob Franklin said. A group called "No Justice, No BART" -- which formed after the 2009 shooting of an unarmed passenger by a Bay Area Rapid Transit Police officer -- organized the spirited, albeit largely peaceful rally centered at the city's Civic Center stop. The protest prompted the BART system to halt service in and out of its Civic Center stop, the agency announced in an alert.
