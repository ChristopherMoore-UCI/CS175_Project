" U.S. officials in Brazil are working closely with Brazilian officials and talking to Samantha and her family to provide assistance, said Heidi Arola, who is with the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian authorities' decision to give custody of Samantha Hernandez to her boyfriend's uncle, while a legal action against her goes through the system, has left her family and U.S. officials scratching their heads. Brazil has a legal and moral duty to immediately return Samantha to her parents in the U.S." The office of Rep. Connie Mack, R-Florida, who represents the district where Robert Hernandez lives, said it has been in touch with the parties involved. The father's attorney, Albert Gayoso, told HLN's "Prime News" that the U.S. State Department told the mother that U.S. officials conducted a "wellness check" on Samantha on Thursday, during which they took pictures of the girl and the house where she is staying. Robert Hernandez said he has considered going to Brazil himself to get his daughter, but said he could be breaking Brazilian law if he were to attempt to get his daughter back on his own.
