John F. Kennedy, George H. W. Bush, John Warner, Daniel Akaka, Robert Dole, Max Cleland, John Murtha, John Kerry, James Webb and John McCain are just a few of the veterans in our nation's recent history who carried their oath to serve from combat to Capitol Hill. Whether they win or lose in their campaigns, for those of us who have served, their initiative is inspiring, especially after a decade of war during which recent veterans have often been portrayed as either villains or victims. But there is another first no one is really talking about: the surge of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans running this year. Hunter served as a Marine in both Iraq and Afghanistan and is up for re-election to Congress in a part of California with a huge concentration of active duty troops. Since George Washington first set aside his rank of general to seek office, declaring "When we assumed the soldier, we did not lay aside the citizen," veterans have long been part of a tradition of political service in this country.
