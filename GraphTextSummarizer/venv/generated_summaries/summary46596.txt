Instead, consider time in session â€¢ Senate time in session: More than 1,098 hours. In other words, Congress spent hundreds of hours in Washington -- far more than average for the Senate -- and still was not able to address most of the biggest issues of the day. We could look at the days in session, which were officially more than 150 for both the House and Senate. In 2013, Congress spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history. That is average for the Senate and way above average for the House.
