Now he's making good on his word: Tuesday's episode of the Fox hit, "The First Time," finds not only Rachel (Lea Michele) and Finn (Cory Monteith) having sex with each other for the first time, but -- in a groundbreaking move for an 8 p.m. series -- McKinley High's gay couple doing the same. According to Murphy, the four actors' only worry was that they look good in the love scenes: "The first thing they all said was 'Do we have to go on diets?'" Originally, when there was talk this past summer of a "Glee" spin-off, the thought was that Rachel would lose her virginity after moving to New York. " Murphy, who isn't surprised by the controversy, is staying focused on the bigger picture: In a year when bullying and teen suicides have grabbed headlines, he's hopeful that Kurt and Blaine's romance will continue to deliver a positive message to "Glee's" audience. The "Glee" co-creator also reveals that network Fox expressed no concern over the episode's potentially polarizing subject matter -- though the Parents Television Council issued a statement Tuesday condemning the episode: "The fact that 'Glee' intends to ... celebrate children having sex is reprehensible. Last winter on the set of the show's massive post-Super Bowl episode, "Glee" co-creator Ryan Murphy told EW that he wanted the gay teenage relationship between Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss) to be just as complicated as any of the show's heterosexual romances.
