For NASCAR Sprint Cup driver Josh Wise, it all adds up to sponsorship for one of the most exciting races of the year and a new bunch of tech-savvy fans. Reddit users also helped develop the fire suits that will be worn by the team on race day. Beyond sports ventures, Dogecoin has raised money to build clean water wells in Kenya and for a charity that trains service animals to work with children with autism and other disabilities. "As the company behind the NASCAR video games and mobile games, we love to see more technology-oriented partners getting involved in NASCAR," said Ed Martin, executive vice president of Eutechnyx, developer of the video game. Wise and Parsons said they would race the Dogecoin car if Reddit users vote Wise into the race.
