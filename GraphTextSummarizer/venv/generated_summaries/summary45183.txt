Jackson's albums hold the top nine positions of Billboard's "Top Pop Catalog Albums" chart, according to Nielsen SoundScan sales data released Tuesday. In the United States and United Kingdom, Jackson's introspective song, "Man in the Mirror," was No. 1 in iTunes downloads. Jackson's songs were on the Top 10 download lists in 21 countries, according to iTunes' Web site early Wednesday. Jackson's albums are not eligible for the current Billboard 200 chart, which is for newer albums. Jackson's albums "Number Ones," "The Essential Michael Jackson" and "Thriller" all sold more than 100,000 copies last week, close to 20,000 more copies than the Black Eyed Peas' "The E.N.D." Scores of listeners have downloaded Jackson's music on iTunes as well.
