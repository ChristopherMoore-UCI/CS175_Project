Two of five men arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing of French filmmaker Christian Poveda. Poveda -- who recently finished a documentary about a violent street gang, part of the Mara 18 gang in El Salvador -- was found shot dead in the town of Tonacatepeque, about 10 miles northeast of the capital, San Salvador, on September 2, authorities said. Poveda's documentary, "La Vida Loca," which follows the lives of members of the Mara 18 gang, had been screened at a handful of film festivals and is slated for wider release later this month. National Civil Police Officer Juan Napoleon Espinoza also was arrested, it said.
