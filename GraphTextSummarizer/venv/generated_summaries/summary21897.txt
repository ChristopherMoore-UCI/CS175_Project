-- Life is good for Elizabeth Smart a decade after surviving a hellish kidnapping, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. I mean, I couldn't be happier," Smart said in the second installment of her interview, which aired Tuesday on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360." Manipulating her kidnappers Mitchell and Barzee took Smart to San Diego soon after that encounter, but they were also talking about heading to New York or Boston, she said. " Mitchell refused to let the detective see under the veil that shielded Smart's face, saying it violated their religious beliefs for anyone but the young woman's husband to see her face. "We have to get back to Salt Lake," she told Cooper she was thinking.
