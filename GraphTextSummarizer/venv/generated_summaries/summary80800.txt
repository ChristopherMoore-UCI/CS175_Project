"The storm essentially shut southern Vermont down," said state police Capt. -- Floodwaters brought by Tropical Storm Irene began to recede Monday in parts of Vermont, but the governor warned that further flooding and loss of life are likely ahead for the small, rural state. Shumlin said additional flooding problems were likely as water poured out of smaller streams into larger rivers. For instance, Otter Creek in Rutland, Vermont, went from a depth of less than 4 feet Sunday morning to more than 17 feet at 1:45 a.m. Monday -- nearly 4 feet higher than the record set in 1938, according to the National Weather Service. Many areas of the state remained under flood warnings Monday, with the National Weather Service reporting continued record flooding in some locations.
