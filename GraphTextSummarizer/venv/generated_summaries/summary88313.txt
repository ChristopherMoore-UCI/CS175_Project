Kim Kardashian and Kanye West tied the knot at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, on Saturday, Kardashian's publicist told CNN. People reported Kardashian was walked down the aisle by Bruce Jenner while Andrea Bocelli sang "Con te Partir√≥"; and Kris Jenner was seen in the front row wiping her eyes during the ceremony. She gave birth to her daughter in June 2013 and Kardashian praised West's parenting skills during an interview with talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres after the rapper proposed to her. Reportedly it took the rapper nine years to finally win the woman of his dreams, but it was in March 2012 when they appeared together at Paris Fashion Week together that they were officially an item. The wedding capped off a weekend of extravagant European affairs, starting with a brunch hosted by fashion designer Valentino in Paris on Friday.
