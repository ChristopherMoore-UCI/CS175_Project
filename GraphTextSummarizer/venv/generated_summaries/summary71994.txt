"How I Met Your Mother" star Jason Segel has become almost unrecognizable after slimming down for the comedy "Sex Tape," and both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto became severely thin for "Dallas Buyers Club." Not everyone loses weight for their characters though. "(I've lost) probably a little over 20 pounds so," Gyllenhaal told CNN at this week's Hollywood Film Awards. Written and directed by Dan Gilroy, "Nightcrawler" is a crime drama that stars Gyllenhaal as an ambitious young man who becomes enmeshed in Los Angeles' underground scene of crime journalism. The 32-year-old isn't the only star who felt the need to transform himself physically to get into character. In David O. Russell's anticipated December release, "American Hustle," Christian Bale -- already no stranger to transforming himself physically -- packed on some pounds.
