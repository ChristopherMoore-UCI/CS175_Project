The violent incident came amid a dispute between Weston Cage's mother, Christina Fulton, and Nicolas Cage over how to deal with their son's psychological issues, which are outlined in legal document filed in Fulton's lawsuit against Cage. "Ms. Fulton comments about Mr. Cage are absurd, and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her," Singer said. Fulton is suing Cage over unpaid taxes and the Hollywood home where she raised Weston, and is seeking to regain legal control over her son, who court documents say suffers from "a number of mental, psychological and physical ailments." He lived with Fulton after she and Cage, who were never married, split up when Weston was a child. "For 18 years, I raised Weston so Nicolas could go be Nicolas Cage, and go be a superstar, and he did," she said.
