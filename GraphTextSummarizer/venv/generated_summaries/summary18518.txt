U.S. President Barack Obama pledged $7 billion Sunday to help combat frequent power blackouts in sub-Saharan Africa. Two-thirds of the population of sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to electricity, including more than 85% of those living in rural areas, the White House said. Africa's greater integration into the global economy will benefit everyone with the potential creation of new jobs and opportunities, he said. Sub-Saharan Africa will need more than $300 billion to achieve universal electricity access by 2030, it said. "These countries have set ambitious goals in electric power generation, and are making the utility and energy sector reforms to pave the way for investment and growth," a White House statement said.
