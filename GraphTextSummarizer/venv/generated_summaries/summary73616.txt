In addition, CNN obtained from a Democratic official a Bain Capital filing with the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in 2001 that listed Romney as Bain president as well as a director. Romney's campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said the Boston Globe article "is not accurate" and insisted the candidate left his management role at the company in 1999 "as Bain Capital has said, as Gov. Romney has said, and as has been confirmed by independent fact checkers multiple times." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Romney couldn't be confirmed as a dogcatcher because he refuses to make public more of his past income tax returns, while Romney adviser Ed Gillespie labeled as a lie some Obama ads that accused the former Massachusetts governor of outsourcing jobs when he headed Bain Capital. Steve Pagliuca, Bain managing partner, told CNN on Thursday that Romney had "absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities" of the firm after his February 1999 exit, but continued to be the sole stockholder. -- Accusations of lies and counter-lies dominated the intensifying November election campaign Thursday, with surrogates and spokespeople for President Barack Obama and certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney trying to cast the other as dishonest and secretive.
