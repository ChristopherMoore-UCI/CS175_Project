Mancini had already spent £25 million ($38.59 million apiece on Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure and Valencia winger David Silva, as well as signing German international defender Jerome Boateng from Hamburg for £15 million ($23.15 million). The Kolarov deal has increased speculation that England international left-back Wayne Bridge will now move to Liverpool. Manchester City's transfer window spending neared the £90 milliion ($139 million) mark after completing the signing of Serbian international left-back Aleksandar Kolarov from Lazio. City's Abu Dhabi-based owners have given Mancini the funds to improve on their fifth-placed finish in the English Premier League last season. The 24-year-old has been granted a work permit and the formalities of the reported £19 million ($29.32 million) deal with the Serie A club were completed after he passed a medical Saturday.
