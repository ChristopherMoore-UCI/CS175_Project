Fuller said general ballistics tests showed that while a bullet would not penetrate the helmet, they still failed to meet stringent Army requirements and "fell short of the required ballistics test. The move was triggered after the Justice Department informed the Army about an ongoing investigation into the company that makes the helmets, ArmorSource LLC, formerly Rabintex USA LLC. The Army refused to accept delivery of another 3,000 helmets recently, bringing the total of problem helmets to 102,000, Fuller said. " Three other companies also make the helmets, and replacement helmets are already being distributed, an Army statement said. After the Justice Department's notification, the Army conducted ballistic tests on the helmets and found they didn't meet service standards.
