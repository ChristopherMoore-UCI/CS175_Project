Using your search history, reviews and network of friends, Google makes recommendations of places it thinks you will enjoy. Images from Google Street View, user-submitted photos and fun Google projects like underwater view and interior 3-D tours are all highlighted, while the map itself fills the page. The next version of the widely used maps tool, previewed on Wednesday at the Google I/O conference in San Francisco, will soon have a different look and some splashy new features including displays of real-time accidents and personalized recommendations. Car accidents will appear on the map in real time. A collection of navigation improvements focus on finding the best, speediest route to a destination in real time.
