-- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas named the president of a West Bank university as his new prime minister Sunday, a top aide said. Rami Hamdallah has been asked to form a new Cabinet, Abbas adviser Sabri Saidam told CNN. Fayyad's decision to step down was viewed as a step toward the possible establishment of a unity government between the two main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas. Hamdallah will replace Salaam Fayyad, who has led a caretaker government since Abbas accepted his resignation in April. He is also the secretary-general of the Palestinian Central Elections Commission and head of the Palestinian stock exchange.
