"Sit Down Hind" has become a popular Twitter hashtag, as well as a popular meme on social media. By law, 15 seats in Jordan's 150-member House of Representatives are reserved for women, with female members determined by election results. This #sexsim stupidity should be ended #sitdownhind" "I now know for sure that my voice will be heard when I demand my rights in the near future #Sit Down Hind should be "Don't Sit Down Hind. Thank you Hind Al Fayez for implementing your presence in the parliament, for unlocking your voice & rejecting to be silent," a Jordanian woman tweeted. Al-Fayez yells before she sits down, referring to what used to be the only acceptable job for women in the Middle East -- running a stall in a market.
