Following 90 minutes of stalemate it was Joachim Low's side who finally broke the deadlock in the second minute of extra time when Thomas Muller squared the ball for Schurrle to cleverly back heal the ball past goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi. Moments later at the other end, Germany were denied themselves as Mbolhi pulled off an amazing double save from Toni Kroos then Mario Gotze. Schurrle replaced Gotze at the start of the second half -- a change which made Germany more purposeful in attack. But when Ozil scored Germany's second in the 119th minute they were home and dry despite Djabou's late goal. As the game entered the final 15 minutes of normal time it was Germany who increasingly looked likely to score.
