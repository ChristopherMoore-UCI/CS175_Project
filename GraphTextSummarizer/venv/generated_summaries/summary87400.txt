Bill Clinton's role is put into full perspective in "HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton," a book by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes that details Hillary Clinton's time at the State Department. Bill Clinton's support was so potent that when the Brown campaign announced it in April, Gansler felt it necessary to issue a statement that spelled out his "respect" for the former President and his strong support for Hillary Clinton, "should she choose to run" in 2016. And now they say she's auditioning for a part on 'The Walking Dead.'" Bill Clinton went on to say he was "sort of dumbfounded" by the fact that Rove reportedly hinted last week that Hillary Clinton may have suffered a "traumatic brain injury" when she fell and suffered a concussion in December 2012. Bill Clinton defends Hillary Clinton over Benghazi Republicans -- some of whom would probably like to see less of Bill Clinton -- suggest that he would be a political liability for a Clinton campaign.
