Claims listed in the filing include: - Jose Baez, the lead defense attorney during Anthony's trial: $500,000 - Orange County Sheriff's Office: $145,660.21 - Internal Revenue Service: $68,540 - Cindy and George Anthony, her parents: Unknown amounts Anthony: "We keep fighting" after two convictions tossed In 2008, Anthony told an investigator the last time she saw her 2-year-old daughter Caylee was when she dropped Caylee off at Gonzalez's apartment.
