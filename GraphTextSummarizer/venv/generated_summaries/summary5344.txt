But 29 months after losing his crown, Woods is back on top for the eleventh time in his career -- capping a fine month for both his game and private life, with the golfer having announced his relationship to skier Lindsey Vonn last week. In October 2010, six months after returning to golf with such poor form that he failed to win a single event in a season for the first time since turning professional, Woods lost his world best crown to Englishman Lee Westwood -- ending a record run of 281 consecutive weeks at the top (which started in June 2005). "It has been a by-product of hard work, patience and getting back to winning golf tournaments," Woods said of regaining the coveted top spot. His 77th PGA Tour victory also marked his 99th professional tournament win as Woods, who has won the Masters on four occasions, prepares his bid to wear the famous green jacket for the first time since 2005. "I play well here -- and that's as simple as it gets," Woods replied when asked the secret of his success at Bay Hill.
