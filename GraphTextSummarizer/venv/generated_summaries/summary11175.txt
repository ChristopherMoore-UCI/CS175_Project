She has become a leader of that country's women's empowerment movement, has been a tireless advocate for increased government transparency and accountability, and -- Republicans should be thrilled with this one -- she has been a staunch supporter of the U.S. private sector, constantly looking at ways to support American jobs by opening up markets and opportunities for companies in El Salvador. Aponte has also been an unmoving U.S. presence against any Cuba-Venezuela influence, including sending a direct message to El Salvador's president, Mauricio Funes, about the need to address human rights and democracy with Raul Castro during Funes' first official visit to Cuba. Mari Carmen Aponte, ambassador to El Salvador, was initially nominated by President Obama in late 2009. Republican Sen. Jim DeMint is using an even worse excuse to vote against her: a commentary she wrote recently for a daily newspaper in El Salvador urging tolerance and inclusion for gays and lesbians. There is still time for Republicans to reconsider how important her work in El Salvador has been and how foolish and petty it would be for them to put politics before good policy.
