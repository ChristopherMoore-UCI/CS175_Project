Fighting erupted at about 2 a.m. when Ansar al Sharia fighters surrounded and attacked a Benghazi base belonging to a Libyan army special forces unit that allied itself with renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar, according to residents and Col. Mohammed al-Hijazi, a spokesman for the self-declared Libyan National Army. One of the main targets of Haftar's Benghazi campaign, which he said is an open-ended war to purge Libya of extremist groups, is Ansar al Sharia, which the United States earlier this year named a terrorist group. The fighting in Libya's second-largest city comes more than two weeks after the previously retired Haftar -- without the consent of the Libyan government and military command in Tripoli -- launched a ground an air assault against Islamist groups in Benghazi. On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Tripoli, Benghazi and other cities in support of Haftar's Operation Dignity. We urge all those involved in the clashes to spare residents and infrastructure, and urge Libyan authorities to ensure the protection of Benghazi residents," said Hanan Salah, Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch.
