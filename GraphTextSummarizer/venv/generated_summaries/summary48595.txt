The move comes as Algeria, like other Arab nations, faces a wave of protest that has toppled regimes in Egypt and Tunisia and led to open revolt in against longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi in neighboring Libya. Human Rights Watch has said Algeria's government controls state broadcast outlets and sharply restricts private newspapers, with journalists facing prosecution for criticism of public officials. U.S. analysts say Algeria faces some of the same problems that fueled uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt -- high rates of unemployment and a stagnant economy in particular. Earlier this week, anti-government protesters clashed with police and pro-government demonstrators, opposition leaders said. The emergency declaration was part of a clampdown on Islamist movements during a civil war that left more than 150,000 dead.
