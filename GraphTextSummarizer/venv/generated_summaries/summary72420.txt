Part genius, part sociopath, part seductress, Susan uses her full arsenal of God-given weapons -- from sexual manipulation to full blown tempter tantrums -- to get what she wants. Though much of her work in recent years has focused on memorable television roles, the Mississippi native returns to the big screen in Michael Walker's "Price Check." Susan is just the latest of many roles you've made famous, but was there ever a part you passed on and then regretted later? For fans who have grown to love Posey's trademark dry wit and pitch perfect edginess, Susan lands squarely in the wheelhouse. Posey plays "Susan," a powerful marketing executive overseeing a chain of grocery stores.
