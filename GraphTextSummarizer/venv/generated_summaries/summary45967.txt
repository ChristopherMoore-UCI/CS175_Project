-- It's a Lego fan's dream come true: Legoland Florida opens this weekend in central Florida, the first Lego-themed outdoor park in the United States since Legoland California opened in 1999. Built on the former grounds of Cypress Gardens, one of Florida's first theme parks, Legoland Florida has preserved much of the historical and natural beauty of its predecessor. Legoland Florida is geared for kids ages 2 to 12 and features 50 rides as well as Miniland USA, the heart of every Legoland Park. Legoland Florida is the largest of the five Legoland parks, located in Denmark, England, Germany, and the United States. There are also smaller indoor Legoland Discovery Centers around the world, including several U.S. shopping malls.
