Italy: Al Qaeda will exploit North African migrant flood "I think there's an important dynamic around the external border of the EU, Turkey, central Asia republics and now of course North Africa and the Middle East," Europol's director Robert Wainwright told CNN Tuesday. -- People trafficking syndicates could try to exploit the unrest in North Africa, potentially causing a surge in the number of victims arriving in Europe, experts fear. Many of these people come to Europe hoping for a better future but end up becoming coerced into sexual exploitation and forced labor. "We have experts on the ground in Italy working with the Italian authorities right now to try to identify any signs that organized crime, even terrorist organizations, are trying to exploit the situation in North Africa in particular and the upsurge in the migratory flows that we've seen in recent weeks. The trade in people trafficking is worth $3 billion a year in Europe alone, but organized smuggling syndicates are constantly looking to expand their operations beyond national boundaries, analysts add.
