This week, Republican Sen. Mark Kirk  introduced an amendment that would impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that do business with Iran's central bank. U.S. officials have said the administration has been reluctant to cut off the central bank out of concern it could drive  up oil prices and hurt the U.S. economy. The Obama administration plans to impose fresh sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, diplomatic sources familiar with the plans said Friday. The goal of the new measures is to bar foreign companies from doing business with Iran's petrochemical industry by threatening them with being banned from U.S. markets,  the sources said. The Obama administration is facing increased pressure from Congress to turn up the heat on Iran, including sanctioning the Iranian central bank.
