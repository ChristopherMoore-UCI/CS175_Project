-- President Barack Obama on Thursday signed the Tribal Law and Order Act, which provides greater law enforcement powers for tribal authorities on Indian reservations. Supporters of the measure say the sentencing provision will expand the number of cases handled by tribal courts, increasing local tribal control on reservations. " "These are significant measures that will empower tribal nations and make a real difference in people's lives," Obama said of the new law. The new law reauthorizes existing initiatives such as at-risk youth programs and treatment programs, said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians. The law requires the Department of Justice to improve coordination with  tribal justice officials in prosecuting crimes on reservations, and  provides resources for better overall cooperation between tribal, state  and federal agencies.
