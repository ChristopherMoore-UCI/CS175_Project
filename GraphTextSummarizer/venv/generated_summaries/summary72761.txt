It took French President Nicolas Sarkozy to call the Security Council exercise weak and to chastise its members, including President Obama, for not condemning Iran and North Korea more forcefully. President Obama's style may be different and more pacifying but at the end of the day he hopefully will be conducting business that benefits American interests and not the lowest common denominator interests of the United Nations membership. We know President Obama loves lofty rhetoric and he does it well. Are either of those three dictators going to be better world citizens or kinder, gentler leaders as a result of Obama's outreach? No American president has ever stood before the U.N. body and condemned his predecessor or American foreign policy in such a way.
