-- Karen Shirk has spent 15 years matching people with service dogs that can help them with their special needs and disabilities. "I'm hoping more of these wounded soldiers will come to us looking for dogs. Within days, Lisa Murphy heard about the dog at the Yellow Ribbon Fund, a Maryland-based charity that helps injured service members recover. "Someone basically made her aware that this group was looking for a soldier amputee to connect with a service dog," said Lisa's husband, U.S. Army Capt. McConnell had lost both his legs in an IED explosion, and he was desperate for a service dog while he recovered at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington.
