A day later it remains unclear whether Saif al-Islam was ever in rebel hands, while another Gadhafi son, Mohammed, reportedly escaped from rebel custody. Washington joined Britain and other Western powers in recognizing the NTC last month as the legitimate governing authority in Libya, adding to the pressure on Moammar Gadhafi to relinquish power to the rebels. But shortly afterwards, Saif appeared in public in Tripoli, where he spoke to reporters -- raising serious questions about the reliability of the rebels' account of events. Djebbar believes the NTC should focus on getting food and medical supplies to the people in areas of Libya no longer under Gadhafi's control, in order to demonstrate that life will be better under a new government. The rebels did not know if Saif al-Islam Gadhafi had been arrested and escaped, he said, so they would have to confirm what happened with the leaders engaged in the fighting in Tripoli.
