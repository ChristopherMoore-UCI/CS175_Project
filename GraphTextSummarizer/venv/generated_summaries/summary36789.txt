Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said the November attack has increased urgency for the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, which failed to make it to the Senate floor in July, despite winning bipartisan committee support. The proposed cybersecurity bill is intended to help companies and the government work together to thwart hackers through increased data sharing. "Privacy advocates will be there to steadfastly oppose any privacy and invasive information sharing bills," said Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst at Electronic Frontier Foundation. A recent executive order issued by President Barack Obama created a program that allows companies to voluntarily share information with the Department of Homeland Security. Although the proposed cybersecurity bills are also voluntary for companies to participate, language has been written into the bill that shields businesses from "frivolous lawsuits" and "unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles," according to Sen. Saxby Chambliss, of Georgia, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and co-author of the Senate measure.
