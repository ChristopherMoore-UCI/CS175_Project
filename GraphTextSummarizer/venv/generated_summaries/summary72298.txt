Yadav is currently in police custody in New Delhi, where he is accused of raping a 26-year-old woman who had requested a ride through the car service app last weekend. The cases against Shiv Kumar Yadav in Uttar Pradesh date to 2003, said Superintendent Srikant Singh, a senior police official in the state. New Delhi says it has banned the car service, citing permit violations, and police say they have filed a case against it. The revelations from Uttar Pradesh police add to concerns about how he was allowed to operate as a driver for Uber. In New Delhi, he spent seven months in jail in between 2011 and 2012 during a trial on charges of rape of which he was acquitted, said the city's deputy police commissioner, Madhur Verma.
