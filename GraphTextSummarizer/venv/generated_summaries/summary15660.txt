"Finally New York gets money," said Helen Alamia, a slots player who said she would no longer travel to out-of-state casinos. The first casino in New York City opened Friday at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens to thousands of eager gamblers, some waiting hours to get in. Billboards for the casino advertise it as being "minutes, not hours away," a clear swipe at the more well-known -- and farther away -- gambling sites of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Indian reservations such as Foxwoods in Connecticut. "It was such a hassle to get in, but I'm glad I'm here," said Carmen Beverly, who said she took the subway to the casino from her home in nearby Brooklyn. It is the first casino to be built in New York City since the state legislature paved the way for its construction during the post-September 11, 2001, economic slump.
