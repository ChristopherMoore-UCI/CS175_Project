-- More than a million people went on strike in France Tuesday -- the biggest demonstrations yet in a series of rolling strikes against government plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62. Rail workers have also said they will stay off the job Wednesday, and air transport workers are voting Tuesday night on whether to continue industrial action, a transport union spokesman told CNN. About a quarter of education workers were on strike, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday -- very slightly below the percentage who walked off the job September 23. Paris transport workers have already voted to strike again Wednesday, which will affect the Paris Metro, buses and RER trains. The open-ended strike over pension reforms began days after the Senate began voting on the pension reform bill.
