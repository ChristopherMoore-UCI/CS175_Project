The exercises have rattled nerves in nearby NATO states, including Latvia, where U.S. troops and equipment recently arrived for NATO training, and where fears are growing about Russian President Vladimir Putin's next move. NATO jets scrambled to intercept Russian military aircraft as they neared Latvian airspace, officials said on Wednesday. The flights come as Russia's Northern Fleet has been placed on full combat alert for military exercises involving nearly 40,000 troops and 50 warships. NATO sent jets to identify the planes and later reported that the military aircraft flew on into Russian airspace. Other than the lead aircraft, NATO said, none of the other Russian military aircraft was on a flight plan.
