Perhaps the film's solid $29.2 million opening weekend was driven more by nostalgic adults than by family audiences. One possible explanation is that after all the activities and shopping of Thanksgiving weekend, many families opted to take it easy this week. The film may have trouble adding theaters beyond metropolitan areas because of its taboo rating. During what was one of the slowest weekends of the year, "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1" held on to first, dropping 60 percent for $16.9 million, according to studio estimates. The rest of the top five was occupied by other family films.
