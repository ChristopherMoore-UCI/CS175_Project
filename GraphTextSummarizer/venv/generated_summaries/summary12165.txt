Kyle became a legend in military circles due to his 160 confirmed kills and developed a deadly reputation in Iraq, where he served several times. "Bradley did an amazing job and I truly don't believe there's anybody who could have done better," Taya Kyle told CNN's Jake Tapper. Kyle's widow speechless after rifle raffle CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this report. Clint Eastwood's film on Kyle raked in $107 million over its first weekend on wide release this month -- an unprecedented haul for an R-rated drama in the middle of winter. The west Texas native attended Tarleton State University in Stephenville after graduating from high school in 1992.
