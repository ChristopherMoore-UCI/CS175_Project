Sunday's "Red Shirt" demonstrators -- so named for the color of their clothing -- demanded a thorough investigation of a deadly government crackdown in May, along with the release of protest leaders, some of whom have been held in jail on terrorism charges for months. Ninety-one people died and at least 1,500 others were injured in the clashes, which saw intense street battles between protesters and government troops. But their protests came to a bloody end in May.  Government troops cracked down and drove them out of their positions in the Thai capital. -- Thailand's red-shirted anti-government protesters returned to the streets of Bangkok Sunday for their first demonstration since a state of emergency was lifted last month. Between March and May of 2010, thousands of opposition protesters occupied parts of the shopping district in central Bangkok.
