-- Country music star Carrie Underwood and husband Mike Fisher took to Twitter Monday to make an announcement: They are expecting their first child. The 31-year old Underwood was American Idol Champion in 2004 and has been releasing hits ever since. " Her husband, Mike Fisher, an NHL player, tweeted more directly: "We haven't picked names yet, but it's looking like Fly is gonna fly." In a riddle of sorts, Underwood tweeted a picture of herself holding her two dogs, with the dogs sporting T-shirts that read "I'm going to be a big brother" on one and "big sister" on the other. It was the fifth time Underwood snagged the award and her third win in a row.
