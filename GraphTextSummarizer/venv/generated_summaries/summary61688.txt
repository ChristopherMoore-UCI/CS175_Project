While the FBI is a newbie when it comes to building mobile apps, several other U.S. federal agencies have already released applications. Parents can create separate entries for each kid, complete with photos, height, weight and other descriptive details. Child ID, the first mobile app made by the FBI, provides parents with a place to keep information about their children handy in case of an emergency. The FBI plans to release versions of the program for other phones later, the government agency said in a statement. Child ID debuted Friday as a free download for Apple iPhone and iPod Touch owners.
