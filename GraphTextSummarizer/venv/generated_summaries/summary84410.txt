"We have to go down there (Miami) and basically approach Sunday's game as game seven," Nowitzki told reporters, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. " Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the team would be focusing on its inability to close out games. "We've been waiting on an offensive night for us where we finally shoot the ball well, added Nowitzki. However the visitors could not keep up with the pace as Nowitzki and Jason Terry in particular took the game to them. "We haven't been able to do it consistently enough in this series," he said, in quotes carried by Reuters.com.
