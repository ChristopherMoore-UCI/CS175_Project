However, Fonseka must return to court Wednesday to face separate charges of violating military procurement procedures. Retired Army Gen. Sarath Fonseka faced a panel of three military judges, who are to decide whether he is guilty of participating in politics while still in uniform. The court will reconvene on April 6 to rule on the objections, according to government spokesman Maj. The former military commander challenged Rajapaksa in January's presidential elections, but lost by a wide margin and accused the government of election fraud. The man credited with the military campaign that defeated a quarter-century-long insurgency by the Tamil Tiger rebel movement was arrested last month.
