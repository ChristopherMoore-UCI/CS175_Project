He added: "Both sides came to that conclusion." Obama and Hagel put on a united front at a White House resignation announcement on Monday, with Obama pouring praise on his defense secretary, apparently to neuter speculation about a political split. Hagel had also shown signs of being increasingly out of sync with White House messaging. He was pushed out by President Barack Obama, sources told CNN, but will stay in the job until a successor is named. Hagel joined the administration at a time when Obama insisted that the nation was moving beyond a decade of war only to find himself grappling with the threat from ISIS, turmoil in Iraq and aggressive moves from Russia. In fact, there were signs that Hagel was becoming increasingly critical in private of Obama's Syria strategy, which is constrained by the President's insistence that U.S. ground troops must not be dragged into a vicious civil war.
