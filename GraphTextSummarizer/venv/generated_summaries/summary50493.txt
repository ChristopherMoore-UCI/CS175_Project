Our presidents still, from time to time, sleep among us, but whatever feeling of lighthearted happenstance was implicit in the "George Washington slept here" slogan is long gone. Presidents and presidential candidates took it for granted that the people who worked in the buildings where they spoke or slept were not a major danger-- until Robert F. Kennedy took that shortcut through the hotel kitchen. Today, when presidents decide to take a jog or go out for a bite to eat, it is done from within thick concentric rings of armed Secret Service agents and local police. Presidents routinely rode through cities in open convertibles-- until the murder of John F. Kennedy made that seem like a foolhardy concept. It's not a phrase any politician would welcome -- no one seeking the voting public's goodwill wants to be associated with traffic headaches -- but that's how it is these days, whether the person in office is a Democrat or a Republican.
