"The most fundamental driver for that kind of growth is coming from sales to consumers from emerging markets like China and India," said Imran Amed, who runs the Business of Fashion website. Outside of Asia and Brazil, wealthy consumers are also reaching for their Louis Vuitton purses again following several years of downturn-induced caution, according to Amed. Luxury brands, including fashion label Burberry and vehicle manufacturer Rolls-Royce, have all enjoyed bumper years, recording slump-busting profits that may raise eyebrows among consumers forced to tighten their non-snakeskin belts. He says that while economic hard times have hit those in the middle to lower income brackets, in countries such as Britain and the United States "there's an elite class of consumer that remains untouched by the crisis. However, he says, high-end brands have little to fear from rising raw material costs that have added to the pressures on other sectors of the economy.
