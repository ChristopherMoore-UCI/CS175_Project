According to court documents, Portland police authorities disagreed with the findings of excessive force but were willing to enter into the agreement with the Justice Department "out of a mutual desire to protect the constitutional rights of all members of the Portland community, to continuously improve the safety and security of the people of Portland, to keep (Portland Police Bureau) employees safe, and to increase public confidence in PPB, all in a cost-effective, timely, and collaborative manner. "I am confident that the reforms mandated by this agreement will result in a Portland Police Bureau that provides police services in a constitutional manner and that better protects the community," said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. -- The Justice Department and Portland, Oregon, have reached an agreement for the reform and monitoring of the city's police department after an investigation determined that police often used excessive force, including Tasers, on the mentally ill in situations involving low-level offenses. " The Justice Department began its investigation into whether Portland's police engaged in a pattern of using excessive force in June 2011. According to the suit, the Portland Police Bureau "engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force on individuals with actual or perceived mental illness in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and other laws of the United States."
