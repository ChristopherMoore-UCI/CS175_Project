On Tuesday, the first lady will unveil the details of her comprehensive plan, the broad outline of which, she told a meeting of key members of Congress and the Cabinet, include four main elements: increasing the number of healthy schools; increasing the amount of physical activity children receive; improving accessibility and affordability of healthy foods; and empowering consumers and families to make healthier food choices. From that moment forward, I saw overweight and obese kids everywhere: At church, in Wal-Mart, at the movies. Studies find that overweight and obese kids are more likely to grow up to be overweight and obese adults. In fact, obesity rates for kids have tripled over the last three decades, according to a widely circulated report that appeared in the Academic Pediatrics journal late last summer. Here's hoping that people across America hear Mrs. Obama's call to action and join the national campaign to end childhood obesity.
