India has been careful not to support Iran's government, but if U.S. diplomacy with Iran fails, it remains to be seen if New Delhi will support tougher sanctions if the U.S. decides to go that route. Before coming to Washington, Singh said that Pakistani objectives in Afghanistan aren't necessarily those of the U.S. Pakistan has long seen instability in Afghanistan as critical to its war strategy against India. India is also considered a critical U.S. partner in dealing with other instability in the region, in places like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India believes the U.S. has failed to curb Islamabad's backing of anti-India extremists based in Pakistan, and tensions between India and Pakistan remain high, especially with Pakistan's slow progress on the investigation into last year's Mumbai attack that killed 166 people. India maintains it is still a developing country and wants developed nations, like the U.S., to assume the lion's share of burden in dealing with climate change.
