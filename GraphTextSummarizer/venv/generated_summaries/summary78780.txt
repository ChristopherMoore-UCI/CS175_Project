"We eliminated four different agriculture subsidies and instead have moved to risk management so we'll support farmers and ranchers when there's a loss, where there's a weather loss, it's a price loss, through crop insurance, through other things where the farmer has some skin in the game," said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwomen Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan. "Unfortunately, it seems that Congress' idea of farm bill reform is to eliminate one subsidy program only to invent a new one to take its place," said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Republicans have blocked many bills this session partly because they've been denied by the Democratic majority the ability to vote on amendments. Most of the bill's savings are achieved through changes to crop assistance programs that have been in place in one form or another since the Great Depression. -- Senators approved a giant farm bill Thursday that is estimated to cut the deficit by almost $24 billion, largely by ending direct payments to farmers and replacing them with taxpayer- subsidized crop insurance to assist farmers in need.
