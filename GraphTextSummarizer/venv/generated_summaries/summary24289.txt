" Mickelson, the 2011 Houston winner, carded a bogey-free four-under-par 68 to be tied for 18th in a group including fellow veterans Ernie Els, Davis Love, Retief Goosen and 2012 U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson. They were three shots behind leaders Bill Haas -- the PGA Tour's 2011 FedEx Cup champion -- and fellow American Charley Hoffman, seeking his first victory since 2010. -- His old rival Tiger Woods is missing the Masters, but three-time champion Phil Mickelson should be teeing off at Augusta next week after allaying fears about his fitness. On Tuesday and Wednesday, fifth-ranked Mickelson spent time practicing at Augusta, where he wore the victor's fabled Green Jacket in 2004, 2006 and 2010. However, the 43-year-old raised hopes of claiming a career sixth major title after coming through Thursday's opening round at the Houston Open in good shape.
