Users can also integrate Axis among multiple devices, saving a personal homepage and searches on phone, tablet and desktop computers. The integrated search feature is intuitive, and being able to move through search results without having to go back to search makes sense. Boyd wrote: "The three leaders in this space have each realized that the conventional paradigms for search, architected over a decade ago when bandwidth was low, few people used the Web for more than research, and almost all computing was done at desktops, no longer work in an age of mobile apps, multiple devices, big data, and ever greater expectation on the part of the consumer that working online is about getting things done, not just perusing documents." The unveiling of Axis comes as Yahoo is trying to jockey for position among the big three of Web search -- Google, Microsoft's Bing and Yahoo Search. On mobile devices, a query returns thumbnail images of actual Web pages instead of a list of links.
