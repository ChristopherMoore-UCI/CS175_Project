That's higher than the average of 6.3 deaths over the past 10 years, said George Burgess, who conducts research on sharks at the University of Florida. -- The number of shark attacks last year dropped to a four-year low, but they were deadlier, a University of Florida report says. Over the past century, shark attacks have been on the increase as more humans have ventured into the water, according to Burgess. "When sudden increases in shark attacks occur, usually human factors are involved that promote interactions between sharks and people," he said. Worldwide, 10 people died in 72 shark attacks last year.
