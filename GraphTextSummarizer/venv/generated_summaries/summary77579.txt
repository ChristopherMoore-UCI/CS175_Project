Novak Djokovic shrugged off an injury problem to turn out for Davis Cup holders Serbia in the doubles rubber against Sweden, but it proved in vain as the Wimbledon champion and Nenad Zimonjic slipped to defeat Saturday. Michael Llodra and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga saw off Philipp Petzschner and Christopher Kas in straight sets, 7-6 6-4 6-4 to complete a comprehensive victory. The French, beaten by Serbia in last year's final, look set to face Spain, who lead the United States 2-0 in Texas, in the last four. Feliciano Lopez stunned the hosts by beating Mardy Fish 8-6 in the fifth and final set Friday night before David Ferrer added to home misery by dispatching Andy Roddick in straight sets. Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils had put France in charge Friday with hard-fought singles victories over Florian Mayer and Philipp Kohlschreiber.
