Angie and Greg Cooper Duluth, Georgia Married 20 years One afternoon in the fall of 2002, Greg sat down at the family's computer with the intention of researching their upcoming trip to Walt Disney World. That had changed: Angie was spending her time either at work or at home with young Aidan, while Greg, a photographer, busily coached Nicholas's soccer team and led his Cub Scout pack. Now they mentor other couples at Retrouvaille, an experience Greg has found so rewarding that he's returned to graduate school to become a marriage and family therapist. We're getting a divorce." Angie, an insurance account manager, and Greg had been growing apart for years. "I didn't feel important to Greg beyond being our children's caregiver," says Angie.
