The report says DHS improved port security by tightening access to ports, conducting advanced screening of foreign seafarers entering U.S. ports and developing a security credential for truckers and other entering ports. The report says DHS has enhanced aviation security by improving the pre-screening of passengers, checkpoint screening, baggage checking and airport security. But the GAO noted that during covert tests, investigators were able to enter ports using counterfeit credentials or authentic credentials obtained fraudulently. It also developed a strategy for cargo container security. Readers of the report will find a wealth of information about the department's accomplishments, and of woeful lapses, all organized in 10 areas of responsibility, such as "aviation security," "border security," and "emergency preparedness."
