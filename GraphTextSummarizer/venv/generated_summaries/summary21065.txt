An impeachment process will help prevent authoritarianism, said Matias Funes, a writer who also is former congressman and presidential candidate. An impeachment process for Honduras "is very risky and is unacceptable," a former president, Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, told La Prensa newspaper last year. In June 2009, the Honduran military carried out an order from the country's Supreme Court to remove President Jose Manuel Zelaya from office. Without a clear interpretation of the constitution, the military ended up sending Zelaya into exile, and the country fell into a political crisis that other nations simply called a coup. , the country's congress will add an impeachment process to its constitution, hoping to deter future political crises.
