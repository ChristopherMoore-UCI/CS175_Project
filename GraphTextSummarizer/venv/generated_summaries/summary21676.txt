" Houston police said they are stuck and will follow any lead, even those involving Iranian conspiracies, if it will lead them to the killer. Houston police on Monday announced they have doubled the reward from $5,000 to $10,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for Bagherzadeh's death. Members of the Sabz dissident group wondered why Iran might target Bagherzadeh, particularly because "there are many more important opposition leaders" in the United States, according to group member Seth Eslami. Burton, a former State Department expert on counterterrorism, said the fact that the victim lived in Paris and traveled widely in Europe could have made her far more important to Iranian intelligence than her dissident activities in the United States. Fred Burton, a senior vice president of a private security analytical firm, Stratfor Global Intelligence, said Iranian intelligence services work in secretive ways, with motives that aren't always clear.
