-- Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki confirmed Tuesday that the Obama administration is considering a controversial plan to make veterans pay for treatment of service-related injuries with private insurance. The groups included The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Davis said the move would risk private health care for veterans and their families by potentially maxing out benefits paying for costly war injury treatments. Currently, veterans' private insurance is charged only when they receive health care from the VA for medical issues that are not related to service injuries, like getting the flu. Lawmakers say they'd reject a proposal to make veterans pay for treatment of war wounds with private insurance.
