-- When the Kansas City Royals moved on to the World Series on Wednesday, superfan Paul Rudd knew exactly what time it was: time to party. He was in town for the American League Championship Series game on Wednesday night, when the Royals beat the Baltimore Orioles 2-1 to advance to the World Series for the first time since 1985. Rocking a new baseball cap in support of his team, a hoarse and clearly thrilled Rudd told CNN affiliate KMBC that he's had faith the Royals could come this far. The 45-year-old actor was born in New Jersey but grew up in a suburb of Kansas City and is one of the team's true blue supporters. Lost voice or no, Rudd wasn't ready to call it a night.
