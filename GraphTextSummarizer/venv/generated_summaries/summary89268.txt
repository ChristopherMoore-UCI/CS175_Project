-- Ireland has expelled an Israeli diplomat over the use of forged passports in the assassination of a Hamas arms dealer in Dubai, allegedly by Israeli agents, the Irish foreign minister announced Tuesday. But "the fact that the forged Irish passports were used by members of the same group who carried the forged British and Australian passports, leads us to the inescapable conclusion that an Israeli government agency was responsible for the misuse and, most likely, the manufacture of the forged Irish passports associated with the murder of Mr. Mabhouh," he said. Ireland is following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom and Australia, which each kicked out Israeli diplomats after concluding Israel had probably forged their countrys' passports as part of a Mossad operation against Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing. Police believe he was killed the night before and suspect the Mossad, the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit, was behind his killing. Al-Mabhouh was found dead in his hotel room in Dubai in January.
