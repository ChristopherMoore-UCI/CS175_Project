Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis says he wants to enact reforms in response to the international financial crisis. Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party suffered a sharp setback in European elections in June, when the Socialists matched New Democracy's tally of eight seats, with 36 percent of the vote. Karamanlis is also seeking a mandate from the voters for reforms in response to the international financial crisis, he said. But Socialist party leader George Papandreou insisted on new elections before the end of Papoulias' term as president in February. The new elections will be held October 4, Karamanlis announced Thursday after meeting President Karolos Papoulias, who officially dissolves parliament.
