" Dunn's former attorney, Robin Lemonidis, previously told CNN, "When all the evidence has been flushed out, I believe that it will be extremely clear that Mr. Dunn acted as any responsible firearm owner would have under the same circumstances," Lemonidis said. He picked up his girlfriend as she came out of the convenience store and fled the scene, not realizing one of his eight bullets had killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis, Dunn told police interrogators. He initially fired his weapon four times, Dunn tells police, and the Durango began to pull away. The couple continued on to St. Augustine, where they checked into their room and ordered pizza but didn't call police, Dunn said. Dunn didn't call police, he says, because he wanted to go back to his South Patrick Shores home, another 130 miles south of St. Augustine.
