When tragedies like Columbine or Sandy Hook happen, we are reminded of the fragility and precious nature of life. Like them, I know what it means to have life turned on its head by unprecedented violence. When you are able to come out of a tragedy you'll be stronger with a greater capacity to love, more determination to serve others and desire to mend broken family ties. Life won't be the same. Then, life will be livable again.
