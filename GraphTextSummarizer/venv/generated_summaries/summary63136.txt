Watch: Taekwondo - 'Nigeria's fastest-growing sport' In Lagos, you'll find most martial artists practicing at Lagos National Stadium in Surulere. -- I moved to Lagos earlier this year as CNN's correspondent for West Africa and so far, it's been everything I expected and more. In Lagos, when it comes to martial arts, taekwondo -- the way of the hand and foot -- rules. to the ritzy Sky Bar (Eko Hotel & suites, Adetokunbo Ademola Street) and the rowdy and pulsating Xclusive Lounge (1310 Karimu Kotun Street, Victoria Island). I've lived abroad a good part of my life and I've visited some of the most dynamic cities in the world -- from Sao Paulo to Hong Kong to Dubai -- and I can honestly say that I've never experienced anything as vibrant, exciting and yes, as challenging, as Lagos.
