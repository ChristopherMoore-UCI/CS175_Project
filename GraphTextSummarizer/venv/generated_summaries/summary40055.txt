Among the other appointments to the 34-member cabinet, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA): Ahmed Galal, a liberal economist educated in the United States and a World Bank veteran, has been appointed as finance minister, and Hisham Zaazou who will retain his post as tourism minister The news of the appointments came as Egypt's top prosecutor, Hesham Barakat, opened an investigation into whether Morsy and 18 senior Muslim Brotherhood leaders made a jailbreak during the early days of the 2011 popular uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak. -- Just two weeks after the Egyptian military ousted President Mohamed Morsy, the country's interim leader Tuesday swore in a new cabinet that excluded members of powerful Islamist parties that came to political power in the country's first democratic elections. Among the allegations, according to state-run EGYNews: Morsy and the others were helped in their escape by elements of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah along with other Salafist and Muslim Brotherhood supporters. The appointment of Adly's new cabinet members, which include Hazem El-Beblawi as interim prime minister and Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei as interim vice president, is likely to do little to cap the growing anger among Morsy's supporters, who have refused to accept the new government. The new government of interim President Mansour Adly is part of a military-backed plan that dismantled Morsy's government and suspended the constitution until a new one can be drawn up and new elections can be held in six months.
