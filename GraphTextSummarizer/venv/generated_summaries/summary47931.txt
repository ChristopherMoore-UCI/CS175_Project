-- A sightseeing ride in the skies over New York City turned into a whole different kind of adventure on Sunday when the helicopter made an emergency landing in the Hudson River. "We lost power," said the pilot, who would not give his name or further details. One person refused further medical attention after being checked out at the scene. Four people were taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries, the New York City Fire Department said. The helicopter hit the water near 79th Street, the New York Fire Department said.
