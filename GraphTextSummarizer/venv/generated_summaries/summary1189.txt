That warning of the limits to U.S. power is broadly the same message Obama wanted to deliver on climate change and ISIS, which he focused on this week. The coalition of Arab countries that joined in the U.S. air campaign over Syria -- a victory for Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry -- can help "de-legitimize" the ideology espoused by ISIS, U.S. officials say, making the group an essential part of Obama's war plan. And on Thursday, President Barack Obama confronted yet another emergency that threatens wide destruction overseas: the Ebola outbreak spreading in West Africa. Both threats, Obama said at various points, will require coalitions of governments to act rather than the U.S. alone. Obama's three main issues here -- climate change, ISIS and Ebola -- each has the potential to rapidly spiral out of control, officials suggest, with the effects of a warming planet already being registered and Americans overseas already being killed both by terrorists with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and by the deadly virus spreading in Africa.
