The suspect, identified as Richard Matthews, 53, of Slaughter, Louisiana, parked outside Grady Crawford Construction Co. shortly before 2 p.m. and entered a building, where he shot a female dispatcher, said Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Casey Rayborn Hicks. Matthews was transported to the sheriff's office in downtown Baton Rouge, Hicks said, and was being questioned. Hicks said police are uncertain if Matthews has prior arrests, mental health or substance abuse issues. Matthews will be booked on two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Hicks said. Hicks said Matthews then went into a second company building and killed two people inside.
