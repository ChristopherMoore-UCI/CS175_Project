" Weaned on the vision of an enlightened spacefaring society that "Star Trek" offered, and inspired by President John F. Kennedy's call to put an American on the moon, Torres dedicated herself at an early age to working in the space program. For Torres, a simple cardboard cutout from "Star Trek" embodies both the adventurous spirit of the space program and the personal convictions that carried her through life. She came of age with classic science fiction, like the original "Star Trek" television series. Candy Torres drove nonstop for 21 hours to see the launch of space shuttle Challenger in June 1983. Her favorite souvenir from her career at NASA is a life-size cutout of the half-Klingon engineer B'Elanna Torres from "Star Trek: Voyager."
