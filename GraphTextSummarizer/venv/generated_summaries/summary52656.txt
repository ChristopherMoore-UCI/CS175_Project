Although the Obama administration "won't be passing the hat," U.S. officials expect that some NATO countries will announce in Chicago commitments to pay for the Afghan army and police post-2014. In a time of contracting budgets, what kinds of commitments are plausible for NATO countries to make to Afghanistan after the alliance withdraws all its combat troops from the country in 2014? There appear to be no good options in Syria and, like most Americans, NATO countries have grown very weary of the long war in Afghanistan. Pakistan closed the ground routes in protest after NATO forces killed about two dozen Pakistani soldiers last November at a post on the Afghan-Pakistan border, in what NATO has termed an accident. Right now Pakistan is blocking the transit of critical NATO supplies over Pakistani roads to Afghanistan.
