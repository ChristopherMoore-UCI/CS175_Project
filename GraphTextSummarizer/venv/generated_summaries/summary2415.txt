The women's final, meanwhile, will pit American Serena Williams and Russia's Maria Sharapova after the two won semifinal matches Friday in straight sets. Already the most decorated Olympian in history, Phelps started off Friday's race -- which he has said will be his final individual Olympic race, having promised to retire after this competition -- trailing several swimmers. And for the first time since the opening ceremony, Olympic Stadium was buzzing Friday with the start of track and field competition. Fellow American Carmelita Jeter posted the day's best time in that race at 10.83 seconds, a full tenth of a second better than her next fastest foe. That margin, while slim, was still exponentially larger than when Phelps captured gold in the same event at the 2008 Beijing Games.
