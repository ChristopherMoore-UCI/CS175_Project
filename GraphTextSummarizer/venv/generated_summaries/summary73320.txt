Incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, and Republican challenger Rep. Bill Cassidy traded sharp allegations of personal misconduct in the final debate before the Louisiana Senate runoff, scheduled for Saturday, Dec. 6. But in addition to defending himself, Cassidy was quick to fire back at Landrieu for using taxpayer dollars to fund her private campaign transportation, a violation for which she has apologized and reimbursed taxpayers for. In addition to highlighting that Landrieu has voted with the President "97 percent of the time," Cassidy also tried to tie Landrieu to Jonathan Gruber, who served as an adviser during the law's drafting and whose controversial comments about the law and its passage have set off a conservative firestorm. Responding to Landrieu's suggestion that the President's unpopularity in Southern states may be attributable to historical racial bias, Cassidy said, "Just because you disagree with the President, doesn't make you a racist." Landrieu finished just ahead of Cassidy in the all-party primary on Nov. 4, but couldn't draw a majority of the vote, sending the race to a runoff that will be decided on Saturday.
