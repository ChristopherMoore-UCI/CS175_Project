"They identified another type of nerve cell, which they called 'grid cells,' that generate a coordinate system and allow for precise positioning and pathfinding," the statement read. Oversimplified, one could say that the place cells mark point A and point B in the brain, and the grid cells help the brain get from point A to point B. They also later figured out how place and grid cells work together to make the brain know where it is and where it's headed. John O'Keefe, along with May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser, discovered cells that form a positioning system in the brain -- our hard-wired GPS. James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman, and German Thomas C. Sudhof were awarded the prize for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce.
