Third seed Caroline Wozniacki, who is in the same half of the draw, progressed into the last 16 with a 7-5 6-4 victory over Russian 29th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Radwanska won 6-3 6-1 against Italian 32nd seed Sara Errani on Saturday, while Na beat Australia-based Russian Anastasia Rodionova 6-1 6-3. "I was playing a little better last year, so hopefully I can pick it up -- obviously I'll have to in the next match," the American told reporters. The 19-year-old Dane will next face unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova after the 20-year-old knocked out 14th seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus with a 7-5 6-0 victory. Williams is seeking her fourth title at the grass-court grand slam in England, but said she has yet to find the form of last year despite an ominous start to the two-week tournament.
