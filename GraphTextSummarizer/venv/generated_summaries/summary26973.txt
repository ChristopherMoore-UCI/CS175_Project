"Our findings and preliminary results suggest that our method could be used to allow people with misaligned eyes ... to experience what it is like to actually see in 3D." He said the study could have implications for movie producers and other industries. The 3-D technology that's currently used in movies and other media relies on two visual images, one from each eye, combining in the viewer's brain to produce 3-D's extra layer of depth. "We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole). In recent years, 3-D has become an emerging technology for blockbuster movies, video games, TV and other media. That method would also decrease eye fatigue and some of the other side effects people report from wearing 3-D glasses.
