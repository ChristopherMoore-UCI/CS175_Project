California is the only state that adopted the 2006 International Building Code without the companion housing code that includes acceptance of AAC in seismic areas, he said. The next International Building Code, slated to take effect in 2011, will permit use of AAC in more places that have minimal seismic activity, Walls said. "We've done all the testing, and the testing showed the material works fine in any seismic area," said Felipe Babbitt, a Mesa, Arizona, engineer who helped develop code standards for AAC block. "What is baffling is this is a product that could be enormously beneficial in California," said Michael McDonough, a world-renowned New York architect who specializes in sustainable industry. Rajesh Kanwar built his Alpine, California, house out of AAC after his previous house burned down.
