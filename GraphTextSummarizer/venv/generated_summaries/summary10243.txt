Alonso's championship lead was reduced to 24 points as two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel capitalized on the chaos to finish second and move ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in the overall standings, heading into the Italian Grand Prix. -- Formula One championship leader Fernando Alonso confirmed Tuesday that he will be fit for Ferrari's home race at Monza, after recovering from injuries sustained in a spectacular crash at the Belgian Grand Prix. "Today I woke up with no pain and 200% ready for Monza," Alonso wrote on his Twitter blog. Alonso complained of pain in his left shoulder, after French driver Romain Grosjean's Lotus flew over his Ferrari on the first corner of Sunday's race, narrowly missing his head. Grosjean, meanwhile, has been replaced by Lotus reserve driver Jerome D'Ambrosio, while he serves his suspension.
