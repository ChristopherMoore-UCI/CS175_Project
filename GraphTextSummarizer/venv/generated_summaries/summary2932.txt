When the Association for Women in Sports Media was founded in 1987, the treatment of female reporters in locker rooms was a huge problem -- if they were even granted locker-room access. " Locker rooms are smelly places. While the arrival of the NBA in Oklahoma City several years has increased the frequency with which I'm inside locker rooms, I still remember the first time that I went into a pro sports locker room. That's continued to be my experience in pro locker rooms. Frankly, I suspect that's the experience of most female reporters who've been in pro locker rooms.
