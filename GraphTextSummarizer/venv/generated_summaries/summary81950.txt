While women with breast cancer have a 90% five-year survival rate, women with ovarian cancer have a 45% five-year survival rate. Women like me, with this mutation, have a 50% chance of getting ovarian cancer in their lifetime. My form of cancer made me eligible as it releases certain proteins which attract the experimental drug, enabling it to attack in a targeted manner. Unfortunately, there has been no breakthrough drug for ovarian cancer treatment in more than 20 years. Before diagnosis, I did not know approximately 21,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer annually in the United States, and 14,500 women die from this disease.
