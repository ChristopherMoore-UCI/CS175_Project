Even before the tropical weather struck Haiti, an estimated 2.3 million Haitians had fallen into food insecurity, with dramatic increases in prices for staple foods, USAID has said. The U.S. Navy sent the USS Kearsarge to Haiti last month to deliver more than 1,400 metric tons of relief supplies, in support of USAID and the World Food Program. Tropical Storm Hanna passed over northern Haiti in early September, bringing heavy rain and flooding. Jean Pierre Guiteau, the group's executive officer, said they suspected the numbers may climb further because many people were still missing.
