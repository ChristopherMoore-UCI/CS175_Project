-- If Elana Meyers Taylor makes bobsled history this season, her husband will have been the driving force. Meyers Taylor and Kaillie Humphries, the Canadian friend and rival who beat her to women's gold in Sochi, had been dreaming of this change. "I didn't know if it would ever be possible to race and compete in four-man," Meyers Taylor told CNN. By 2013, Taylor was begging FIBT boss Ivo Ferriani to pull some strings: he wanted to propose to Meyers, as she then was, during the podium ceremony at the end of that year's World Championships, where Meyers had won silver. "We spend a lot of time together and he puts me through some pretty brutal workouts," said Meyers Taylor.
