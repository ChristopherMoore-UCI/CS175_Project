Last year, Frontier Airlines banned pets from the cabin area because officials said pet allergies are common among their customers. Each year, airlines transport hundreds of thousands of pets in the cargo and cabin areas. Midwest Airlines may be an extreme example, letting select dogs sit in the same seats as humans, but other airlines are relaxing their pet policies by letting smaller cats and dogs come into the cabin area. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't have restrictions on whether animals can be in the cabin area, but airlines must allow service dogs for the disabled on board. Only cats and dogs are allowed in the cabin areas on most airlines.
