Wayne Nelson Corliss, 58, was arrested at his apartment in Union City, New Jersey, about midnight Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Interpol said in a written statement. After the success of that operation, Interpol's general assembly approved a resolution allowing Interpol to seek public help in child sex abuse investigations. "Two days ago, this man's nationality, identity and location were totally unknown," Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said. "All we had to go by were a series of graphic photographs in which the suspect was seen sexually abusing young children and our confidence that the public and police worldwide would once again respond to Interpol's call for assistance. Corliss appeared Thursday before a U.S. magistrate in Newark, New Jersey, but did not enter a plea.
