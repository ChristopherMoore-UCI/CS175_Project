Intensifying clashes in eastern Ukraine following a new Russian-backed separatist offensive on January 13 have fueled debate over how the United States and others should respond to the uptick in violence, including growing talk of the U.S. sending weapons. Just last week, a report by prominent former diplomats and highly respected members of the U.S. national security establishment argued for a drastic increase in U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including the provision of lethal weapons. As a result, while the debate on weapons for Ukraine is not over, it appears settled for now. True, with support, coordination, and heavy armaments from Russia, the separatists have managed to push Ukrainian forces north of the previous line of control, leaving Ukraine's military in a precarious position. Russia's end game--federalization of Ukraine, autonomy for the separatists, and a permanent hook over the strategic choices the country makes--simply cannot be agreed to.
