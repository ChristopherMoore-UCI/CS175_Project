This was not a random act," Pentis said at a news conference Monday. Until the couple's slaying, the gated community of luxury homes had not recorded a homicide in 15 years, police said. Packer is accused of murdering Brock Husted, his wife, Davina Husted, and her fetus. About 10:30 p.m., the suspect entered the home through French doors that face the ocean, police said.
