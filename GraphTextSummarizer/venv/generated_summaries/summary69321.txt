-- Police in Bolivia used tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters who took to the streets protesting a hike on the price of fuels Monday. Bolivian President Evo Morales defended the increase, saying it was needed partly because of Bolivian fuel being sold illegally to other countries, the state-run news agency ABI reported. As a result, trafficking in fuels made it a very profitable business, said Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera. The government estimates that Bolivia loses as much as $150 million a year in fuel sold outside the country. The price of gasoline has risen 73 percent while diesel fuel rose at least 80 percent.
