Last year, world No. 1 Roger Federer failed in his bid to match Tilden's record when he was beaten in the final by Juan Martin Del Potro. He won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at Wimbledon in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit Eventually joined by the likes of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Don Budge, Tilden remained a star attraction until well into his 40s, filling arenas such as Madison Square Garden in big-money matches. A relatively late starter, Tilden struggled to get into his college tennis team in Pennsylvania, but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the First World War as he reached the U.S. Open finals of 1918 and 1919. Tilden, who claimed his seventh U.S. Open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist, goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Tilden won his six straight U.S. Open titles from 1920-1925, a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system -- where the champion automatically qualified for the final -- in 1911.
