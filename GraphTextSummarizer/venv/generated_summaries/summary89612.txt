The plea filed on behalf of Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, was "under process," Supreme Court registrar Pukhraj R. Bora said. -- India's Supreme Court received an appeal challenging the death sentence of the only surviving gunman from the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai, authorities said Friday. A trial court handed down the death sentence last year for Kasab, a Pakistani, on charges of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. India blamed the siege on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda.
