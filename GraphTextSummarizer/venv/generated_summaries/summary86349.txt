"I've gotten e-mail after e-mail from former band members saying exactly the same thing," Axelrod said.. An audio recording, purportedly of Waters yelling and cursing at a band member, surfaced on Sunday. " The report, released last Wednesday, described longtime traditions in the band like sexually explicit nicknames and something called the "midnight ramp," in which band members entered the stadium through a ramp wearing only their underwear. He was deeply affected by it and that's why as band director he did everything he could to stop anything inappropriate," the attorney said. But the university didn't think Waters did enough in the 21 months he led the marching band, first as interim director, then as band director. The Ohio State University marching band is considered one of the best college marching bands in the country.
