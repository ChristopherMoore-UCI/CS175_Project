In the Dohar district, Awami League candidate Abdul Mannan, a former land minister, was routed by Jatiya Party candidate Salma Islam. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and its allies boycotted elections and announced it would try to prevent voting with general strikes and road blockades. The Election Commission will hold new voting in eight districts where it suspended elections because of violence Sunday. The party on Sunday urged the government to cancel the election results and announce schedules for new elections under a neutral caretaker government. Including the results from unopposed elections, the Awami League has won 232 seats so far, and the Jatiya Party has won 33 seats.
