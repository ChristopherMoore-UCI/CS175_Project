Led Zeppelin, one of the most influential groups of all time, broke up in 1980 following Bonham's death, but reunited for four occasions, most recently a show at London's O2 Arena in honor of Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, who signed the band in 1968. The offer to re-form the band was reportedly made by Virgin chairman Richard Branson, a fan of the group, and would have set up dates in three locales: London, Berlin and New Jersey. Robert Plant has reportedly thrown a wrench in another "Celebration Day" for Led Zeppelin fans -- though his publicist said the report was "rubbish." According to a report in the UK Daily Mirror, the Zeppelin lead singer turned down a Â£500 million ($800 million) contract for a Led Zeppelin reunion. Jason Bonham, son of the band's late drummer John Bonham, would have taken a fee.
