-- If you take Jeff Bezos' word for it, Amazon's new Kindle Fire HD is "the best tablet at any price." This year, Amazon has a new Kindle Fire called the Kindle Fire HD that's a noticeable improvement over the original. When you're using the tablet, you're constantly inundated with suggestions to check out more Amazon products. These ads and suggested items are a clever way for Amazon to continue to drive value out of you months and months after you buy the Kindle Fire HD. Like Amazon.com, the Kindle Fire HD is built to find ways to sell you more stuff.
