Kaitlyn Hunt, the 19-year-old who faces charges of lewd and lascivious battery in Florida after police learned of an alleged sexual relationship she had with a 14-year-old girl, has accepted a plea deal, prosecutor Brian Workman said Wednesday night. "I believe this is a fair and balanced offer that protects the victim while giving Ms. Hunt the ability to avoid the most severe consequences of her crimes by demonstrating that no further punishment is necessary," Workman said Wednesday afternoon. Sheriff to young woman's supporters: Teen sex case is about age, not gay rights Hunt's attorneys said Wednesday night they would not comment on the case. Under the plea deal, Hunt will plead no contest to five charges, including two counts of misdemeanor battery, misdemeanor contributing to the dependency of a child and two counts of felony interference with child custody, according to a copy of the plea deal provided to CNN by Workman, who is an assistant state attorney.
