We're inside the original 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone, an area completely evacuated after the tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems for three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing them to melt down and emit radioactive material. This is a reminder that the problem of what to do with radioactive water at the crippled Fukushima plant is not the only storage issue this country has to deal with. The cheery jingle on the radio reminds you of a different time in this part of eastern Japan, a different world that existed before March 11, 2011. The government does not want to run the risk of accumulative radiation exposure if people stay for a full 24 hours. On any given day up to 8,000 people are working on the clean-up around Fukushima Prefecture.
