And a familiar pattern in public opinion on Obama again asserts itself: Americans don't like his track record on major issues while they continue to like him personally. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 9-11, with 1,038 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The number of Democrats who wanted the party to renominate Obama dropped to an all-time low of 70% in early August, but it rose to 72% in the previous poll and 76% in the current survey. That's one point higher than the 54% disapproval rating he routinely hit in polls taken in July and August. Opinion on Obama's economic track record is mixed, however.
