"We use martial arts as a platform for meditation, for relaxation, to allow children to gain these tools and to really face down so much of the fear and the anger and the junk that accompanies pain," Goldberg said. The ceremonies are sometimes held in big auditoriums filled with hundreds of people, or they may take place in small ICU rooms with immediate family crowded together. The program encourages children to teach what they have learned to other youths and adults experiencing sickness, pain or stress. Through Goldberg's program, Haley learned to control her fear and pain. For Goldberg, instilling that sense of purpose is especially important for children at the end of their lives.
