This week I released a report with Democratic Sens. Carl Levin and Tom Carper and Republican Sen. John McCain. Why would we impose billions of dollars of additional debt on future generations when we could instead find billions in additional savings? In it he proposed $435 billion in savings over the next decade that many Republicans would accept. Specifically, the president proposed using a more accurate way to adjust for inflation with Social Security benefits and other federal payments. My friend Erskine Bowles, who served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, put it best when he said we face the "most predictable economic crisis in history.
