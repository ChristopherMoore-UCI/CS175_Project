The official title of the project is "Ash vs. Evil Dead," and Starz is planning for 10 half-hour episodes. "'Evil Dead' has always been a blast," Raimi said in a statement. -- Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead" has risen once again. Starz's series is going to revive Campbell's Ash Williams, "the stock boy, aging lothario and chainsaw-handed monster hunter who has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead," the synopsis says. The best news is that Campbell's back as Ash, and Raimi's on board as a writer and director.
