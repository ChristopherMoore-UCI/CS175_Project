"It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again," said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. " Mark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event. Restarting the Large Hadron Collider -- the $10 billion research tool's full name -- has been "a herculean effort," CERN's director for accelerators, Steve Myers, said in a statement announcing the success. It reached its operating temperature -- 271 degrees below zero Celsius -- on October 8 and particles were injected on October 23. The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz.
