And we understand, whether we're mothers or not, how Mother's Day weekend can be a double-edged sword. More than two dozen groups of women throughout the country, from Orange County, California, to Chicago to New Orleans plan luncheons on the day before Mother's Day (or soon after) to honor mothers no longer living. Here are some ideas from two decades of interviews with motherless women and 33 years of spending Mother's Day without my own: Attend a local Motherless Daughters Day luncheon. Many of them have found mother substitutes in grandmothers, aunts, sisters or good friends. Motherless women -- as well as daughters who have estranged or difficult relationships with their mothers -- really have no culturally sanctioned way to recognize their mothers on Mother's Day.
