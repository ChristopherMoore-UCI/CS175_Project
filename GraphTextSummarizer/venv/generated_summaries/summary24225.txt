I've seen trees down, flash floods across the roads, so it's a really very hazardous environment at the moment," storm chaser James Reynolds told CNN Wednesday morning, approximately 7 a.m. local time (7 p.m. ET). Typhoon Matmo comes on the tail of Super Typhoon Rammasun, which hit the Philippines last week and went on to cause havoc in southern China. It's projected to hit coastal provinces in eastern China, including Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Winds traveling at up to 64 knots (33 meters per second) swept over the territory, downing trees, cutting electricity and sending water gushing over roads. The China Meteorological Administration said Rammasun was the strongest storm to strike southern China since 1973.
