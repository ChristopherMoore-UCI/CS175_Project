The intermediate levels were made up of more union leaders and higher customs authority officials, all the way up to the queen, which the union officials charged may be high-ranking members of the ruling political party who appoint customs and border police chiefs. -- After a nearly six-month investigation, authorities launched 70 raids at border crossings and other sites in western Romania Tuesday and detained as many as 100 border police, customs officials and suspected smugglers, police and prosecutors said. Prosecutors said those involved in the smuggling operations easily could make at least 5,000 euros ($6,835.50 U.S.) per illegal shipment, and there have been hundreds of shipments. They described the border police and customs employees working at the crossings as the pawns, and said shift bosses, customs managers and some union leaders who collected the bribes were the knights. Last week, 59 border police and customs employees at the Siret crossing in eastern Romania were arrested on the same charges.
