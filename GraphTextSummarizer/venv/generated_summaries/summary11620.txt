Crime scene police Officer John Tuggart testified the alleged victims had 21.5 square feet per person of living space while in the sub-basement. Weston served prison time in the 1980s for killing her sister's boyfriend by locking him in a closet and refusing to feed him. Sanabria testified at the preliminary hearing for Weston, 51, Gregory Thomas, 47, Eddie Wright, 49, and Jean McIntosh, 32. He said he traveled to Philadelphia with Weston from West Palm Beach, Florida. Court documents show Bernardo Ramos, 25, was fed only four times while locked in the closet over the two-month period.
