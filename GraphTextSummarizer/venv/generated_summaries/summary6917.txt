UK police said 15-year-old Shamima Begum and two other London girls took a flight to Istanbul from London Gatwick Airport on Tuesday. Their families have reported them missing, and London's Metropolitan Police say the girls are believed to be heading to Syria, where militant groups and government forces are locked in a war, and parts of which have been taken over by the Islamist terror group ISIS. " UK police are concerned about the number of girls and young women trying to head to areas of Syria controlled by ISIS, Walton said. On Friday, police released pictures of the three girls walking together through Gatwick Airport, carrying travel bags. The family of a girl who UK police say may be headed to Syria with two friends have a message for her: We're not mad at you, and please come home.
