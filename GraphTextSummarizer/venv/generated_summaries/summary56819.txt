-- United Nations inspectors are heading to Iran Sunday to visit a uranium mine in Yazd and a uranium-thickening plant in Ardakan, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported. Behrouz Kamalvandi, Iran's atomic department spokesman, says his country has already taken six of those steps, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported Sunday. Iran has said it just wants to create nuclear power plants for civilian energy. Many countries and international entities have expressed concern about Iran using its nuclear program to built atomic weaponry. The inspection comes as a May 15 deadline looms for Iran to meet international requirements regarding its nuclear program.
