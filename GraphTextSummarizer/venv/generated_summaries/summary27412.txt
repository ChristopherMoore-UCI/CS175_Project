In spite of signals from the Vatican discouraging even discussions of obligatory celibacy for Catholic priests, the almost 1,000-year-old rule is under the microscope. The Rev. Donald Cozzens says the debate over celibacy for priests will be around for decades. Public opinion surveys indicate that most Catholics, priests included, believe the discipline of celibacy needs a serious review. The church's official response is consistent and succinct: As a precious gift from God, the discipline of celibacy for priests will remain in place. Closing and merging parishes may offer some temporary relief for overworked priests, but the shortfall of priests will continue to challenge the vitality of Catholic parishes and the health of Catholic clergy for decades to come.
