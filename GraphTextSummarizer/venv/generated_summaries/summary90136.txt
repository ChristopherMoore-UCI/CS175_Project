That's what's appropriate." To those, like House, who say Manning should not be held in maximum security conditions, Morrell said it's not just for his own protection. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters during a news conference last week that reports "that he is being mistreated, or somehow treated differently than others, in isolation, are just not accurate." Manning is held in his cell 23 hours a day. House said he does not discuss the WikiLeaks scandal with Manning because their conversations are monitored by Marines. House said Manning is physically deteriorating. And he views the power of social media as a force that has the power to unite people and can allow them to rapidly organize and outsmart tyrannical regimes," House said.
