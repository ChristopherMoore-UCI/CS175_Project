If scientists can figure out how antimatter interacts with gravity, it would take them a step closer to understanding how the universe was formed during the Big Bang, when a lot of antimatter was still around, Hangst says. Antimatter science vs. fiction Antimatter may be the stuff of science fiction movies and novels, but it is hardly futuristic, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, where Hangst's group runs its experiments. Antimatter abounded But scientists have long theorized that a lot of antimatter was produced during the universe's inception. Physicists with ALPHA Collaboration research group are trying to figure out how antimatter interacts with gravity, and if it produces "antigravity," says the group's founder, Jeffrey Hangst. Many scientists believe that antimatter acts in the same or in a similar manner as matter when it comes to gravity.
