Schmitt later amended that statement to say he wasn't referring to Constand, who resolved her differences "to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago." Castor released a statement on his office's website in 2005, saying that he found that "insufficient credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt." In January 2004, Andrea Constand, then a 31-year-old staffer for the women's basketball team at Temple University, Cosby's alma mater, was at the comedian's Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy, she alleged the following year. Cosby's attorney in the case, Walter M. Phillips Jr., called the allegations "utterly preposterous" and "plainly bizarre" at the time, yet in a civil filing, Constand's lawyers said they had found 13 "Jane Does" with similar stories. He couldn't check her blood, urine, hair or fingernails for traces of drugs, he couldn't obtain hair or fiber for analysis, and he couldn't obtain a warrant to search Cosby's home for evidence.
