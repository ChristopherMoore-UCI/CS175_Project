John Blanchette said cancerous lesions started appearing on one of Gabor's legs, which were examined Sunday, and gangrene was imminent. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, is with her in the hospital, Blanchette said. Gabor has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt has said. -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor is hospitalized again and will have part of a leg amputated, according to her representative.
