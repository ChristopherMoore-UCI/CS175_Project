Omar Meza went missing after a company dinner last Thursday at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa in Palm Desert, California. On the Facebook page dedicated to "Find Omar Meza," the family asked for privacy, saying, "we are with heavy hearts tonight as we announce the passing of Omar Meza. I was the last conversation per his telephone records ... on Thursday night around 11:20 p.m.," said his wife, Diane. She said her husband suffered short-term memory loss from a traffic accident last year. The family also thanked those who supported them, writing, "it brings tears to our eyes to see how well loved Omar was, he will be missed by many."
