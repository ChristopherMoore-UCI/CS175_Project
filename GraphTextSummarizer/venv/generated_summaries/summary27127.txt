Europe's immigration nightmare just beginning While detections of illegal border crossings dropped in the western Mediterranean area between northern Africa and Spain, attempted migrant incursions through the central Mediterranean region -- including Italy -- are up in 2012, according to the report. But although the tragedy at Lampedusa shocked the world, it has done little to dissuade migrants who continue to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from northern Africa to European shores. According to Frontex's "Annual Risk Analysis 2013" report, 51% of migrants entering illegally via land and sea took an eastern Mediterranean route, with many crossing into Greece before continuing on to the western Balkans by land or through ferry links to Italy. The deaths of hundreds of migrants in early October has prompted EU leaders to review the bloc's immigration policies. " The EU also said it is setting up a new border surveillance system and Mediterranean task force to bolster its efforts and will review its asylum immigration policies next summer.
