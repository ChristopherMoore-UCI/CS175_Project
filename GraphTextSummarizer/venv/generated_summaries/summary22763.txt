The attack on a soldier hacked to death on a London street has echoes of other plots on British soil in recent years. This is not the only recent example of serving soldiers being the targets of terrorist attacks. In 2007 four men were imprisoned over a plot to kidnap and kill a British Muslim soldier on leave and behead him in a Birmingham garage. "It was a plot whose purpose was to undermine democratic government, to demoralize the British army and to destabilize recruitment, and to cause anguish to the then prime minister of the day and the loyal citizens of the country," the judge said. High Court judge Mr Justice Henriques said Khan's aim was to deter any Muslim from joining the British army.
