-- The federal government may require automakers to road test cars to ensure the accuracy of gas mileage claims, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Tuesday. Currently, the EPA road tests 10 to 15 percent of new vehicles every year, but the other 85% are tested by the car companies themselves, typically through use of computer modeling, wind tunnels and treadmill-like tests. The answer, the EPA says, is to require car makers to conduct road tests. Mileage claims were lowered by 1 or 2 miles per gallon on most cars, but the Kia Soul was adjusted by 6 miles per gallon. The Obama administration has pushed through significant changes in auto mileage requirements for passenger cars and light trucks, including SUVs, pickups and minivans, as a way to reduce U.S. oil consumption.
