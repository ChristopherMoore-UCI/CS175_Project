Unlike your average haunted house, found hidden in some dark alley or unlit street, this one sits on one of Beijing's busiest thoroughfares -- Chaoyangmen Inner Street. Ghosts or no ghosts, for young adventurers the place is still a spooky destination -- especially around Halloween. -- In recent years Halloween has become a big deal in Beijing, with locals and foreigners hitting up dozens of themed parties around the city in their wackiest costumes. Beijing taxi drivers have no trouble finding it when you tell them you're looking for the haunted house on Chaoyangmen. Other ghoulish options in the Chinese capital include a haunted walking tour or the Beijing ghosts tour.
