-- that those who gain legal status will include, in the words of the union representing immigration agents, child molesters, drunken drivers and gang members; -- that more immigrants will come illegally in the months to come, because of the promise of legalization; -- that more immigrants will come legally in the years to come, sponsored by newly legalized family members; -- that those who get legal status won't learn English or assimilate but instead create a country within a country; -- that the newly legalized will go on welfare, usurp public benefits and bankrupt the system; -- that this is a fool's errand for the GOP because the immigrants won't vote for Republicans anyway; -- that the newly legalized might, upon becoming citizens, actually punish Republicans for years of mistreatment; -- that the country is changing demographically to the point where whites will soon be in the minority, and a legalization program would only speed up the process; -- that immigrants will worsen population growth, overcrowd our schools, and lower Americans' standard of living; -- and, finally, that this will create, as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas claims, a "de facto affirmative action" by providing an incentive to employers to hire them over U.S. citizens because they're not covered by Obamacare mandates. The goal is to convince us that, if Congress passes immigration reform and grants legal status to millions of illegal immigrants, Americans should be afraid of 10 things. We've gone from Ronald Reagan declaring, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall" in Berlin to Republican Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota demanding another 700 miles of border fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. In the mid-18th century, Benjamin Franklin tried to scare his fellow Americans into thinking that German immigrants would soon "be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of us Anglifying them." Reagan, who said during the 1980 campaign that he supported giving legal status to illegal immigrants and who in 1986 signed an amnesty bill that legalized more than 3 million people -- would be ashamed of what has become of his party.
