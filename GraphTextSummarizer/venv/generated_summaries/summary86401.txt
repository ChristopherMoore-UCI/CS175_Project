Parents are usually the first to show off pictures of their kids, but that role has been reversed in a new breed of style blogs in which children submit nostalgic and stylish photos of their parents from back in the day. "Similar to the way that young people look to celebrities as style icons, more people are looking to these attainable vintage fashions from their parents and there is a growing population of people who prefer these classic looks," said Margot Nason, editor of the trend forecasting newsletter Trend Central. Since the Web site has been live for a little more than a month, Weiss has received several hundred submissions of parent pictures from folks who want to memorialize their mom and dad's most stylish years on the Internet. -- Dads in short shorts and moms in beehive hairdos are becoming all the rage on the Internet. Rather than laughing or cringing at old photos of their folks, today's children want everyone to see their parents in their heyday.
