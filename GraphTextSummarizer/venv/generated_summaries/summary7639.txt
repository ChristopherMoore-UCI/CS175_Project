Though she had reportedly been having financial difficulties, a representative for Scott said, "The figures quoted in the media regarding the financial status of LS Fashion Limited are not only highly misleading and inaccurate but also extremely hurtful and disrespectful to the memory of L'Wren Scott." The group's tour had been put on hold since the March 17 death of Mick Jagger's girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott. Scott's death, which was ruled a suicide, stunned Jagger, who had been with the designer and former model since 2003. Scott left her $9 million estate to Jagger, according to the late fashion designer's will. The Stones' Oslo set list included "Jumpin' Jack Flash," "All Down the Line," "Let's Spend the Night Together," "Emotional Rescue" and a version of "You Can't Always Get What You Want" accompanied by the Edvard Grieg Youth Choir.
