In the view of presidential scholar Michael Beschloss, they require the courage to tell difficult truths, to make unpopular decisions, to work with people who have different beliefs. In other countries facing great problems such as high unemployment and shrinking economies, these days, "difficult choices" and uncertain outcomes are the centerpiece of political discussions. In the first debate, candidates again avoided talking about the need to make difficult choices. But that's different from reshaping your supposed ideology to win different audiences. Real charisma allows leaders to change their mind.
