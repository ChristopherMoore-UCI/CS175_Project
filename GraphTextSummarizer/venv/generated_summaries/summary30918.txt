"For the time being he is waiting to see what is happening under the buildup of the new government under Mr. Monti," said Deborah Bergamini, a member of Italy's Parliament and former assistant to Berlusconi. Franceso Rutelli, leader of the Alliance for Italy, also told reporters his block will support Monti's government. If he becomes prime minister, Monti could bring a distinctly different approach to governing than Italy has experienced over the past three years. Let's hope that the international credibility of Mr. Monti will be able to work in this direction," Bergamini told CNN. Monti was nominated Sunday to replace Silvio Berlusconi as Italy's prime minister.
