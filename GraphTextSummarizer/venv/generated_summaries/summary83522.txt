Just to be safe, NASA will move the Mars Odyssey orbiter, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and the new Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) to the other side of the planet as the comet approaches. NASA thinks the comet will miss the Red Planet, but comets spew out a trail of dust and gas, and that could damage the fleet of spacecraft orbiting Mars. "We're going to hide behind Mars," said Rob Lock, Orbiter Studies Lead in the Mars Program Office. "Mars will be right at the edge of the debris cloud, so it might encounter some of the particles -- or it might not," Rich Zurek, chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a press release. NASA says the rovers are safe and will be protected by Mars' atmosphere.
