The four-time World Cup overall champion underwent reconstructive surgery but aggravated the problem in a crash during training in November. "I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February. " Vonn counts the ski resort in the Rocky mountains of Colorado as her home and spent Thanksgiving Day training in Vail. She went on to make a successful return to racing before Christmas but last month the writing was on the wall when she had to pull out of a World Cup event in Val d'Isere, France. Vonn, the reigning Olympic and World Cup downhill skiing champ, will not compete in next month's Winter Olympics, according to a post Tuesday on her official Facebook page.
