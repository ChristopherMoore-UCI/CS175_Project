Attacks on press freedom traditionally provoke a strong response from newspaper editors around the world, and Wednesday's horrific attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo was no exception. " Charlie Hebdo had published cartoons of Mohammed "that were certainly offensive to many Muslims," it said. French daily Libération ran a black front page with the words in bold white: "Nous Sommes Tous Charlie" -- "We are all Charlie," echoing the crowds that took to the streets of Paris and other major cities to denounce the attack. In a strongly worded column, the paper's editorial director, Alexis Brézet, called for a vigorous defense to the threats to press freedom, accusing the gunmen of striking at the heart of free expression. One user tweeted, "Why show the one image they want you to print, and not the cartoons?" The Independent took a different tack, running a full-page image of a bloodied cover of Charlie Hebdo, with a hand emerging showing a raised middle finger.
