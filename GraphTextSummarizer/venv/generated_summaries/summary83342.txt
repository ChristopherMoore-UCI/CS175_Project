Buoyed by the fame he earned as a soap sculptor, Gaba moved to New York in 1932, where he went into fashion and retail and pioneered the design of mannequins that combined style with realism. Cynthia was his star, accompanying him to nightclubs and social events. She became an A-list celebrity, top fashion houses sent jewels and dresses, and she was briefly engaged to one of radio's biggest stars. He achieved it through his uncanny skill at one of the Great Depression's quirkier national crazes -- soap sculpting. Cynthia wasn't human, she was a mannequin -- a plaster, dead-eyed dummy.
