"Linsanity," out in select theaters October 4, offers a glimpse of Lin's road to stardom: He was a standout basketball player in summer leagues, competed in a tightly contested high school state championship and faced racial epithets as an Ivy League athlete before landing, undrafted, in the professional league. Lin: Through difficult moments I'd say Romans 5:3-5 and Romans 8:28 talk about just being able to deal with really tough situations in life and being able to have peace beyond circumstances. Do you ever think about life after the NBA and what that looks like? Lin: I think there are certain players who, when they become really good, they look down on other people.
