-- Additional details surfaced Thursday pointing to similarities between the bombs found in packages mailed from Yemen last week and a failed attempt to blow up a plane as it landed in Detroit, Michigan, last year. " Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano recently said the two devices found on freight planes in the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom last week have "all the hallmarks" of a plot by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based arm of the terrorist network. One of the parcel bombs was disarmed minutes before it was due to explode, French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told French TV on Thursday in Paris. And officials believe that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was responsible for both plots. The most recent security threat came to light Friday, when authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages sent from Yemen with explosives that were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois.
