Ginsburg, 81, died at his home in Weston, Florida, said Howard Rosenthal, an executive at Ginsberg's Florida-based Mr. Food Brand. Ginsburg, whose syndicated "Mr. Food" segments were shown on more than 125 television stations nationwide as of June, was known to enthusiastically sign off with his signature phrase, "Ooh, it's so good!" "What you saw on TV was how Art was off TV," Rosenthal said. -- Art Ginsburg, who as "Mr. Food" demonstrated recipes and cooking tips in 90-second segments for millions of TV viewers over more than 30 years, died Wednesday of cancer, a company official said. Ginsburg's "commitment to anyone-can-do recipes and passion for helping others made him well-loved among his peers and among television viewers and website visitors," a message on the "Mr. Food" website said. He established his own company, which by 1994 had a TV studio, a test kitchen and publishing offices in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
