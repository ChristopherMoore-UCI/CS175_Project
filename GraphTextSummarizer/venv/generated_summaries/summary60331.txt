-- Italy's prime minister held emergency meetings on Monday to discuss the growing garbage problem in Naples, where more than two weeks of closed dumps and uncollected garbage has led to mountains of trash across the city. The Camorra, as the mafia is known in Naples, controls both dumps and garbage trucks, making the problem enormously difficult for the government to solve. Italian media have cited statistics saying that Naples produces 1.6 million tons of garbage a year, and that the government has spent 1.8 billion euros ($2.7 billion) over the past 14 years to deal with the problem. Problems with Naples' garbage have been around in some form for 14 years, when Italian authorities first declared the situation an emergency. Bags of rotting, uncollected waste now line city streets and sit in alleys beneath residential apartment blocks.
