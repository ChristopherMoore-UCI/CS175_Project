After introducing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, told reporters that Republicans shouldn't vote for White House hopeful Mitt Romney because he's a Mormon and described the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a "cult." "For some candidates, pro-life is an election-year slogan to follow the prevailing political winds," Perry said in apparent hit against his opponent, Mitt Romney, whom he didn't name. -- Controversial remarks by the pastor of a Dallas church stole the spotlight from several Republican White House contenders Friday during the first day of the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of evangelicals and other social conservatives. Along with Rep. Ron Paul, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is set to address the gathering Saturday. Asked personally about Jeffress' remarks after a campaign event in Iowa Friday night, Perry told reporters that he did not think Mormonism is a cult, a view Perry spokesman Mark Miner had expressed earlier on Perry's behalf.
