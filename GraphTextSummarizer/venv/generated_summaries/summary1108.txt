Huang eyes Liverpool bid But after captain Steven Gerrard committed himself to the club, and new manager Roy Hodgson strengthened the side with the purchase of England international Joe Cole, Torres has now said he is staying at Anfield. -- Liverpool's star striker Fernando Torres has given the club a huge boost ahead of the new Premier League season by insisting he has no intention of leaving the club. " Torres also welcomed the signing of Cole, who joined on a free transfer after leaving Premier League champions Chelsea in June. Torres also says he has been impressed with Hodgson -- the man who replaced Liverpool's former manager Rafael Benitez -- and appreciated the fact the 62-year-old traveled out to meet him when he was on holiday. The Spanish forward's future has been up in the air since Liverpool slumped to a seventh placed finish last season, meaning they missed out on qualification for the European Champions League.
