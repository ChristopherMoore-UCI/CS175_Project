"I think the messaging is brilliant," said Sue Scheff, an author, parent advocate and family Internet safety advocate. Breast vs. bottle, stay-at-home vs. work outside the home, natural birth vs. drug-assisted delivery, baby carrier vs. stroller. Moms, dads, grandparents, passerbys, people who don't have children. There are the stroller moms, the moms with baby carriers, the working moms, the stay-at-home moms, the stay-at-home dads and of course the "breast is best" crowd pitted against the bottle-feeders. It is truly ridiculous when you think about it, which is exactly the point of a hilarious and moving new ad by formula maker Similac.
