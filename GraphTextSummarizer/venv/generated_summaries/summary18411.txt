She marked the shootout in Boston, and took a poke at the Florida senator who is leading immigration reform efforts, by mischievously tweeting: "It's too bad Suspect No. 1 won't be able to be legalized by Marco Rubio, now." So why would their evil acts have the effect of torpedoing the prospect of immigration reform that primarily affects millions of illegal immigrants from Latin America? Earlier this week, Rep.

It's worth noting that Americans started the long and difficult journey toward immigration reform on September 5, 2001, when President George W. Bush welcomed Mexican President Vicente Fox to the White House for a state dinner in his honor. -- We already knew that opponents of immigration reform had no good arguments in favor of preserving the status quo.
