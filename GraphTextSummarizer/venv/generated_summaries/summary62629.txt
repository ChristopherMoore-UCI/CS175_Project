This might make for good politics and help distract from the numerous scandals and poor economic outlook reported on the nightly news, but it is a terrible way to treat fellow Americans, especially when the economy continues to struggle and job creation remains weak. Rather than responding to these harsh realities with the politics of division and distraction and pitting Americans against each other for political gain, Washington should work toward real, commonsense solutions that help create jobs for hardworking families. We need a shift in focus from empty promises, handouts and shallow accusations to education, job training and encouragement toward hard work and entrepreneurship. All Americans, regardless of who they are or where they come from, want a good-paying job with more opportunity, choice and control over their economic and personal futures. Most American success stories, and the jobs that result, involve hardworking individuals and families who take significant personal and financial risk, work from sunrise to sunset and persevere through good times and bad.
