Welcome to John and June Sturgeon's indoor train garden, a collection of model trains the couple have been sharing with friends and neighbors every holiday season for nearly 15 years. "Santa Claus is here every night, every night until Christmas, and most of [the children] bring me their wish list," John says behind the white beard and red suit. Once the collection outgrew their house, the Sturgeons built a detached building the size of a two-car garage specifically to hold the display year round. "And then ... when it closes [they're] looking forward to it next year." Last year, more than 1,200 people followed the lit path to the backyard garage, including regulars like Jason Gauchier and his two children, who come at least once a week when the display is open.
