When fully loaded, the Dreamlifter needs a runway 9,199 feet long to take off, reports affiliate KWCH. But a spokeswoman for the airport authority, Valerie Wise, cited favorable weather Thursday and the fact that much of the fuel had been used in the flight from JFK -- which lightened the weight of the plane -- for the conclusion that it was safe to take off on the shorter runway. A mammoth cargo plane that landed Wednesday night at the wrong airport in Wichita, Kansas -- one that typically does not accommodate such beasts -- took off without incident Thursday afternoon on a runway half a mile shorter than it usually uses. "Onlookers and gawkers have caused accidents," said Roger Xanders, chief of airport police and fire. The takeoff came less than a day after the plane, which was bound for McConnell from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, missed its mark.
