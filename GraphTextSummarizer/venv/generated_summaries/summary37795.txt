Firefighters are focusing on saving homes in Eagar and nearby Springerville. That's the main reason," said Eagar resident Bob Meador. Residents of Eagar and Springerville received the order late Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Their 18-year-old dog, Tigger, got a seat in the cab of the truck, but the family cat remained at home. Bob Meador and his son, Rodney, loaded what they could into a pair of pickup trucks.
