The East Down Yacht Club, based at Strangford Lough, is hosting the world championships for the GP14 class of sailing dinghy, with Monday the first day of racing. A rescue operation was launched Monday after news that 87 boats were in difficulty, at Strangford Lough inlet, in County Down. Two helicopters -- an RAF aircraft from Wales and an Irish coast guard helicopter -- were called to help, alongside vessels from the coast guard and Royal National Lifeboat Institution, or RNLI. Bernard Roddy, a volunteer for RNLI at the scene, told CNN that the weather had been good, but a random squall had hit, causing a large wave that overturned a number of dinghies. Twenty people ended up in the water, 10 of whom needed medical attention, with most showing signs of hypothermia, Liam Colquhoun of the Belfast Coastguard said.
