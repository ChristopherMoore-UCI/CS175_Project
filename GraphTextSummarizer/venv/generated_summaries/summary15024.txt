Sheen voluntarily entered an undisclosed rehabilitation center for treatment Friday, Sheen representative Stan Rosenfield said. Sheen, the son of actor Martin Sheen, spent at least a month last year at a Malibu, California, rehab center, but it was never disclosed what he was treated for there. The announcement came a day after Sheen was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where Rosenfield said he was treated for severe pain related to a hernia. "It is a shame that during this time, while Mr. Sheen has sought treatment on his own, opportunistic women are trying to take advantage of his celebrity status," Galanter said. The actress described what she said was a nonstop party at Sheen's Los Angeles home, including a large amount of cocaine use by Sheen.
