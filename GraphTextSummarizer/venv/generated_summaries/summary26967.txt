Indiana Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock believes that rapes resulting in pregnancy are "something that God intends to happen." The case against electing a right-wing ideologue like Richard Mourdock to the Senate goes deeper than social issues. " Mourdock and Akin were both trying to explain their determination to outlaw abortion even in cases of rape and incest, a position consistent with the Republican Party platform, which calls for a constitutional ban on abortion. But many conservative candidates for Senate harbor deep-seated social conservative views, an absolute opposition to abortion among them. What Mr. Mourdock said is shocking, and it is stunning that he would be so disrespectful to survivors of rape."
