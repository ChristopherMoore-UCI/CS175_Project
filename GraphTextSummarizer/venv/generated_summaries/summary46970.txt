In a groundbreaking report released in 2011 by the Global Commission on Drug Policy, three former Latin American presidents -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, CÃ©sar Gaviria of Colombia, and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico -- and a host of other notable global figures, such as Kofi Annan, Richard Branson and Paul Volcker, called for "breaking the taboo" on discussing alternatives to drug prohibition and encouraging "experimentation by governments with models of legal regulation of drugs. As the region that has most suffered the brunt of the war on drugs, it is no surprise that the loudest political voices calling for reform are coming from Latin America. It is no doubt that as the war on drugs grinds on in Latin America, women and children will continue to seek refuge from the violence. Although the arrest of a drug lord or corrupt government officials may catch our attention, we fail to sufficiently consider those throughout Latin America who have fallen victim to violence related to the drug war. What has been glaringly absent from discussion of this humanitarian crisis is any attempt to address its underlying causes, which rest fundamentally in drug policy reform.
