The former Kentucky postal worker was sentenced to six months in federal prison for "destroying, hiding and delaying the delivery of at least 44,900 pieces of mail," according to David J. Hale, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Kentucky. Morse, a mail carrier for five years, stored the nearly 45,000 pieces of undelivered mail at his deceased mother's home and, just like Newman, at rented storage facilities near his home and mail route in western Kentucky. Morse, 34, was not charged with stealing the contents of the undelivered mail, according to Hale, but he was ordered to pay nearly $15,000 in restitution for losses incurred by two businesses that mail commercial circulars. " Valdes said the owner of one of the storage centers noticed a large amount of mail and USPS equipment when Morse failed to properly shut his unit's door, so he called authorities. -- Newman, Jerry Seinfeld's diabolical nemesis and United States postal worker, was denied his dream transfer to Hawaii when the Post Office discovered he hadn't been delivering a lot of the mail he was supposed to be.
