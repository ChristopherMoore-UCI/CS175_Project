" Double Masters champion Bubba Watson, his fellow American Chris Kirk and Englishman Paul Casey are in a three-way tie for second, one shot ahead of 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley. "Last week I just didn't do that and that's down to nothing more than hitting good golf shots and hitting good putts and limiting my mistakes whenever I get in trouble on the golf course. There's just been runs of holes in tournaments where I haven't played so well and I've shot it four or five over in the space of nine holes, and that's really just derailed my tournament. "This has been coming," McIlroy, who will be attempting to win the U.S. Open for the second time in his career when it begins at Pinehurst on June 12, told the PGA Tour's official website. The Northern Irishman broke off his engagement to Wozniacki on May 22 -- ending a three-year relationship -- before going on to win the European Tour's flagship event -- the BMW PGA Championship -- on Sunday thanks to an imperious final-round 66 at Wentworth.
