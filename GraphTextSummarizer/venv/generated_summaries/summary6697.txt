People on both sides of the same-sex marriage issue are accustomed to a political process coarsened by ideological rhetoric and political posturing. If they can view the Prop 8 trial via YouTube, they will be surprised by what they see: a decision-making process devoid of politics, in which a thoughtful and unbiased judge asks hard questions of both sides' lawyers in search of legal rules reflecting neutral principles, not political fiat. -- It's hard to imagine a video of lawyers debating points of constitutional law going viral on YouTube, but the audience for the Proposition 8 trial -- a lawsuit seeking to overturn California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage -- is potentially vast. Much as I disagree with their position on same-sex marriage, harassment infringes their First Amendment right to participate in the political process. Public access should be encouraged, not thwarted, in court cases involving divisive issues -- all the more so when judicial power is invoked in an effort to invalidate the outcome of a vote.
