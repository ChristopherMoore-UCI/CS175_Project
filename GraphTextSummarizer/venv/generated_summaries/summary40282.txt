Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts has galvanized enough rank-and-file Republican voters to close the gap with independent challenger Greg Orman in one of the nation's hottest races, a new CNN/ORC poll has found. Roberts enjoys an 84% to 15% lead among likely Republican voters, while Orman is backed by nearly all Democrats and 62% of independents, compared to 33% of independents who support Roberts. Based on what Orman told reporters Wednesday after his debate with Roberts, voters won't know until after Election Day the answer to a critical question: which party he will caucus with if he wins. Roberts hit that point hard during a debate with Orman on Wednesday, repeatedly slamming Orman as a "liberal Democrat" who would continue the policies of President Barack Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. Orman's chances drastically improved -- and the race was catapulted into the national spotlight -- when Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped off the ballot in September, allowing Orman to appeal to a broad swath of anti-Roberts voters on the right and left without competition.
