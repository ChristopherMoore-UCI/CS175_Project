-- Luke Donald demands perfection of himself and his caddy on the golf course, so when CNN presenter Shane O'Donoghue was given the chance to carry the world No. 1's bag for a few holes, he knew the learning curve would be steep. Fortunately, McClaren had taken back the bag a few days later when Donald beat Westwood in a playoff to win the PGA Championship and become world number one for the first time. Donald's regular caddy John McClaren was on hand to give some useful tips, but it appeared wasted on the Living Golf host. Donald reached the top of the rankings earlier this year by winning the PGA Championship at Wentworth -- despite the best efforts of O'Donoghue to derail his effort in a practice round for the European Tour's prestige event. "It was affecting our relationship," Donald told O'Donoghue.
