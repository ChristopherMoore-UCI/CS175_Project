Caf√©s, dessert bars, and chocolate shops: Valentine's Day is often associated with sweet things, so stock up on chocolate the week before -- you don't want to stop anywhere that specializes in chocolate fondue. It can be torture to watch couples exchange stuffed bears, chocolates and kisses. So keep your heart on the mend by avoiding these seven spots couples flock to on Valentine's Day. If you must see a flick, go to something unsentimental, like an action film that involves fighting and guns. A nice dinner is a very typical V-Day date, especially since restaurants capitalize on the day with specials involving free bubbly and a red rose on the table.
