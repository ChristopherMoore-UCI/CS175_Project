Others here are mourning the death of the Great Leader's son, the man they call the "Dear Leader," Kim Jong Il. "President Kim Il Sung is our father," one lady says. The drab concrete skyline is brightened only by the splashes of color of the countless thousands of portraits, paintings and statues of the leaders. And now the power is passed to a new generation: The youthful Kim Jong Un is now the "Supreme Leader." Human rights groups and defectors claim that people can be sent to brutal gulags for not showing enough deference or the crime of having dust on one of the leader's portraits.
