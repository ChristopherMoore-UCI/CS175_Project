-- A bodyguard for the mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was shot and killed in an exchange with Mexican federal police, a federal police spokesman said late Tuesday. The shooting happened near the international bridge between Juarez and El Paso, Texas, according to spokesman Ramon Salinas. They were headed to a checkpoint when an incident occurred between federal police and the bodyguards for Murguia. Juarez Mayor Hector "Teto" Murguia and his convoy were coming from a meeting with a contingent of local priests, according to Salinas and a statement from the mayor's office. Murguia denounced the shooting and said the bodyguard -- 29-year-old Jorge Humberto Munoz Perez -- was shot after he identified himself as a bodyguard for the mayor.
