Suleman revealed in April that she was so determined to build a future for her 14 young children that she would accept adult entertainment offers, although she would not touch another "human's flesh." "I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told HLN's "Showbiz Tonight" correspondent Nischelle Turner. -- A month after Nadya Suleman took her clothes off for an adult video, the octuplets mom has accepted a job dancing topless at a Florida strip club, her representative said Monday. The adult video Suleman recorded last month is set for release in June, Rodriguez said. Suleman, who collects food stamps to feed her 14 young children, filed for bankruptcy last month, but the case was tossed out of court because of paperwork issues. Suleman, 36, will perform two shows a night for four days at T's Lounge in West Palm Beach, starting July 11, Rodriguez said.
