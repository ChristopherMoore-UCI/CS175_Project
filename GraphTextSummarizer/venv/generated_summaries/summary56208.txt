The Michael Jackson song "This Is It," released Monday, was co-written and recorded in 1983 with singer-songwriter Paul Anka, Anka and the Jackson estate confirmed Monday afternoon. Jackson's estate and Sony Music Entertainment did not realize this history when they picked the song out of boxes of tapes in their archives, leading to a big surprise Monday when Anka called them, Anka said. The original version, with just Jackson and Anka, will be included in the two-disc soundtrack, along with the orchestral version, Sony said. The just-released song got widespread airplay on radio shows across the United States Monday, according to Nielsen BDS, a company that tracks music airplay. Anka said it was "an honest mistake" that the estate's special administrators quickly resolved Monday.
