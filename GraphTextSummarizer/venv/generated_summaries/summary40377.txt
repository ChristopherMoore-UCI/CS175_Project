"While doing my training, I found it incredibly hard to tow a body in the water and started looking at rescue equipment. Called ASAP, Kemp's creation is part ski, part surfboard and part catamaran. Thanks to British designer Ross Kemp, the world has been graced with a solar-powered watercraft that costs just a third of the price of your average powered water craft.
