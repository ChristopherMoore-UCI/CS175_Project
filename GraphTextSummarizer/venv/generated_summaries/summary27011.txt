In a pair of unrelated incidents, three suspects were apprehended at New York-area airports within days of each other for attempting to smuggle $1.4 million worth of cocaine and heroin through customs, federal officials said Friday. In the first incident, on October 30, a woman was found with 30 pounds of cocaine hidden in wooden hangers and clothing, according to a news release from Customs and Border Protection's New York field office. Jeffrey C. Piettell, Ortiz's defense attorney, said he thought his client might be able to get leniency in court if he is convicted. Two days later, on November 1, two men were taken into custody at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after heroin was found in their checked luggage, the agency said. John Saleh, spokesman for the New York field office, told CNN that the agency held off announcing the arrests until it determined that the cases would not be harmed by making them public.
