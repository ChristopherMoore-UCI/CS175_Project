It's not exactly Avengers money, but it's more than enough for Fox to want to keep Jackman in the X-Men fold. Since opening on July 26, The Wolverine, Jackman's fifth outing as the ornery X-Man, has grossed $307 million worldwide. In fact, compared to the reports of what Warner Bros. is going to throw at Bale to return as Batman, $25 million per for more Jackman almost seems like a discount. In fact, I'd argue that Jackman as Wolverine for four more X-Men movies is worth every penny to Fox. As The Wolverine's post-credit sequence teased, Jackman will time-travel for a cameo in next year's X-Men: Days of Future Past.
