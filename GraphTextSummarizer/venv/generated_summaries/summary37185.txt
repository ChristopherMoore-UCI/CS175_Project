I made another POV video immediately afterward that tracks my journey from Hawaii to New York City, which garnered quite a few strange looks, as there are a few more people in New York than the countryside of Iceland. With his skills, it was a natural transition to audition for the Blue Man Group, which promptly cast him and sent him to perform in Blue Man theaters in New York, Chicago and Orlando, and as part of a national tour. Now in Los Angeles to pursue acting and writing (in between Blue Man fill-in work), Smith is still basking in the midnight sun of Nordic stardom. The 28-year-old from Lake Tahoe, California, has been juggling for 16 years, performing at Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers basketball games, in Las Vegas and abroad. I always carry some beanbags around with me, but I juggle mostly just to relieve stress and have fun rather than perform.
