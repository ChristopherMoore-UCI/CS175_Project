I am Jason Moran, son of Mary and Andrew Moran, brother of Yuri and Tai Moran, husband of Alicia Hall Moran, father of Jonas and Malcolm Moran. For the future, Moran looks to a new crop of musicians, teaching the next group of performers. Moran shares where he has been and why "knowing when to 'shut up' is extremely important." From the past, Moran has built on the tradition of Thelonious Monk and other jazz greats. Having older musicians tell me early on, sometimes very bluntly, what they liked or didn't like in my playing also helped.
