While Burkina Faso eventually prevailed 3-2 on penalties following a 1-1 draw, all the talk after the game centered on Jdidi's failure to award a legitimate penalty, his decision to disallow a valid goal and the red card he issued to Pitroipa. -- Tunisian referee Slim Jdidi, the man whose performance came close to overshadowing Burkina Faso's astonishing fairytale passage into the final of the Africa Cup of Nations, was suspended by the Confederation of African Football on Thursday. Jdidi's officiating during the Burkinabe's semifinal victory over Ghana has been heavily criticized after he made a number of questionable decisions. The Burkinabe are also hopeful that Pitroipa will have his suspension overturned, although that depends on whether Jdidi admits to the error in his match report. "We would have expected a better standard," Confederation of African Football (CAF) secretary-general Hicham El Amrani told a media conference.
