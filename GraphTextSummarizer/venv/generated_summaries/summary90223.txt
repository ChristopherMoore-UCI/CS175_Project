"A flight went up prior to sunset and observed a very light oil sheen approximately three miles long by 100 yards wide," said Coast Guard spokesman Darin McCracken. Eleven people were rescued on Thursday after their towing vessel -- carrying 75,000 gallons of diesel fuel -- sank off the coast of Oahu, according to Honolulu Coast Guard. "Approximately two and half miles west of Barbers Point Harbor," the officer said, "vessel appears to have started to sink. " The mayday call came after the pilot of the towing vessel Nalani called the Coast Guard at 3:13 p.m. The cause of the sinking remains under investigation and it is probable the vessel will not be recovered, said McCracken.
