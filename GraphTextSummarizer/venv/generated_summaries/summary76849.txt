-- Some 20 years after his beating at the hands of Los Angeles police, Rodney King was pulled over in Arcadia, California, this week after allegedly running a red light, his fiancee said Thursday night. Amateur video captured King's beating after Los Angeles police officers stopped him for speeding March 3, 1991. The three days of rioting that followed in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities left 55 people dead and 2,000 injured. There were 12,000 arrests and about $1 billion in property damage in Los Angeles. Kelly was a juror in King's civil trial against the city of Los Angeles in 1994, in which he was awarded $3.8 million.
