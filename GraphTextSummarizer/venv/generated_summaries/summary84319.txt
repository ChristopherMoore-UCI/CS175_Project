The "To Tommy, From Zooey" line will be sold in over 200 Macy's stores and Tommy Hilfiger outposts in North America, Europe, Mexico and Japan starting April 14th. The "New Girl" star has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to create a 16-piece clothing collection called "To Tommy, From Zooey," which is scheduled to arrive in stores this spring. "The collection is the perfect fusion of Zooey's adventurous style and the classic, cool, American spirit at the heart of the Tommy Hilfiger brand." The actress will promote the collection by appearing at events in New York, Los Angeles, and Mexico and will also appear in an ad campaign shot by photographer Carter Smith. Tommy and I share many of the same inspirations â€” old school music, classic films and old Hollywood icons â€” and his guidance during the design process helped to put a really unique twist on each piece."
