What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket. The arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality. And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe," according to Rodriguez. What we know: Baltimore police are looking into Gray's death and are expected to have a report for prosecutors by Friday.
