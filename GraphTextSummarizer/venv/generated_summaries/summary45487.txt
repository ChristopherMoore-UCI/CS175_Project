He was also banned for eight matches after racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in October 2011, and former Liverpool captain Graeme Souness said after the Chelsea match that the 26-year-old is in "last-chance saloon." Souness, one of the match analysts for UK broadcaster Sky Sports, said the club needed to take strong action after an incident which reflects badly on one of the world's most famous teams. It is not the first time Suarez has bitten an opponent -- he was suspended for seven matches in late 2010 after an incident while playing for Dutch club Ajax, two months before joining Liverpool. The incident overshadowed former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez's return to Anfield with Chelsea, but the Spaniard refused to comment on Suarez -- instead complaining about the near seven minutes of time added on that allowed the striker to head an equalizer for his 23rd EPL goal of the season. The draw dented Chelsea's chances of qualifying for next season's European Champions League, leaving Benitez's team in fourth place -- a point behind Arsenal and one ahead of Tottenham.
