And a report from the Daily Mail, also citing emails purportedly sent from Emwazi to the British publication, said the Kuwait-born Londoner saw himself as a "dead man walking" and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities. One email details Emwazi's account of his detention at a British airport, when authorities stopped him from traveling to Kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours. " Emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it, according to CAGE, the human rights and Muslim advocacy organization that worked with him. " Emwazi wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the Independent Police Complaints Commission, before going into detail about how he was apparently "assaulted by the police officer" as he attempted to leave for Kuwait. Analysts who've studied ISIS recruiting say they aren't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned Emwazi into "Jihadi John."
