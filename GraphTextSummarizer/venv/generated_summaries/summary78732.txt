The unmanned Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory-B (GRAIL-B) fired its main engines at 5:05 p.m. and slipped into lunar orbit 39 minutes later, controllers at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported. Scientists theorize that the moon formed when a Mars-sized object crashed into Earth, but it remains unknown why the near side of the moon is so different from the far side. " NASA says the twin orbiters will study the moon "in unprecedented detail" from a near pole-to-pole orbit about 34 miles (55 km) high. Maria Zuber, principal investigator for GRAIL, said the moon remains mysterious in many ways. But the GRAIL probes took more than three months and covered more than 2.5 million miles "reshaping and merging their orbits" so that they could be better positioned and coordinated to study the moon, NASA said.
