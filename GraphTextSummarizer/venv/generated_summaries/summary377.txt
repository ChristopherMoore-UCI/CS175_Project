Facebook has unveiled a new product, Facebook Home, at an event everyone knew would have something to do with phones and apps and operating systems. But at Wednesday's event, HTC unveiled the HTC First, an AT&T exclusive Android phone that will be released the same day Facebook Home goes live. As described by Zuckerberg and others, Home is a "family of apps" that essentially push Facebook content front and center on your Android phone. It will run on the Galaxy S 4 and the HTC One when those phones are released, with other phones being added in the coming months. At release, it will only be optimized for Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II and the HTC One line of phones.
