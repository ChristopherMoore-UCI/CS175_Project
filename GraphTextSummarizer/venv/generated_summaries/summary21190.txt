"Nebulous star-forming regions like M16 are the interstellar neon signs that say, 'We just made a bunch of massive stars here,'" said Paul Scowen of Arizona State University, who helped lead the original observations, in a post on NASA's website. The new image "hints" that these columns "are also pillars of destruction," NASA said. The Hubble Space Telescope revisited the so-called "Pillars of Creation," which the space agency describes as "three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16. The new sharper and wider image was taken "in near-infrared light, as well as visible light," NASA said. " The previous photo of these pillars, taken in 1995, went on to stand out from all the rest of NASA's space images, the agency said.
