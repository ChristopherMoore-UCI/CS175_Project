It keeps me up to speed with how cases are being tried today, as opposed to back when I was in court. While Clark closed the door on her career as a prosecutor, she continues to stay active with the law by working on appellate court cases. Other than that, I wanted to share the feeling of camaraderie among prosecutors and police officers, the kind of humor they share, their dialogue, the way they're always needling each other, messing with each other, that kind of sense of sharing a world together, I wanted to convey that feeling. It featured Rachel Knight, a strong-willed deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, with a deep sense of justice and a bit of a rebellious streak. Now Rachel Knight returns in "Guilt by Degrees," which hits book stores May 8.
