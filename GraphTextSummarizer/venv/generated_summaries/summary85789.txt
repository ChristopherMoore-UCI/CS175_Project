CNN Heroes -- everyday people who are changing the world for the better -- have been profiled weekly on the network since January. Joining the list of stars participating in the show were presenters Halle Berry, Demi Moore, Jessica Alba, Kid Rock, LL Cool J, Renee Zellweger, Gerard Butler, Kiefer Sutherland, Marisa Tomei, Aaron Eckhart and Holly Robinson Peete. Since 1997 he has helped build 45 footbridges over perilous rivers in Kenya, protecting people from flash floods and predatory animals. Today, his program, Mary's Meals -- run from a tin shed in the Scottish highlands -- provides free daily meals to more than 400,000 children around the world. The Chilean miners who were rescued last month after nearly 70 days underground were saluted with a standing ovation at the start of "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute."
