-- A government report obtained by CNN on Friday states that government agents and lawyers mistreated Monica Lewinsky when they approached the former White House intern in January 1998 to get her to cooperate with an investigation into President Bill Clinton. In doing so, however, the agents and lawyers denied Lewinsky attempts to speak with her lawyer, Frank Carter. At the center of the government report is what happened after FBI agents and lawyers from the Office of Independent Counsel, who at the time was investigating the affair with Clinton, approached Lewinsky at a food court and moved the conversation to a hotel room nearby. The government report - titled the "Report of the Special Counsel Concerning Allegations of Professional Misconduct By the Office of Independent Counsel in Connection with the Encounter with Monica Lewinsky" - substantiates Lewinsky's story. At the Forbes appearance, Lewinsky spoke at length about her confrontation with agents and lawyers that was detailed in the government report.
