Jeb Bush was blitzed with questions Thursday about his presidential ambitions in a private session with top South Carolina donors and business leaders, multiple sources at the meeting told CNN. I get the temptation but that can't be the only reason that people elect you is that you're not the other guy." Bush told the donors he admires the restraint of his brother, former president George W. Bush, for not criticizing Obama even as the security situation in Iraq deteriorates. Following crowded public events in Greenville and Lexington, Bush headlined a fundraiser for Haley in Columbia that included a high-dollar roundtable with about 30 of the state's top business leaders and Republican officials including Pamela Lackey, the president of AT&T South Carolina, Mikee Johnson, head of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, and former state Attorney General Henry McMaster. The former Florida governor was in the state, which happens to hold the first presidential primary in the south, for a round of campaigning with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is expected to win re-election next month. Bush has traveled the country raising money for Republican candidates this cycle, but the South Carolina visit marked his first trek to an early primary state as questions about his national ambitions build.
