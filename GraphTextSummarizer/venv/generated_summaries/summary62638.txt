Federer, the world's top-ranked player, will take part in an exhibition event in  Australia on Sunday along with other top names such as Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters, Serena Williams and Samantha Stosur. The 28-year-old, who has won more Grand Slam titles than any other male tennis player, also visited tsunami victims as part of his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Gasquet, who has dropped to 53rd in the rankings after serving a ban for testing positive for cocaine last year which was later reduced due to mitigating circumstances, was seeking his first title since September 2007. They will play in doubles matches at Melbourne Park in the state of Victoria's capital city, giving up their last day of preparation ahead of this year's opening Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open. What happened there makes us realize how lucky we are," said Isner, who defeated France's Arnaud Clement 6-3 5-7 7-6 (7-2) in the final of the Heineken Open on Saturday to claim his first ATP Tour title.
