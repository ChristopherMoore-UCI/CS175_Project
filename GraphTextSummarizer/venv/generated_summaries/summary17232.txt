" Transportation officials had said Thursday night that repairs of the bridge, which carried about 280,000 vehicles per day, would be complete by late Friday morning, but Ney said contractors were still working on custom-fitting steel for the structure. On Friday, workers were grinding the areas where there was the potential for steel-on-steel connection, Ney said. -- Repair work on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge will continue nonstop into the weekend and the bridge may reopen Monday, but officials were making no promises Friday. On Thursday, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) said, the system carried the most passengers ever, breaking a record set the day before. "Commuters are going to need to check back with us over the weekend," said Bart Ney, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation.
