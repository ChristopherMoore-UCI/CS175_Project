"Glenwood Gardens is an independent living facility which, by law, is not licensed to provide medical care to any of its residents," Fontana told CNN. Glenwood Gardens in Bakersfield, California, has a policy against its employees providing medical care. The law provides that "no person who in good faith, and not for compensation, renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission. "This incident resulted from a complete misunderstanding of our practice with regards to emergency medical care for our residents," the statement said. CNN asked spokesman Matt Fontana why a nurse would be involved if the facility's policy prohibits staffers from performing medical care.
