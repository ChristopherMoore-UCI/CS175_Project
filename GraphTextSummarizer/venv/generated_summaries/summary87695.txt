Father of shooting victim chastises politicians Five revelations from the 'twisted world' of a 'kissless virgin' CNN's Sara Sidner, Michael Martinez, Paul Vercammen, Pamela Brown, Todd Leopold, Ashley Fantz, Greg Morrison, Alan Duke and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report. By then, Rodger's mother, Lichin, had seen the e-mailed manifesto as well as disturbing video on his YouTube page in which her son talked about "slaughtering" women at a sorority house at UCSB, family friend Simon Astaire said.

Richard Martinez said that his son's death should not be in vain, imploring people and especially politicians to enact stricter gun control laws.
