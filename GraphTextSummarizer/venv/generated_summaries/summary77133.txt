Where most American business make the hard choices to pay their bills and live within their means, in Washington more spending and more debt is business as usual. It CUTS and CAPS government spending and paves the way for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which we believe is the best way to stop Washington from spending money it doesn't have. Last week, the House passed such a plan, and with bipartisan support. I want you to know I made a sincere effort to work with the president to identify a path forward that would implement the principles of Cut, Cap, & Balance in a manner that could secure bipartisan support and be signed into law. The House has passed a bill to raise the debt limit with bipartisan support.
