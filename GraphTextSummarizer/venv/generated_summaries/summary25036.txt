You wouldn't know it for all the diplomatic sound and fury that surround the country, but possibly the most exceptional thing about Iran compared with the other Middle Eastern countries I've been to -- and I've visited them all, as a roving travel correspondent and Middle East specialist -- is how almost manically welcoming everyone is. Imam Square Isfahan is the next stop on many Iran itineraries, with its Imam Square said to be the second largest such urban space in the world after Tiananmen in Beijing. In Shiraz, in south-central Iran, wine production may have dried up but some of the finest gardens, historic homes, mosques and markets in the country remain. -- One thing did shock me on my visit to Iran last month: the immigration officer at Tehran Airport smiled as he stamped my passport. Well, let's consider what you'll miss out on if you don't one day slot Iran into your travel itinerary: most travelers who do take the plunge come away raving about the place.
