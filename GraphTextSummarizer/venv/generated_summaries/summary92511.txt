-- NFL offensive lineman Richie Incognito has been on the defense since November after fellow Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin abruptly left the team citing emotional abuse by Incognito on and off the field. When friends become bullies There are two types of toxic friendships, says Glass: Those that start out toxic, and those that start to require a Hazmat suit over time. She stresses in the book that people make many friends in life but only a few stick for prolonged periods. Incognito adamantly maintains the two were friends who just had a crass rapport, though an NFL-sanctioned investigation found racial slurs used by Incognito and sexually explicit messages about Martin's mother and sister constituted a "pattern of harassment." It's more when there is a "discrepancy in personality and values" or a friend discourages success, says psychologist Irene S. Levine.
