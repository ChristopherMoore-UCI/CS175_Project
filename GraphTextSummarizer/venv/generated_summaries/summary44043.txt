The Arc is a national community-based organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. While a diagnosis of mental illness or disorder of any level of severity can seem overwhelming to a parent, there are resources available to support families on their journey through diagnosis and treatment. The nonprofit provides online support groups, a professional resource directory, and a family helpline where families can submit questions to trained parent volunteers. Here are just a few: The Balanced Mind Foundation offers support and for parents and guardians of children with mood disorders. And unfortunately many of those suffering from mental illness ultimately choose suicide as the  way out.
