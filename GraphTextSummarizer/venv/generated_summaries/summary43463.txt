His great-grandmother was in Krotz Springs for the great flood of 1927, which inundated 165 million acres, killed 246 people and left another 600,000 homeless throughout the Mississippi River system, according to a National Weather Service report. By Sunday, they had a few things they still had to do: clear out their trailer home in the Halphen Hollow subdivision of Krotz Springs, Louisiana, in order to head to higher ground ahead of the 5 p.m. mandatory evacuation deadline, and find a way to celebrate their daughter Mayah's fourth birthday. But the consequence is that as many as 4,000 people, according to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, could have their homes submerged as waters are funneled into the Atchafalaya River Basin, between that river and the Mississippi. That includes the town of Krotz Springs, about 20 miles southwest of Morganza. This, of course, is what's happening with Krotz Springs, Melville and other communities nearby.
