He never confessed, and in 2007, Texas inmate Jerry Johnson -- who didn't realize Cole had died eight years before -- wrote to Cole, confessing the rape and offering to submit to DNA testing to clear Cole's name. After realizing her mistake, she helped to get Cole's name cleared and has since developed a relationship with Cole's family. Cole was a student at Texas Tech when he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the 1985 rape of 20-year-old Michele Mallin. To those who loved him, Texas can never right the false conviction, but the Lubbock City Council wants to make sure Cole and his case are not forgotten. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, state Attorney General Greg Abbott and state Sen. Wendy Davis, as well as friends and family of Cole, were among the attendees at Wednesday's dedication.
