Gates has a book of design inspirations coming out next fall. Interior design expert Erin Gates, founder and editor of popular lifestyle blog "Elements of Style," recommends looking in your wardrobe closet for inspiration. To help feel stimulated, make inspiration boards either virtually or from fashion and decor magazine clippings, she suggests. Whether she's decorating a sailboat in San Francisco or a studio apartment in Boston, Gates looks for parallels between fashion and popular interiors. Just as fashion is ever-changing, you can keep your home in pace with trends, but be sparing about it.
