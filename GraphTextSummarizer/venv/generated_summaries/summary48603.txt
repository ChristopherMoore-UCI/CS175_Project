-- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a full mental competency screening for Omar Gonzalez, who is accused of jumping the White House fence, after a disputed initial examination found him not competent for trial. Bos told the judge: "There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Gonzalez is competent to stand trial." Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprinted into the executive mansion, setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures. David Bos, the federal public defender representing Gonzalez, objected to any examination in the first place because he says Gonzalez is fit for trial. His family has said Gonzalez, an Iraq War veteran, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia.
