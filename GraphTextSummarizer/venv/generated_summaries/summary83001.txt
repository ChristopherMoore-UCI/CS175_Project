according to the ICC The leaders and masterminds of the genocide were tried by the criminal courts and the ICC, and civilians who contributed to attacks or loss of life directly or indirectly were sent to gacacas. They administered justice and united Rwandans at the same time," Rwanda President Paul Kagame said in a statement posted on the gacacas website. -- Rwanda officially closed on Monday its village tribunals overseeing the prosecution of suspects in a 1994 genocide that left 800,000 dead, marking the end of more than a decade of local court prosecutions. Government officials gathered in Kigali over the weekend to formally mark the closure of the courts, known as the gacacas, which closed the last of its cases earlier this month. More than 1.5 million cases were heard by the gacacas, according to estimates.
