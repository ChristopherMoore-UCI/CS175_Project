Abducted son reunites with father after 13 years The mother and son will spend a few days in San Diego getting to know each other again. More recently, she searched for her son under the name "David Amaya" for years on social media, but she never knew that he was using her maiden name -- Barrick -- as part of his full name, a common practice in Latin America. Kathy Amaya, an assistant housekeeper at a hotel, has four adult children who are half-siblings to David Amaya. David Amaya Barrick, whose father took him across the border at about age 2 from Chicago, was biting his nails just before his mother, Kathy Amaya, now 60, appeared before him in the airport. Then David Amaya will return to San Diego to build a new life.
