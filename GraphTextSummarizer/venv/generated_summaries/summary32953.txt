The plunge in the price of European sovereign debt meant that MF Global had to stump up more cash or easily marketable securities to its lenders so that they would have adequate security for their loans. Last week, MF Global disclosed that it had $6.3 billion exposure to the shakiest of European sovereign debt. These days, investors in companies such as MF Global are not just rich individuals and entities; they are often pension funds and other entities that pool the funds of small investors. MF Global is small enough to fail, and while capital markets are unlikely to seize up, investors, lenders and counterparties are likely to lose a good deal of money. But with only 2.5% or so of its assets representing capital rather than borrowed money, MF Capital could not find enough of its own cash to satisfy its lenders.
