We're escorted through Camp Bucca, the United States' biggest detention facility in Iraq, by Marine Gen. Douglas Stone, who runs the camp. Stone wants Camp Bucca to be the model for three new detention facilities to be built around Iraq closer to detainees' families. He says the new policies are already paying dividends: "Detainees now tell us more about the network of al Qaeda, about the training techniques of al Qaeda, about how they fund their operations." He says 7,000 inmates have been released. Since that time, Stone has radically reshaped the camp, working to change the attitudes of the guards and detainees alike. How the new approach holds up after Stone leaves when his tour ends in the coming months will be a test of how successful he has been in changing the psychology of guards and detainees alike.
