A resurgent Williams team announced itself as Mercedes' closest rivals after Felipe Massa had taken pole position ahead of teammate Bottas. "It's a nice gap," said Rosberg, who remains determined to stem rising expectation that he will emulate his father Keke and be crowned world champion. -- Inside the Red Bull Ring -- home to the returning Austrian Grand Prix -- Mercedes toreadors Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were effectively left to slog it out by their peers in Sunday's race. He then passed the Williams of Valtteri Bottas after the first round of pit stops to start the chase to Rosberg. The two Mercedes circled each other like silver sharks in the final 20 laps around the undulating circuit but each time Hamilton bit into Rosberg's lead, the German responded.
