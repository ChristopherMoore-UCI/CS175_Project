" Obama doesn't know if the girls will be with him when he meets the new leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis, later this year. That includes the former Pope, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. And we have great conversations although mostly it's about history more than about what's going on right now," Obama told CNN in an exclusive interview airing Friday.
