Spain's Jose Manuel Lara claimed only the second European Tour title of his career with victory over Englishman David Lynn in a playoff at the end of the Austrian Open in Atzenbrugg. The pair finished three strokes clear of Sweden's Alexander Noren, England's Danny Willet, who led with Lynn after the third round before falling away with a 71, and European Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell (69). Lara had missed nine cuts in a row before his fourth-place finish at last week's KLM Dutch Open and he carried that form over into this week's event. I was hitting the ball really well last week," Lara told the official European Tour website after his win. The 33-year-old, the winner of the 2007 Hong Kong Open, carded a best-of-the-day eight-under-par 64 to finish on 271 (-17), level with joint overnight leader Lynn -- who posted a 68 for his final 18 holes.
