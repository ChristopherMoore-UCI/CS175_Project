Education reform movements are often based on the fast-food model of quality assurance: on standardization and conformity. Current systems of education are based on the manufacturing principles of linearity, conformity and standardization. In my view, reform is not enough: The real challenge is to transform education from a 19th century industrial model into a 21st century process based on different principles. What's needed is a much higher standard of provision based on the principles of personalized learning for every child and of schools customizing their cultures to meet local circumstances. Returning to TED in 2010 I wanted to focus on the need for a radical shift in education more generally.
