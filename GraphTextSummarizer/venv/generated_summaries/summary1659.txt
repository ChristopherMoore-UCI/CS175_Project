To show their support, the family held an in-absentia engagement ceremony for al-Obeidy at a mosque in Tobruk on Monday. A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy's sister's house Monday, but were blocked by security forces. As security forces dragged her away, al-Obeidy warned: "If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it." It was on Saturday that al-Obeidy, a 29-year-old law school graduate, burst into the Rixos Hotel as foreign journalists were having breakfast. The way al-Obeidy spoke out was unprecedented and she has already been hailed as a hero on social networking sites.
