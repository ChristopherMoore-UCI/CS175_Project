The latest ISIS video calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France. French authorities say a woman in the latest video released by French-speaking ISIS fighters may be Hayat Boumeddiene, who is believed to have knowledge about the deadly January 9 attack on a Paris kosher grocery, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The video, titled "Blow Up France 2," was released Tuesday and shows an ISIS fighter praising previous attackers in France and calling for new attacks. The grocery store attack followed the January 8 attack by Islamic gunmen on Charlie Hebdo, a satire magazine. "French authorities are investigating the possibility this woman could be Hayat Boumeddiene," the source said.
