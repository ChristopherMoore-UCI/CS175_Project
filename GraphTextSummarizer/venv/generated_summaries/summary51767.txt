Plaintiff's attorney apologizes about error in sex lawsuit Instead of just changing the date on the filing to January 15 -- the day John Doe #1 later decided was when it happened -- Okarocha decided to withdraw the allegation from the lawsuit. "We fully expect that my client will similarly be vindicated with respect to Doe #2, as well as with respect to any other person who makes meritless claims against John Travolta," attorney Martin Singer said. Okarocha apologized last Friday for putting the wrong date of the John Doe #1 incident in the lawsuit, saying his first client initially told him it was January 16, 2012. "I can guarantee that John Doe #2 has a truckload of witnesses to back up what he's saying," plaintiff's attorney Okorie Okarocha told CNN Tuesday. Okarocha also said he had "personality conflicts" with John Doe #1 that contributed to his decision.
