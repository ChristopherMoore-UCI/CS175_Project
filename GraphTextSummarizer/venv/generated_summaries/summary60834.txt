The loss left Sporting struggling down in 19th place on 28 points three points ahead of bottom-side Racing Santander (who travel to Villarreal on Sunday) and level on points with Real Zaragoza who host Granada, also on Sunday. -- Cristiano Ronaldo beat his own La Liga scoring record on Saturday as Real Madrid maintained a four-point advantage over rivals Barcelona with a 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon. A gaggle of furious Levante players protested to the officials in vain before Messi stepped up to put an unstoppable spot kick past goalkeeper Gustavo Munua. Five minutes later Gijon defender Roberto Canella was dismissed by the referee for a second bookable offense which paved the way for France forward Karim Benzema to add a third in the 82nd minute. Ronaldo's record-breaking goal was a vital one, putting Madrid ahead for the first time in the game after Miguel De Las Cuevas had given Gijon the lead from the penalty spot in the 30th minute.
