The 56-year-old Egyptian-American behind the inflammatory film "The Innocence of Muslims" is set to be released from a residential re-entry facility, or a halfway house, in Southern California on Thursday, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman Ed Ross. -- Nakoula Basseley Nakoula -- who a year ago was, arguably, the most hated man in the Islamic world -- will soon be a free man. The anger faded, however, particularly after Nakoula's arrest on September 27, 2012. The film got little attention when it was initially posted online, though things changed considerably when Egyptian media highlighted it in September 2012. Among other things, Nakoula was barred from using aliases -- yet court documents stated that he used at least 17 false names.
