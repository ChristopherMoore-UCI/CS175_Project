Obama has ruled out U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq and by extension Syria, leaving it Iraqi forces as well as Syrian opposition groups that are fighting both the government of President Bashar al-Assad and ISIS. He also announced more military aid and other support for Iraqi forces and Syrian opposition groups fighting ISIS extremists on the ground, as well as increased counterterrorism efforts to cut off the group's funding and the flow of foreign fighters from Europe and elsewhere joining its ranks. Difficulty getting a coalition "There is likely to be a lot of difficulty getting a coalition beyond a limited approach, especially regarding U.S. efforts to attack ISIS in Syria," said Faysal Itani, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. Meanwhile, NATO partners Britain and Germany have sent mixed signals on participating in airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, while France ruled it out but committed to military support in Iraq. "Next week, I'll be testifying before Congress and we'll have more of the reports back in as others are talking to various countries and we'll have a better sense of where we stand on that." He added: "I will tell you this: More than 40 countries had already offered assistance of one kind or another before I left Washington." Earlier this week, Sunni Gulf states needed by Obama to legitimize regional support for going after ISIS put a qualifier on military contributions, saying they would participate "as appropriate."
