"Then there are those regions that have good solar radiation and high fossil fuel prices such as Japan which is not an obvious place for this sort of system, but where we see a lot of potential," Ambrosetti said. Vascular system Ambrosetti said the cooling system drew its inspiration from nature where vascular systems operate to carry away excess heat. Developers say that it needs just a quarter of the panels to produce the same amount of power as conventional systems. Sea water vapor would pass through a polymer membrane and condense in a separate chamber, to produce as much as 2500 liters of fresh water per day. "It's biggest potential is in making integrated systems where you can provide several things at once such as heating, cooling and electricity," he said.
