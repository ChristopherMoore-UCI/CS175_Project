This is therefore the first spill where large plumes of oil have been observed spreading below the sea surface. Decades of research on natural plumes, such as those rising from deep-water, hydrothermal hot springs on midocean ridges, and man-made plumes, such as sewage outfalls, have taught us that mapping subsurface plumes is time-consuming and costly. BP has also injected dispersants into the oil plumes rising from the oil rig's broken plumbing on the seabed to try to prevent oil slicks from forming on the surface at all. Instruments lowered from a research ship in the gulf have detected large oil plumes near the leak, more than 3,000 feet down. Because oil is lighter than water, it tends to rise to the surface and form slicks that can be very damaging to the natural ecosystem, and ultimately the regional economy, as we are seeing now.
