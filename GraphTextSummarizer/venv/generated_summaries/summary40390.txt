" Attorney: Interrogation shows police 'tried to cover it up' Wright on Tuesday said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its police department; and Walmart. And the Crawford family's lawyers say police didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon. After killing a man at an Ohio Walmart, police interrogated his girlfriend, accusing her of lying, threatening her with jail time and suggesting she could be on drugs, according to a video obtained by CNN. Now, the family's lawyer says the recently released interrogation video shows police were trying to force Crawford's girlfriend to say something to justify what they'd done. Wright said police knew Crawford didn't have a firearm when he walked into the Walmart.
