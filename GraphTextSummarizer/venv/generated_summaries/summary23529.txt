The plane, which will cover a broad swath of the sea in the area, arrived after Coast Guard crews on Monday flew an H-60 Jayhawk helicopter over more than 42 miles of water. Visibility was clear and the water was warm in the sea, also called the Gulf of California, but rescuers had not found any survivors since Monday, Coast Guard Lt. Gibson is an avid fisherman and has participated in the same deep sea fishing trip several times, said Contra Costa Community College spokesman Tim Leong. One of the surviving tourists is Charles Gibson, the chief of police services at Contra Costa Community College District in California. "We have been working with Mexican navy authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard in the search and rescue," Baja Sportfishing Inc. said in an e-mail.
