For them, we present this list of sites and activities at former Winter Olympic venues. Although Lake Placid hosted the games in 1932, it is most remembered for the U.S. athletes' performances at the 1980 Winter Olympic Games -- especially the U.S. men's ice hockey team's "Miracle on Ice" victory over the heavily favored Soviet team followed by their gold-medal win over Finland and Eric Heiden's unprecedented five gold medals in speed skating. Chamonix, France (1924) More than 10,000 paying spectators came to watch 11 women and 247 men compete in ice hockey, figure skating, speed skating, bobsleighing, curling, Nordic (cross-country) skiing and ski jumping at Chamonix Winter Sports Week 90 years ago. It wasn't until after the event proved to be such a success that it became known as the "first" Winter Olympic Games. Vancouver, Canada (2010) Many venues from the 2010 Olympic Winter Games have been smoothly integrated or reintegrated into the Vancouver landscape.
