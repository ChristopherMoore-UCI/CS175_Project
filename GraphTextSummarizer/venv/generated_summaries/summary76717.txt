Green lace gift pouch, inexplicable black wetsuit, or pink and gold Christmas ribbon? ("The X Factor" is so bad at most things, but in the cat-uh-gry of "going all out for Christmas," it is a true five-million-dollar winner. The wardrobe department (or possibly Camila, who will one day rule us all) decided to make Camilla's GIANT HAIR BOWS her "signature thing," so all the others got to wear weird things too so as not to feel left out. Few things infuriate me more than matching boots and pants. EW: See all 'X Factor' recaps Fifth Harmony -- excuse me, #5HSantasHelpers -- took on a classic Christmas song as well, but what's important here is their fastidiously chosen headwear.
