" "We've tracked Little League games right through the Little League World Series, and as the competition grows, the kids throw curveballs up to 70% of the time," Glenn Fleisig, ASMI's director of research and co-author of the Andrews study, told ESPN The Magazine. Even though Little League has instituted new pitch count rules, ASMI says Andrews has performed about seven times the number of arm operations on young pitchers that he did 15 years ago. Some 2.6 million kids play Little League baseball all over the world. "The difference now is, kids are playing on a number of travel and showcase teams outside Little League, and they have no such rules," says Lance Auken, vice president of communications for Little League Baseball. Doctor: 'Don't throw curveballs until you can shave' Little League Baseball commissioned its study with USA Baseball and the University of North Carolina.
