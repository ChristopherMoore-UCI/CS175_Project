One of the suspects, the woman's former boyfriend, is the father of the boy born Tuesday morning, said Louis Galasso, police deputy commissioner in Warren, a Detroit suburb. Rogers said he originally conspired to end the pregnancy, but changed his mind at the last moment and told Mathis to abandon the plan, said Galasso. The abductor, who police believe was Mathis, drove toward Detroit with the woman. Rogers had told Bowman he wanted nothing to do with his child once it was born, according to Galasso. At some point, Rogers, who is expecting a child with another woman, told Bowman he wanted to reconcile, Galasso said.
