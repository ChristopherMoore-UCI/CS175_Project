Water service might not be fully restored until the middle of next week, but even then hundreds of rural homes could still be without water, he said. -- Northern Ireland's water supply is in a "precarious position" after several major water pipes burst, allowing 10 million liters of water to drain from Belfast reservoirs each day, the Northern Ireland Water interim chairman said Friday. Chairman White said company executives were not considering resignations, since their focus at the moment is restoring water service. Many customers have been without running water since Monday, but some say they haven't had supplies for 10 days. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses have lost their supply after frozen pipes burst in a rapid thaw that followed record low temperatures last week.
