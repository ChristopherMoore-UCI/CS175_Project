-- Pressure is inescapable in the cauldron of Ryder Cup competition -- pressure and ping pong. Though Graeme McDowell, that year's U.S. Open champion, closed out a 14½ - 13½ victory for Europe in the final singles match, Fowler had shown he belonged on the transatlantic stage. Twice, at the British Open and most notably at the U.S. PGA Championship, Fowler was pipped to the crown by Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who has vowed to lead Europe's charge for the Ryder Cup in Scotland this week. Defeat at Celtic Manor in Wales back in 2010 was Fowler's first taste of the tournament, but he was omitted for the infamous "Miracle of Medinah" in 2012 when Europe stormed from 10-4 behind to take the cup in dramatic fashion. "With the past few cups going to Europe I feel like this is one that we need to win," Fowler says.
