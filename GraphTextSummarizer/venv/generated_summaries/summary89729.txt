A new force of workers might not work at improving the electric grid, but they could survey urban rooftops for their suitability for installing solar panels, or take wind readings in promising areas for potential wind farms. Towns and cities turned to the WPA to build new airports and improve old ones with new and longer runways. In all of these areas, the WPA provides models that we can use in today's economic crisis. Later, when the Second World War loomed, the WPA's road and bridge work helped move troops and materiel among bases and to staging areas. Workers would not all have to be employed building new roads or making other physical improvements to the infrastructure.
