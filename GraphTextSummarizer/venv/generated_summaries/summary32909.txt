Google purchased the restaurant-review company in 2011 and added its database of reviews to existing Google services like Google Maps and Google Plus in 2012. They haven't replaced Google's own Yelp-like scoring system, which assigns locations a one- to five-star rating based on user reviews in Google Plus. It also plans to add in results for other types of destinations, including stores, hotels and places of interest. Zagat ratings score dining, hotel and other entertainment venues on a scale of one to 30. With this overhaul, Google is making Zagat content free and accessible to everyone without having to sign up.
