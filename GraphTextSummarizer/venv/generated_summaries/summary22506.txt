Jenny Hausch was riding on a chartered boat Friday with her husband and three children, taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they launched themselves out of the water. And then the next jump, the eagle ray jumped straight into our boat, straight at my chest -- 300 pounds -- and knocked me backwards and was flapping around on top of me," Hausch told CNN Wednesday. Eagle rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. -- A Florida woman said she went into "survival mode" when a huge eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of her on a boat in the Florida Keys, throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it. "We turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem," said Officer Aja Vickers.
