The Rim Fire has burned nearly 106,000 acres, up from about 53,000 acres a day earlier, spreading east from Stanislaus National Forest to part of Yosemite, Forest Service spokesman Bjorn Fredrickson said. The fire had destroyed 16 structures as of Friday morning, according to InciWeb. Meanwhile, about 70 miles to the east of Groveland, evacuation advisories were issued Friday for the town of Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill by the Tolumne County Sheriff's Department, according to InciWeb. The fire has burned 11,000 acres in a remote wilderness area of Yosemite and has had no direct effect on the park's tourist-heavy Yosemite Valley, park Ranger Kari Cobb said. -- A fast-moving California wildfire that is threatening thousands of structures has roughly doubled in size in a day -- to about 165 square miles -- and is now burning in part of Yosemite National Park, officials said Friday.
