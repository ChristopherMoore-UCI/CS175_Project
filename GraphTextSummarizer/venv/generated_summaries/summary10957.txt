The one-megabit mandate, however, is simply an intermediary step, said Laura Vilkkonen, the legislative counselor for the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The move by Finland is aimed at bringing Web access to rural areas, where access has been limited. Like banking services or water or electricity, you need Internet connection," Vilkkonen said. But the law is designed to bring the Web to rural areas, where geographic challenges have limited access until now. -- Finland has become the first country in the world to declare broadband Internet access a legal right.
