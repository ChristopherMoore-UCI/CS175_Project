From left to right: Former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, director Emir Kusturica and ex-footballer Diego Maradona at this year's Cannes. A committed socialist and fierce critic of U.S. involvement in South America, Maradona counts among his friends the Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. By contrast, two of the most critically-acclaimed sports documentaries of the last 20 years featured flawed sporting legends: the self-styled "greatest" Muhammad Ali and the brooding French footballer Zinedine Zidane. In the director's eyes Maradona embodies Latin America's underdog status against the power of the West in general, and the U.S. in particular. Read a timeline of Mike Tyson's life Kusturica's film about Maradona details the Argentine footballer's well-documented problems with cocaine that saw him sent home in disgrace from the 1994 World Cup finals after he failed a drug's test.
