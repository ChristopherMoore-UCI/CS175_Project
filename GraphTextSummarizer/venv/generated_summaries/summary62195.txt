"If your student was at this party, knows someone who was there, or knows of students who have been affected by this event, we have counselors and other trusted adults should they need support or need to share their feelings," Superintendent Brian Ewert said in a letter sent to parents. The girl who said she was assaulted is an Englewood High School freshman, school district spokeswoman Julie McGinley said. The Englewood, Colorado, school system is urging parents to talk with their children after a sexual assault case involving several students. He was charged with five counts, including sexual assault and sex assault on a child. Five teenage males have been arrested, four of them juveniles who attend public schools in the Denver suburb of about 30,000 people, police said.
