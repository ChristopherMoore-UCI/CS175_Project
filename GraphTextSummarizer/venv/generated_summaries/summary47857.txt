U.S. officials have previously acknowledged that Panetta canceled the entire program this year when he learned of its full scope. -- The Central Intelligence Agency hired the private security firm Blackwater USA in 2004 to work on a covert program aimed at targeting and potentially killing top al Qaeda leaders, according to a source familiar with the program. He decided that the time had come to brief Congress on a counterterrorism effort." Blackwater's extensive involvement in U.S. operations overseas, particularly in Iraq, has been controversial. The Iraqi government says that in a shooting in September 2007, Blackwater security guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians. The incident led to the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license in the country when it expired in May.
