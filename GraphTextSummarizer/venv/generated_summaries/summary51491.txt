Rounding out the cast were Bruins defenseman Kevan Miller (Kristoff), forward Seth Griffith (Hans), defenseman Matt Bartkowski (Sven) and defenseman Torey Krug (Olaf). But he and forward Matt Fraser (now known as Elsa's sister, Anna) brought a bit of Halloween fun to the sick children at Boston Children's Hospital. Bruins defenseman Dougie Hamilton would never have been Disney's first choice for Elsa, the cartoon star of the hit "Frozen" movie. "I've heard the song a lot of times, especially with my niece singing," Krug said.
