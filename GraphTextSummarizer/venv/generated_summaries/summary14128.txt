-- Eighteen people are stranded in the town of Mogollon, New Mexico, after the only road in and out of town was washed away, according to a spokesman for Gov. Susana Martinez. Roughly an equal distance from Albuquerque, New Mexico, El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona, Mogollon is now largely a tourist attraction boasting hiking, hummingbirds and stargazing. It once was a mining hub for silver, copper and gold and was home to about 2,000 people before the mines closed in 1942, according to Mogollon Enterprises, which operates tourist storefronts in the city. The National Guard will be providing food, water and sanitary supplies Tuesday, and a bulldozer will scrape the road to provide access to the village, said Enrique Knell, the governor's spokesman. Billing itself as "the ghost town that refuses to die," Mogollon hosts an antiques store, artisans gallery, cafe, museum and theater, most of them re-fashioned out of the town's original 19th-century structures.
