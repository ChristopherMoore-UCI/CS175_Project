One passenger died after smoke filled the L'Enfant Plaza metro station Monday afternoon, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said. A six-car Yellow line train was southbound from L'Enfant station when sparks were noticed about 1,100 feet in front of the train as the tunnel filed with smoke. "All Yellow Line service will be replaced with additional Blue Line trains" until the Yellow line returns to regular service. " The smoke was thick enough to prompt WMATA to suspend service on several lines, including parts of the Green and Yellow line, which both stop there. Other trains will be delayed.
