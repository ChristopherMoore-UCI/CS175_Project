A Saint Lucia resident found the Suski siblings on the beach and called police, the detective said. The captain checked out the engine room, which was filling up with water, David Suski said. "They told me they had a fish on the line, and were fighting the fish, then heard a noise," said David Suski, an older brother who was not on the trip but was briefed by his siblings. Two American siblings, Dan and Kate Suski, are recovering on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia after a weekend fishing trip turned into a harrowing experience. Both Dan and Kate Suski can swim and had life jackets on, but that didn't make it any less scary.
