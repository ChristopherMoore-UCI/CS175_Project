Volatile organic compounds cover a wide range of gases that can come from thousands of products, such as paints and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, pesticides and permanent markers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Samples were taken to two labs for tests, and results are expected Monday afternoon, Skippack Township Fire Chief Haydn Marriott said. Firefighters were testing homes' gas levels again Monday, and evacuated residents were being allowed to return to homes where levels were low, Marriott said. Firefighters began evacuating homes from part of Skippack Township after a resident complained of an odor early Sunday evening, the township's fire department said. The Red Cross opened a shelter at an elementary school for evacuated residents who needed a place to stay, the fire department said.
