-- It was a meeting apparently straight off the TV screen: Bart Simpson called before Mr. Burns after allegedly causing trouble. Barton Simpson, known as Bart, appeared Monday before the judge, Mr. Recorder Burns, to face charges of possession of a firearm and possession of a dangerous article on board an aircraft. Simpson's cartoon namesake is the star of the long-running U.S. TV series "The Simpsons," which also features a Mr. Burns -- who runs the local nuclear power plant and is Bart's father's boss -- as a nemesis. But the encounter did not play out in cartoon form, but rather at Warwick Crown Court in the English Midlands. He had previously denied possession of a firearm.
