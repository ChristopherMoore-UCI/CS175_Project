Protests in Tunisia against rising unemployment rates, poverty levels, inflation and government repression in late 2010 and early 2011 were the beginning of and inspiration for the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring is the popular name used to describe the wave of protests across the Arabic-speaking world in recent years against autocratic regimes. Demonstrations led to the ouster of the country's leader, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in early 2011. In October 2012, the once-banned moderate Islamist party Ennahda won Tunisia's elections. The winning party formed Tunisia's Islamist-led government.
