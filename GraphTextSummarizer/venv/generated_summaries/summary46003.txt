The White House said while it is pleased that international observers were allowed to participate in the election, "we also share concerns raised by observation groups about the restrictive political environment in which this election took place." "As Egypt looks toward parliamentary elections later this year, we urge the government to consider the recommendations of the observer groups on ways to improve the administration of future elections," the White House said. The election was called amid months of political turbulence that saw Mohamed Morsy -- the country's first democratically elected president after the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak --  removed from power in a July military coup. Former Egyptian military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was officially declared the winner of the country's presidential election on Tuesday, with election officials saying he won more than 96% of last month's vote. Allegations were made that his campaign representatives were attacked and detained, and that el-Sisi's representatives were allowed inside polling stations, Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news agency reported last week. Sabahy conceded defeat last week.
