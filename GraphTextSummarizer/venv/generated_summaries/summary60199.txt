"In Antarctica, they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate," Kate Baker, a spokeswoman for the zoo, said in June. "It's an indescribable feeling to see a patient finally set free," said Dr. Lisa Argilla, manager of veterinary science at Wellington Zoo, where the bird has been recuperating since New Zealanders discovered it in June on a beach north of the capital city. -- An emperor penguin that lost its way from Antarctica more than two months ago was released back into his native Southern Ocean waters Sunday. The bird was found "exhausted and hungry" on Peka Peka beach on New Zealand's Kapiti Coast this summer, according to the zoo. Argilla said in June that the bird might have gotten lost in a current, or perhaps its internal radar went awry.
