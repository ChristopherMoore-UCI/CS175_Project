Democrats here in Arkansas and elsewhere in the South are buffeted by constituent anger toward President Obama and his legislative initiatives like health care reform and the stimulus, regardless of how they voted on the issues. According to an analysis by CNN, there are 62 Democrats in Southern states facing re-election this cycle, all House members except for Lincoln. " Arkansas has bucked the trend among Southern states by electing Democrats to all seven statewide offices and giving them control of both legislative chambers. Arkansas supported John McCain over Obama in the 2008 election by more than 20 percent. " Brantley is not prepared to predict a dramatic realignment in the electorate, but he believes Arkansas is finally catching up to the rest of the South by electing more Republicans, regardless of the help provided by favorite son Clinton, who has come to the state three times this year to campaign for Lincoln.
