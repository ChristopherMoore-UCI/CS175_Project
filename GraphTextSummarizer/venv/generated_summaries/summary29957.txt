Christiansburg, Virginia, police Chief Mark Sisson identified the suspect Friday night as Neil Allen MacInnis, who he said was a student at New River Community College. A man pictured on that page, for instance, resembles the mugshot of MacInnis that Christiansburg police released on Friday night. On Friday night, while the mall where he allegedly shot the women was shut down except for law enforcement authorities, MacInnis was in the Montgomery County Jail. An item on the online forum 4chan -- posted at 1:52 p.m. Friday, three minutes before police estimated the shooting began -- said it was from Neil MacInnis, who wrote that he goes to the same community college's satellite campus in Christiansburg. Several elements mentioned in the 4chan post paralleled what Sisson told reporters Friday night, including that MacInnis was enrolled at the community college, lives in Christiansburg and attended that city's citizen police academy last year.
