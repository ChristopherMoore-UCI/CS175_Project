Koro shares some vocabulary with other languages spoken in the region but shares more features with languages spoken farther east, such as Milang and Tani, the linguists said in a news release issued by National Geographic. Enduring Voices documents vanishing languages and cultures and assists with language revitalization. Like most languages, Koro is unwritten and transmitted orally. A permit is required to visit, few linguists have worked there and a reliable list of languages has never been drawn up. Harrison and another National Geographic Fellow, Greg Anderson, led the expedition, called Enduring Voices, which brought Koro to light.
