-- A day after thousands of Israeli demonstrators demanded an end to rules that make ultra-Orthodox Jews exempt from the draft, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the nation's approach to military service must change. The issue is a sensitive one for Netanyahu and his Likud paty, which has traditionally relied on ultra-Orthodox parties as natural coalition partners. Both ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arab Israeli citizens are exempt from military service. Ultra-Orthodox students have been exempt from service through historical political agreements since Israel's establishment in 1948. The existing law provides an exemption for Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews.
