Rights groups accuse security forces and militia gangs of torturing civilians as world leaders warn that the nation is on the verge of a genocide. The United States sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down Kony, the brutal leader of the Lord Resistance Army. Left uncontrolled, militia groups are banding along religious lines. As history has shown over and over, religious loyalties can breed contempt and escalate conflicts. Though world leaders have warned of mass atrocities if nothing is done, the response has been limited.
