Meanwhile, Schrenker fled Harpersville on his motorcycle and traveled to a campground in Florida, where he was arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service on the outstanding charges from Indiana, according to court documents. "The defendant stated to air traffic controllers that he was not going to make it," according to documents filed in court providing a factual basis for Schrenker's guilty plea. The jets followed the plane until it crashed near the Blackwater River in East Milton, Florida, according to court documents. The Coast Guard Investigative Service later recovered cut lines from tree branches and a parachute with a serial number that was traced to Schrenker, court documents said. On January 11, Schrenker took off alone from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA46 plane, saying he was headed for Destin, Florida.
