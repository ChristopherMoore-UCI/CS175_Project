"We should care about [U.S.] troops, but we should also care about stability in Afghanistan so we don't see a return to something that looks like pre-9/11 Afghanistan," he said. Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said he's not convinced that ousting the Taliban from Afghanistan would make the U.S. safer. Moreover, a senior U.S. military official said last month that Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, was expected to request even more U.S. troops be sent there. Gates further said it was a "mystery" how long U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan. "Were the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan and the Taliban to regain power (or end up sharing power, which is more likely), going after the United States won't even be on their 'to do' list."
