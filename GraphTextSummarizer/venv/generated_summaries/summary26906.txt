" Earlier, police had said that Marina Krim found nanny Yoselyn Ortega, 50, on the bathroom floor of the family's Upper West Side luxury apartment with self-inflicted wounds. When the nanny and children didn't show up, Krim went up to the apartment, where she found the lights were off, police said. I think I see more mothers out today than nannies. Worst nightmare anyone could ever imagine," said grandmother Karen Krim, who lives in California. "We believe now that the nanny began to stab herself as the woman entered the room," Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters in a revised account of Thursday's events.
