A report released Thursday alleges that Angelyn Donald, principal at PS 386, was told by a number of students about note passing and even kissing between their 10-year-old classmate and her 40-year-old special education teacher, Anthony Criscuolo. Criscuolo was arrested in June after the alleged victim's mother called police, according to NYPD Detective Marc Nell. The charge against Criscuolo stemmed from an purported incident in June in the teacher's car, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. When one student reported to Donald's office after witnessing the alleged victim and Criscuolo kissing and another told her about reading an allegedly sexually explicit note passed between the two, Donald told the students not to spread rumors and that she would look into the allegations, according to the report. -- A Bronx middle school principal's job is in jeopardy after investigators say she failed to report student allegations of inappropriate conduct by a teacher who was later arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a female student.
