-- Jay Leno ended his 17-year reign as the host of "The Tonight Show" Friday with the children of people who met and started families while working at the long-running late-night show during his tenure, according to audience members who attended the taping. Rosa Moore from Denver, Colorado, said Leno became teary-eyed when James Taylor sang "Sweet Baby James." "When James Taylor sang the line, 'I'm 10 miles from Boston with a thousand miles more to go,' Jay wiped his eye," said Moore. Conan O'Brien, Leno's first guest Friday night, will be taking over "The Tonight Show" hosting duties beginning Monday. "His staff members, from stage managers to runners, who met, got married and had kids joined Jay on the stage and he took a picture with the 70 kids of those parents. The new show will have some of the same elements as "The Tonight Show" but with some new features.
