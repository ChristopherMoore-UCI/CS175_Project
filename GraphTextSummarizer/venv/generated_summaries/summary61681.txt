"There is absolutely no doubt that that the great boom of golf in America was started by Harry Vardon," said David Crawford, former head greenkeeper at Royal Jersey, where Vardon learnt the game. " Vardon went on to claim three more Open titles before he was struck down by tuberculosis, spending long spells in sanatoriums until 1910. His victory at Muirfield in 1896 announced his prowess to the world and irked the man he beat -- two-time Open champion Willie Park Junior. Vardon was born into a working class family in Jersey, a British outpost off the coast of Normandy in France, and honed his game when the island got its first golf course in 1878. "It was a year before they came to play it and Vardon was two shots up after the first tie at North Berwick where around 10,000 people came to watch.
