-- Russia's stand off with Ukraine might be spilling over into the sporting arena with the idea floated for Fabio Capello's team to be barred from contesting June's World Cup, but the UEFA president believes this would be a travesty for the players who worked so hard to qualify for the finals in Brazil. On Thursday, Germany announced it would not send governmental representatives in order to make a "very clear political signal to Russia", according to disabilities commissioner Verena Bentele. As the South American nation prepared to host its only World Cup to date, calls for a potential boycott were led by the Dutch whose team -- perhaps ironically -- would not just attend the event but reach the final as well. The former France international had a similar decision to make when considering whether to contest the 1978 World Cup or not. Should they do so, such a move could overshadow Friday's Opening Ceremony.
