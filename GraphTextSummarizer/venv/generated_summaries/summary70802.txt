The scenes were recorded on a cell phone, and the imagery brought stiff condemnation from human rights groups who believe the video is possible evidence of Indonesian armed forces torturing members of independence movements. "The investigation is still going on but initial reports I received from the armed forces commander, show that there were elements of the military who were involved in those excessive, unprofessional acts, that were clearly a violation of human rights, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs Djoko Suyanto told CNN. For example, the weapon being used in the video appears to be a standard military issue and the questions posed by the interrogators are consistent with those of Indonesian security forces, said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. Another video surfaced this year showing a disemboweled Papuan political activist being taunted by men in police uniforms. Human rights groups say that while they haven't determined the authenticity of the video, they have clues that the persecutors are members of the Indonesian armed forces.
