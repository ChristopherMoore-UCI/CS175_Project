According to Forbes Business Magazine, the 10-highest paid tennis players in the world earned a combined $60 million in prize money between June 2012 and June 2013. Roger Federer, the 17-time grand slam winner, is estimated to have earned $71.5 million in that time from sponsors, endorsements and exhibition matches, not to mention the $6.5 million in prize money. It's not a problem for those in the top 10 -- but with rising expenses and endless airfares to pay for, those unable to win the grand slams or attract big name sponsors are facing a conundrum. The problem for the World No.39 is that the cost of competing at the highest level is soaring, meaning he must collect $200,000 in prize money each year just to break even. The last of his seven singles titles came in 2011 and while he has bounced around the circuit picking up prize money, the opportunity to earn the big bucks continues to elude him.
