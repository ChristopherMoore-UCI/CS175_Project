-- Former President Bill Clinton suggested on Saturday that the fall in Hispanic turnout for Democrats in 2014 was partly due to President Barack Obama's decision to not issue an executive order on immigration. " "We can do this again," he said to a room full of Hillary Clinton fans. Clinton said the biggest problem for Democrats -- who lost their majority in the Senate and fell deeper into the minority in the House -- was that "the people who were against us felt more strongly than the people for us." The former president also suggested that a national advertising campaign -- that Democrats "didn't have" -- on an economic message and other issues could have "made all the difference in a couple of close races." Clinton's recollections came during a celebration around the 10th anniversary of the Clinton Presidential Center. Unlike other events during the week that looked back at the Clinton administration, the former first lady's event was forward looking on how to increase women's participation in the workforce.
