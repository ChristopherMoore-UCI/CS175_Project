-- For our seventh set of countries, we asked you to connect Australia and Angola. Blog commenter "Yu-Chuan Gan" also made the resource connection, pointing out that both Angola and Australia are rich in raw materials and mineral resources. Australia and Angola both have great natural beauty, a connection many of you made. China, which we featured on Global Connections last week, is buying a lot of oil from Angola and recently signed a big deal for natural gas with Australia. Australia's well known for its kangaroos and koalas, while Angola's national icon is the giant sable antelope.
