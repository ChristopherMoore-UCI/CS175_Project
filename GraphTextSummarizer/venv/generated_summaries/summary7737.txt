The longevity of Tomba's career is testament to his ability and the hard work he put in, scoring his first World Cup victory in 1987 when he beat his great idol, Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden. " Current World Cup star Didier Cuche also believes Tomba rather cleverly maintained the image, but remained a very serious competitor at heart. " Tomba was famous for his daring charges in the deciding second runs of his races, often making up large deficits from the first leg to storm to victory. "La Bomba" called it quits at the end of the 1998 season, aged 31, having won three Olympic gold medals, two world championship titles and 50 World Cup races. A combination of circumstances had prevented Tomba from claiming a world championship title, but he put that right in 1996 with double gold.
