Tom Hanks says working in Rome, Italy, added to the production values of "Angels & Demons." Unlike the previous effort in which the Oscar-winning duo went on a shooting spree across several European countries, the new film takes place in just one locale, Rome. Tom Hanks: You're shooting in a place like Rome and quite frankly, every layer of history and every passer-by, every scooter, every truck adds to the ambience of the film, the production value that you couldn't get in a million years if we were trying to fake it during the daylight hours back home. Hanks and Howard sat down with CNN to talk about the challenges -- and "blessings," in Hanks' word -- of making "Angels & Demons" happen in one of the world's most densely trafficked, architecturally powerful cities. Now superstar Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard are back with another of Brown's best-sellers, "Angels & Demons."
