The 20-year-old Dane withstood the customary onslaught from Sharapova to emerge victorious after just under two hours of compelling action on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court at Flushing Meadows. Sharapova, desperate for another grand slam title after clawing her way back up the rankings following shoulder surgery, made an impressive start but an astonishing string of double faults in the fourth game saw her fall 3-1 behind. -- Caroline Wozniacki underlined her status as women's top seed with a battling straight sets 6-3 6-4 victory over former champion Maria Sharapova in their last 16 clash at the U.S. Open on Monday. It was her first win over former world number one Sharapova. Wickmayer, a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows last year, looked to be cruising to victory as she swept the opening set without the loss of a game, but 31st seed Kanepi battled back to level on a tiebreaker and swept through the decider. But Wozniacki, beaten by Kim Clijsters in last year's final, made no mistake when she served for the match, closing it out with the first of two match points.
