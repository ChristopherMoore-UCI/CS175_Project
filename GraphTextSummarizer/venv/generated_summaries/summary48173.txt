The portrait-style photographs were discovered in a storage unit Alcala kept in Seattle, Washington, said Orange County district attorney spokeswoman Susan Kang Schroeder. " Alcala was convicted in 1972 of kidnapping and molesting a child in Los Angeles County in 1968, according to the Orange County District Attorney's office. "We know that Mr. Alcala used his photography as a ruse to get close to his victims," she said. "Mr. Alcala is a predatory monster and we believe that he destroyed many lives everywhere he went. Anyone with information regarding the identities of the women and children in the photographs found in Alcala's storage locker is asked to contact the Orange County District Attorney's Office or the Huntington Beach Police Department.
