The request for "expressions of interest" comes a week after the organization's executive council asked its director-general to explore "options for destruction in chemical disposal facilities" of chemicals that Syria has declared. Most of Syria's declared chemical weapons program includes common industrial chemicals or otherwise chemicals that can safely be rendered harmless or destroyed, the OPCW said. "This blessed front has been formed with the will of God to fulfill our countrymen's ambitions in Syria and in accordance with their aspirations and to pave the way for the gradual unification of factions and founding movements," Ahmed Issa Alsheikh, an official of the group, said in a video statement on Al Jazeera Arabic. The moves come after the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant succeeded as the predominant military force in northern Syria, marginalizing and even fighting Syria's more moderate factions. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces.
