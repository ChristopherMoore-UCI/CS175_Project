Police identified the victims as Qiao Zhen Li, 37; Linda Zhuo, 9; Amy Zhuo, 7; Kevin Zhuo, 5; and William Zhuo, 1. A mother and four children have been stabbed to death in a Brooklyn apartment, and a cousin of the slain woman's husband has been charged with killing them, New York police said Sunday. Mingdong Chen had been staying with the family for about a week before the Saturday night horror unfolded in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, Officer Sophia Tassy-Mason said. All five of the dead had stab wounds to their upper bodies, police said. Three of the children were dead at the scene, while the other victims were pronounced dead at nearby hospitals, police said.
