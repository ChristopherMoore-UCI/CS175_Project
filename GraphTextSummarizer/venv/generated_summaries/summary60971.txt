Although I might quibble with the exact numbers in the piece, the big picture is this: the mutation increases the risk of developing breast cancer about five fold and increases the risk of ovarian cancer more than 10 fold. They are at average risk for breast cancer. That's because most women don't have the mutation and because most breast cancer is sporadic. It's not where I expect to see a story on breast cancer. She seems to believe the answer is yes, pointing to the half-million women who die from breast cancer worldwide each year.
