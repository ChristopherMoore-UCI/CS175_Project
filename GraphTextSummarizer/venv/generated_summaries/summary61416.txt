-- President Barack Obama has signed off on a new package of nonlethal aid for Syrian rebels, U.S. officials tell CNN, signaling his administration is cautiously wading further into the conflict. The Obama administration has funneled $385 million in humanitarian aid to Syria through international institutions and nongovernmental organizations. Officials said it is expected to include equipment such as body armor, night vision goggles and other military equipment that is defensive in nature, but could be used to aid in combat by Syrian rebels battling forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Secretary of State John Kerry has pushed for more aggressive U.S. involvement in Syria since taking office in February. The move reflects what officials describe as a ramped-up effort to change the military balance on the battlefield in Syria.
