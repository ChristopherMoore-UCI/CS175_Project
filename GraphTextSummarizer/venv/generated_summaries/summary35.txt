Thalys, which operates high-speed trains across much of northern Europe, announced that services were fully suspended all day, affecting travel to Brussels from Paris, France; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Cologne, Germany. Eight people died in a train crash in Belgium in March 2001, media reports said at the time, calling it the worst rail accident in the country in 25 years. Eurostar suspended high-speed train services between London, England, and Brussels, Belgium, the company announced, and did not expect the trains to run for the rest of the day. The crash caused disruption to parts of the wider rail network in northern Europe. London-to-Paris services were not affected, the company said, but there were delays on the service to Lille in northern France close to the border with Belgium.
