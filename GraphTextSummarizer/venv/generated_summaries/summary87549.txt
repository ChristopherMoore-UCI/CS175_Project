For the fifth year in a row, Chestnut beat the 17-man field at the 96th annual Major League Eating event at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. Competitive eater Joey "Jaws" Chestnut proved himself the official top dog of the hot dog-eating world when he ate 62 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes at the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest on Monday, but his archnemesis Takeru Kobayashi crushed Chestnut's world record at an off-site event where he pounded down 69 hot dogs and buns. Chestnut took home the contest's signature Mustard belt -- a yellow championship belt -- while Thomas was the first recipient of a pink belt, meant to promote event sponsor Pepto Bismol. Kobayashi, who has been banned from the contest due to a contract dispute with Major League Eating, competed from afar: on the roof of a Manhattan bar, in unison with Chestnut and his fellow competitors. The hot dog eating contest is on Coney Island."
