After the latest incident, the commissioner for children's services, Jim Henry, said there are rules in place that restrict guards' ability to manage the teens. The other 14 boys were brought back inside the facility, where extra guards were put in place. No one escaped the facility that night, but new security measures were put into place. In May, some teens broke out of a window inside their dorm room, and then flipped a switch to let others out, according to CNN affiliate WSMV. On Monday, 32 teen boys escaped from the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center on the outskirts of Nashville.
