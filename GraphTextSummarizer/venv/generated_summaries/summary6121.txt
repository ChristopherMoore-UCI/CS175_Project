But an athletic, evolved guppy would scoff at that accomplishment, if you can consider guppies athletic. The Maryland researchers concluded that while many fish launch out of the water into the air to capture prey, migrate, or avoid predators, the guppies have a different evolutionary motive: to reach all the available habitat in Trinidad's mountain streams. And if guppies scoffed. By dispersing, guppies move away from areas of heavy predation, minimize competition with one another and keep the species' genetic variability high, the researchers said. The popular pet fish can jump up to eight times their body length, at speeds of more than 4 feet per second, according to a recently published research paper in the online peer-reviewed journal PLOS One.
