Anelka is now playing for his sixth English club, having left Chelsea in January 2012 for a big-money move to Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua. Anelka took to Twitter and claimed the "gesture was just a special dedication to my comedian friend Dieudonne" but the French government is seeking to ban Dieudonne for alleged anti-Semitic behavior. "This salute is merely a lesser known Nazi salute and we expect the same kind of punishment to be handed down by the authorities as if Anelka had made the infamous outstretched arm salute," its president Dr. Moshe Kantor said in a statement on Sunday. -- Soccer star Nicolas Anelka has sparked controversy after making a gesture one French government official called "shocking" and "disgusting." However, the European Jewish Congress called for English authorities to punish Anelka.
