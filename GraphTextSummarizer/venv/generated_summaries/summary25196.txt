With the year's third major on the horizon, Rose was pleased to have come through such a thorough examination at Congressional, host of the 2011 U.S. Open won by Rory McIlroy. The last time golf's oldest major was at Hoylake was in 2006, when Tiger Woods lifted the Claret Jug while Rose was enduring a miserable run of form which saw him fail to qualify for seven consecutive majors. Rose will now head into a major on home soil as one of the favorites, boosted by the first playoff win of his PGA Tour career. The 33-year-old led by one heading down the last having reeled in overnight leader Patrick Reed, but a wayward drive led to Rose finding the water on the 18th as he let world The world No. 8 beat unheralded American Shawn Stefani in a playoff to clinch the Quicken Loans National and win his first title since lifting the U.S. Open in June 2013.
