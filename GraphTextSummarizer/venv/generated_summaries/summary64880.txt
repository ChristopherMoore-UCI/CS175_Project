Graham and Matthew were seen leaving a bar together, and Matthew drove away in his Chrysler coupe that was parked near the bar, and police told WVIR they have "every reason to believe" Graham was in the car, too. At the bottom of the poster, however, it says police would like to speak with Matthew regarding Graham's disappearance. -- A new search warrant was issued Monday for the apartment of Jesse Matthew, who police believe was the last person to see Hannah Graham before her disappearance. Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, Longo said, giving detectives no clearer picture of what may have happened the day Graham disappeared. "I hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to Jesse Matthew again because I think he can help up find Hannah Graham," the police chief said.
