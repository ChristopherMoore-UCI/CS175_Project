Von DuBose, an Atlanta-based attorney and NFL contract negotiator who has represented NBA players in off-the-court matters, likens Collins to Marcus Camby or Juwan Howard, a fraternity of "bigger post guys who don't rely on their quicks or perimeter play to survive. "He's a weird player in a sense," said Michael Lee, who covers the Wizards, Collins' latest career stop, for The Washington Post. On the flip side of that equation, Lee and DuBose don't foresee a team picking up Collins because he's gay, as that would immediately devalue him among his teammates. While most of the reaction to Collins' announcement has been positive, DuBose said it's possible his sexual orientation could affect his future, especially if an NBA general manager feels his team is too immature to handle the addition of the league's first openly gay player. Collins needs to go to a team with solid structure and an assertive coach and GM, Lee said.
