In 2008, Gonsalves founded Music Basti, an arts education program that seeks to inspire New Delhi's underprivileged children to share their dreams and aspirations through music, and teaches them important life skills that they may not get from formal schooling. "The biggest positive change that we see in the children, and the communities that we work in, is ... how learning music and performing music gives children a sense of achievement but also of confidence, and that goes a huge way in many other aspects and areas of their lives." Gonsalves was heavily involved in music at school and as a student at Delhi University. Over the last six years, the program has worked with at least 600 young people -- children who, Gonsalves says, would never have a chance otherwise to hold a public platform or stand on a stage. -- As Faith Gonsalves walks through the dusty streets of a slum on the outskirts of New Delhi, she passes pigs rummaging through piles of trash, and colorful saris hanging out to dry.
