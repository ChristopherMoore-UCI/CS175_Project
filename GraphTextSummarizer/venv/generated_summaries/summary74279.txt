Real Madrid struck the post three times prior to the game entering extra time and Atletico keeper Thibaut Courtois made two stunning saves to preserve the victory and help end his team's three-match losing streak in Copa finals. Jose Mourinho bemoaned the "worst season of my career" after seeing his Real Madrid side slip to a 2-1 extra time defeat to capital rivals Atletico in the final of the Copa del Rey. The scrappy contest that featured more than a dozen yellow cards and two reds was settled by Miranda's header in the eighth minute of extra time on a night when it seemed Atletico, which hadn't beaten their city rivals since 1999, were destined to lift the trophy. Mourinho was ordered to leave the touchline by the referee for protesting a decision late in the second half as Atletico won their first Copa del Rey in 17 years. After Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 14th minute with a typically impressive header, Diego Costa leveled on a counter attack in the 35th after superb work by striking partner Radamel Falcao.
