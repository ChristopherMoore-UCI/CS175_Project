Estonia's oil shale gamble assumes that oil prices will remain high, and that the price they pay the European Union for carbon emissions remains low. "Oil shale is the dirtiest fuel used today in European Union. While Liive may be worried about oil prices and emission costs, he tells me it's not enough to make him lose sleep. Estonia got our independence in 1918 and actually Estonia independence is very much close links with the oil shale industry, because in 1924 we already had oil plants in operation, and even gasoline was produced," he said. But unlike shale oil and shale gas which is drilled and often associated with fracking, oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground.
