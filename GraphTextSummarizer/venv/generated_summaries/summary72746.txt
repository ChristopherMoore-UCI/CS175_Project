" No ranking Army official had ever uttered the words "slave labor camp" in reference to the men's captivity at Berga.

And there before the crowd on this historic evening, he was presented with one of the nation's highest honors, the Bronze Star. "To all who shall see these presents, greeting: this is to certify that the President of the United States of America authorized by executive order, 24 August 1962, has awarded the Bronze Star Medal to Private Samuel Fahrer, Army of the United States, for meritorious achievement while serving with Medical Detachment, 110th Infantry Regiment in the European Theater of Operations on 19 December 1944, in military operations against an armed enemy of the United States." The general even addressed documents that many of the Berga survivors signed before they were sent back home to the States. If there was a skeptic coming into the evening, it was Fahrer, a U.S. medic held at Berga.
