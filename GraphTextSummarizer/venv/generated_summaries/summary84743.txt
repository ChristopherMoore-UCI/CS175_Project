El Aroud is the Belgian-Moroccan widow of Abdessattar Dahmane, a Tunisian al Qaeda operative who was involved in the assassination of anti-Taliban Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud on Osama Bin Laden's orders two days before 9/11. El Aroud is accused of being a leader of a terrorist group that recruited young men in Belgium and France to receive terrorist training in al Qaeda camps in Pakistan. The individual in question, Hicham Beyayo, who was arrested the same day as El Aroud and is also on trial, has denied that the e-mail represented any hostile intent, and has said it was just tough talk to impress an ex-girlfriend. El Aroud has not kept secret her sympathy for al Qaeda. -- Belgian police have mounted an unprecedented security operation outside the Brussels courtroom where nine members of an alleged terrorist cell linked to al Qaeda are on trial.
