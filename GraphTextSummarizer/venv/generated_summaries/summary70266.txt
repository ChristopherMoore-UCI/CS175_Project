"This beetle is really tough, and most of the pesticides that are legal for use in Hawaii do not work on it," said Darcy Oishi, the state Agriculture Department official in charge of containing the beetle. Efforts to wipe them out have been unsuccessful, said Aubrey Moore, a University of Guam entomologist who is advising Hawaii on what has and hasn't worked there. -- What's Hawaii without palm trees? "Do people want to go to a Hawaii that is without palm trees?" Oishi said those steps are being studied in Hawaii, but will require extensive studies under "very contained conditions."
