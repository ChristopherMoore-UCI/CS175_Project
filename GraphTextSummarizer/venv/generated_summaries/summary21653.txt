Of course, Drake and Madonna's little makeout sesh got the web talking and meme-ing: "So @Drake proves that kissing @Madonna is about as ghastly as I always imagined it would be," wrote former CNN personality Piers Morgan. While the blondes had fun with it, Drake appeared less than enthused after Madonna's prolonged smooch onstage at the Coachella music festival in California on Sunday. It all went down after Drake performed  "Madonna," a song named for the megastar off his new mixtape "If You're Reading This It's Too Late," according to Billboard. Madonna has a thing for making out with fellow performers on stage. He welcomed Madonna onstage as a special guest to perform a few songs.
