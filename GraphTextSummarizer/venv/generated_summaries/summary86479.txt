Guests expected to attend include members of the Kardashian-Jenner family but minus Brody Jenner, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, fashion designer Rachel Roy, Vogue contributing editor Andre Leon Talley, star trainer Gunnar Peterson, and the usual assortment of Kardashian pals (Jonathan Cheban, La La Anthony, Brittny Gastineau, etc.). -- Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, aka "the world's most talked about couple," are saying next to nothing about their wedding plans. Kardashian has said that she and West, who popped the question last October, had their sights set on marrying in Paris. But lately there's been a lot of chatter that Kardashian and West will have their rehearsal dinner in France before tying the knot in Florence, Italy. In early May there was a Life and Style Weekly report that Kardashian and West had already obtained their marriage license, but she personally denied that claim.
