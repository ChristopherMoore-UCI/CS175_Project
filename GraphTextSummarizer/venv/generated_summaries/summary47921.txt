-- Residents of northern Japan streamed south from their earthquake-stricken hometowns Saturday, crowding stores in search of vital supplies as rescue teams worked north toward the historic quake's epicenter. Roads and airfields were washed out by the tsunami; rescue workers headed to the stricken region had to rely on helicopters. Video from Sendai showed people trapped in the second floors of homes, waving sheets of white cloth in hopes of drawing rescue workers. Japan's major highways, large sections of which are elevated, have been closed since the magnitude 8.9-quake struck off the northeastern coast Friday afternoon. The quake and resulting tsunami left behind hundreds dead by early Saturday, and that number was expected to climb sharply.
