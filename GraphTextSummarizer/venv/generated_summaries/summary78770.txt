Theoretically that might allow clubs or national federations the scope to request that FIFA allows players to use GPS in a game -- and arguably navigate a route to injury prevention. "It's in the interest of clubs, fans, players and the game itself that we do everything possible to maximize the performance of the player while doing our best to minimize the risk of injury. "We have substituted players in preseason when these numbers start getting outside normal zones and also to monitor loads in training to ensure injuries are prevented," said the Australian. However, arguably it might be in FIFA's financial interest to permit the use of GPS given that it recently committed $75 million to an insurance policy to pay clubs a maximum annual payout of $9.7 million per player injured while on national team duty, with clubs paid a daily maximum of $27,000 a player. "Football needs to legalize its use to enhance player welfare," Duncan, who is head of human performance at soccer club Sydney FC, told CNN.
