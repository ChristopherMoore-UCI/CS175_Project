WWP's announcement came as nearly 100 veterans from a coalition of the nation's leading veterans and uniformed services organizations made their angry push Tuesday at Washington's National World War II Memorial to end the shutdown. Steve Nardizzi, executive director of Florida-based Wounded Warrior Project, announced on CNN's "AC360" the organization will spend $20 million providing wounded veterans with stipend checks should their disability benefits not be issued by the federal government, which is still deeply entrenched in a bitter partisan standoff 15 days after the shutdown began. Nearly 40,000 U.S. veterans wounded on or after September 11, 2001, will each get a $500 check to help their families even if deadlocked Washington cannot not find a deal to resolve the partial government shutdown, one of the nation's largest veterans service groups promised Tuesday. Veterans rally against shutdown Testifying before the House Veterans Affairs Committee last week, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki warned that if the shutdown continues, on November 1, the agency will not be able to pay all of its 3.8 million beneficiaries, far outnumbering WWP's 40,000, who are counting on their checks.
