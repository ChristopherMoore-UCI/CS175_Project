-- Johannesburg doesn't have the stunning beauty of Cape Town or the seaside like Durban, but the energy in South Africa's largest city makes it an exciting place to be, says CNN South Africa correspondent and Johannesburg native Robyn Curnow. I grew up in 'Jozi' -- it's bustling, green, friendly and, yes, has a slightly manic energy, which is understandable considering Johannesburg is the economic hub of Sub-Saharan Africa. Curnow grew up, went to school and started her broadcasting career in Johannesburg. CNN.com asked Curnow for tips on her favorite Johannesburg spots. As for food, there is always "boerewors" for those who want a real taste of South Africa.
