Lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have requested a trial date no earlier than September 2015, according to a joint status report filed in federal court in Massachusetts Monday. Among other issues, the report said Tsarnaev's lawyers have not had a chance to review the many pieces of physical evidence, "including nearly 2,000 items that reportedly are still being analyzed by the FBI and items kept at additional locations." Authorities allege Tsarnaev, a Chechnya-born American, and his brother, Tamerlan, planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon, then killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later. Federal prosecutors said last month they'll seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in "an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner" and lacks remorse. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev during the manhunt.
