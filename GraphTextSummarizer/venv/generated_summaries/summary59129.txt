-- Having worked on seminal teen shows "Dawson's Creek" and "One Tree Hill," costume designer Leigh Leverett is no stranger to dressing high-school-age characters. The trick to costuming such events, Leverett said, is dressing the human high school students like "a teenager would interpret the period -- or at least what a teenager would pick out when they go to the fantastic Mystic Falls Costume shop." Besides, with many of the vampire characters, trying to blend in as mortal teenagers, Leverett added, "we can't get too crazy in the clothing department." With one notable exception: For characters Elena Gilbert and Katherine Pierce, both played by actress Nina Dobrev, fashion is especially important as it helps viewers tell the lookalikes apart. While the regular humans on the show dress more or less like typical high school kids, the vampires have their own set of fashion rules.
