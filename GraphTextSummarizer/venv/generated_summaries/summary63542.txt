Additional remains were uncovered in subsequent months at neighboring Gilgo Beach and along beachfront property in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City. -- A year after police discovered four bodies dumped along a remote stretch of New York beach, authorities said Tuesday they believe they've found the body of a missing New Jersey woman whose disappearance triggered the search. "If it is Shannan Gilbert, then her location is indicative of her trying to make it to the causeway," situated northeast of where the remains were ultimately found, said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. A medical examiner is expected to determine whether the remains belong to the Jersey City, New Jersey, resident, whose death authorities have previously said is not likely attributed to the suspected killer. Her disappearance in May 2010 prompted a search that has since unearthed 10 sets of human remains strewn across two Long Island counties, leading to national headlines and a hunt for a possible serial killer.
