Ensign took CNN on an exclusive tour of the animal hospital, just a few blocks west of the Bellagio hotel and famous Las Vegas Strip. But the embroidered name on his crisp white medical coat bears a familiar name: Dr. John Ensign. He's better known as former Nevada Sen. John Ensign, who abruptly announced his resignation 10 months ago amid a high-profile sex scandal. Last spring, the Senate Ethics Committee issued a lengthy, stinging report with a torrid narrative of the affair, accusing Ensign of violating the law by trying to help Hampton's aggrieved husband -- a former staffer -- find lobbying jobs. It's those moments that make Ensign call veterinarian medicine his life's passion.
