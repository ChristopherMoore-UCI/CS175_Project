The male acquaintance, also 30, witnessed the kidnapping of Denise Louise Huskins from the Vallejo home, and he is not a suspect in the case, said Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park. "Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown, and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom," Park told reporters. " Huskins, who has been living in Vallejo the past year, is from Huntington Beach in Southern California, police said. Park declined to comment on the nature of the relationship between Huskins and the 30-year-old man who saw and reported the kidnapping. About 75 people from the Solano County Search and Rescue Team were searching for Huskins in nearby woods and on Mare Island, Park said.
