Which is not to say that the film skimps on its comedy -- and with Ramis, Black, Cera, Hank Azaria, David Cross and producer Judd Apatow ("The 40-Year-Old Virgin," "Superbad") around, there's no shortage of jokes. Films poking fun at the Bible -- or, indeed, treating the Bible with anything less than reverence -- have been the subject of protests and criticism. " Ramis rounded up a cast of comedians familiar to any watcher of Judd Apatow-produced movies -- no surprise, since Apatow is a producer of "Year One." " Ramis said one of his intentions with "Year One," which he co-wrote with "Office" writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, was to focus on people, not God. "I wanted to do a film that kind of addressed these fundamental beliefs and urged people to take personal responsibility, no matter what they believe God is or isn't," Ramis said.
