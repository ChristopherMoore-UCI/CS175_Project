Meat actually played something of a role in popularizing the association of reindeer with Santa early last century, according to Laura Galloway, who wrote about the history for CNN.com. Though Lomen's campaign for reindeer meat never took off in the United States, "his marketing efforts unleashed a worldwide obsession with Santa and created a common narrative now known around the world, and even elaborated on," Galloway wrote. A businessman named Carl Lomen hoping to mass market reindeer meat worked with Macy's in 1926 to create a parade led by Santa and reindeer. Reindeer meat was on the menu, she wrote, "if you can bear not to think about Rudolph, Dancer, and Prancer." But making a meal of reindeer meat is actually "totally normal considering where he is," said food guru Kat Kinsman, who runs CNN's Eatocracy blog.
