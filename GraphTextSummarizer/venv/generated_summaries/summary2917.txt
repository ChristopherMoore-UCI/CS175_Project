"Physically Monaco is not that draining but mentally it is massive. "The first thing that hits you at Monaco compared to other tracks is how claustrophobic it is," adds Webber, who chose not to join peers such as Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in making Monaco his home. "But Monaco is up there for us as drivers and as race teams. On other tracks you don't see that." Hearing Racing around Monte Carlo's elegant, legendary circuit is not just a visual sensation -- the magic of Monaco piques each of the five senses. "You might get a bit of the salt water," says Webber, pondering whether there was a particular scent in the Monaco air.
