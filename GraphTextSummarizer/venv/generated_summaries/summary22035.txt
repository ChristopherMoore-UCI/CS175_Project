Swapping out meat just once per week would also help reduce the emissions that are contributing to climate change and extreme weather. Eating less meat is a simple way to reduce the pressure on global resources and help ensure that everyone has enough to eat. The reality is that it takes massive amounts of land, water, fertilizer, oil and other resources to produce meat, significantly more than it requires to grow other nutritious and delicious kinds of food. My own organization, Oxfam, an international relief and development organization, recently endorsed the idea of eating less meat and dairy as part of our GROW campaign to fight global hunger. Because meat production is so resource intensive, livestock farming actually accounts for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
