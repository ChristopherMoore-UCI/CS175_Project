"I do not think that speculation is going to solve any problem." Pakistan's government "did not have a policy of protecting these people," he asserted during an interview on ABC's "This Week." Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, told CNN's Candy Crowley he has not seen any information to indicate Pakistani officials knew bin Laden was living in Abbottabad. Pakistan remains a hotbed of anti-U.S. sentiment and is home to a large number of people with sympathy for bin Laden. "We think that there had to be some sort of support network for bin Laden inside of Pakistan," Obama said in a "60 Minutes" interview airing Sunday on CBS. " Pakistani authorities have "indicated they have a profound interest in finding out what kinds of support networks bin Laden might have had," Obama noted. "This may be an opportunity to reboot this relationship with Pakistan, and get them to be more aggressive in going after these common targets," Hayden said during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Even if Pakistan was not complicit in providing the safe haven" to bin Laden, "they certainly fell well short of what it was we thought or perhaps they think they should be," he said.
