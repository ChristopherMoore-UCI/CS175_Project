Football player Michael Sam, actress and fitness mogul Suzanne Somers and powerhouse singer Patti LaBelle are among the contestants for the new season of "Dancing With the Stars," ABC announced Tuesday morning. Actor Alfonso Ribiero won the show's mirror ball trophy last season. Sam became famous as the first openly gay football player drafted by the NFL, though he didn't make a pro team's final roster last year. He still has hopes of a football career, he said on Twitter after the "Dancing" announcement.
