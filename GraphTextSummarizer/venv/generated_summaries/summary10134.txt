She checked into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center a week ago for "symptoms caused by congestive heart failure," which an "ongoing condition," representative Jamie Caldwell said last week. -- Famed actress Elizabeth Taylor has shown "steady improvement" since she was taken to a Los Angeles hospital last week for treatment of a heart problem, her representative said. The London-born movie star has won two Academy Awards for best actress: for "Butterfield 8" in 1961 and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" in 1967. The actress has used Twitter over the past two years to communicate with fans and dispel the occasional rumor reported on celebrity gossip websites. When doctors repaired a leaky heart valve in October 2009, Taylor posted a Twitter message saying it "was like having a brand new ticker."
