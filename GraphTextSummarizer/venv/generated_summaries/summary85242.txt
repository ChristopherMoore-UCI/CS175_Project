Engaging lawyers to overturn the laws in those states, bikies are now about to fight another battle in the northern Australian state of Queensland which on Wednesday passed a law banning gang members from owning, operating or working in tattoo parlors. Besides the Tattoo Parlors Act, members of motorcycle clubs -- or 'bikies' as they are known in Australia -- have had to contend with anti-association laws in New South Wales and South Australia. "Murder to armed robbery to arson to malicious damage, firearms offences - tattoo parlors are synonymous with outlaw motorcycle gangs," Katsogiannis told the ABC. While boutique tattoo parlors such as Bondi Ink like to highlight their family-friendly credentials, police estimate that at least one-in-four tattoo parlors across Australia are affiliated with outlaw motorcycle clubs such as the Hells Angels, the Gypsy Jokers and the Finks. This month, New South Wales passed new laws requiring tattoo parlor owners and employees to provide detailed information about their personal associations and criminal histories.
