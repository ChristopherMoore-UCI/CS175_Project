African-Americans are far more likely than white Americans to use hospitals or clinics as their primary source of care, and about 20% of African-Americans lack any consistent source of health care. That, of course, means advancing initiatives such as paid family leave, so parents don't have to choose between taking care of a sick child or parent and keeping their job. For example, in health care and education we have made much progress, but racial disparities and cyclical poverty highlight our nation's unfinished business. The Affordable Care Act is clearly an important step in providing affordable, quality health care for all Americans -- a step that prioritizes lifesaving preventive care. Clearly, we need to be doing more to support single parents, but there are also strategies to encourage parents to stay to together.
