"This investigation revealed unthinkable plotting and planning of terrorist activity that targeted unsuspecting innocent citizens," New York State Police Superintendent Joseph A. D'Amico said in a news release. The suspects, expected to appear in federal court Wednesday, apparently planned to use the homemade X-ray machine to attack high-ranking government officials and other targets with radiation, the source said. Two men have been charged in the Albany, New York, area in a bizarre plan to use a device loosely described as a ray gun to "target people they didn't like," a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Wednesday. If convicted, each faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and five years of supervised release. Beginning in April 2012, authorities received information that Crawford was searching for people at local Jewish organizations to help him build a device capable of killing human targets silently from a distance, according to a criminal complaint.
