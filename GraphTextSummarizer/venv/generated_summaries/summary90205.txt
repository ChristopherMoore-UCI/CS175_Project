"We're in an era where social media drives live TV and live TV drives social media," said Mr Cuban, who owns and operates AXS, with partners that include Ryan Seacrest, Anschutz Entertainment Group and Creative Artists Agency. The Huffington Post spends no more than $2m per market and splits the costs and the profits with its partners, said Jimmy Maymann, chief executive of the Huffington Post Media Group. Executives at Tomorrow Focus and Le Monde, which is working with the Huffington Post in France, said that they decided to link up with the Huffington Post rather than go it alone so that they could tap into the new media group's tech knowhow. Together, the groups hire an editorial team of about 12 people, usually led by a prominent Ms Huffington-like figure, such as prominent French journalist Anne Sinclair for the Huffington Post's French outpost. " Each international outpost -- outside Canada and the UK -- is set up as a joint venture, where the Huffington Post contributes its technology system and the traditional media outlet contributes its promotional power and understanding of the market as well as its ad sales team.
