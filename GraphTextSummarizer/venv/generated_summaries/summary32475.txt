The idea behind Cha Cha Cha films was conceived by Cuaron senior, del Toro and Innaritu when the trio -- a kind of all-stars of Mexican cinema -- found themselves with a surprise 16 nominations and 4 awards at the 2007 Oscars. It was written written and directed by Carlos Cuaron, and is the first release from groundbreaking new production venture Cha Cha Cha films. Cha Cha Cha was established by Mexico's three leading directors who are also renowned internationally -- Carlos' brother Alfonso Cuaron ("Children of Men"), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ("Babel") and Guillermo del Toro ("Pan's Labyrinth"). Watch Cuaron, Bernal and Garcia talking about "Rudo y Cursi" "I don't care about Mexican films, about indie films, about Hollywood films," says Alfonso. When Carlos was originally writing the script, his bother, Alfonso told him thought it was perfect for Cha Cha Cha.
