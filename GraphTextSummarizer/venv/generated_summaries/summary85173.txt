The 24-year-old "Red" singer shared a photo of her new shoulder-length 'do on Instagram, along with a video of all the people who were watching the big chop in action. Since Swift's had her trademark long curls since she debuted, we're not surprised that as many witnesses as possible wanted to see the cut in action. Swift was in London performing on Tuesday as part of her "Red" tour, and the set included an appearance from Ellie Goulding. "London, I could never thank you enough," Swift captioned a photo with the British singer. -- On Tuesday, Taylor Swift became a card-carrying member of the short hair club.
