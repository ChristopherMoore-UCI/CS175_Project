Woods' 76th PGA tour win puts him closer to regaining the No. 1 ranking in the world, a status now held by Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy, 23, who finished the tournament seven strokes behind Woods and tied for eighth place. -- Tiger Woods won the World Golf Championship tournament at Doral's Blue Monster course in Florida on Sunday, boosting his comeback just weeks before next month's Masters. Woods credits his physical condition and his work with swing coach Sean Foley. Woods, 37, finished Sunday's final round two strokes ahead of runner-up Steve Stricker despite two bogeys in his last three holes. It is Woods' second tournament win of the young season, adding to the Farmers Insurance Open title he won in January.
