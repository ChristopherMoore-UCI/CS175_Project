Having been handed a brutal beating by Polish side Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, Celtic's European adventure appeared to be over before it had started. A game against Slovenian champion Maribor was Celtic's reward with the opportunity to play some of European football's biggest names the prize. It was his presence on the field which meant UEFA awarded the game to Celtic 3-0, making it 4-4 on aggregate and allowing the Scottish champion to progress on away goals. And it soon carved Celtic open to claim a deserved equalizer when Damjar Bohar ran through to slot the ball past the onrushing Craig Gordon. In Belgium, Oleg Shatov scored the only goal of the game as Zenit St Petersburg recorded a 1-0 away win at Standard Liege.
