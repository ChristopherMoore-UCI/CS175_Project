An earthquake that size is strong enough to cause "considerable" damage, the Geological Survey said, though the extent of damage that any earthquake causes depends on many factors, including its depth, proximity to dense population centers, and the strength of structures where it hits. These people, the ones who are entrapped without the ability of receiving food or water, they have to withstand heat indexes at or near triple digits. As aid moves more quickly, those Haitians who made it through the quake with their health will have increased access to necessities such as food and water. The body may survive a lot of days without food, but definitely they need water." Bottlenecks at all points of entry -- the airport, roads, and ports -- have delayed food and medical aid to the estimated 3 million Haitians affected by the quake.
