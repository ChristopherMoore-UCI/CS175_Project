Already, the Greek letters sigma, alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house's facade, the house will be closed as of midnight Tuesday and the university will board up the windows, following up on separate decisions by the university and the SAE national headquarters to shutter the Oklahoma chapter, Boren said. So far, no students have dropped out -- voluntarily -- but the video has cost the university's football team a top recruit as offensive lineman Jean Delance said Monday he was de-committing from the Sooners and considering other teams. Writing to the two students Tuesday, just two days after a video of frat members singing the racist song surfaced, OU President David Boren said they were being booted for "leading a racist and exclusionary chant which has created a hostile educational environment for others. The law "prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance," but it also provides the parameters for determining if someone is violating the federal law, Boren said. " Also unknown at this point is whether other students who appear in the video will be expelled or otherwise punished.
