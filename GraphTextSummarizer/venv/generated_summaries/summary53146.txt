At any one time, the camp can take 120 children -- free of charge -- with illnesses such as cancer, blood diseases and disorders and metabolic diseases. He believed that children facing grave illnesses and very grown-up realities should have a special hideout where they could just be kids for a while. "What the children, I think, get out of camp the most is that is a sense of community and a sense of acceptance, and in their regular lives they feel totally isolated, and they so often are living on the margins. But at camp, they're surrounded by 120 other children that have walked in their shoes, down similar paths. " And according to 11-year-old Cameron Merritt, that's exactly what happens when he comes to camp each summer.
