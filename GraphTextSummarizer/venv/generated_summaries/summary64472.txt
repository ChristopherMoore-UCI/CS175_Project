how could Oprah, who had never selected a collection of stories for her book club, choose a collection like Uwem Akpan's, with its multilingual patois, complete absence of pathos or sentimentality and nearly unbearable-to-read violence toward children? Of course, my colleagues and I never forgot why Uwem was in Ann Arbor, Michigan. That second version of "An Ex-Mas Feast" was so powerful and finely polished that I asked Uwem if he would send it to the deputy fiction editor of The New Yorker, whom I had met a few weeks earlier when the magazine brought its college tour to Ann Arbor. A few months later, Uwem accompanied me to my temple for the Jewish New Year. The magazine accepted Uwem's story for its fiction issue.
