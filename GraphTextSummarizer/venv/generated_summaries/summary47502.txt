Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in January that the A-10s had flown 11% of the Air Force's missions against ISIS despite coming into the conflict more than two months after initial U.S. involvement. "The Air Force is increasing rotational presence in Europe to reassure our allies and partner nations that our commitment to European security is a priority," Lt. Gen. Tom Jones, vice commander, United States Air Forces in Europe -- Air Forces Africa, said in a statement. It's about some very tough decisions that we have to make to recapitalize an Air Force for the threat 10 years from now," Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, said in January. The U.S. Air Force is sending its "tankbusters" back to Europe. The Air Force said besides operating in Germany, the A-10s will be forward deployed to other partner nations in Eastern Europe.
