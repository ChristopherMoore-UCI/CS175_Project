Yahoo e-mail has suffered from other limited outages since October, although none as bad as last week's. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has apologized for a massive e-mail outage last week, calling the days-long glitch "unacceptable" and a "massive inconvenience. " Mayer made revamping e-mail a key part of her effort to kick-start Yahoo, but it's been a rocky process. Service was restored to more than 99% of affected users by Saturday, although Yahoo's engineers were still working on the problem Sunday. Mayer said it affected about 1% of Yahoo e-mail's users.
