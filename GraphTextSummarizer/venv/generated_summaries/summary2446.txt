"Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any of our other victims," she added, saying that the Zimmerman verdict had nothing to do with her pursuit of the Dunn case. It was a hot-button trial that drew comparisons to the proceedings against George Zimmerman in the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. The jury in the case of Michael Dunn found him guilty Saturday night on four charges, including three of attempted second-degree murder, but they couldn't reach a verdict on the most significant charge -- first-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. Like the Dunn trial, the earlier case had racial overtones and claims of self-defense, but Zimmerman was found not guilty in Martin's death on July 13, 2013. " She added, "It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life with that sense of torment, and I will pray for him, and I've asked my family to pray for him."
