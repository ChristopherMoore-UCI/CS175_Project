She was right, but there is an even more ominous similarity between the actions of Iran and those of pre-war Germany. No wonder the Iranians were so happy:-- Sanctions were eased, and "Iran was given access to $550 million of its assets that are frozen overseas," noted Iran Watch. Pressure is what brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, and only more pressure will get [them] to abandon their nuclear weapons program. Greater pressure on Iran will not make war more likely; it will make war less likely -- because the greater the pressure on Iran and more credible the threat of force on Iran, the smaller the chance that force will ever have to be used. "Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran's security and defense doctrine, and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions," Rouhani added.
