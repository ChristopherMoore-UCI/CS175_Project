New York police have estimated the cost to the city would exceed $200 million per year in a trial that could last years. -- White House advisers are considering recommending alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed be tried in a military court instead of a civilian one in New York City, a senior administration official told CNN on Friday. "At the end of the day, wherever this case is tried, in whatever forum, what we have to ensure is that it's done as transparently as possible and with adherence to all the rules." White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday the administration was evaluating its options "based on New York City logistical and security concerns." In November, Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to try Mohammed in a New York civilian court. To try Mohammed and others "as common criminals, giving them the constitutional rights of American citizens in our courts, is justice according to 'Alice in Wonderland,'" said Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut independent.
