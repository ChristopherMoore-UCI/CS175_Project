Rape with sticks and guns, even bayonets. A week hearing terrifying stories of torture and rape. Some years later, in 2009, I returned to make a film about rape and found a disturbing new trend. This little girl had been conceived from rape. It makes difficult reading, but not nearly as difficult as it is for the women survivors, who are living with the consequences and stigma of rape.
