-- Apple is developing iPhones with curved-glass screens and enhanced sensors that detect different levels of pressure, according to a new report. The new phones would likely be released in the third quarter of next year, the source said, adding that Apple is also testing "pressure-sensitive technology," which won't be ready for the next iPhone launch. Curved glass has become a smartphone trend among major tech companies. Samsung last month released its Galaxy Round phone, which has a 5.7-inch curved display, while LG is set to release its G Flex phone, which is curved from top to bottom. Two models â€” with screens of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches â€”are in the works, and both would use glass that curves downward at the edges, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the plans.
