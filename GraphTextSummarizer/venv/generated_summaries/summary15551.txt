-- This is the day San Diego Mayor Bob Filner enters a behavior counseling clinic for two weeks of what he describes as intensive therapy. Battling a lawsuit Filner's former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson, and nine other women have accused Filner of sexual harassment. None of the other women leveling claims of sexual harassment against Filner came forward until Jackson filed her suit in state court. Jackson said Filner subjected her and other women to "crude and disgusting" comments and inappropriate touching. In late July, Filner said he planned to begin counseling Monday.
