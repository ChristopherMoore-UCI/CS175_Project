Initially, Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said Bergdahl was safe, and a video was distributed showing Bergdahl "in good shape and good health." Shortly after his capture, Bergdahl appeared in a video, saying, "Scared I won't be able to go home, and it's very unnerving to be a prisoner." Since then, his captors have released three more videos of the Wood River Valley, Idaho, native assigned to 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, in Fort Richardson, Alaska. With news that the U.S. will engage in peace talks with the Taliban and encouraging signs that Bergdahl will be included in a prisoner swap, we'll likely be hearing more about the man whom friends and family describe as an adventurer and a gentleman. My brothers and sisters in uniform know we won't rest until Bowe Bergdahl is safely back with his family." Those who know Bergdahl say he's gregarious and chivalrous, able to hold a conversation with anyone and prone to spontaneous acts of kindness. Other officials have said they're encouraged by signs that Taliban representatives are doing just that and by statements suggesting the group is willing to accept ideas supported by Afghan society, such as allowing girls to attend school.
