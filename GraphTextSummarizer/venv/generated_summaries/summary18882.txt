The sale has benefited from the boom in Patek Phillippe auction values over the last 15 years. "It's amazing that they did all that without computers," says Larry Pattinelli, the president of Patek Phillippe. The Henry Graves Supercomplication timepiece, made by the luxury watchmaker Patek Philippe in 1933 for the prominent banker Henry Graves, was sold at Sotheby's in Switzerland. The Supercomplication took Patek Phillipe eight years to produce, from its commission in 1925 to delivery in 1933. One of the Supercomplication's more obscure features is a sidereal time dial, which tracks the Earth's rate of rotation in relation to fixed stars.
