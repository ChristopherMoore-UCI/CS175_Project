'Captain Marvel' Set for July 6, 2018, the movie about Carol Danvers' cosmic alter ego caused a lot of excitement on social media, especially among fans who feel that female comic book characters have gotten short shrift on the big screen (something which rival DC Comics recently addressed by announcing a "Wonder Woman" movie). The next five years will be huge for Marvel fans, no doubt about it. However, Captain Marvel achieved new popularity when Carol (previously Ms. Marvel) assumed the Captain's mantle. Marvel's version of Captain Marvel was originally an alien officer, and the name has been transferred to multiple characters over the years. The 1992 comic book story involved many characters of the Marvel Universe, and followed up on a previous story arc setting up Thanos (most recently seen in the "Guardians of the Galaxy" movie) as one of the big bads of Marvel Comics.
