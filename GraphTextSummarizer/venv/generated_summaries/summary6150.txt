Thanks to the actions of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne in the last "Bourne" film, 2007's "The Bourne Ultimatum," Aaron Cross finds himself in jeopardy as Bourne's exposure risk creates problems for Outcome. Rather than have her enter the plot through Aaron Cross, she's on her own journey, Gilroy said, noting how "that in itself is a really much more open perspective." Weisz, who told CNN that she's a "huge fan of the original trilogy" as well as writer/director Gilroy, said that what intrigued her about this installment is that "it lifts the curtain on the first three and it shows you who was really in charge, who was really the puppeteer behind all the puppets. Viewing Greengrass' "Ultimatum" made Gilroy ponder what could happen if there was a "larger conspiracy ... and it turns out there's a whole other world outside. Portrayed by Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner (who's already had a blockbuster summer as Hawkeye in "The Avengers"), Cross is an agent with another government program called Outcome, which creates agents with medically enhanced cognitive and physical capabilities. -- The "Bourne" franchise returns to theaters Friday minus its central character, Jason Bourne, but with a new hero and story -- a turn that caught even its writer/director, Tony Gilroy, by surprise.
