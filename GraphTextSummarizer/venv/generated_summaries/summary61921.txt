" "Raging Bull" won two Oscars, including best actor for De Niro, who portrayed the boxer. Federal copyright law gave Paula Petrella the sole right to renew the copyrights before the term expired, which she did in 1991. Ginsburg added, "Allowing Petrella's suit to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has earned during that period and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties, such as consumers who have purchased copies of 'Raging Bull.'" Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy, along with Chief Justice John Roberts dissented. The companies say having an open-ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions. The underlying issue was a lot more dry and technical than the film itself: equitable defense and tolling for remedies in civil copyright claims.
