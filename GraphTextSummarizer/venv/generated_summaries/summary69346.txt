-- A former trader for Swiss banking giant UBS was convicted Tuesday on two counts of fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison over what prosecutors called a "staggering" $2.3 billion loss in unauthorized trading. The charges against Adoboli led to the resignation of UBS chief executive Oswald J. Gruebel two days later. At the time, UBS chairman Kaspar Villiger said in a statement the bank regretted Gruebel's decision.
