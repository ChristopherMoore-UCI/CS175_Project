The reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole and his daughter, Natalie Cole. Jackson took to the stage in London on Thursday and performed their 1995 song Scream as video of Michael Jackson played and his voice filled Royal Albert Hall. Jackson declined to comment to the press on the two-year mark of her brother's death, instead taking to social media this week with a simple message on Twitter on the June 25 anniversary: "I miss you, I love you. " Jackson wraps up the European leg of her tour this week then heads to North America, Australia and Africa. In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording "Unforgettable" into a father-daughter duet.
