Police used surveillance video to identify a man and woman suspected in the theft and are asking for citizens' help in identifying them, acting Oslo Assistant Chief of Police Hege Naustad told CNN on Saturday. Based at the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi, he frequently weighs in on issues -- from expressing condolences over the death this summer of Ghanaian President John Evans Atta Mills to promoting development and unity among Asanteman chiefs. The king had gone to Oslo to promote his people by taking part in a conference run by the Norwegian African Business Association, according to Naustad. While Ghana is a constitutional democracy led by a president since the mid-20th century, it has a rich history beyond that -- including groups that date back centuries, including the Asantes, who are centered inland in the West African nation. The current leader of the traditional Asante kingdom, the 62-year-old King Osei Tutu, remains a prominent figure in Ghana.
