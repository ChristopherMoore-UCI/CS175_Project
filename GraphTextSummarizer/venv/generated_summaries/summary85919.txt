-- Officials in Muskingham County closed schools as sheriff's deputies equipped with night vision attempted to hunt down dozens of exotic animals, including bears, lions, tigers, cheetahs, wolves, giraffes and camels, who are on the prowl in eastern Ohio following the death of the man at the farm where they lived. "There are still thought to be several dangerous animals on the loose, creating a public safety threat." Bears and wolves were spotted along I-70. "Deputies are currently patrolling the area in pickup trucks, armed with shotguns," Sheriff Matt Lutz said in a statement. Terry Thompson, the owner of the land and animals, was found dead on the scene outside the home, according to Lutz, who didn't elaborate, Thompson was recently released from prison for an unknown crime. The Columbus Zoo, The Wilds, a safari-themed park, and Ohio State Police have responded to the incident, according to state police.
