During his 2008 trial, prosecutors presented evidence that in 1982, Connolly, then an FBI agent, schemed with Bulger and the Winter Hill gang to kill businessman John Callahan. -- A Florida court has vacated the murder conviction of former FBI agent John Connolly, the informant handler of convicted Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger, according to court documents. The Florida Court of Appeals on Wednesday determined that prosecutors had incorrectly requested that the jury be allowed to convict on second-degree murder with a weapon, instead of first-degree murder, because Connolly's gun was not used in the crime. It was revealed in court that Connolly, Bulger and associates met over several weeks before the slaying, but it was "undisputed" that hit man James Martorano, and not Connolly, fired the murder weapon. Prosecutors during his trial said Connolly was corrupted by his two highest-ranking snitches: Bulger and Flemmi.
