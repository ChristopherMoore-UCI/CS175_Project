5 things to know Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki objects as his ouster looms What to know about Iraq's Prime Minister Al-Maliki could bide his time and try to divide Iraqi politicians to make it difficult for al-Abadi to muster enough support to form a government over the next 30 days as Iraq's Constitution outlines. Washington has sought to separate the need for urgent support to combat militants from support for al-Maliki. While senior U.S. officials say they are now less worried about Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki launching a coup to stay in power, they still predict he'll try to obstruct the political process to keep his designated successor, Haider al-Abadi, out of office. Iraq's political power struggle reached a breaking point on Monday when President Fuad Masum named al-Abadi, the deputy speaker of Parliament, to replace al-Maliki.
