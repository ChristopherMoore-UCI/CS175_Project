"Nogwaza's death is the latest in a long series of sadistic crimes against lesbians, gay men, and transgender people in South Africa," said Dipika Nath, researcher in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights program at Human Rights Watch. Despite the law, attacks based on sexual orientation are still going on, rights groups said. -- A 24-year-old who was stabbed to death in South Africa is the victim of "corrective rape," gay rights activists said Thursday, a crime where men attack lesbians in an attempt to reverse their sexual orientation. Outspoken gay rights activists have faced harassment and attacks in the nation, Human Rights Watch said. The death has sparked renewed calls for action as rights groups warn of escalated homophobic attacks.
