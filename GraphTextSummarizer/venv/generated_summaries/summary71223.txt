Santley grabs a plastic bag inside the major surfboard manufacturer Lost, and points down at a pile of polyurethane powder, excess foam that sprinkled from a surfboard-shaping machine. The dominant supplier of surfboard blanks, Clark Foam, shut down in 2006, opening the market to new firms, including one created by some of its former employees, U.S. Blanks. But the buzz in San Clemente's surf businesses is newest batches of Green Foam Blanks are less murky and Santley showed off some visibly cleaner next-generation boards. The surfboards made from recycled foam blanks were dotted with little specs, giving the boards just a slightly dirty or murky finish. Santley saw an opportunity to "green up" surfing by recycling all that blanks' dust and is now teamed with U.S. blanks.
