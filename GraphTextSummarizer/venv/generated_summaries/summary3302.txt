The entertainment site took note of the relationship last September after photos surfaced of Foster spending time with Hedison, a photographer/actress and an ex-girlfriend of Ellen DeGeneres. The actress and filmmaker quietly tied the knot with her girlfriend Alexandra Hedison over the weekend, a rep for Foster confirmed to CNN. According to E! Online, which first reported the news, Foster and Hedison had been dating for almost a year. No other details are yet available about Hedison and Foster's nuptials, although we won't hold our breath: Foster is notoriously private about her personal life. In that speech, Foster expressed gratitude to her former partner Cydney Bernard, with whom she has two sons.
