Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras but denied any prior knowledge of the alleged kickback scheme. Throngs of protesters packed the streets of major Brazilian cities on Sunday, pushing for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of the votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after protests began last month. And during many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. "Many things have changed since the election," Janaina, a protester in Sao Paulo, said on Sunday, noting that even some people who voted for Rousseff were in the crowd.
