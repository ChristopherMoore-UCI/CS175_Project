" This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest: Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the mountain on May 29, 1953. Yuichiro Miura reached the top of Everest Thursday morning with his physician son Gota, mountaineering official Gyanendra Shrestha said from the base of Everest. Miura's achievement eclipses that of a Nepali man who climbed Everest at age 76 in 2008. I think I have a good chance to reach the summit of Everest," he said via phone earlier this month. -- An 80-year-old Japanese man on Thursday became the oldest person to reach the top of Mt. Everest, officials said.
