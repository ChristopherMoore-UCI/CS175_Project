Molly Hutchins says the Twitter feed gives people an "outlet to vent your frustration" over bad drivers. " Hutchins hatched the idea after she found her mother's instant messages, or tweets, were increasingly becoming rants on bad driving. When "you yell out the window or give them the finger, you really don't get any vindication," said the Twitter feed's co-creator, Molly Hutchins. AKBadDrivers is a month-old Twitter feed that takes road rage into the information age. It lets aggrieved motorists in Alaska fire off 140-character vents about drivers who follow too closely, park too tightly, drive too fast or flout other vehicular etiquette.
