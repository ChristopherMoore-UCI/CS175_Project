-- Alleged al Qaeda operative Abu Anas al Libi, accused of playing a role in the deadly bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, denied terrorism charges when he appeared in federal court in New York Tuesday. When al Libi was captured, al Qaeda threatened to kidnap Americans in Libya and target western interests. In the east of the country around Benghazi, where al Qaeda and the Islamists are strongest, and where U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was killed last year, security for westerners has deteriorated. Libya's Justice Minister Salah Marghani says he trusts the U.S. justice system, that al Libi is innocent until proven guilty. According to one official, such is al Qaeda's ease of operations in eastern Libya, that hundreds of Islamists from neighboring north African nations are gravitating to the area.
