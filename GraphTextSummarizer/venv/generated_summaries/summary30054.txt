The next version of Windows will look a lot like Windows Phone 7. " Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who took the stage after the Microsoft folks, entertained the idea of building a Windows tablet. Windows 8 is still in development, so it's unclear how well the system will run on tablets. Windows 8 takes the colorful tiles and finger-swipe gestures from the Windows Phone operating system and expands them to a larger screen -- in this demo, 10.6 inches diagonally. Microsoft unveiled the design for Windows 8 at the All Things Digital conference here on Wednesday.
