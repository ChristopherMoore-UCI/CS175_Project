Two former coaches have sued Major League Soccer team Chivas USA, claiming they were fired this year because they are not Latino. He "undertook a systemic effort to reverse what he perceived as the 'Americanization' of Chivas USA and to implement a discriminatory employment practice similar to the ethnocentric 'Mexican only' policy that exists at Chivas de Guadalajara," the lawsuit alleged. Court documents cited Vergara's comments to the press, in which he is quoted as saying the plan called for Chivas USA to be "the son of Chivas of Guadalajara" but "it got away from that and the clubs suffered a divorce in philosophy and structure." Daniel Calichman and Theothoros Chronopoulos, who worked in the team's "academy," or player development, program, accused team owner Jorge Vergara Madrigal of Mexico of enacting a Latino-only employment policy, according to a lawsuit filed in a Los Angeles County court. Since Vergara took control of Chivas USA, about seven non-Latino academy employees, including the two former coaches, have been terminated, the lawsuit said.
