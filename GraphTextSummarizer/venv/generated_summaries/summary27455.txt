A full day later, both Gregory Dunn and his son Jason are still alive despite their life-threatening injuries, said sheriff's office Detective Will Gardner. That's the gruesome scene Shasta County, California, sheriff's deputies encountered Monday afternoon, before calling ambulances to transport the two to area hospitals. Gary Rinehart told CNN affiliate KRCR that he saw both men being wheeled from the scene into separate ambulances. Reflecting Tuesday on the bloody incident that occurred across the street from his home, Rinehart said, "I just can't imagine anything like that happening between family." Then, the sheriff's office said a press release, Jason Dunn mutilated himself by using a radial-arm saw to sever his hands.
