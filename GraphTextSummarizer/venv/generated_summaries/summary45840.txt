Do Hispanics care about immigration reform? This electorate is familiar with politicians making promises they don't always keep -- and surely will see that McCain favors border security before immigration reform, a reform he put his name on at great cost. Why isn't there a similar outcry when candidates address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on the future of Israel? But the debate on immigration has motivated many to apply for citizenship and many others to register to vote. They believe reform would help in a community that shares a common language, even though it has many differences.
