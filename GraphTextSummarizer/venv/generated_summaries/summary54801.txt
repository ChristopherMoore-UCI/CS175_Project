"We can confirm that Floyd Corkins graduated from George Mason with a master's degree from our college of education and human development," said George Mason University spokesman Dan Walsch. Corkins lived with his mother and father in a middle class single-family home in Herndon, Virginia, a Washington bedroom community minutes from Dulles International Airport. No matter the circumstances, we condemn such violence in the strongest terms possible," David Mariner, executive director of the DC Center for the LGBT Community said on a note posted on the center's door. The Washington Post quoted Allan P. Chan, a former George Mason student, as saying he lifted weights and socialized with Corkins. Chan said Corkins was secretive and somewhat odd, and displayed an intense interest in the 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, according to the Post. Mental health evaluation ordered Prosecutors said they are still investigating the motive behind the shooting, and the motive could determine whether Corkins is charged with domestic terrorism or hate crimes.
