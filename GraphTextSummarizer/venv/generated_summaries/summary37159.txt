Kentucky When it comes to Democratic candidates setting up a sharp divide with Obama, Kentucky candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes has been one of the most visible, even pointing out in a recent ad, by saying "I'm not Barack Obama." , President Barack Obama is a gift that keeps on giving when it comes to campaign fodder to use against Democrats. But Sen. Mitch McConnell's ad released Friday looks to paint a different picture: "Alison Grimes says this election is not about her support for Barack Obama and his failed policies," the ad's narrator says, before playing the clip of Grimes stating she's not the President. The ad cuts to Obama's quote from Thursday, and then ties him to independent candidate Greg Orman, painting him as a Democrat. A line from Obama's economic speech on Thursday is giving Republicans more material to continue slamming their opponents as Obama surrogates.
