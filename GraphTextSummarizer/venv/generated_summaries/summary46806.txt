In neighboring Pakistan, heavy rains have continued over the past few days, causing flooding from the main rivers of that region. The Jehlum and Chenab rivers in northern Pakistan have seen water levels rise by as much as 18 feet, turning parts of their courses into lakes as much 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide. The focus of the Indian relief effort will remain on Srinagar and areas of south Kashmir because of the number of people still stranded without food and water, Lt. Gen. D. S. Hooda, chief of the Indian Army's Northern Command, said at a news conference. Western regions of the subcontinent have usually seen the last of rains by early September, but the Indian Meteorological Department forecast "heavy to very heavy rainfall" in a number of states over the next few days. -- A huge relief operation is continuing across northern India and into Pakistan amid devastating floods that have killed hundreds of people and left tens of thousands more stranded.
