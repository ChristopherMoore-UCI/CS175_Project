"There's no question that Chinese have the appetite and the deep pockets for a thriving yacht culture," says Traugott Kaminski, China CEO for upmarket yacht firm Sunseeker -- which was one of the first to enter the then almost non-existent market back in 2003. He argues that modern yachts need modern marinas, with properly trained staff -- "But who wants to invest millions in a high-tech marina," he asks, "only to find out that you have to rebuild the whole thing because of an obscure regulation?" A 42% tax on imports of foreign yachts is also proving prohibitive, he says. She says trailblazing Chinese trend setters will need to take up yachting before it really takes off. Chinese people don't like beaches much, they don't like the sun This compares to 17 million privately owned recreational boats in the United States, the world's biggest yacht market, according to industry publication International Boating Industry.
