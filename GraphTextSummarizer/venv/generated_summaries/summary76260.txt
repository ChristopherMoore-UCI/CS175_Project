President Barack Obama took veiled shots at governors who are mandating quarantines for health workers returning to the United States after treating Ebola patients Tuesday. A Pentagon spokeswoman said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is reviewing the Army's move and "will have a decision soon" on whether it will be extended to other branches of the military. Obama, though, said he has no problem with members of the military facing different policies than the general public because their service in West Africa, at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, isn't voluntary. " Christie, though, pointed to the discrepancy between how health workers and military members are being treated as he defended himself in an NBC interview Tuesday morning. Without mentioning them by name, Obama criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and others for the quarantines they've imposed for health workers, saying they "aren't based on science and best practices" and calling them "another barrier on somebody who's already doing really important work on our behalf.
