-- One week after 11-year-old Celina Cass was last seen, her body was found Monday by divers searching the Connecticut River, New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said. "We have brought Celina home, not the way we wanted to bring her home," Young said early Monday evening. " An autopsy will be conducted on Celina's body on Tuesday morning in Concord, New Hampshire, said Young. Celina's body was found around 10:30 a.m. Monday by divers from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department near a hydroelectric plant outside West Stewartstown, New Hampshire, according to the attorney general's office. On Monday night, the father thanked all those authorities and residents who had put their time and effort into finding Celina.
