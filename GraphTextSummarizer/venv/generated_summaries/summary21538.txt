"Nobody would have thought that Italy-France would be a last-ditch match," said Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, whose penalty save against Romania kept his country's slim hopes of making the last eight alive. "Before the European Championship, this was supposed to be the biggest match of the group." Either Italy and France could advance if they win and Romania are beaten or held to a draw by the Dutch. -- World champions Italy meet France Tuesday at Euro 2008 in a rematch of the 2006 World Cup final and the 2002 European Championship final -- For us, this is already a final," said Donadoni, who replaced Italy's World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi following Italy's win on penalties over France two years ago. Should Romania beat the Netherlands -- who are expected to rest key players having already qualified for the quarterfinals -- in the group's other match in Berne both sides face elimination regardless of the result.
