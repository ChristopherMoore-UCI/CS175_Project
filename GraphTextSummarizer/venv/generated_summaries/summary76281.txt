Greenberg had petitioned the Cubs to let him come back for one official at-bat with them, but team officials turned him down. On July 9, 2005, Greenberg stepped up to the plate to pinch-hit for the Cubs, who had just called him up from the minors, at Miami's Dolphins Stadium. Greenberg signed a one-day contract with the Marlins on Tuesday afternoon in anticipation of taking a single at-bat in the night's game against the New York Mets. Greenberg, in severe pain, had to leave the game without playing defense and no official at-bat -- it counts only as a plate appearance. Adam only got a couple seconds." Liston, who didn't know Greenberg but recalled seeing the plate appearance on TV, decided he wanted to help him get a proper MLB at-bat.
