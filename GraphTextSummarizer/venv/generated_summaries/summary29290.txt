About 30 roofs collapsed from Thursday night into Friday morning, Erie County Deputy Executive Richard Tobe said. Erie County crews have had to deal with clearing 1,800 lane-miles of county roads before getting to residential streets, Poloncarz said Friday. Erie County officials aren't taking any chances. Some roofs already have crumbled, but rain may collapse more, in part because the already heavy snow perched atop buildings will soak up this weekend's rain before it melts, Erie County officials have said. The National Weather Service says flood-prone areas will be inundated, but warns there will be general flooding, too. "(We) expect 5 to 6 feet of water in some areas in a short period of time," Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said.
