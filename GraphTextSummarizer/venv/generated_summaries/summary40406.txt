Family members say Hamza got separated from his father in the chaos during demonstrations around Daraa, when protesters marched on the city to break the Syrian military siege and force the delivery of important supplies, such as medicine and milk for babies. Syrian state TV recently ran a segment in which a person identified as the medical examiner in the case said the body's injuries were sustained when Hamza was alive, but there was no evidence on the surface of the body that the boy had been subjected to torture, violence or retaliation. Tamer was at the same demonstration Hamza attended, according to activists. Several weeks ago, the family received Hamza's body. -- A second Syrian teenager has been returned to his parents -- lifeless, battered and, according to activists, a victim of torture.
