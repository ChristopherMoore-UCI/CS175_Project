McCain: Ashton Carter won't be heard at W.H. Drawing often from neoconservative Sen. John McCain, Cruz laid out a foreign policy focused on reasserting U.S. power and values in the world and "resolutely defending" U.S. national security. The Texas Republican, who is considering a 2016 run in hopes of heading his own White House administration, called the unusually high turnover at the helm of the Defense Department emblematic of a White House that puts politics above U.S. national security. Sen. Ted Cruz slammed the White House on Tuesday for a "failure of leadership" as President Barack Obama prepares to nominate his administration's fourth defense secretary. "At a time when the threats are this grave, we shouldn't see turnover at the Defense Department than one has at a typical Burger King." Cruz said he did not know Ashton Carter, the former No. 2 man at the Pentagon who is expected to be Obama's nominee to succeed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but Cruz said he looks forward to learning more about Carter and his "good reputation." " Cruz also mocked the Obama administration's failed "reset" with Russia and repeated his claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a "KGB thug," criticizing Obama's response to Russian military action in Crimea with disbelief.
