Steve Ballmer: From screaming Microsoft exec to LA Clippers owner? Referring to NBA commissioner, Sterling added, "I believe that Adam Silver acted in haste by illegally ordering the forced sale of the Clippers, banning me for life from the NBA and imposing the fine. ... Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is withdrawing his support for the sale of his team and is asking his lawyer to go ahead with a $1 billion lawsuit against the NBA. Sterling's estranged wife and co-owner of team, Shelly, agreed to sell the franchise to Ballmer. In late May, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer laid down a $2 billion offer to buy the Clippers.
