In its latest comedic production, an amateur cast of activists, civilians and Free Syria Army rebels dressed like cavemen and mocked the inaction of the international community in a video called "Kafranbel: The Syrian Revolution in Three Minutes." "I thought it would be good to use cavemen because of the language. We need to send a message to the world that we are human and we want to live," said Raed Fares, head of the opposition Kafr Nabl media center. "Something was very wrong with (President Barack) Obama's actions that he will strike Assad just to get rid of chemical weapons. In the first two scenes, the cavemen demonstrate against al-Assad only to be killed first by gunfire then by TNT, but when the oppressors fire chemical weapons, previously uninterested bystanders representing the international community intervene to confiscate the gas. In the final scene, the killing continues sans chemical weapons and with approving thumps from the international community.
