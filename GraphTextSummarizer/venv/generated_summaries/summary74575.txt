The easiest way is to effect change is to pledge to collectively put aside partisan politics and vote only for candidates in the 2014 primaries and general election who run on a platform of going to Congress to work in a bipartisan manner for our common good. Even in 2012, when Congress was riding "high" with an abysmal 18% approval rating, did we see many members of Congress booted? The Constitution only provides one procedure to remove members of Congress. In fact, 90% of the members of Congress who sought re-election in 2012 won. Because all I can say is -- If you do know people who actually believe Congress is doing a good job, please watch over them carefully.
