Camel milk is lower in fat and higher in Vitamin C than cow's milk, according to scientists. In a Dubai cafÃ©, patrons sip camel-milk lattes, camel-ccinos and shakes made with camel milk. There's also camel-milk cheese and "Camelicious" -- bottled camel milk sold in supermarkets and sometimes flavored with date or chocolate. The farm has thousands of camels, each producing around six liters of milk a day, but demand is so high they are struggling to keep up. The newly opened Cafe2Go is one of the first to put camel milk on its menu and it seems to be passing the taste test with intrigued customers.
