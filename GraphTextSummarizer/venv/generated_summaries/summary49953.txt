Now it is pancaked, reduced to a third of its height and a mess of rubble and reinforced steel. There is a mobile government field hospital here, and those treated wait listlessly outside, a collection of crushed hands, broken legs, strapped ankles. Six bodies had already been pulled from the concrete and steel wreckage. People bring in fresh fruit, and there are water sellers -- although clean bottled water is becoming hard to to find. Metal bleacher-style seating has been set up, with dozens of people sitting, waiting, makeshift blue tarp tents pitched underneath.
