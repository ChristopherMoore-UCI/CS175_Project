" Kim believes the North Koreans try to jam their radio signal into North Korea, and says the North Koreans have called him a traitor. But the founder of Free North Korea Radio, Kim Seong Min, believes that more and more North Koreans are secretly tuning in. Though funding is sometimes a struggle, they believe that the broadcast is vital to North Korea because the South Korean government stopped its own radio broadcasts into the country under the "Sunshine Policy" instituted by former President Kim Dae Jung in 1988. He believes that the work he does at FNK radio is helping other North Koreans hear the truth about the world. In 1996, Kim says he made a perilous escape by crossing the North Korean-Chinese border, only to be caught by North Korean soldiers while trying to board a ship to South Korea.
