Abused but alive: Lessons from survivors All too often, information is not provided to victims suffering a missing loved one in the onset, such as where to file the report and what agencies can provide support services and help with advocacy and on-the-ground services. The sense of urgency and hitting the ground running from the start could be the difference in many missing person cases. We should urge all communities to play an integral part in assisting law enforcement in investigations about missing persons. There's no doubt that trying to find missing persons requires a tremendous amount of work. Many missing persons who have been missing for a long time are still not found.
