-- Hundreds of Indonesian police officers charged into a prison in Bali on Wednesday to subdue rioting inmates who had set a building on fire and thrown stones at firefighters. The police arrived at Kerobokan Prison late Tuesday to ensure that no prisoners escaped during the rioting, said Ketut Untung Sayoga, the deputy chief of police in Bali, but did not enter the facility until daylight broke Wednesday. Kerobokan Prison is in southern Bali, a few kilometers from Denpasar Airport and the popular tourist area of Kuta. The 12 Australians in the prison were unharmed, said Ray Marcelo, a public affairs official at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. Three inmates were wounded, one of them shot in the leg by a rubber bullet, Sayoga said.
