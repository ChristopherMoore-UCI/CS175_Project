-- As many as 32 tourists who were trapped in South Africa's Kruger National Park after torrential rains and flooding have been rescued, park officials said Thursday. David Mabunda, the chief executive of South African National Parks, flew over the park Thursday to witness the extent of the damage. Kruger National Park, South Africa's flagship big-game park and a top destination of foreign tourists, was established in 1898. Visitors already in the park were "urged to exercise caution around rivers as crocodiles are likely to be in flat areas," according to a statement on the South African National Parks website. Barring a few tents, there has been limited damage to the tourism facilities," he said.
