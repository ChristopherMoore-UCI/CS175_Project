The final result is a collection of diverse images ranging from intimate portraits to eye-catching landscapes that provide an insight into the complex changes that are currently underway in Rwanda -- snapshots of the rising capital Kigali, where new buildings pop up and assertive women take a leading role in urban commercial life, are accompanied by scenes of rural life, where poverty and hardship endure. To address this, a new exhibition opens Friday in London, showcasing insightful snapshots of daily life in today's Rwanda as seen through the eyes of local photographers. "Rwanda In Photographs: Death Then, Life Now" is presented by the Cultural Institute at King's at the Inigo Rooms, Somerset House East Wing, London from 21st March -- 30th April . The exhibition features arresting images by more than 10 professional and amateur photographers who back in November took part in an eight-day workshop led by the prominent Nigerian photographer Andrew Esiebo and the Kenya-based American photojournalist Brendan Bannon. The exhibition also features "Returnees," a series of portraits taken by Esiebo capturing Rwandans from all walks of life who've come back to help in the redevelopment of their country.
