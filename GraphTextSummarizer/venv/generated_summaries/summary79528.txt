Kevin Kilbane, a former Republic of Ireland international who played with Everton in the English Premier League, reported West Ham supporters to the English Football Association for derogatory chants against Tottenham's Harry Kane during Sunday's game. In another incident on Sunday a group of men -- thought to be West Ham fans -- were filmed chanting anti-Semitic abuse on a train in North London. "The club emailed every supporter who had bought a ticket to Sunday's game to remind them that they were acting as ambassadors for West Ham United" a West Ham spokesman said Monday. Kilbane was told about the chants by Andy Merriman -- a Tottenham season-ticket holder whose daughter lives with Down's syndrome. Kilbane's daughter Elsie has the same condition and he is a patron of the Down's Syndrome Association.
