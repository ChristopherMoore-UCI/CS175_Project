"The judicial officer determined that due to the player's failure to attend the hearing he would adjourn the case to an appropriate time when he would face the charges against him," tournament organizers Rugby World Cup Limited (RWCL) said in a statement. The center was summoned after criticizing referee Nigel Owen on social networking site Twitter following Samoa's 13-5 defeat to South Africa on Friday which ended the Pacific Islanders' participation at the 2011 Rugby World Cup. "Pending the holding of such a hearing, he ordered that Mr. Fuimaono Sapolu be provisionally suspended from all participation in the game of rugby union." Fuimaono-Sapolu had received a warning for a similar outburst earlier in the World Cup. The hooker was handed the sanction after admitting that he gouged the eye of Ireland prop Cian Healy during Sunday's match in Dunedin. Meanwhile, Italy forward Leonardo Ghiraldini has been banned for 15 weeks for foul play during the Azzurri's 36-6 reverse against Pool C winners Ireland.
