"We are staying in order to be remembered, for Ukraine to be remembered as the state which sent a unified team," Ukraine Paralympic Committee president Valeriy Suskevich told reporters in Sochi. -- Ukraine will compete at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games in Russia in order to promote peace between the two nations, the head of its Paralympic Committee said, although only one of the country's athletes attended Friday's opening ceremony. It had sparked fears Ukraine would boycott the 2014 Paralympic Games, which run from March 7-16, but the 23-strong team will now compete under its own flag. " Ukraine's decision to remain in Sochi and participate in the Games was welcomed by International Paralympic Committee (IPC) chairman Philip Craven. "We are delighted as we want sport to prevail and a full complement of teams to compete in what we are confident will be a fantastic Paralympic Winter Games," Craven said in a statement.
