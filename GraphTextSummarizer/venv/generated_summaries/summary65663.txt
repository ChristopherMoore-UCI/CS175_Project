-- Three of the best-loved leaders in the history of the Roman Catholic church will be united this weekend when Pope Francis makes his predecessors, Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II, saints in a special ceremony in St Peter's Square. John XXIII, already 76 when he was elected pope after a long career as a priest, professor and Vatican diplomat, had been expected to serve merely as a "papa di passaggio," or interim, caretaker Pope. Experts say that in recognizing the two men together, Francis may be looking to heal a long-term rift in the church, dating back to Vatican II, that ground-breaking conference of church leaders set up by John XXIII. But instead, 100 days into his reign he took the surprising -- and courageous -- decision to try to shake up the church, calling for the Second Vatican Council (better known as Vatican II), which he hoped would modernize Roman Catholicism, bring unity and improve its relations with other faiths. John XXIII (1881-1963) -- known as Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli before he became Pope -- was one of 13 children born into a family of Italian peasants, farmers from a tiny village in the country's north, before being sent away to study for the priesthood at the age of 11.
