Obama, Harper differences over Keystone pipeline on display at summit A recent State Department environmental report concluded that building the pipeline would have little impact on overall carbon emissions from tar sands oil. "Tar sands oil is very difficult to clean up when a spill occurs, and a 2010 tar sands pipeline spill into the Kalamazoo River still has not been resolved." They also cited "significantly higher levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens" downwind from tar sand refineries, with people living those areas "suffering higher rates of the types of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals, including leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma." Oil companies invested billions in tar sands complexes to extract and refine the Canadian bitumen, and now want to cash in with increased production to meet both the U.S. and export demand. "This single project will inject billions of dollars into Louisiana and national economies and reduce our dependence on oil from hostile countries," said Landrieu, whose state has major oil production facilities. U.S. report on Keystone indicates little climate impact Environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17% more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production.
