President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, dressed in a flowing blue gown, welcomed Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his wife at the White House steps as a military honor guard saluted and media cameras clicked and whirred. Guests dined on jicama and fruit in a citrus vinaigrette and ceviche of Hawaiian opah, followed by Oregon beef in Oaxacan black mole with black bean tamalon and grilled green beans. The more than 200 invited guests, including diplomats, White House officials and celebrities, including actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Eva Longoria-Parker, arrived through a separate entrance for the Mexican-themed dinner and musical performances. After the meal, the diners will move into a tent erected on the South Lawn to be joined by additional guests for performances by pop star Beyonce and Mexican performers Rodrigo y Gabriela, along with the President's Own United States Marine Band. He concluded by responding to Obama's reference to Mexican poet Octavio Paz's sentiment that people must deserve their dreams.
