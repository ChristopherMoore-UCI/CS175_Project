The 20, 40, 40A, 42 and 62 buses from Waikiki all make stops at Pearl Harbor; the ride takes about an hour. To get to the Dole Plantation, take bus 8, 19, 20, 47 or 58 from Waikiki and transfer onto the 52 at Ala Moana Shopping Center; ride time is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. To sample some of the best short ribs on the island, visit another family-run local favorite, Helena's Hawaiian Food, which has been around since 1946 and was featured on the Travel Channel's "Man v. Food." The north side of Oahu is less developed as a tourist destination than the south side where Waikiki is, so it's not unusual for the beach to be empty (though don't be surprised to see a sea turtle napping on the shore).
