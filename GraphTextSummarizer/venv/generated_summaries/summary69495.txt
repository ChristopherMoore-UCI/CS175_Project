Romney shifts spotlight to McConnell -- Former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney dodged questions again on whether he'd consider mounting a third bid for the White House in an interview Monday, singling out another former governor instead. Mark Halperin, co-host of Bloomberg's "With All Due Respect," asked Romney in an interview Monday night. While viewers didn't learn anything new about Romney's plans, they did get another peek into Romney's personal side -- which has emerged more and more from the guarded image of Romney that voters were exposed to two years ago. In an evolution from his stiff, buttoned-up demeanor that was often lampooned during his previous White House runs, Romney dished in the interview on his favorite television show, his grandchildren and even a leg massage.
