The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid "to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student," said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey. The roommate of the Rutgers University freshman who killed himself after his sexual encounter with another man was broadcast online was indicted Wednesday on privacy and bias charges, the prosecutor of Middlesex County in New Jersey announced. Clementi's body was recovered from the Hudson River on September 30, more than a week after he jumped from the George Washington Bridge, which spans the Hudson River separating New York from New Jersey. In October, less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Barack Obama released a taped video message condemning such acts. "The grand jury indictment spells out cold and calculated acts against our son Tyler by his former college roommate," Clementi's family said in a statement Wednesday.
