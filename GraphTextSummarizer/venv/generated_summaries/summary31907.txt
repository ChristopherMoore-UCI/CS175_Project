Last year New York Observer film critic Rex Reed referred to McCarthy as a "female hippo" while panning her film "Identity Thief," which co-starred Jason Bateman. The Daily Mail reports that promotional posters for the film, which stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, appear to have been altered to slim McCarthy's face. McCarthy's neck in the poster also appears slimmer than in real life. I have helped people try to lose weight, and I don't find this to be the subject of a lot of humor," Reed told WOR-AM radio in New York. Kelly's piece, which was inspired by a CNN article "Weight is a big deal for TV, movie characters," led to thousands of complaints from Marie Claire website readers.
