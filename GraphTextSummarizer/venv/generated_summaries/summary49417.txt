Geraghty said FAA regulations approved for manned aircraft did not apply to unmanned aircraft any more than they applied to paper airplanes or balsa wood planes. In a press release headlined "Busting Myths about the FAA and Unmanned Aircraft," it stressed that UAS enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes. But the decision confounded the FAA, which as recently as last week had publicized its restrictions on commercial use of drones. "Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft-manned or unmanned-in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval." "There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations," the FAA continued.
