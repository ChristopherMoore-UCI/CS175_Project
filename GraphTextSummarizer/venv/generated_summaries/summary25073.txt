Treat your Democrats well: President Obama has not taken enough care of Democrats on Capitol Hill. Obama needs to remember that his fate is closely tied to the Democrats on Capitol Hill -- Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi should be his best friends -- and he needs them to help him in his struggles with Republicans. The dangers of President Obama's approach became apparent with the rollout of health care reform, in which the president and his team were not on top of the details of implementation in the weeks leading up to the launch of the website, and they allowed technical mistakes to turn into a huge political fiasco. -- As millions of Americans think about how they can do better in 2014 through their New Year resolutions, President Obama might want to make a few of his own. Sweat the small stuff: There is considerable evidence that President Obama seems uninterested with detail.
