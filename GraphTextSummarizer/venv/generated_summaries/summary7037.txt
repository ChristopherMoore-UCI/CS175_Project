Vargas was detained Tuesday morning at the McAllen airport while trying to pass through security en route to Los Angeles, said Ryan Eller, campaign director for Define American, a group Vargas founded in 2011. Vargas, Define American and other groups traveled to McAllen to "stand in solidarity with and humanize the stories of the children and families fleeing the most dangerous regions of Central America," Eller told reporters Tuesday. "Mr. Vargas has not previously been arrested by (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement) nor has the agency ever issued a detainer on him or encountered him," the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday. Early Tuesday, Vargas tweeted that he was about to go through security at McAllen-Miller International Airport. On Tuesday, U.S. Border Patrol agents detained the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist in McAllen, Texas, after he told them he was in the country illegally, officials said.
