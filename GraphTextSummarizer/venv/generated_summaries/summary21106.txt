This somewhat awkward looking vehicle is the work of German company e-volo and a prototype has just made its first manned flight, after completing unmanned trials. With e-volo's Thomas Senkel strapped into the center of its four-limbed frame, it flew for one minute and 30 seconds over a field in Southern Germany, powered by 16 small rotor blades. "It could go longer," said e-volo's Alexander Zosel. Although there's plenty of development work left to do, e-volo believes the vehicle could one day be have a variety of uses, including an air taxi. E-volo says its creation is powered entirely by lithium batteries and can carry a load of around 80kg -- about as much as it weighs.
