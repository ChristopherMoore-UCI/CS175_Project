Headed by Raphael Botsyo Nkegbe and his protÃ©gÃ©, Maclean Atsu Dzidienyo -- both internationally recognized wheelchair racers -- the academy aims to educate Ghana's disabled community, and nurture their talent for sport. Today, he is a professional body builder who also owns his own gym. "With the gym, I love it when people see me with my disability training able-bodied people," says Narh Teye, who is now training himself for the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Ghana isn't the easiest place for people with disabilities. One of the leading spokesmen for Ghana's physically challenged is Charles Narh Teye, one of a handful of Ghanaian para-athletes who competed in the London 2012 Paralympics. "Unfortunately, we associate disability with all manner of negative influences: with witchcraft, with the devil, with bad karma," explains Max Vardon, who formerly headed Ghana's National Council on Persons with Disabilities.
