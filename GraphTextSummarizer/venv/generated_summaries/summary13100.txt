Most of the public is unaware that relapse rates for all the substance use disorders are about the same as relapse rates for other chronic illnesses such as hypertension, asthma or diabetes, or that there are approximately 20 million individuals who are in stable, long-term (a year or more) recovery. This brain jolt results in a compelling desire in a person to repeat an experience, which then leads to signs of addiction: loss of control over use or the inability to temper use once started. What makes substance abuse hard to combat is the fact that addiction plays such a central role. Despite the prevalence of substance abuse, addiction remains widely misunderstood and misrepresented. More importantly, substance addiction is largely affected by genetic heritability.
