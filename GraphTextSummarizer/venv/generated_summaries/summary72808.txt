Arsenal defeated West Brom 1-0 with a goal from summer signing Samir Nasri to follow up last Wednesday's 2-0 victory against Dutch side Twente in the first leg of their Champions League third-round qualifier. -- Striker Emmanuel Adebayor has committed himself to Arsenal by signing a new contract with the English Premier League club. Emmanuel Adebayor has been a big success since joining Arsenal from French club Monaco. However, fans started to turn on him during pre-season as it became apparent that he would not turn down a move away from Arsenal, and he was again booed by sections of the crowd during Saturday's Premier League opener against West Brom. " "Arsenal can confirm that Togolese forward Emmanuel Adebayor has signed a new long-term contract with the club," read a statement on the club's Web site on Monday.
