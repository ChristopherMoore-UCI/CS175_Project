Thieves have stolen eight shoes belonging to Holocaust victims from a museum in Poland, the latest in a series of thefts targeting memorials to those killed in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. The concentration camp in Lublin, popularly known as Majdanek, housed Jews from Poland and across occupied Europe, as well as Soviet prisoners of war and political prisoners from Poland. The museum displays 280,000 shoes belonging to Holocaust victims in a former barracks building on the grounds of the former concentration camp. The famous "Arbeit Macht Frei" sign at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland also was stolen in 2009. It comes less than a month after an iron gate with the notorious Nazi slogan "Arbeit Macht Frei," which translates to "work sets you free," was stolen from the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany.
