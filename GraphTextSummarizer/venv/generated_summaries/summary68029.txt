The Connecticut Democrat, who has been a sharp critic of the NFL's handling of domestic violence issues, said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's leadership has been "completely lacking," adding that it should not require recorded evidence to punish someone for abuse. Blumenthal said he won't "rule out" Congressional involvement to pressure the NFL to alter its "deep-seated fundamental far-reaching problem" involving domestic abuse. For Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Ravens' firing of running back Ray Rice on Monday doesn't come close to addressing how the NFL deals with domestic violence. As football season finished its opening weekend, Congress pounced on a variety of issues in addition to domestic abuse. The NFL's lobbying activity spiked after 2006 to more than $1 million per year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
