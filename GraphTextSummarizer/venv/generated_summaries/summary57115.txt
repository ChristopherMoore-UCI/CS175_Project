U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Egypt had a critical role to play in countering extremism, as he met with Egyptian leaders in his latest effort to build regional support for President Barack Obama's strategy to combat ISIS. Kerry also spoke of the need for international partners to support the new government in Iraq, not only militarily but with humanitarian aid, addressing illicit funding stream reaching ISIS and stopping the flow of foreign fighters. Kerry said efforts to move forward the coalition against ISIS would continue Monday in Paris, where France is hosting an international conference on the crisis in Iraq. As Iraq needs strong air support from its allies to confront ISIS, French President Francois Hollande promised Iraq's new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that France "will participate in efforts to hit terrorist locations in Iraq," al-Abadi told reporters in Baghdad Friday. U.S. forces have already carried out more than 150 air strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq.
