Three of the victims were Seton Hall students, one a New Jersey Institute of Technology student, and a New York resident, Cordero said. Area police and college officials pledged to work around the clock to solve what East Orange Police Director Jose Cordero called a "horrific" crime. Counseling services are being offered to Seton Hall students. "The shooter picked the wrong city to do this crime," said East Orange Mayor Robert L. Bowser. The incident occurred in East Orange -- about a mile from the Seton Hall campus -- at 12:17 a.m. Saturday during a party at a private residence, officials said.
