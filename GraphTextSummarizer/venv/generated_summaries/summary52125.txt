Have your say below Laura's parents are happy about Friday's decision, family lawyer Peter de Lange said. Laura Dekker's parents support her round-the-world ambition, which sparked concern from child protection officials because of her age. He said he doesn't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventure. Laura Dekker will find out on Friday whether the Dutch Court will back her record attempt. Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said.
