Zackary Trissell of Oklahoma's Air National Guard returned home Tuesday from a nine-month deployment at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, but he's been corresponding with his three stepchildren with the help of a cherished childhood toy and a camera. While stationed in Kuwait, Zackary Trissell decided to have a little fun with the toys and started snapping them in full military mode, whether in front of a Humvee or with pilots in a cockpit. "(Matthew) said if he could walk and wasn't in a wheelchair, that he would have joined the military," his mother, Linda Trissell, told CNN affiliate KOCO. Trissell was given three Lego figurines before he left by his stepson Matthew, who has muscular dystrophy. There are countless organizations devoted to sending letters and care packages to troops overseas, but for one deployed airman, it was about sending a little bit of overseas to his kids at home.
