It's an old idea that Obama took on in the second year of his presidency, when he said:  "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism." Indeed, six states have introduced bills to change the framework of AP history courses to emphasize the idea of exceptionalism and downplay aspects of American history that don't seem, well, exceptional. American politicians who dwell on American exceptionalism only dishonor us by suggesting we play dumb to our past. This month, Oklahoma politician Dan Fisher introduced a bill that tried to ban Advanced Placement history classes in his state because the guidelines for teachers didn't talk explicitly about American exceptionalism. Talk of American exceptionalism has become headline news, with loud sputtering from Rudy Giuliani, who suggested that President Barack Obama doesn't love America in the same way that the rest of us do.
