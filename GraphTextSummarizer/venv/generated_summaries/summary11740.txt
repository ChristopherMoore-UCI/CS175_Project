-- Thousands of security officers cracked down on landmark sites in Iran's capital and other major cities Sunday, at times striking at throngs of protesters with batons and rushing others on motorcycles, witnesses said. Security forces on foot and motorcycles there beat several protesters with batons and detained at least four, the witness said. Opposition websites reported that security forces opened fire on protesters in Hafteh Tir Square, killing one person. Roughly 200 people, including men and women of all ages, gathered at the site, but were dispersed by uniformed and plainclothes security agents who hit at protesters with batons. Iranian security forces put up a steel gate in front of the narrow alley that leads to opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's Tehran home, opposition website Kaleme reported.
