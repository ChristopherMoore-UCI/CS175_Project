Televisa previously came under attack August 15 when a grenade damaged apartments near the TV station's office in the city of Monterrey in neighboring Nuevo Leon state. "No journalist is safe in Mexico when criminal groups feel free to wage grenade attacks on a national broadcaster," said Carlos Lauria, the organization's senior program coordinator for the Americas. At least two car bombs exploded Friday near the television studios of Televisa in Ciudad Victoria, the capital of Tamaulipas state in northeastern Mexico, authorities said. Journalists have come under increasing attack in Mexico, as drug cartels try to limit the information being distributed about their activities. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent, nonprofit organization, criticized this month's grenade attacks against Televisa.
