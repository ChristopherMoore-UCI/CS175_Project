State courts have been at odds on whether such non-testimonial evidence is acceptable, particularly in capital cases. In a separate appeal, the justices asked Florida to weigh in with a response from an appeal by death row inmate Joseph Smith. The Ohio case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had successfully prevented Richland County Common Pleas Judge James DeWeese from posting another copy of the Ten Commandments. The high court had rejected an earlier appeal from Smith in June, but the inmate filed another federal claim, saying his right to confront witnesses at trial was violated when prosecutors introduced DNA evidence implicating him. Smith was later convicted and sentenced to death.
