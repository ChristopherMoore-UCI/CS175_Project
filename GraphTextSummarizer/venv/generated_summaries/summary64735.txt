In 2013, Posey appeared in "Scary Movie 5," and he will next be seen in the comedy "Taco Shop," according to Internet Movie Database. Since being cast as Lopez's son, Posey has worked steadily. It seems like only yesterday Tyler Posey was a child actor playing Jennifer's Lopez's son in the 2002 film "Maid in Manhattan." "I know we haven't seen each other since 'Maid In Manhattan' forever ago, but I thought that if you needed a backup dancer, I'd fit," Posey said before breaking into some dance moves. The "Teen Wolf" star co-hosted the awards show and ran onstage just as Lopez was about to present an award.
