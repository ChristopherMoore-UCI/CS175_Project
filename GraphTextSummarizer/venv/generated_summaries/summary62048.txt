"Collective bargaining is a fiscal matter," said Walker, who toured multiple state districts Friday in an effort to pressure the absentee lawmakers. At a Thursday night news conference, Walker said if the Legislature does not pass his budget bill, state aid to local governments could be cut, brushing off critics who said the legislation will destroy public employee unions in the state. Tensions simmered in Wisconsin as a political stalemate continued Friday after the state's Assembly passed a Republican bill that would strip most state workers of the bulk of their collective-bargaining rights. "The vote we took wasn't the easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do," Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder, a Republican, said early Friday. The confrontation reached a fever pitch after Walker was recorded during a prank phone call discussing the idea of duping absentee Democrats by luring them back to "talk, not negotiate," allow them to recess and then have the 19 Republican senators declare a quorum.
