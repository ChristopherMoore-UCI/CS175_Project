Nigeria won Group F after beating second-placed Malawi 2-0 at Calabar, while on Friday Ghana also qualified -- joining Algeria, Egypt and Ivory Coast in the five two-leg playoffs to be held in October and November. The Americans, meanwhile, dropped to second place after losing 3-1 against Costa Rica, despite Clint Dempsey scoring on his 100th international appearance. The reverse, just Mexico's second in 77 qualifying matches at Estadio Azteca, left the Olympic champion in fourth place in the CONCACAF group and struggling to earn an automatic place at the showpiece tournament in Brazil next year. Only the top three teams have direct qualification -- the fourth finisher must play Oceania winner New Zealand in a playoff. South Africa, the 2010 World Cup host, failed to make the final round of qualifying despite finishing its Group A campaign in second after a 4-1 win over Botswana.
