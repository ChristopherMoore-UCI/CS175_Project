Rain began to fall about lunchtime, with one gauge registering about 5 to 6 inches about mid-afternoon, said Jennifer Frost, spokeswoman for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. Charlotte received 3 inches of rain, with more in some places, said city fire department spokesman Capt. CNN's Dave Alsup, Joe Sutton and Michael Martinez contributed to this report. One hotel lobby interior was turned into a waterfall as heavy rain accumulated on the roof and poured through light fixtures, collapsing a desktop-size section of the ceiling, according to one hotel visitor who shared his video of the spectacle with CNN. Authorities and responders were carrying out at least 16 rescues of people trapped in flooded vehicles, Brisley said.
