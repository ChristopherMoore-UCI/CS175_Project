We have a long history of aggressively policing communities of color in America. As has always been true of the war on drugs, the battlegrounds are disproportionately in communities of color. This deliberate strategy explains why almost 80% of the paramilitary raids we studied were to search homes (usually for drugs); why SWAT teams forced their way into people's homes using military equipment like battering rams 60% of the time; and why they were 14 times more likely to deploy flash-bang grenades, originally invented to ambush wartime enemies, in drug raids than during SWAT raids for other purposes. Cutting this funding is part of a larger recognition that aggressively fighting the war on drugs has failed to abate drug use and instead done incredible damage to communities. And just has been true for decades, our police's most aggressive tactics are doing disproportionate damage to communities of color.
