Sarah Smiley won't reveal the identities of future guests to the public, but she drops hints on their Facebook page. So, now the Smileys each take a turn inviting a special guest to dinner every week for 52 weeks until dad returns. The robot projected a video of deployed Navy pilot Dustin Smiley, father to Ford, Owen, and Lindell. The standing rule is one special guest per dinner (the invited guest gets a "plus one"), but when it comes to the highest office in the land, the kids will make a few concessions. In the video, Dustin Smiley told his family that he loved them and implored his boys to congratulate their mother on her graduation from a master's program at the University of Maine.
