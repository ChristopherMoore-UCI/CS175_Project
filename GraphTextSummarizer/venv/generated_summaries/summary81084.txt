-- NATO troops in Afghanistan have been ordered to halt some joint operations with Afghan security forces after a spate of attacks by their local allies and amid fallout from a controversial anti-Islam video. The halt in some joint operations with Afghan forces comes weeks after U.S. Special Operations forces suspended the training of some Afghan Local Police recruits while it double-checks the background of the current police force. Over the weekend, four Americans and two British troops were gunned down in attacks believed to involve Afghan police. "Green-on-blue" refers to a color coding system used by the military, in which blue refers to the friendly force and green refers to allied forces. British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, meanwhile, insisted Tuesday that, "There has been no change of policy in Afghanistan" for British forces.
