But not so fast: News organizations wouldn't necessarily be getting all, or even most, of the ad dollars from news apps. They're hoping news apps might help save the ad-supported news business, perhaps even help keep traditional print newspapers and broadcast news operations afloat. But if a boom in mobile advertising ends up mainly benefiting national and global advertisers, ad networks and news outlets, then more people will keep getting less and less access to local news -- with potentially profound effects on communities. Localytics' data implies that smartphone and tablet apps for news could indeed offer an advantage to mobile advertisers. New research from Localytics shows that mobile users spend roughly the same amount of time with news apps as they do with Twitter's mobile app, about 115 minutes per month.
