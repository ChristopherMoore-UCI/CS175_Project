"To the extent that this proposed law would ban the display of products to adult tobacco consumers, we believe it goes too far." New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas A. Farley said smoking rates among New York's young people have remained flat since 2007. It's just the latest in a string of New York health initiatives blamed by some for eroding personal freedoms and contributing to a so-called nanny-state. After naming tall sugary drinks Public Enemy No. 1, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday unveiled another public health initiative. In 2011, Bloomberg signed a bill banning smoking in many other public places, including New York City parks and public beaches. The bill would increase penalties for retailers who sell tobacco without a license or fail to pay tobacco taxes.
