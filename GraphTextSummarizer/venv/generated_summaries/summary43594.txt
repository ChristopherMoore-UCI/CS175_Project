Monroe County, Florida, which encompasses the Keys, canceled schools Wednesday as bands of thunderstorms with frequent lightning moved through, according to a statement from Sunny Booker, safe school coordinator for the county school district. -- Severe weather has damaged more than 50 homes in several Florida towns, officials said, and schools in the Florida Keys were canceled Wednesday because of heavy rain and frequent lightning. Damage assessments were under way in Plantation and Sunrise, Florida, after a suspected tornado swept through south Florida about 10 p.m. Tuesday. "Bands of thunderstorms with frequent lightning are hitting the middle and lower Keys," the statement said. A VFW building was "completely destroyed," with its roof ripped off, said Bill Schobel, spokesman for Martin County Fire and Rescue.
