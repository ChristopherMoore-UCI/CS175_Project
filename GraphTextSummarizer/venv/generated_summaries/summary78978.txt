To his wife Jan, and his family and all his friends and fans that loved him, my sincerest condolences," friend and fellow graphic artist Chris Kinniery said on Facebook. Norman Lee, an artist for DC and Marvel comics, went missing while snorkeling with his wife off the eastern coast of Grand Cayman, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Tributes flooded his Facebook page and Twitter from friends, fans and colleagues who knew him from art school and comic conventions. "It is unlikely that we will make any recovery at this stage," Chief Inspector Brad Ebanks told Cayman 27. Strong currents hindered the search, which lasted until Friday evening, Cayman 27 reported.
