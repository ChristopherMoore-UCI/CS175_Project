Minutes after the initial explosion, gunmen stormed the station and clashes erupted between them and Iraqi security forces, police officials said. In nearby Tikrit, militants stormed the city council building, clashed with Iraqi security forces and occupied the facility for a time, police officials in the city said. In Baghdad, at least 27 people were killed and more than 50 wounded when two car bombs exploded in quick succession near a procession of pilgrims making their way by foot to Karbala for the annual commemoration of the seventh century death of their Imam Hussein, a memorial called the Arbaeen. More than 8,000 people have been killed in Iraq in 2013, according to U.N. figures. Hussein's death led to a split between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.
