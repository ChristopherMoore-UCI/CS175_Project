A circular I saw showed the "new" room service (store brand orange juice and cereal served at home); the "new" personal trainer (using home exercise equipment instead of paying for a gym membership); and the "new" restaurant (eating at home) -- all things that can be pricey, but are now being repositioned on the cheap in an effort to boost sales. I'm not so sure that behavior itself has changed, but this time around, people are trading down in their drink of choice. Store away all your valuables, and make sure you have enough eyeballs on hand to ensure that people don't wander around your home with sticky fingers. Beer drinkers, meanwhile, are skipping expensive and exotic microbrews in favor of cheaper choices. There were 715,000 postings in February -- more than double the amount last year at that time.
