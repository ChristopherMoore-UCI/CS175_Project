Lynch, an Illinois native who got her start in theater at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company and Second City, will appear in the musical for eight weeks only, from May 16 through July 14. "So I am excited and honored to be making my Broadway debut ... and joining the pantheon of women who have taken on the great and irresistible role of wicked Miss Hannigan." Dorothy Loudon won a Tony playing Miss Hannigan (then considered a lead role) in the original 1977 production. The role seems like a perfect fit for the star: Miss Hannigan, the drunken and scheming head of young Annie's orphanage who melodically complains about being surrounded by "little girls." Two-time Tony-winner Katie Finneran, who has played Miss Hannigan since the new revival opened last November, was recently cast as Michael J. Fox's sister in an untitled new NBC sitcom that has a 22-episode commitment for this fall.
