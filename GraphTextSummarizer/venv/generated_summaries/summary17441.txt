-- New York Gov. David Paterson on Friday appointed relatively unknown U.S. Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand to replace Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Senate. Gillibrand, who will become the first upstate senator to represent New York since the late 1960s, is a stranger to most New Yorkers and a fresh face on Capitol Hill. While Gillibrand, 42, will represent one of the most progressive states in the country -- and has garnered solid union support and a 90 percent score from the American Civil Liberties Union -- the former antitrust lawyer and Clinton administration official is no dyed-in-the-wool liberal. Gillibrand succeeds Clinton, who was sworn in Wednesday as secretary of state. "I aspire to follow in her footsteps, knowing her shoes I can only hope to fill," Gillibrand said of Clinton.
