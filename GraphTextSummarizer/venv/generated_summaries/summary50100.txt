Watch Gonzalez make his tearful plea Â» Like many undocumented workers, Gonzalez came to the United States last fall to provide some financial help for his family, who had fallen on hard times back in Guatemala. But as Gonzalez's heart failed him, he opened up the hearts of others. Diagnosed with a chronically weak heart, without much money and lacking resources, Gonzalez seemed bound to die without ever seeing his parents again. Juan Gonzalez was earning $250 a week as a dishwasher when his heart trouble began. Now, after traveling thousands of miles for more than two weeks to make a better life for his family and himself, Gonzalez faces his final fight, but it's one he will face with his family, thanks to the kindness of others.
