Chokonjetsa is one of dozens of newborns in the African country who have survived thanks to the ingenuity of students in a senior design class at Rice University in Houston. "We've found bubble CPAP to be very beneficial in infants with respiratory distress. ... Using aquarium pumps, the students have designed a low-cost version of a breathing device called a bubble CPAP, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, machine. When you blow into the top of the straw, bubbles come out of the bottom of the straw and bubble up. "When lungs are underdeveloped, it's like when you're blowing up a completely deflated balloon and that first breath to inflate the balloon is really difficult," said Dr. Rebecca Richards-Kortum of Rice University, who helped facilitate the design of the students' bubble CPAP machine.
