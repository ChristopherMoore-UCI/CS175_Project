How to tell space rocks apart "Comet ISON belongs to a class of comets called Sungrazing comets," Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab told CNN. "Predicting the behavior of comets is like predicting the behavior of cats -- can't really be done," Don Yeomans of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program told CNN.com in March. " "Comet ISON has the potential to be among the brightest comets of the last 50 years," Dennis Bodewits, an astronomer at University of Maryland at College Park, told NASA. "If Comet ISON splits, it might appear as a 'string of pearls' when viewed through a telescope," Battams told NASA. Comet ISON was discovered by Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok in September 2012.
