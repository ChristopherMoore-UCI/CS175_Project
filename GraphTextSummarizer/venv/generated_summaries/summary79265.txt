In the 2005 film, "Wedding Crashers,"  Jeremy Grey and John Beckwith, played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, brought wedding crashing to the big screen. In it, the band drive from wedding venue to wedding venue, and sneak up on stage that's enclosed by giant curtains. The band is not sure if the grooms "disclosed it to their bride and wedding party. "It was an out of body experience," Levine told People Magazine in a press release. "We are going to drive across L.A. and hit every wedding we possibly can," says frontman Adam Levine as the video starts.
