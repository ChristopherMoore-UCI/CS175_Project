It's really no surprise at all that drugs permeate every level of Mexican society, from religion (yes, there is a patron saint of drug trafficking) to music, and film is by far one of the most naturally gratifying mediums for the fictitious high-flying antics of outlaw traffickers. Today there is a constant flow of B-movie releases featuring drug dealers, good cops, bad cops, women, cocaine and a lot of big trucks. The movement soon turned to action, guns, trucks, cars, explosions, women, and drugs. Narcocorridos, as these types of songs are called, are the musical equivalent of narco cinema, and are often the basis for many popular films. For this installment of the Vice Guide to Film series, VBS co-founder Shane Smith traveled to Texas, Tijuana and Mexico City to immerse himself in the seedy, fast-paced, and vastly prolific and amusing world of films inspired by -- and often funded by -- Mexico's ultraviolent drug cartels, a genre known as narco cinema.
