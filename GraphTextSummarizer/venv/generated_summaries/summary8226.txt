NASA says space station crews normally work on about 200 experiments over six months, but Kelly will be doing many more. Kelly was joking about his twin, former astronaut Mark Kelly (who is also known for being the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords). "Building this facility that allows us to understand how to operate for long periods of time in space to allow us someday to go to Mars. The Kelly brothers' experiments should help NASA understand what happens to astronauts who spend a long time in space and help plan longer spaceflights to an asteroid or to Mars. Despite all the health risks and personal sacrifices, Kelly said there's a big reason to stay in space a year.
