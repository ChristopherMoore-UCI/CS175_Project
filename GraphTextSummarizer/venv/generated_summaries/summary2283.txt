Before the strikes began in Syria, U.S. government officials had barely acknowledged the presence of Khorasan, which formed from former al Qaeda members. The former head of U.S. counterterror operations said Tuesday the "imminent threat" posed by an al Qaeda offshoot in Syria hasn't lessened after a U.S. air campaign there. At the time, senior officials described the threat posed by Khorasan as "imminent." " President Obama announced strikes against Khorasan in September at the same time he began the mission to "degrade and destroy" the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq. While Olsen said foreign fighters present a broad risk to Americans' security, the potential for so-called "lone wolf" attacks by unaffiliated terrorists also worries officials.
