At the presentation, club captain Carles Puyol left it to manager Tito Vilanova and fellow defender Eric Abidal, who have both been absent as they battled cancer this season, to lift the trophy. In Italy's Serie A, a late penalty from Mario Balotelli and the winner from Frenchman Phillipe Mexes gave AC Milan a dramatic 2-1 victory at Siena. The last-gasp win clinched third and the final Champions League spot for Milan, who had fallen behind to a 25th minute goal from Claudio Terzi. If the Catalan giants win their remaining two matches, they will equal the 100 points record total of arch rivals Real Madrid. With Lionel Messi sitting out the rest of the season with a hamstring injury, it was left to Pedro Rodriguez to put Barca ahead in the first half.
