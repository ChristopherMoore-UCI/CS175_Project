The simple fact is that our dependence on oil from nations in the Middle East and other regions constrains our choices, hamstringing America's flexibility and choices on the world stage. Today, thousands of Americans are calling for a new freedom from oil -- a dangerous, dirty and vulnerable source of energy. But for years, we have watched as billions of dollars flowed to hostile nations to pay for oil. It is for that reason, and many more, that the fight for energy independence is being fought here at home, a struggle I hope more Americans will join in support of those who are fighting abroad. In the spirit of the holiday and in light of the tragedy in the Gulf, let us dedicate the next two decades to winning a new battle for American independence -- from oil.
