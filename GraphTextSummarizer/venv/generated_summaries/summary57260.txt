As an adult, she faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for willful desecration of the Quran, Choudhry said Rimsha was accused by a local resident of burning pages of the Muslim holy text after she gathered paper as fuel for cooking in Islamabad, according to the authorities. To back up his argument, Choudhry cited a report on Tuesday by an independent medical board stating that Rimsha was 14. Choudhry says he expects Rimsha's trial to last as long as two years. Choudhry has said that nobody actually saw Rimsha burning the papers. The Pakistani authorities have come under pressure to guarantee the safety of the girl, identified as Rimsha, in a country where people accused of blasphemy have been killed by members of the public in the past.
