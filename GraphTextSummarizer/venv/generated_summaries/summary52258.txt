Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board. -- Technical experts directing the salvage operation aboard the Costa Concordia cruise ship are recommending that the underwater part of the operation be called off because it is becoming too dangerous, Italy's civil protection agency said Tuesday. Gabrielli said that if the ship does not slip into deeper water, it will take at least seven to 10 months to remove the wreckage. Costa has announced it was offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Officials are particularly concerned for divers who are searching submerged areas of the ship amid a sea of debris that includes heavy items and wires, they said Sunday.
