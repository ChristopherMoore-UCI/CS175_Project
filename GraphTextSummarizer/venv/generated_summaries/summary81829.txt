In a statement published Thursday, Netanyahu referred to Grass' comparison between Israel and Iran as "shameful" and argued that it said "little about Israel and much about Mr. Grass." Referring to Grass' past as a member of the Nazi Waffen-SS during World War II, Netanyahu said "it is not surprising" for the poet "to cast the one and only Jewish state as the greatest threat to world peace and to oppose giving Israel the means to defend itself." "It is Iran, not Israel, that is a threat to the peace and security of the world" said Netanyahu, "It is Iran, not Israel, that threatens other states with annihilation." "Grass' poems are an attempt to ignite the flame of hatred against the people and the state of Israel and thereby promote the idea he was publicly a part of when he wore the SS Nazi uniforms," Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai said on Sunday. Published in the German paper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung on Wednesday under the title "What needs to be said," the poem by Gunter Grass accused Israel of planning a preemptive strike against Iran in order to "extinguish the Iranian people."
