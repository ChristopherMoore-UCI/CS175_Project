"If anything had been different, she might not have made it," emergency room doctor Brock Royall told the station. Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot last Saturday. The frantic voices of rescuers can be heard on the body cam video showing the moment baby Lily was found one week ago. Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. A firefighter is seen lifting her tiny body, wrapped in pink, from the red car where Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, lost her life.
