"Ice increases the weight of branches by about 30 times compared to snow," said CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri. It's a little like brittle, it breaks up as you drive on it," said National Weather Service meteorologist Kurt Van Speybroeck said. Icy danger lingers longer, because ice holds on longer than snow, Javaheri said. Most snow gets dirty after a day or two, which makes it absorb more of the sun's rays and melt quicker, Javaheri said. A foot of snow may look big and bad, but it's a bunch of fluff compared to a solid inch of ice.
