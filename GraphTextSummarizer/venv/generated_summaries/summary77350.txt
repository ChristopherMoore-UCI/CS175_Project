Eighteen other workers in the camp escaped the raid, which the Sudanese military blamed on the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North -- a rebel force in the border region with neighboring South Sudan. South Sudan became the world's newest nation last year after decades of conflict with the north. The 29 workers flew out of Sudan aboard a Red Cross plane bound for Nairobi, Kenya, a statement from the ICRC said. Rebels kidnapped the workers January 28 from a camp run by China's Power Construction Corp. in volatile South Kordofan. China is Sudan's largest trading partner, while Sudan is China's third-largest trading partner in Africa.
