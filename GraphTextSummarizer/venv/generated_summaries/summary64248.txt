A drought in the Horn of Africa region straddling Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia has left nearly 12 million people in need of assistance. Aid agencies have urged the international community to ramp up help as thousands flee Somalia each week in search of food and water -- many walking for days in the sweltering sun to refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia. "Urgent humanitarian assistance is crucial to alleviate the impact of the drought, which has deprived people from water, sanitation, health, basic food and nutritional needs," the 54-nation body said in a statement announcing the delay. Relief efforts in Somalia have been hindered by the ongoing battle between Islamist rebels and the transitional government, which holds little sway beyond Mogadishu. Only a handful of African nations have donated to the effort, according to Oxfam.
