The "girl on bike" is a familiar trope in the motorcycle world, which is why the editor of American motorcycle blog Asphalt & Rubber didn't pay much attention last year when images surfaced of a woman draped across the latest Ducati. Beeler from the Asphalt & Rubber blog said his referral traffic showed it got moving on Facebook, caught on in S&M social media circles, then moved into feminist media, catching the attention of mainstream media outlets. Last year, he wanted his shop to be the first to circulate promotional images of the hotly anticipated Ducati 1199 Panigale. She also wanted to distinguish the photos of the female model from the "pervy images" that have defined motorcycle marketing; she prefers to see women riding bikes rather than hanging off them, she said. Both sets of images were the brainchild of Arun Sharma, general manager of MotoCorsa, a Ducati dealership in Portland, Oregon.
