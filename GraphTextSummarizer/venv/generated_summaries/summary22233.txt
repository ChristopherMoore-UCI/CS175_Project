While the statement doesn't make reference to the abduction five years ago of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Palestinian security sources have said the group was involved in Shalit's capture, along with Hamas and another entity. The group is led by Mumtaz Dughmush and "operates primarily in the Gaza Strip and Palestinian territories," the State Department said. "These actions include a number of rocket attacks on Israel, the 2006 kidnapping of two Fox News journalists in Gaza (an American and a New Zealander) and the 2007 kidnapping of a British citizen, journalist Alan Johnston, in Gaza. The State Department says the Army of Islam "subscribes to a Salafist ideology of global jihad together with the traditional model of armed Palestinian resistance. Hamas runs the Palestinian territory of Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, which is dominated by the Fatah group, is in charge of the West Bank, the other Palestinian region.
