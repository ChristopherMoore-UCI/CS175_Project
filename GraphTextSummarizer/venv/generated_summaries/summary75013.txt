"My mom did some things which have cost me dearly." Hammond sat down with CNN for an interview for a CNN Comedy segment, but the tone shifted and it became clear that he had serious things to talk about. alum Darrell Hammond was stabbed, beaten and subjected to electrical shocks by his mother during his childhood, which led to self-mutilation and hospitalizations during his later life and while he was performing on the hit TV show, he told CNN. Hammond said he was put in psychiatric wards from time to time as doctors struggled to figure out what was happening to him. Hammond says he was medicated almost all of the time he performed on "SNL" each week, but that wasn't all that was happening behind the stage doors. CNN's Jarrett Bellini contributed to this report.
