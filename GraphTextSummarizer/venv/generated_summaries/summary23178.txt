It's no wonder, then, that Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Riyadh are each vying to throw up the biggest and grandest transportation hub in the region. "A number of passengers may not make it to Abu Dhabi, because they're only connecting. "You probably couldn't operate two airports of that size at full capacity so close to each other because of air traffic. Doha's impending Hamad International Airport will house the world's second longest runway, while Istanbul and Dubai are competing for the title of world's largest airport. "This is a country that sees the value of aviation and embraces it," says Lorne Riley, head of corporate communications at Dubai Airports.
