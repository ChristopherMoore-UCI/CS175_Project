Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests We stand with Ferguson, Holder says U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke Thursday about his visit to Ferguson to check in on the federal civil rights investigation into Brown's shooting. " On Thursday, Holder declined to answer questions about whether his department was looking into past allegations of abuse by Ferguson police, including a 2009 incident in which a man said police bloodied him in a jail cell, as well as the 2011 death that Holder spoke of. For the first time since a white police officer fatally shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, the streets emptied early Thursday. He heard from a woman who said her brother died in an encounter with Ferguson police in 2011. "Although I understand the concerns, and do not take lightly the demands that I recuse myself from this case, I also recognize that I have a responsibility to the family of Michael Brown, the people of Ferguson and the entire community."
