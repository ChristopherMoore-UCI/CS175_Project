Friday, a photo posted on photo-sharing site Instagram from the account "mollywestttt" showed a picture of two girls and veteran criminal defense attorney Don West eating generously-sized ice cream cones. After court let out this week, West and two of his daughters went to get ice cream and took a picture to commemorate it "like old times. " Zimmerman defense team communications director Shawn Vincent confirmed the photo came from Don West's 23-year-old daughter, Molly, featured in the photo along with West and another of his four daughters. Vincent said it was a tradition in West's family to go out for ice cream together. A comment below the photo from mollywestttt read: "We beat stupidity celebration cones," along with "#zimmerman," "#defense" and "#dadkilledit.
