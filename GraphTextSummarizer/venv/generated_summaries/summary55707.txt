The children were given little chance of surviving past the age of 10, but two people did: Machado and his lifelong friend and roommate Eliana Zagui. He says that when they have patients who have been paralyzed in car accidents they take them to spend some time with Machado and Zagui. There was a decade of freedom when Machado used an electric wheelchair to come and go with relative ease. But once inside the videogame convention, we enter Machado's world. For a day, at least, the tubes, the respirator, the hospital bed, they all fade into the background, and Machado becomes invincible.
