Poo was arrested on October 21, hours after his arrival in the United States, when Secret Service agents  observed him selling stolen credit card numbers for $1,000 at a Brooklyn diner, the statement said. Lin Mun Poo, 32, is suspected of accessing financial records at a Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, Ohio, by "exploiting a vulnerability he found within their secure system," according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of New York. Authorities discovered a "massive quantity" of stolen personal financial data following a forensic examination of Poo's "heavily encrypted" laptop computer, the U.S. attorney's office statement said. A Malaysian man was charged on Thursday for hacking into the computer  network of a U.S. Federal Reserve bank and for stealing more than 400,000 stolen  credit card and debit card numbers, according to federal authorities. Poo had obtained the numbers by hacking into numerous systems, including  FedComp, a data processor for federal credit unions, the statement said.
