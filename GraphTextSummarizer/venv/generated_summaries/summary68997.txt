Balderas, 34, was arrested in a wealthy neighborhood of Mexico City, Federal Police Section Chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno told reporters. Balderas also is accused of having ties to Edgar Valdez Villarreal -- alias "La Barbie" -- an alleged U.S.-born drug kingpin arrested last year. Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have arrested Jose Jorge Balderas, a suspect in last year's shooting of a Paraguayan soccer player in Mexico. Pequeno said Balderas told authorities he did not fire the shot that hit Cabanas. Salvador Cabanas was shot in the head at a bar in late January 2010.
