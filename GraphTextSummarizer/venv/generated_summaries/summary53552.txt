According to reports, the actress married Good Charlotte musician Benji Madden in a small ceremony at the couple's home in Los Angeles. "I approve of anything that's going to make Benj happy," Richie, who's married to Madden's twin brother, Joel, told Andy Cohen on "Watch What Happens Live" in July. Diaz's friend and Madden's sister-in-law, Nicole Richie, has previously (and perhaps jokingly) taken credit for setting the pair up. " If Richie did play matchmaker for Diaz and Madden, she nailed it. Diaz - who has previously been linked to actor Jared Leto, singer Justin Timberlake and baseball player Alex Rodriguez - has been skeptical in the past of marriage and outspoken about the fact that she wasn't anxious to settle down.
