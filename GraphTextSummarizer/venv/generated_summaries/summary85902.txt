He became the youngest world No. 1 since Woods with victory at Palm Beach earlier this month, usurping Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald. " Donald regained the No.1 spot with victory at the recent Transitions Championships. "Last year's Masters was definitely a defining moment for me," the 22-year-old told the European Tour's website when asked about the tournament eventually won by South African Charl Schwartzel. His 16-under-par total of 268 bettered a record previously held by 14-time championship winner Tiger Woods at Pebble Beach in 2000. When the eyes of the golfing world fall on Augusta next month for the first major of 2012, it will offer the world No. 2 a chance to reflect on how he turned a soul-crushing low into a redemptive high.
