Juve's day got better when second placed Napoli went down 2-0 at Chievo Verona after goals from Boukary Drame and Cyril Thereau. -- Saturday was all about Lionel Messi as the Barcelona striker scored for a record 17th consecutive game in Spain's La Liga but on Sunday Cristiano Ronaldo answered with two goals of his own to continue his remarkable streak for Real Madrid. Real's win moved them into second place after city rivals Atletico Madrid suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat by Real Sociedad. Inter Milan went down to a surprise 1-0 home defeat to Bologna thanks to Alberto Gilardino's 57th minute goal. But Celta, who are deep in relegation trouble, pulled level just two minutes later when Iago Aspas' shot took a deflection off Portuguese defender Pepe and squirmed past Diego Lopez.
