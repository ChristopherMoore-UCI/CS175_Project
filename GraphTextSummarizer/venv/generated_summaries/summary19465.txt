CPAC 'Las Vegas' for young conservatives Maybe it's because the conference is at its most exciting during presidential campaign years, when GOP candidates are jostling for attention from the conservative base. In the Obama era, CPAC has earned a reputation for fire-breathing rhetoric and divisive commentary, but some of this year's biggest speeches had a softer edge. But it was how he presented himself that mattered -- and the Christie who showed up at CPAC was a far cry from the Christie who ran for re-election in blue-leaning New Jersey last year, winning in resounding fashion. This year's Christie more resembled the tea party hero of 2009, when he first won the governorship, and 2010, when he traveled the country in rock star fashion campaigning for GOP candidates. The face of CPAC has become younger in recent years -- it feels a little like spring break for College Republicans -- and more libertarian in the process.
