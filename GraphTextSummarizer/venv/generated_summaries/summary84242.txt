For Blake, who recorded the year's leading time over 200m and a personal best in Friday's 100m, it marks another significant step in his rise to prominence after clinching World Championship 100m gold in Daegu, South Korea last year, after Bolt was disqualified from the final after a false start. -- Sprint superstar Usain Bolt was beaten by fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake for the second time in 48 hours on Sunday as he was pipped to first place in the 200m final at the Caribbean nation's Olympic trials. Former 100m world-record Asafa Powell and Warren Weir in the 200m complete the Jamaican line-up for the individual sprint disciplines. The duo will be hoping to meet again in the 100m final at London's Olympic Stadium on August 5 and the 200m showpiece on August 9. The 22-year-old Blake, who clocked a time of 9.75 secs to beat Bolt over 100m on Friday, crossed the line in 19.80 secs in Kingston -- 0.03 secs ahead of his rival.
