The Buffalo (New York) News reported that Lindsay M. Schmit, 26, was killed Thursday when the Chevrolet Malibu she was traveling in crossed the center line on Route 446 and was struck by a tractor-trailer. "Seinfeld" star Wayne Knight took to Twitter over the weekend to dispel a fake report he had been killed in a car crash on Route 446 in Pennsylvania. The Hollywood Reporter attempted to trace the fake sites and reported that the registration names for TMZ.today are listed as private, while the fake Usmagazine.us site is registered to someone named Ryan Wiseman in San Antonio. According to the story that made the rounds on the Web -- including a fake TMZ website -- the accident involved his Mercedes, which crashed into a tractor-trailer near the Pennsylvania-New York state line. According to The Hollywood Reporter, several sites picked up on the Knight death hoax, which also appeared on a fake US Weekly site.
