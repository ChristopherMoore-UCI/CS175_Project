It is a big 10 days for third-placed Real, who host Barca in La Liga next Saturday before traveling to England for the second leg of the Champions League last-16 clash with Manchester United. Another shock defeat had seemed on the cards when Sevilla exposed Barca's frailties at the back three minutes before halftime, as former La Masia academy defender Alberto Botia headed home a cross. Barca did not include Eric Abidal in the squad, though the French defender was on Thursday cleared to make his long-awaited comeback following a liver transplant. Messi scored for the 15th successive league match as Barca came from behind to beat Sevilla and move 12 points clear of second-placed Atletico Madrid. The striker had missed the midweek Champions League defeat by AC Milan due to his problem with kidney stones. Earlier Saturday, Ronaldo came off the bench to help earn a 2-1 victory for Real against bottom club Deportivo la Coruna.
