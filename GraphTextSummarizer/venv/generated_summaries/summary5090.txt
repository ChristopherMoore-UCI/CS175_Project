The bag was found when a teenager walking his dog spotted it in a "wash," or dry river bed, near where Loughner's family lives on Thursday morning, Nanos said. -- A bag that is believed to belong to Arizona shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner contains the same kind of ammunition as was used in Saturday's massacre, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said Thursday. On Wednesday, Kastigar said Loughner had previous contacts with law enforcement, but none so alarming that authorities were concerned about what he might do. Speculation that law enforcement had enough information about Loughner to stop the shooting is "completely untrue," Kastigar told CNN's "John King USA." Pima County on Thursday released records saying that Loughner visited the Rio Nuevo One Stop career center in September, but was asked to leave because he was filming with a video camera and refused to turn it off despite being asked repeatedly.
