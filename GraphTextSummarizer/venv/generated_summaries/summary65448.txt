-- Russian President Vladimir Putin should "man up" and offer clear explanations amid important questions about the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said on Sunday. "It's pretty clear that this is a system that was transferred from Russia in the hands of separatists," Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN on Sunday. Ukrainian officials have said that a Russian-made Buk M1 missile system, brought into eastern Ukraine from Russia, had shot down the airliner. During the interview, CNN's Candy Crowley pointed out previous sanctions against and meetings with Russia all designed to get that country out of the Ukraine and to stop supplying weapons to the separatists. Russia has denied any involvement, and Putin said Ukraine's military campaign against the rebels was to blame.
