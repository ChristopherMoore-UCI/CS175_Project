After hours of careful extraction by rescue crews from Germany, South Africa and Mexico, Zizi was carried from the rubble on a wooden board as she grasped the edges, her face covered in dust. "I haven't given up hope," Janvier told CNN. Zizi managed to hold on for twice as long, something that experts say speaks to the body's resilience in times of danger. She is a tough woman," Janvier said, recalling when he heard the news, via a CNN tip, that his mother had been found. By her side as Zizi was freed, her friends from the church cheered and prayed, Janvier said.
