In many cases, victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations. In December, federal authorities found and arrested two U.S.-based "runners" who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from pre-paid cards to foreign bank accounts. They harness stolen identities and use programs such as Google Earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money. Treasury Department officials say if you get one of these calls, the best and simplest way to handle it is to hang up. Federal authorities say it's the largest IRS impersonation scam they've ever seen -- swindling victims out of more than $15 million since it began in 2013.
