A typical cross court winner gave Nadal victory in a shade under two hours, collapsing to the ground in trade mark fashion. Only a shock first round exit at Wimbledon has interrupted Nadal's charge to the top of the rankings with three of his successes coming on hard courts on top of his traditional dominance on clay. But the latest triumph was only her third over the American in 15 attempts, giving her a morale boost ahead of next week in New York. But there was an upset in the women's final as Victoria Azarenka recovered from a set down to beat World No.1 Serena Williams 2-6 6-2 7-6 in two and a half hours. It was his 26th victory at a Masters 1000 tournament and second in succession after lifting the trophy in Montreal last week.
