Jiro may not say much, and while many previous customers have mistaken his silence as contempt, the truth is that he speaks with his palms and fingers, which create a combination of fish and rice unmatched by any other. The Japanese food provided by head chef and proprietor Jiro Ono leaves little time for small talk, much less big talk. When I answer no, chef Jiro and his son Yoshikazu immediately present a menu detailing the 19-piece "Chef's Recommended Special Course," followed by the first dish, karei, or sole. It's the perfect appetizer, and there's no doubt that chef Jiro has designed tonight's custom menu to lead my sense of taste through a special gastronomic journey. A bottom feeder, uni is generally something I avoid, but from the hands of chef Jiro it becomes a creamy, rich morsel of the ocean floor.
