Their report comes a day after Turkish government officials, including Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, met with a special Syrian envoy to help stem the growing tide of refugees. The number of Syrian refugees now in Turkey stands at 8,904, Turkish emergency officials said. More than 50 nations issued a tough statement on human rights abuses in Syria at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Wednesday, and the U.S. State Department underscored the thrust of the message Thursday. Navi Pillay, the high commissioner for human rights, urged Syria "to grant access to the country for the fact-finding mission established by the U.N. Human Rights Council." The plans came as Syrian refugees continued Thursday to flee across the Turkish border to escape violence, as world powers amplified their outrage over the Damascus regime's tough crackdown on peaceful demonstrators.
