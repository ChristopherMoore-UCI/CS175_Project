" It stated that the kingdom was committed to an open-door policy regarding the media, including "openness, transparency, disclosure of the facts." Maj. Gen. Tariq Hassan Al-Hassan, Bahrain's public security chief, said meticulous planning had gone into the event, the official Bahrain News Agency reported Saturday. Formula One racing is the world's most popular motor sport, and races have a TV audience of more than 500 million, though the scenes last year in Bahrain were viewed as a public relations disaster for both the sport and the country's authorities. Last year, opposition calls for large protests raised fears that the Bahrain Grand Prix would have to be canceled for a second year running and pose a threat to car crews, workers and fans. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled after drivers, including former Formula One star Damon Hill, raised concerns after the death of at least 35 demonstrators in a clampdown on unrest. A TV crew from British broadcaster ITV News was ordered to leave the kingdom Friday "as they reported on the violent clashes taking place in the buildup to the Grand Prix," ITV News said.
