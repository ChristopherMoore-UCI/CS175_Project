The summit organizers have four main aims: ending the culture of impunity by agreeing on an international protocol for documenting and investigating sexual violence in conflict zones; taking practical steps to protect women, including by training soldiers and peacekeepers; increasing support for survivors and human rights activists; and achieving a "seismic shift" in attitudes so that the problem is recognized and tackled globally. Speaking alongside Jolie, with whom he launched the campaign to end sexual violence in conflict two years ago, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague pledged another Â£6 million ($10 million) from the UK government to help support survivors. According to UNICEF, about 40% of Congolese women are believed to have been subjected to some form of sexual violence at some point in their lives, while in the most recent conflict in South Sudan, rape has been used by both sides of the conflict during fighting. So said Hollywood star Angelina Jolie on Tuesday in London, as she opened the biggest summit of its kind aimed at ending the scourge of sexual violence in conflict. "Let us pray for all victims of sexual violence in conflict, and those working to end this crime," he tweeted Tuesday, using the hashtag #TimeToAct.
