At least two demonstrators also were killed in the exchange of gunfire near the base where the two Americans died, said Haji Mohammad Hassan, chief of Khugyani district in eastern Nangarhar province. The protest and shootings came as the Taliban called on Muslims to attack NATO military bases and convoys and to kill soldiers following the admission that NATO troops had incinerated the books at Bagram Airfield. " "As the situation is still under investigation, it would be premature to speculate on any potential outcomes," said NATO International Security Assistance Force spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings. American diplomats in Kabul and the north and south of Afghanistan were on lockdown for a second day in the face of protests, U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Thornburg said. Afghan security forces prevented the 700 to 800 demonstrators from entering the compound, said police spokesman Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai said.
