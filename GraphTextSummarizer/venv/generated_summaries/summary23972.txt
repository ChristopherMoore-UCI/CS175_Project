-- Prosecutors officially filed terrorism charges against radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir on Wednesday, charges that make him eligible for a death sentence. The militants were preparing to launch attacks similar to the one in Mumbai 2008, and assassination attempts on Indonesian government officials, authorities have said. Bashir was first detained in August for his suspected links to a militant training camp raided by authorities in the province of Aceh in early 2010. In the past, authorities have tried but failed to directly link Bashir to some of the major terror attacks in Indonesia. Police say Bashir and his relatively new organization, the Jamaat Tawhid Anshoru or JAT, was involved in setting up the camp.
