After al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed by American commandos in Pakistan, old high school friends joked about how Checque was probably involved. -- Focused, determined and dedicated: that's how friends and neighbors describe Nicolas Checque, the Navy SEAL killed during the successful rescue of an American doctor kidnapped in Afghanistan. "He died doing what he loved," former neighbor Kim Victor said of Checque. Checque was a four-year honors student, said his physics teacher Doug Knipple, but rather than go to college, he chose to go straight into the Navy. Growing up here, Checque kept a short, military-style haircut, and even got Lasik eye surgery -- mainly to make sure there was nothing that could disqualify him from becoming a commando, according to Troisi.
