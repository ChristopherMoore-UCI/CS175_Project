" In May, MySpace announced that it would provide the coalition of state attorneys general with information on sex offenders who use the site. "We have zero tolerance for sexual predators on MySpace," Nigam said at the time, as he introduced a tool known as Sentinel SAFE to track online sex offenders. " MySpace's chief security officer, Hemanshu Nigam, issued a statement: "As the first and only social networking site to use state of the art technology to identify and remove registered sex offenders from its site, MySpace is proud of its leadership position and hopes that Facebook follows our lead in providing their members with the same protections. "This revelation is totally appalling and unacceptable, and this shocking revelation, resulting from our subpoena, also provides compelling proof that social networking sites remain ripe with sexual predators. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who spearheaded the campaign to subpoena MySpace, told CNN Radio that he found the number "appalling." "These convicted, registered sex offenders clearly create profiles seeking to prey on children," he said.
