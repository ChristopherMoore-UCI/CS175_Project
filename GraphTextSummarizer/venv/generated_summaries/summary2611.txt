Al Qaeda's franchise in Syria, al-Nusra Front, is hit by U.S. airstrikes along with ISIS, and both are described as terror groups by the U.S. government, but the al Qaeda affiliate does at times clash with ISIS for territory and resources. Above all, Wednesday's long and florid statement shows an al Qaeda desperate not to be eclipsed by its newer -- and at times, in the gruesome jousting of this world -- more radical cousin, ISIS. This hints at the growing and deeply troubling "rivalry" of sorts between ISIS and the older brand of jihad -- al Qaeda. While it seems at first bizarre that two groups with fundamentally similar goals would conflict, the differing worlds of al Qaeda and ISIS have been apparent for some time now. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's message Wednesday doesn't spell out how to connect the dots concretely between the Kouachi brothers' disturbed cries they were working for al Qaeda in Yemen and the Yemeni jihadis themselves -- that's something investigators have to work on to prove.
