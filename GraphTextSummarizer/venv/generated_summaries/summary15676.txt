At the same time, continued rain may cause river flooding in parts of southern England where the ground is saturated and water levels are already high, the agency said. Meanwhile, southwest England and south Wales had their fifth wettest January since records began in 1910, according to the Met Office, and some areas have suffered dire flooding. The Environment Agency has warned that high tides and gale force winds could bring more flooding in some coastal areas, and nine severe flood warnings are in place. The Irish Met Office warned that coastal flooding is also likely Saturday for coastal counties in the country's west and south, thanks to the high winds, extremely high seas and very high spring tides. Met Office figures for January 1-28 show that southeast and central southern England had more than twice the usual amount of rain.
