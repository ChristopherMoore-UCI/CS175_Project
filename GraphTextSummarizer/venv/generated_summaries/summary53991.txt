And that advantage was doubled in the 32nd minute when same superb interplay between Argentine duo Javier Zanetti and Diego Milito resulted in captain Zanetti sliding the ball past Seongnam goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong. The European champions, who have struggled to replicate last year's form, when they claimed the Champions League, Italian Serie A title and Italian Cup, will now face African champions TP Mazembe in Saturday's showpiece after this comfortable victory. Inter Milan cruised into the final of the Club World Cup after beating Asian champions Seongnam Ilhwa 3-0 in Abu Dhabi. The victory was sealed 17 minutes from time when Milito, making his return to action after five weeks on the sidelines, stabbed home a rebound after Samuel Eto'o's shot was parried by Jung. Meanwhile, the fifth-place play-off was won by Mexican side Pachuca, who rallied from going two goals behind to defeat local side Al-Wahda on penalties, after the match finished 2-2.
