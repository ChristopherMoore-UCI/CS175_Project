-- Back in January, Vice President Joe Biden summed up President Obama's first term with: "Osama Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive." In the middle of his term, President Carter seemed a decent bet to win re-election. Recently, Vice President Biden accused the GOP of not caring about the middle class. Other economic indicators are pointing in the right direction, too. The campaign is now more focused on the economy, highlighting the difference between the president's "promoting the private sector" and the GOP's "promoting the privileged sector."
