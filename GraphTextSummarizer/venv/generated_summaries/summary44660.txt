The elephant in the room has always been that training standards have not kept up with the technological changes in aircraft. The report concluded that a series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash. Plane crashes do still occur, even with state-of-the-art aircraft. New threats emerge every day, but through proactive efforts in data collection and analysis, we don't have to wait for an accident anymore -- we can mitigate these risks before they become real problems. Some of this will require a renewed emphasis on manual flying skills, but new training will also have to be developed to address the fundamental new relationship that has developed between man and machine.
