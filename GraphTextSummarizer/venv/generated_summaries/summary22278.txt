The first White House Easter Egg Roll was hosted by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878. -- President Obama and the rest of the first family teamed up with an extremely oversized rabbit Monday to the host the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, much to the delight of visiting children from across the country. The first family kicked off the event, which dates to 1878, shortly before 11 a.m., appearing with the Easter Bunny on the White House's South Portico, a balcony overlooking the residence's sprawling South Lawn. Several celebrities attended the event, including players from the Washington Redskins and athletes Apolo Ohno and Billie Jean King. As well as participating in the traditional egg roll, families were invited to visit the White House garden and play football, basketball and tennis, among other things.
