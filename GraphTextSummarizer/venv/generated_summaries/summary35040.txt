In a sign of what's at stake for the United States, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will spend most of this week in Europe to meet with top officials, including Sarkozy and the newly appointed Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti. The European Commission has proposed issuing so-called stability bonds as part of a plan to pool government debt across Europe. The crisis requires of us an extra commitment for unity and Europe will not redo the mistakes of the past," Sarkozy said after their meeting. He did not want to debate what that role would be, but Sarkozy did say the ECB would act to prevent a deeper economic downturn in Europe. -- France and Germany would like heads of state to meet monthly to look at the economic governing of the eurozone, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Monday.
