"It seems Asisi's artistically and archaeologically-underpinned reconstruction of an ancient cityscape fills a large audience with enthusiasm for panoramic scenes and classical antiquity even today," said Andreas Scholl, director of Berlin's antiquities collection. "Moments that have shaped our world have a huge impact on my art", said Asisi, sitting in his large Berlin studio, its walls filled with his paintings and photographs of ancient buildings or old reliefs. Asisi has created a second historic panorama showing the ancient Greek city of Pergamon (today located in Turkey), which is currently on show at Scholl's Pergamonmuseum, on the Museum Island in Berlin. In the east German city of Dresden, artist Yadegar Asisi has designed a panoramic scene of epic proportions, breathing life into a long-forgotten view of the Italian capital. "This panorama is fascinating," said Rene Gust, 32, from Berlin.
