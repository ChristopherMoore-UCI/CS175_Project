Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper, NFL free agent Corey Smith and former University of South Florida players William Bleakley and Nick Schuyler went overboard February 28 during a fishing trip. Schuyler survived the accident, which happened 35 miles west of St. Petersburg, Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico. The report said that the "improper anchoring" to a portside bracket, the attempt to throttle the boat forward to release the anchor,and the "failure to leave enough slack anchor line to compensate for top-water Gulf conditions" caused the accident. A fishing boat carrying two NFL players and two other men capsized last month because it was improperly anchored, a Florida agency reported Friday. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the men were unable to pull up the anchor of their boat to head back to port.
