Three Premier League players, Sergio Aguero, Diego Costa and Charlie Austin, have scored more league goals this season than the entire Villa team, while league leaders Chelsea and second placed Manchester City have each scored four times as many goals as the Birmingham team. How else to explain that first-tier Bournemouth recently turned up in the Midlands city to play Villa's rivals Birmingham City and won 8-0 -- as many goals as the Villans have scored in their home city all season. At times Villa fans must have felt the football Gods were truly conspiring against them. Despite the team's unerring defiance of the very essence of the sport, it's not all bad news for Villa fans with the team sitting in a surprisingly healthy league position. In the seven matches Villa have played at their Villa Park stadium, Paul Lambert's shot-shy side has managed just seven goals.
