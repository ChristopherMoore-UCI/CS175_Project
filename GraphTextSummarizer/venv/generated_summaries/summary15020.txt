Schiavo said other possibilities include engine failure or an explosion, particularly in the engine room. The agency approved the ferry's intended route, and "there was no huge difference between their plan and the actual track chart," spokesman Nam Jae Heon said. That could be from cargo shifting or "some other internal damage," Boynton told CNN's "New Day." -- As divers searched frigid waters off South Korea in low visibility, hoping to save hundreds of passengers, a dominant theory began to emerge about how the ferry sank.
