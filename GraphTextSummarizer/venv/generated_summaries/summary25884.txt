While the UAE has thrown itself into the manufacturing of military drones (at last year's Dubai Airshow, Abu Dhabi-based Adcom Systems had the largest selection of UAVs), the government is also hoping to lead the way in the implementation of machines meant for civilian use. Last month, the government launched the Drones for Good Award, a two-part competition inviting local and international engineers alike to submit proposals for UAVs aimed at improving government services locally and bettering humanity worldwide. The competition is an extension of the UAE's ambition of becoming the first government to use UAVs to deliver government services. In February, Dubai announced it started testing drones to make lightweight deliveries -- namely official documents, like IDs and driver's licenses, and medication -- and would employ fingerprint technology to confirm the identities of recipients. " The first phase of the competition, which comes with a $270,000 cash award, invites UAE residents to submit ideas that can be employed by the country's various government services (Al Aleeli envisions drones monitoring traffic and being the first responder at emergency scenes within the next five years).
