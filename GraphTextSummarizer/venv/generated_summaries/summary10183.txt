By the same token, does Hollywood exclude women and people of color in powerful director and producer roles more than other facets of American business and society? Or black producers and directors don't have the same opportunities to create films in the more elite genres? And the bigger box office films, including many nominated for Academy Awards, tend not to include female producers. After all, plenty of financially successful films each year are produced and directed by black men and women -- though mostly men. Yet Hollywood fails to regularly create, let alone celebrate, any near-significant number of critically and commercially successful films created by black directors and producers with as much power and pull in Hollywood as their white counterparts.
