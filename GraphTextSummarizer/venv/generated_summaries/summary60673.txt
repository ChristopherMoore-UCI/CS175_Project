To put yourself in position to receive more in life, you must first open your hands -- and your heart -- by giving to others today. The best move you can make today is to let go of what was and focus on what has been dubbed the new normal: a period of more moderate growth. If you want to have $5,000 for a milestone birthday trip in two years, you'll need to put away about $200 a month now, given today's low bank rates. Make that question your guidepost, and I will 100 percent guarantee that life will be richer than you can imagine. If there's no raise this year because of the economy, meet with your boss to determine grounds for a raise next year.
