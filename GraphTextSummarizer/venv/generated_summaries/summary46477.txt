But scientists need to examine further to make sure it is indeed a planet that is crossing in front of a star, and not another orbiting star. In June, NASA announced that the space observatory had identified more than 700 planet candidates, including five solar systems that had more than one transiting planet. " Since its launch on March 6, 2009, the space observatory has recorded tiny blips from more than 150,000 stars.
