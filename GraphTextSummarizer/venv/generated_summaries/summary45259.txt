Carbon emissions will decline only if the price of fossil fuels begins to include their costs to society: their effects on human health and climate. We need broad expertise because climate change is not just a science problem. The widely accepted goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius would lead to continually receding shorelines and growing climate extremes. If we start aggressively reducing carbon emissions, we can stabilize our climate and avoid cataclysmic change. My co-authors are experts on biology, ecology, law, economics, public health, climate modeling, oceanography and paleoclimatology.
