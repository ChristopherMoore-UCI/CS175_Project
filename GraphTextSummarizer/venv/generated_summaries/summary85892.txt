"This incident is particularly troubling in the light of a number of recent attacks against the Muslim community in Sri Lanka," the embassy said in a statement. "We appeal to the government to ensure such attacks do not recur since the right to worship is enshrined in our Constitution," said A.J. Mohamed Muzzamil. The new mosque was just a thousand feet away (300 meters) from a Buddhist temple, and many Buddhist worshipers had objected to the proximity. Police commandos and riot squads were moved into the area, and police reimposed a curfew for a second night Sunday. Dozens of local Buddhists took to the streets to vent their anger.
