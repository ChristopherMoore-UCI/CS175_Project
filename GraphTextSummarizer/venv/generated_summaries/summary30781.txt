"Americans love Queen Elizabeth and they think the royal family is a good thing for the people of England, but only one in eight would like to see royalty here in the United States," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Many Americans and Brits were disappointed in the royal family's handling of the death of the "people's princess," saying the queen didn't sufficiently reflect her subjects' sense of loss following the accident. Next week the United Kingdom will put royal pageantry on full display in celebration of the queen's Diamond Jubilee. "Prince Charles' favorable rating, at 57%, is comparatively low, and only 36% have a positive view of his wife, the former Camilla Parker Bowles," Holland said. Her wedding last April drew hundreds of millions of television viewers, and sparked a renewed interest in Britain's royal family among Americans.
