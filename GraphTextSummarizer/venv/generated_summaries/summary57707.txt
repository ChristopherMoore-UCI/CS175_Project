Did Tsarnaev interact with Abu Dujan during his time in southern Russia? The 26-year-old can't give an answer: He was killed after a shootout with U.S. authorities in Watertown, Massachusetts -- 5,500 miles from Makhachkala -- early Friday. Tsarnaev also appears to have posted and removed a video of a militant named Abu Dujan, a jihadist leader who was later killed by Russian troops. The U.S. investigators were joined by members of Russia's Federal Security Service, human rights activist Kheda Saratova said. -- The building, No. 50, that members of the Tsarnaev family call home sits on a seemingly quiet street in Makhachkala.
