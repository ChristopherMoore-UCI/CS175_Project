-- Neil Bolen has worked as a civil engineer with the Federal Aviation Administration for the past 24 years, designing air traffic control radar systems that help keep America moving. The FAA has stopped hundreds of airport construction projects nationwide, putting about 24,000 construction workers out of work. Bolen, a 48-year-old father of two from the Atlanta area, is one of thousands of Americans with ties to the aviation industry who are suddenly finding themselves out of work this summer because of Congress's failure to pass routine legislation keeping the FAA funded. "Congress doesn't care about me at all," Bolen told CNN. Other workers caught up in the mess share Bolen's frustrating and growing anger with Congress.
