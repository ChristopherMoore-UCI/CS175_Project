"It was kinda cold and wet, we didn't really go to sleep at all, and there were lots of mosquitoes," 9-year-old Luke Schreck told WPLG. Not the thing to do," Schreck told CNN affiliate WPLG. "We weren't able to see them, we were only able to hear them," Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino told the affiliate. The Schreck family -- Scott, Carrie and their three young boys -- spent a night in the swampy wilderness Thursday in an ecosystem home to alligators, snakes and mosquitoes. When the Schrecks did not return from their trip on Thursday, concerned family members called the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
