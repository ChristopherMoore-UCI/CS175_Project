The death toll from recent eruptions of Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano has climbed to 273, government officials said Wednesday. He and several ministers have visited the area and taken part in relief efforts. The government's volcano alert level remains at its highest level, though officials said last week that the worst might be over. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called the volcanic eruptions a crisis situation. On Wednesday, 300,957 people remained in temporary shelters.
