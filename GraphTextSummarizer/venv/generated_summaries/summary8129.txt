Sabahy's campaign announced Wednesday that it's withdrawing its delegates who observe the polls because they have been arrested or assaulted: "In the past 48 hours we were subjected to a wide range of abuses, assaults and violations. Extending the voting period for no real plausible reason will open the door to possible vote violations and rigging," said Hussein Abdel Ghany, a top adviser to Sabahy. "The mass arrests of thousands of political dissidents, whether Islamist or secular, has all but shut down the political arena and stripped these elections of real meaning," the group's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said in a statement Wednesday. -- Polls finally closed in Egypt's presidential election Wednesday, and workers have started to count the ballots, according to Egyptian state media. Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb had even declared Tuesday a public holiday "in compliance to citizens' wishes," state TV reported.
