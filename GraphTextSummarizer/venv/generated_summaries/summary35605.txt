Moore worked right to the end, preparing for a stage reading of a new play and helping her actor grandson learn lines, Kirk Kellykhan said, "I just got cursed out that morning about learning my lines," Kellykhan said. Most of her roles in the 1950s were as domestics, until she was cast as Annie Johnson in "Imitation of Life." A Los Angeles native, she began her entertainment career as a Cotton Club chorus girl and a film extra. She played a wise grandmother in "Disney's The Kid" in 2000, while acting in television guest roles in "ER" and "Judging Amy." -- Juanita Moore, the third African-American actress to ever get a supporting actress Oscar nomination, died of natural causes at her Los Angeles home Tuesday, her grandson said.
