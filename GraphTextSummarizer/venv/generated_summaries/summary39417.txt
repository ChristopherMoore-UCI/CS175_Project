Different districts in Japanese cities have varying training regimen for geisha, but typically, as in Kyoto, exams are taken after the first year as an apprentice, with four additional years of training.h Many operate within geisha houses -- academies for trainee geisha -- that help manage their careers, while also providing a unique bond and atmosphere of sisterhood. " While Niseko is something of frontier in the country for geisha culture, the rest of the year Sayuki is based in Tokyo's Asakusa district and also travels to host geisha banquets abroad. " For Downer, geisha remain the embodiment of refinement and grace and are still the custodians of the traditional Japanese art forms. Along with Kyoto, the Asakusa district has a long tradition of geisha, enabling visitors today to easily indulge in some geisha-spotting (particularly the ancient Gion area of Kyoto) as they walk through streets on the way to functions at local teahouses and restaurants. With each delicately crafted kimono costing thousands of dollars (traditionally each geisha would need a wardrobe of 36 to reflect changing seasons), being affiliated with a geisha house helps trainee geisha (called maiko in Kyoto, hangyoku in Tokyo) absorb the costs.
