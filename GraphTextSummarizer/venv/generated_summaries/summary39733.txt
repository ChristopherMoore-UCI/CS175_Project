Migrating peregrine falcons traveling north from South American wintering areas, destined for nesting areas as far as Greenland, are also crossing the Gulf's marshes. All these birds can live decades and take years to mature, so adult birds killed by oil this year will mean populations reduced for years to come. When oil was just starting to smudge some of the birds on beaches now thick with it, I saw sanderlings, ruddy turnstones, black-bellied plovers and other such northbound birds. We're hearing a lot about the economic dislocation of thousands of Gulf fishers and their families -- and rightly so. We are all Gulf victims now.
