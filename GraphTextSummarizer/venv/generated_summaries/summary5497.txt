The 2010 Commonwealth Games, which India had hoped would burnish its image as a rising economic power, was marred by accusations of graft, missed construction deadlines and cost overruns. The presence at the ceremony of Suresh Kalmadi, who was arrested last year on corruption charges related to the Commonwealth Games, would be "contrary to national interest," the High Court of Delhi said Wednesday. The Indian government also is not in favor of Kalmadi attending the Olympics while he still faces corruption charges, according to the text of the high court's judgment. The petitioner who brought the litigation, Rahul Mehra, said Kalmadi's presence at the Olympics would be "extremely embarrassing" for the athletes and India. But it said he couldn't leave India until Friday, the day of the opening ceremony, and should honor a pledge not to attend any Olympic events "in any official capacity." Kalmadi still holds a number of high-profile sports administrative roles, including the presidency of the Indian Olympic Association.
