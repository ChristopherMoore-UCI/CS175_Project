New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have given indications they are thinking of running, although they haven't announced candidacies at this very early stage of the contest. In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis ran for the presidency against Vice President George H.W. Bush. The condition and record of their states almost always becomes the prism through which presidential candidates who are sitting governors are evaluated. Sometimes governors use this to their advantage, like Bill Clinton in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2000. In 2012, another man who served as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney, suffered from similar challenges.
