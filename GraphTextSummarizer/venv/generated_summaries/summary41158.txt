-- For many people the financial sector appears to be a sprawling, interconnected mass of colossal banks, complex jargon and mind-boggling numbers. Encouraging wider participation in financial production would create more diversity in the system whilst empowering people. Goal 1: Wider participation in financial production Right now, production of financial services is limited to a closed, elite group of professionals -- bankers, fund managers, traders, and so on -- who reap very large rewards. The current banking sector is unaccountable for many reasons, but one of them is simply the poor state of financial literacy, leaving empowered financiers facing off against people who frequently feel alienated or unsure about how the system works. This includes filmmakers, young businesspeople who have heart but little track record, and projects that are too small for big banks to care about.
