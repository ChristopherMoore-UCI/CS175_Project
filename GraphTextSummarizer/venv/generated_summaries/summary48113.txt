When New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared at a news conference Wednesday without Lydia Callis at his side, fans of the sign-language interpreter immediately expressed their disappointment via Twitter. So sad Lydia Callis is not the sign language interpreter #Sandy" tweeted @kyledoyle. New York magazine said Callis gave the city "a legitimate reason to smile" even as the storm loomed. "Bloomberg's new signer does her job fine, but she doesn't have panache of Lydia Callis, who signed with a New York accent. Callis, 30, became an Internet sensation just three days earlier because of the dramatic facial expressions and body language she used to translate Bloomberg's dire warnings about the dangers coming with Superstorm Sandy.
