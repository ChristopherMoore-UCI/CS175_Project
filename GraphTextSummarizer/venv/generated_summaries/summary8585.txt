Jason Wayne Autry, who is already in prison for an unrelated assault conviction, was indicted on especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder charges by a special grand jury Tuesday, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said at a news conference in Decaturville Tuesday afternoon. -- A second man has been charged with murder in the 2011 disappearance of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo. The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee, from those who knew the young woman to others who rallied behind the effort to find her. Although Gwyn has previously declined to say whether any remains have been found, he acknowledged Tuesday that her body has not been located. Other suspects can expect police to be "on their doorstep" soon, Tennessee's top investigator told reporters Tuesday.
