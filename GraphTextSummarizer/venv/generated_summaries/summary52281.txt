Plus, "Istria" is still a little-known proper noun and "Tuscany" has moved into adjective territory. For the modern invader, Istria comes in two flavors: coastal paradise and rustic hilltop hamlet. Although the air is perfumed by the nearby sea, inland Istria is a world away from the coast's busy beaches and ice cream stands. Pliny the Elder called Istrian olive oil the second best in the world (after Italian olive oil, of course) and contemporary foodies geek out over the area's distinguished grape varietals and artisanal hams and cheeses. Turns out civilization has existed in Istria since at least the Bronze Age, when people lived in "gradines," fortified castles built on the tops of hills.
