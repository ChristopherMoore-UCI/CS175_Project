Cruise isn't the only star in Oblivion â€” it also features Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, and Olga Kurlyenko â€” but it was marketed almost exclusively on his appeal. IMAX screens accounted for $5.5 million of Oblivion's weekend gross. Pines grossed $4.8 million, yielding a mediocre $3,078 per theater average, which doesn't merit further expansion. According to distributor Universal, audiences, which were 57 percent male and 74 percent 25 or older, listed Tom Cruise as their primary reason for seeing the film, followed by the sci-fi genre and Morgan Freeman. In fact, only four Cruise vehicles have ever opened higher â€” and three of them are Mission Impossible movies.
