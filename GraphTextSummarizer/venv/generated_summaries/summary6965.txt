"Whereas his father Kim Jong Il had the absolute consolidation of power base and direct full control of the Party, the military, and the state, his son Kim Jong Un seems to reign than rule. "Kim Jong Un basically grew up on Google and his father grew up on letters and stamps," said Jasper Kim, founder of Asia-Pacific Global Research Group. "Our Party is determined our people will not have to tighten their belts but will enjoy wealth and the honor of socialism," Kim told a crowd of thousands at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang. But some North Korea watchers believe the Swiss-educated fan of Western movies and basketball lacks the absolute power enjoyed by his father and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea. Kim Jong Un seems determined to make his own mark as leader.
