Even before the ink on Ohio Gov. John Kasich's signature on Senate Bill 5 had time to dry, public employee unions in Ohio and their allies began the process of gathering the signatures necessary to invoke a provision in the Ohio Constitution that allows legislation to be placed before the state's voters. The fear now among Republicans is not only that Senate Bill 5 will be repealed, but that organized labor in Ohio will emerge from this victory newly energized and better positioned to achieve its goals. The campaign to repeal Senate Bill 5, led by a group called "We Are Ohio," quickly went national. Since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning Ohio, it may well be that vote to repeal Senate Bill 5 in Ohio helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in January of 2013. Although shrinking in population relative to the rest of the country (after the 2010 census, the Buckeye state lost two seats in Congress), Ohio's electoral vote total is seen by the Republicans and the Democrats as being both up-for-grabs, and crucial to putting together an electoral majority.
