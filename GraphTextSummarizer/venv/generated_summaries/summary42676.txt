Nigerians voted April 9 for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. It was a major setback reminiscent of the nation's 2007 elections, which the European Union described as filled with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigerians voted Saturday for their president, a week after parliamentary elections were marred by violence and accusations of fraud in Africa's most populous nation. A new election chief promised free and fair elections, but the electoral commission was forced to put off elections earlier this year by a week after logistical problems, including party logos missing from ballot papers, were reported nationwide. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and its largest oil producer, is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States, and hosts many Western oil companies and workers.
