"I am honored, as are our faculty, staff and students, that President Obama will give his first commencement speech as president of the United States at ASU." Arizona State University's refusal last week to present an honorary degree to President Obama cast an unnecessary dark cloud over the school and forced officials to do something they apparently were trying to avoid: recognize the president for his accomplishments. "We hope that the recent discussion of honorary degrees will not detract from the honor and thrill that ASU -- and indeed all of Arizona -- is experiencing in anticipation of his visit," Crow said in the statement. Mark Preston says Obama came out ahead in the honorary degree flap with scholarship named after him. "Naming this scholarship program after President Obama that will affect the lives of thousands of students is an honor befitting, not only the president's exceptional achievements, but also his values as an individual," Crow said in a statement released by the school.
