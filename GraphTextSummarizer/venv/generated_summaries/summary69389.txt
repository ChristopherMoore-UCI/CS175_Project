Sheriff's deputies took Bieber's personal smart phone when they used a felony search warrant to raid his mansion Tuesday morning, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson said. Deputies at the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station, which serves an affluent section of Los Angeles County just east of Malibu, have become familiar with Bieber, 19, since he moved into a $6.4 million home two years ago. Deputies found suspected illegal drugs "in plain view" of Lil Za when they entered his bedroom in Bieber's home, Thompson said. Lil Za's lament Bieber house guest Lil Za -- a 20-year-old rapper whose real name is Xavier Smith -- is steaming over the media attention and legal troubles that followed his abrupt awakening Tuesday morning. The sheriff's technical crew, which is also examining security video seized in the search, are looking for any evidence of Bieber "bragging or making fun of" the incident, Thompson said.
