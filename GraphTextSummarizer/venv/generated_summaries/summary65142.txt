When officers arrived outside a split-level home in a middle-class neighborhood, a woman came out and told them a younger woman -- later identified as 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins -- "had been shot by her boyfriend several times," said police spokesman Darin Snapp. "I am devastated and heart broken," wrote Jeff Allen, one of several Kansas City players who took to Twitter to express their grief and astonishment. It left the baby -- who was inside the Kansas City home, but in another room, when her mother was shot -- without a surviving parent, and she is now with relatives, Snapp said. " Officers sped over and noticed a black man, talking to several coaches, and holding a gun to his head, Snapp said. "I think that they believe there is an obligation to the people of this city, the fans of the team, the fans of the other team to proceed and go forward."
