Bacani's first documentary project captured the stories of a group of women at Bethune House Migrant Women's Refuge, a shelter for abused migrant workers. Bacani is one of more than 320,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong. On her one day off each week, Bacani wanders the streets of Hong Kong with her camera in hand, ready to photograph. "She is uniquely placed to tell the story of her community, that of migrant workers," says Sim, who recommended Bacani for the fellowship. A domestic worker from the Philippines who moonlights as a photographer in Hong Kong will be leaving her job in May to pursue a dream career in New York.
