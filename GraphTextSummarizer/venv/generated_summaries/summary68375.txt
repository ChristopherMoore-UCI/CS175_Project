More than 80,000 residents have been left homeless or displaced in Pernambuco state and about 74,000 have met a similar fate in Alagoas state, the news agency said. In response to severe flooding in northeastern Brazil that has left 46 people dead, the government on Thursday announced the release of 500 million reais (U.S. $277 million) to help victims, national civil defense officials said. The money comes on top of a previous 50 million reais (U.S. $27.7 million) destined for the two hardest-hit states, Pernambuco and Alagoas. In Alagoas, more than 11,000 homes have been destroyed and another 7,000 damaged, Agencia Brasil said. Twenty-nine people have lost their lives in Alagoas and more than 600 are missing, Agencia Brasil said.
