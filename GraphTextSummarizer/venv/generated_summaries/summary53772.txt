Shirley Dermond did not drown but rather died from a "blunt impact injury to the head," Putnam County Coroner Gary McElhenney said Saturday. Authorities believe she was taken from her home after her husband was killed, sometime between May 2 and May 4. The decapitated body of her husband, 88-year-old Russell Dermond, was discovered May 6 in the garage of the couple's million-dollar waterfront home after friends went to check on them. Investigators continue to search for Russell Dermond's head, and they plan to look in the area where Shirley Dermond's body was found, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said. The coroner's finding came a day after authorities pulled Dermond's body from the lake about 80 miles east of Atlanta.
