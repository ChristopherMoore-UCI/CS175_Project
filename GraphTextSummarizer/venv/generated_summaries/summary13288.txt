"I kind of viewed it less about cordoning off children, and more as just another way for airlines to charge fees," she says. Now, amid all the grumbles of childless passengers and harassed parents, airlines are offering the warring factions a chance to sit further apart.. Recently, Scoot Airlines, Singapore Air's budget brand, became the latest carrier to unveil child-fee seating zones. Rather than separate the two groups, they've introduced "The Flying Nanny," an in-flight team of child experts that play with, calm and otherwise distract children from causing a scene. Etihad Airways has paired up with Norland College, England's premier childcare institute to train the all-female staff of nannies on child psychology, sociology and child development. By introducing quiet zones, Osman-Rani is hoping to drive passengers, be they families or singles, towards paying the fee.
