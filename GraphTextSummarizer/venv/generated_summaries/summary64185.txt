Coroner slams handling of Kendrick Johnson case Fredericks was able to find a little more than 18 minutes of video showing Johnson throughout the school on January 10. CNN also provided Fredericks and his company, the Spokane, Washington-based Forensic Video Solutions, with hundreds more hours of video from 31 cameras in other parts of Lowndes County High School. What Fredericks wasn't able to find was video showing whether there was anyone in the gym when Johnson was there -- images that could prove vital in determining how the teen died. Kendrick Johnson's family waited months for hundreds of hours of surveillance video, hoping it would answer their questions. Fredericks quickly knocked down the Johnsons' concerns -- they're all easily explained, he said -- but his examination raised what could be another mystery: at least an hour of missing video from all four cameras inside the gym.
