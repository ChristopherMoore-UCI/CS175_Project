Cockscomb has camping facilities and cabins for rent specifically for visitors to watch for cats at night. Sitting still, in the dark, in the rain, at night looking for jaguars, I would want to talk to my guide just to stay awake. Guides are available both in Belmopan and Placencia. I arranged my visit with Sam through Splash Dive Center in Placencia. My guide, Sam, tells me the trail we're on is often used by jaguars as an easy path through the forest.
