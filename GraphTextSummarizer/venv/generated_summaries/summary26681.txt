The children were rescued by police late Thursday in southeastern Nigeria's Abia state, according to Yeni Ajayi, a deputy National Police spokesman. The gunmen boarded a school bus carrying the nursery and elementary school children from Abayi International School on Monday and took them away. Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has condemned what he calls "utterly callous and cruel kidnapping" and ordered the Inspector-General of Police and heads of other security agencies "to take all necessary steps to rescue the abducted children and return them safely to their parents." Just after the incident, authorities said the bus driver and the school teacher who were on board were in police custody and helping security forces. -- Authorities in Nigeria have recovered 15 schoolchildren who were snatched by kidnappers earlier this week, a police spokesman said Friday.
