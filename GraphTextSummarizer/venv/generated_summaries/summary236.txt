He's a hot star now, especially after his eye-catching performance in "The Good, The Bad, The Weird," says Jean Noh, deputy Asia editor based in Korea for global film trade magazine Screen International. Lee says his character was perfected through several conversations, discussions and arguments with Kim, a close friend who also directed him in 2005's "A Bittersweet Life." " In his native South Korea he is best known for brooding, soulful performances in romantic films and TV dramas. In South Korea, where celebrities are closely scrutinized by the public and Internet gossip is rampant, Lee, who is a target because of his film star status, says he tries his best to steer clear of online chatter. Lee has always had star power, says Noh from Screen International.
