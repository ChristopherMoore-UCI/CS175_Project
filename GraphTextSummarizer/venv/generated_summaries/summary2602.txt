Brewer's family was not represented at the Jarvis family's public apology. "The swelling has come way down, and you can recognize facial expressions now," said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami. With her lip quivering, Sherry Jarvis apologized to the family of 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who is clinging to life in a hospital burn unit. Jarvis is the mother of two boys who, along with three other youths, are accused in the burning of Brewer. Detectives have returned to the Brewer house, after two dolls were found in the swimming pool.
