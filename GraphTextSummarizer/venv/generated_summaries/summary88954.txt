Over two decades, Ferguson won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups. "I don't understand how people can say that," Ferdinand, who left Old Trafford at the end of last season, told CNN when asked whether Ferguson was responsible for United's failings. How can people say that?" Ferdinand, who won 81 caps for England, arrived from Leeds United in July 2002 for Â£30m, a world record for a defender at that time, went on to win six Premier League titles, the Champions League and two League Cups. Now at Queens Park Rangers, Ferdinand was part of the United team which struggled badly last season under Moyes, the man who was handpicked by Ferguson to succeed him. However, some argued Ferguson had left his successor an aging squad, with the likes of Ferdinand, now 35, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra -- two defenders who left Old Trafford in the summer transfer window -- Robin van Persie and Michael Carrick all in their fourth decade.
