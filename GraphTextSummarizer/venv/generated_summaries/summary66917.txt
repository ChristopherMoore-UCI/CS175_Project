On its "front," the heliosphere is more bullet-shaped, but it is asymmetrical because of the influence of magnetic fields from interstellar space, said David McComas, lead author on the paper and principal investigator for IBEX at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Rather, the tail is a stream of solar wind plasma -- charged particles -- and magnetic field, trailing off behind the heliosphere. We've seen it around other stars, we know the sun is moving relative to interstellar gas," said Eric Christian, IBEX mission scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Thanks to solar wind blowing out from the sun in all directions at a million miles per hour, material from comets gets whipped back into a formation that looks like a tail. Astronomers had previously determined that other stars also have tails around their magnetic bubbles, which are called astrospheres.
