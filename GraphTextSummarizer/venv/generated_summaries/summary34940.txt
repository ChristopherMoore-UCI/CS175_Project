He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. The defense team for Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president accused of war crimes, formally concluded its case on Friday, the Special Court for Sierra Leone said. The defense case began in July 2009, and 21 witnesses were called in Taylor's defense, including Taylor, who faces an 11-count indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the civil war in Sierra Leone, fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior and were often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor -- who was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003 -- is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, enslavement and sexual slavery and violence.
