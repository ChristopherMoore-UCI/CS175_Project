"It is not our impression that people refrained from buying or wearing colorful clothing (after the earthquake in March)," said Mitsuko Watanabe, editor of Vogue Japan. "People did pull back somewhat immediately after (the disaster), but shopping didn't stop and they were buying items that were less obvious, like fragrances," said Nicole Fall, director of trends for Five by Fifty. According to a survey by Asian trend and innovation agency Five by Fifty, 58% of consumers in the big city areas of Osaka and Tokyo continued shopping for clothes and fashion as normal after the earthquake. However, by May sales for many luxury goods had risen above pre-disaster levels, according to Watanabe, especially for items that transcended fashion, namely engagement and wedding rings. Japanese clothing companies and fashion magazines mobilized charity campaigns and donated clothes to people in the stricken area.
