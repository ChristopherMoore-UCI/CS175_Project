Not only that, the success of Montpellier -- a team described as French football's "ugly ducklings" by coach Girard -- in one of Europe's top leagues gives hope that in the era of big money in football even the smaller teams have a shot at the biggest prizes. "There is an opportunity (in France) for small, well-run clubs (to do well)," said French football analyst James Eastham, who explained that France has had four different champions in four seasons, which gives opportunities to less well off teams. Montpellier won the title thanks to a style of football they had been building for years." While PSG could afford to blow €40 million ($51.26 million) on Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore and hire Italian legend Carlo Ancelotti, the biggest outlay by Montpellier's former France under 21 coach Rene Girard was €2 million ($2.56 million) for defender Henri Bedmino. The team's success -- much like European football's other fairytale league success, for Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona in Israel -- was built not on money but on nurturing young players in the academy, building team spirit and spotting talent and value in footballers previously discarded by everyone else.
