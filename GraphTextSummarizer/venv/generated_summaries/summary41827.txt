-- As the country continues to debate police accountability and the all-too-routine killing of unarmed black men by white law enforcement, it's imperative to understand that this issue is not just about black people and white people. On the day when white law enforcement officers are indicted for the killing of unarmed black men, and on the day when white men stop receiving medals associated with the killing of Native Americans, then I will say we've grown as a nation, but only a little. Native Americans make up about 0.8% of the population, yet account for 1.9% of police killings. Though this outrageous incident was covered by CNN and other networks, the killing of Goodblanket and many other Native Americans who've died at the hands of law enforcement remains unspoken. Goodblanket's mother, Melissa, said she can't comprehend why mainstream media does not report on the killings of unarmed Native Americans, and why the killing of her son has failed to spark a national response.
