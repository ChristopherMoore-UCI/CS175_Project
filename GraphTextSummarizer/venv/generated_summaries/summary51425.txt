-- Maria Sharapova's impressive record of winning matches that go to three sets in 2012 shows no sign of ending after the Russian beat Nadia Petrova in the U.S. Open fourth round to set up a quarterfinal meeting with Marion Bartoli. Robson, who had beaten Kim Clijsters and Li Na to reach the fourth round, saved eight match points as she came from 5-2 down to get back on serve but Australian Stosur broke again to clinch victory and a match with top seed Victoria Azarenka. Earlier on Sunday defending champion Sam Stosur ended 18-year-old Briton Laura Robson's impressive U.S. Open run with a 6-4 6-4 win in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. " Serena cruises into last 16 with revenge win over Makarova Frenchwoman Bartoli also had to come from behind to beat the fifth seed Petra Kvitova, but did so in style, winning 12 of 13 games to take a 1-6, 6-2, 6-0 victory. "I'm definitely disappointed," said former Wimbledon junior champion Robson, who will rise from 89th to 75th in the rankings after doing so well at Flushing Meadows.
