Tech: After Newtown, shoppers think twice about violent video games If we could make it legal to regulate violence in games, would that have stopped Lanza or any of the other mass homicides through history? If violent video games were some small but critical component of Lanza's motivation, why we could just get rid of such games and make this whole problem go away. But just because violent video games seemed to have been a part of Lanza's life, as with many young men, we cannot jump to conclusions. On Monday, CBS News raised eyebrows with a report citing unnamed law enforcement sources conjecturing that Lanza was motivated in part by violent video games as well as Norway shooter Anders Breivik. According to the Hartford Courant, we know that when the police searched Lanza's home after the shooting, they found thousands of dollars' worth of violent video games.
