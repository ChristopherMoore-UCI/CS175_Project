-- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin blamed the United States Thursday for encouraging opposition protests that have broken out since parliamentary elections Sunday. " Demonstrators have been protesting against what they describe as electoral fraud in Sunday's national vote, which kept Putin's United Russia party in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in Parliament. Police said 8,000 people had turned out for a separate demonstration in support of Putin's United Russia party. Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Wednesday that Russian authorities "must halt police mistreatment of election protesters, journalists and detainees" before further planned rallies. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, called Wednesday for new parliamentary elections in Russia over concerns about vote fraud.
