For those, like me, who watch the other candidate closely when his opponent is answering a question, the contrast between Obama and Romney's reactions was like comparing Darth Vader with Honey Boo Boo. " Opinion: Romney endorses Obama's national security policies Romney continued his "I agree with Obama" tour with regard to Israel: "I want to underscore the same point the president made, which is that if I'm president of the United States ... we will stand with Israel. But Obama pinned Romney with the look -- Obama-stare. How else can anyone explain why Romney -- who is highly critical of Obama's foreign policy when he is out on the campaign trail -- would agree with the president on issue after issue when placed in the same room? I'm sure there will be those who fault Romney for agreeing so often with Obama instead of articulating a stark contrast on foreign policy.
