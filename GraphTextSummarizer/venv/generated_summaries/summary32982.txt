Winter weather for these regions is often driven not by La Nina but by the Arctic oscillation. ■ Hawaii: Above-average temperatures are favored in the western islands with equal chances of above-, near-, or below average precipitation. La Nina is associated with cooler than normal water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which influences weather throughout the world. ■ California: colder than average with odds favoring wetter than average conditions in northern California and drier than average conditions in southern California. The snow forecasts are dependent upon winter storms which are generally not predictable more than a week in advance, they said.
