Treve is trained by Criquette Head-Maarek but the record breaking filly will be sent to French rival Andre Fabre for race preparation. Nicolas de Watrigant, the agent who bought the filly on the Sheikh's behalf, spelled out the reasons for the record breaking purchase, the most paid at auction in Europe for a horse of any age. Sheikh Al Thani, the son of a former emir of Qatar, won Europe's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Sunday with the filly Treve and will be hoping his new purchase can achieve similar success. Bidding on the filly, a sister of 2012 Epsom Oaks winner Was, was brisk with Irish owner John Magnier competing strongly for the purchase. -- Qatari Sheikh Joann Al Thani has broken the world record paid for a yearling filly by splashing out $8.38 million for a daughter of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo at the Tattersalls bloodstock auction in Newmarket, eastern England.
