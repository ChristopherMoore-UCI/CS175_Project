While the Senate report found there had been a "marked decline" in Australia's national koala population -- with the largest losses reported in the states of Queensland and New South Wales -- it said that in some areas of Victoria and South Australia koala colonies were "flourishing." Currently, koalas are listed as "vulnerable" under state legislation in Queensland and New South Wales, and as "rare" in South Australia. A national listing would offer greater protection to the koala under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999. "I can't provide a blanket threatened species listing across Australia when there are many places where koala numbers remain high," he said in a statement. Some say the disparity between survival rates in different parts of the country is complicating what should be a simple decision to grant koalas greater protection.
