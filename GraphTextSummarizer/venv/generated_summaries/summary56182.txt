A "major disturbance, emergency situation" was declared, and law enforcement officers from nearby Ventura County responded to help the Santa Barbara County deputies already on the scene, the release said. " Five more officers -- Santa Barbara County deputies -- were injured, including one who was hit in the face with a brick, and two hit in the hand with bottles, the sheriff said. About 15,000 people -- many of them students from nearby University of California, Santa Barbara -- crowded the streets of Isla Vista for the annual "Deltopia" celebration when "a major disturbance broke out," according to a news release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. A large crowd threw rocks, bricks and bottles at police officers who were arresting the person suspected of hitting the officer, it said. Stop signs were torn down, small fires ignited and property damaged, including several police vehicles, before order was restored early Sunday, the sheriff's office said.
