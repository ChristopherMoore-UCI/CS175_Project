Dr. Sanjay Gupta is used to making headlines. "I understand there is concern that if you legalize it, kids will use it recreationally, and I don't want young people to do that, but our concern for their safety shouldn't keep patients who need this from getting access," Gupta said. After his article appeared Thursday, Gupta said he received calls and e-mails from people from all walks of life who were grateful he started the conversation. The Washington gossip site Wonkette posted a story with the headline, "When you've lost Sanjay Gupta you've lost America: Sanjay Gupta wants to get 'high' on the pot like a common jazz criminal." His column inspired pot jokes as well as thoughtful conversations in publications around the world.
