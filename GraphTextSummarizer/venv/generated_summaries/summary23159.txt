Opinion: Without protests, justice for Trayvon Martin can't be served Florida authorizes deadly force "if the danger could be avoided only" by using it, but does not require a threatened person to try first to flee. This means arguing at trial, and on appeal, that someone like Zimmerman can be brought to justice notwithstanding Florida's strong self defense law, or that the law should be construed less favorably to those who resort to deadly force. George Zimmerman should only be prosecuted if, after an exhaustive investigation and an honest assessment of Florida's "stand your ground" law, special prosecutor Angela Corey concludes that there is a strong possibility of proving his guilt at trial for the killing of Trayvon Martin. The outcome of cases is determined by comparing the defendant's actions against state law. To convict Zimmerman, a jury would have to find that there is no reasonable view of the evidence that would justify his lethal actions.
