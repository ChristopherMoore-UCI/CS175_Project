As a submarine rescue vessel, the Kittiwake was home to many Navy divers during its 49 years of service. "She was a ship that served divers all of her life," she says, "so it just seemed the appropriate ship." "It was a pilot project and that was part of the complexity of it," says Nancy Easterbrook, who spearheaded the Kittiwake project on behalf of the Cayman Islands Tourism Association. The Kittiwake was sunk a little over a year ago just off Grand Cayman's popular Seven Mile Beach. The Caymans applied to the U.S. government to receive a decommissioned ship to use as an artificial reef, a process that was open for the first time to international applicants.
