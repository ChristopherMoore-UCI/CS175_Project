Mohamud was a 19-year-old Oregon State University student when he was arrested on November 26, 2010, and accused of trying to blow up what he believed to be an explosives-laden van parked near a holiday event in Pioneer Courthouse Square, authorities said. The Oregon resident began communicating electronically in August 2009 with another accused terrorist, Amro Al-Ali, who is now being held in his native Saudi Arabia on terrorist charges, federal authorities said. The FBI investigation moved to another level, including several discussions and trips involving Mohamud and undercover agents. The two discussed Mohamud's possible travel first to Yemen and then to Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province for terrorist training. Born in Mogadishu in 1991, Mohamud moved to the United States and became a naturalized U.S. citizen, settling in the northwestern Oregon city of Corvallis.
