Ocean is nominated for six awards at the February 10 show, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Urban Contemporary Album, where his competition includes none other than Brown. According to MTV, the two exchanged words in June 2011 on Twitter after Ocean seemed to take offense to Brown comparing him to singer/songwriters such as James Fauntleroy and Kevin Cossum. Authorities are investigating the January 27 brawl, in which Brown is accused of punching an unnamed victim on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement the following day. Brown has been in two other highly publicized incidents -- one involving fellow musician Drake in New York, and one with writer/comedian Jenny Johnson on Twitter. Authorities did not name the man whom witnesses say Brown punched, but Ocean tweeted that it was him.
