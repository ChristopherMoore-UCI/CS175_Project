During this process of confrontation between state and society, Islamic politics have been transformed from revolutionary Islamism which peaked in Iran in 1979 to the emergence of a post-modern, secularised, democratic, civic Islam that is a part of the political mix in Muslim-majority societies today. The success of Ennahda is indicative of a wider ideational trend that has engulfed the Arab-Islamic world for quite some time now: the shift from ideological Islam to civic Islam (al-Islam al-madaniya) or what I have called a "post-modernised Islam" elsewhere. Post-modern Islam is politically secular and operates in a distinctly pragmatist mode. Today, post-modern Islam is primarily geared to the cultural and socio-economic preferences of the burgeoning middle-classes in the region whose politics is certainly not revolutionary. This is very different from the heydays of modern Islamism whose godfather, Sayyid Qutb, and Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna had very specific and rather doctrinal ideas about the function of Islam in politics.
