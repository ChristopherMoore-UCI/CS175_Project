"When abused, prescription drugs are just as dangerous and just as addictive as drugs like methamphetamine or heroin," DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said. " Thirty-five states already have prescription drug monitoring programs in place that help track how prescriptions are prescribed and distributed by authorized healthcare providers and pharmacies. "The more we can do to stop the abuse of prescription drugs, the more effective we will be in reducing the death, destruction and despair that accompanies all drug abuse." Under this process, drug manufacturers must make educational materials on proper prescribing and disposal available to anyone writing prescriptions for long-acting and extended-release painkillers. "We share a responsibility to protect our communities from the damage done by prescription drug abuse."
