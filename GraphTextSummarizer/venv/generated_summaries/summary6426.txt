Local legend has it that Old Forge pizza began 88 years ago with grandmother Ghigiarelli, whose family restaurant, Ghigiarelli's, still stands on Main Street. Red is made with tomato sauce and cheese; white is cheese only, double crust, with olive oil and rosemary sprinkled on top, although they recently introduced a new version with broccoli. This is Old Forge pizza and all the caf√©s here make it. Next to him is a stack of pizza crusts. Mrs. Ghigiarelli lived below a gentlemen's club where the clients played cards.
