The iPhone has remained the world's top-selling smartphone, save for a few quarters when it was dethroned by phones in Samsung's Galaxy S line. Historically, rollouts of new Apple products have been near-mystical affairs for fans. But after making up nearly 24% of all smartphones sold in late 2011, Apple's device is now down to about 14%, while Android phones account for a whopping 79%. It will have over 200 new features, according to Apple, including the ability to switch voice-activated digital assistant Siri to a male voice. "It has an incredible all new design, one that's more fun, more colorful than any iPhone we've made yet," said Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for marketing.
