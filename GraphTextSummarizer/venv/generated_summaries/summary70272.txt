A few days later, the crew was told the ship was under investigation for arms trafficking, and last Wednesday, the captain and crew were charged. "It's normal for many ships to have some type of self-defense on board." The crew member in touch with CNN said the ship's security team keeps the rifles in a locker on board. He came back to the ship once, to move the ship from the docks to anchor in Maracaibo Bay, but he was held on land while the crew members were told to stay on the ship, the crew member said. The crew member who spoke to CNN said there were "normal shipboard conditions" while the ship has been detained and that there was never any danger or threat of physical harm.
