And so it goes with Sen. Ted Cruz, at least when it comes to killing Obamacare. While some polls show that two-thirds of tea party sympathizers are just fine with a shutdown over health care reform, a majority of independent voters are not. In it, Cruz gets to cuddle the tea party while taking on the evil establishment â€” and by that he means the awful folks in his own party who would not shut down the government over a doomed move to kill Obamacare. Only he was asking Senate Republicans to vote against something that would actually kill Obamacare. Right now, Cruz has divided the Republican Party in a Palinesque way, only worse because he is an actual senator with actual authority who could have an actual presidential candidacy.
