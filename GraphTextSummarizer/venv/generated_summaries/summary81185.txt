Last year was considered the fourth busiest Atlantic hurricane year since 1944. Storms acquire a name when they are designated tropical storms, with sustained maximum winds of at least 39 mph. In 2008, there were 16 named storms and eight hurricanes, five of which were major -- that is, classified as Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity -- with winds of 111 mph or higher. Though they foresee fewer storms than last year, all the forecasts except the one from the Weather Research Center would translate into an above-average season. The latest prediction for the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season agrees with three previous ones, forecasting a season that will be at least a bit milder than last year's.
