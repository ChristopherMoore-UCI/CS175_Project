By 2001 Derby winner Galileo, prepotent sire of, among others, Frankel, and out of 2004 Oaks winner Ouija Board, Australia was bred by Lord Derby himself, whose ancestor gave this race its name. Sent off as a well backed 11-8 favorite, Australia ultimately lived up his billing as a horse worthy of adding his name to a roster of champions that includes the likes of Nijinsky, Mill Reef and Sea the Stars. The oft-quoted English horseracing authority James Weatherby once said, "Fortunately, nobody knows how to breed a Derby winner. For Lord Derby he became the first member of his family to breed the winner since the 1933 champion Hyperion But while the British public are accustomed to antipodean sporting success on their shores, in this case, Australia has a pedigree that's a little closer to home.
