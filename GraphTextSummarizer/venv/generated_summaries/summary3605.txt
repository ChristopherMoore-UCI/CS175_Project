Bolt made an appalling start and had to charge through the field to claim second place, 0.11 seconds behind, with Asafa Powell in third place. -- Yohan Blake stunned Usain Bolt over 100m in the Jamaica Olympic trials to signal his intent ahead of the London Games where they will battle again for gold medal glory. Bolt was disqualified for a false start in the 100m in the world championships in Daegu last year, leaving the way clear for the 22-year-old Blake. It may have been playing on his mind as he got left off the blocks and could not make up the deficit on Blake, who shares the same coach in Glen Mills. Only the top three in the Jamaica trials are selected for the individual events at the Olympics, so there was not room for error by any of the star sprinters.
