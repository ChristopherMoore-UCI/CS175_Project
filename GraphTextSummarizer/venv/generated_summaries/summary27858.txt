Recently the Korean government approved the 2012 DPRK Amateur Golf Open, meaning that Harris will be back next May with another batch of scratch golfers and curious hackers looking to play on one of the most hard to reach courses on the planet. Reporters Without Border's annual Press Freedom Index ranked North Korea 177 out of 178 counties, making it one of most repressive countries in the world to be a journalist. "Originally I was trying to play golf in Cuba, Iran and North Korea," explained 35-year-old Philadelphia-based computer programmer Warwick Poole, one of the 17 golfers who made the trip. North Korea puts heavy restrictions on journalists entering the country. Along with the 18-hole Pyongyang Golf Course, and a nine hole course next to a hotel in the city, a $73 million championship course was built near the North-South border during calmer times.
