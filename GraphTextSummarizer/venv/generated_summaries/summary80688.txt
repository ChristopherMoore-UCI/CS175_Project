High speed, worn parts led to deadly Reno Air Races crash The Reno Air Race Association made several changes ahead of this year's event to improve safety, as recommended by the federal safety board and the association's own expert panel. Reflecting on the "devastating blow" that last year's crash dealt to the Reno "air race family," Reno Air Racing Association President and CEO Mike Houghton talked about the "tremendous sorrow" many had experienced and the resilience and courage of those whose relatives were killed. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, last year's crash of the modified P-51 airplane -- named "Galloping Ghost" and flown by pilot Jimmy Leeward -- was caused by the failure of several lock nuts on the left trim tab, which is part of the airplane's tail. Even though his cousin saw the accident last year from the grandstands, Paulazzo said, "I know it was a freak thing." Paulazzo's biggest disappointment is that part of the course was moved back per the NTSB's recommendation. The five-day Reno Air Races features six classes of race planes, some acrobatic performances and flights by military demonstration teams.
