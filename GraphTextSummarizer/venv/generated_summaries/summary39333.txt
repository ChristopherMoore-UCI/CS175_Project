Heart attack prognosis may depend on what's in your medicine cabinet In effect, red yeast rice is a low-dose lovastatin, which may explain why it can sometimes cause muscle pain in statin-intolerant patients, according to Becker. "Despite the preliminary evidence that the average patient suffering from muscle pain might see some lipid-lowering without having the pain again, we're not to ready to recommend red yeast rice to our patients," says Paul Phillips, M.D., a cardiologist who runs a clinic for statin-related muscle complications at Scripps Mercy Hospital, in San Diego, California. In an editorial accompanying Becker's study, Dr. Phillips notes that the incidence of muscle pain reported among the study participants taking red yeast rice (about 7 percent) could be artificially low.
