The Malaysian government is in the process of acquiring tools from companies such as Petronas, Sapura Kencana, Boustead and DEFTECH, acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin said Thursday. Relatives of those on board have lambasted Malaysian officials for weeks, saying they have not been forthcoming and transparent in releasing data about the plane, which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board. More specialized devices will be needed in this new stage of the search, which will focus on reanalyzing data to help ensure the correct search area; conducting a detailed mapping of the sea bed; and deploying specialized autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Who has the data investigators used to shape their search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and why hasn't it been released to the public? "That's why there's so little credibility right now about why this search zone has been identified." Search officials turn to private companies for help With no tangible evidence of Flight 370 after more than two months of searching, officials are reaching out to commercial companies for help.
