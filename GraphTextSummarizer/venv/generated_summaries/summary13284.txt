The Coast Guard says that because the ship picked up the refugees outside of U.S. territorial waters, it requested that Oasis of the Seas turn over the group of Cubans at the ship's next port of call, which was Cozumel. The cruise ship was on a seven-night voyage from Port Everglades, Florida, to Cozumel, Mexico. Once the Cubans were on board, the Royal Caribbean crew gave them food, water and medical attention. The cruise liner alerted the U.S. Coast Guard, which advised the ship to continue to Cozumel and disembark all refugees in Mexico. In waters south of Cuba, near the Cayman Islands, the ship encountered a small boat carrying 19 male and four female Cuban citizens Wednesday.
