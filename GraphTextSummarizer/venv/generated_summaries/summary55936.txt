By the time of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee in 1977, much was different. Hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets of London to cheer the queen as she toured her capital, while millions more folks, including a 10-year-old me, took part in street parties up and down the land. This will be the moment when people show how proud they are to have Elizabeth as their head of state. During this jubilee weekend, millions of people will sing the British national anthem, "God Save The Queen." I remember doing projects at school about the royal family and also receiving my Silver Jubilee coin.
