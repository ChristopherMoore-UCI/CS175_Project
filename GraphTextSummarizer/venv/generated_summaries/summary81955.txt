He took another of Muller's records for Germany's all-time leading scorer when he grabbed his 69th goal in a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia in a World Cup warmup game earlier this month. Boateng's half-brother Jerome was in the Germany side, only the second time in World Cup history this has occurred. It was his fifth goal in World Cup finals, equaling the African record held by the great Roger Milla of Cameroon. Klose also became only the third man to score in four World Cup finals tournaments, along with Pele and fellow German Uwe Seeler. "It doesn't matter whether I play from the start or come off the bench: all games are important and 15 goals in 20 World Cup games isn't bad," said Klose, who plays for Italian club Lazio.
