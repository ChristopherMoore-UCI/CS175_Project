-- Blogger Perez Hilton said he has no regrets about posting a Twitter message that linked to a controversial upskirt photo of Miley Cyrus this week. The photo appeared to have been digitally altered to give the impression that Cyrus was not wearing underwear, according to Behar, who saw a copy of the photo provided by Hilton. The photo never appeared on Hilton's celebrity gossip website, but was linked to a message he sent to the 2 million followers of his Twitter account. Hilton has frequently satirized Miley Cyrus, a teenaged Disney star who is approaching adulthood with cameras constantly tracking her. Other photos taken at the same time clearly showed panties under her white dress, Hilton said.
