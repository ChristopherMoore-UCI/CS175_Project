However, one Palestinian official, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, said that funneling food, cement and other goods via other means, such as Greek ships, missed the point, which he said is to "immediately lift, not ease" Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza. A spokeswoman for The Audacity of Hope, a U.S. ship full of activists (but no humanitarian aid) that was barred last week by Greek authorities from sailing to Gaza, said the Greek offer "doesn't really address the issue for us, (which is) ending the naval blockade. On Sunday, Erakat said that while Palestinian leaders "support international engagement in lifting the unjust and inhumane Israeli blockade," the Quartet's statement and their opposition to the planned flotilla to Gaza skirt the broader challenges in the region. The Audacity of Hope and the nine other ships are aiming to promote public awareness about Israel's blockade of Gaza and, in part, to commemorate a May 2010 incident in which Israeli troops boarded Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries. The Greek government has said it won't allow any of the boats in the flotilla to sail to Gaza because their mission is too dangerous.
