Usually about 200 people are involved in building a home for Wallrath's group, but more than 4,000 volunteers chipped in to help "Extreme Makeover" build Zeigler and Hansen's home in Salado, Texas. The spotlight also led "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" to partner with Wallrath on a special project last month: building a home for one of the victims of the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas. "I think every time we look around, we'll always feel that." In mid-December, at an event honoring Zeigler and Hansen, Wallrath announced that Operation Finally Home had established a Fort Hood Victims' Fund to help all of the families affected by the attack. "It's just been incredible," Wallrath said last month. After helping renovate the home of a young Marine who had been severely wounded in Iraq, Wallrath realized there were thousands of other injured war veterans who needed a hand.
