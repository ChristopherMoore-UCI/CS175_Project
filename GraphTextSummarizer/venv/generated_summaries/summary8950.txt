In 1996 the lead singer of Pulp, Jarvis Cocker, caused a furor at the Brit Awards in London when he invaded the stage during Jackson's performance of "Earth Song" in protest "at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. Sharpton added that the song Jackson co-wrote with Lionel Richie, "We Are the World," a 1985 charity single that raised an estimated $50 million for famine relief in Africa, ushered in Live Aid and the era of celebrity philanthropy. Jackson had been invited with his children and entourage to Bahrain by the king's son, Sheikh Abdulla bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who lavished money on Jackson and built a recording studio, which he believed would be used to record albums by Jackson using material the sheikh had helped to write. Michael Jackson, the ultimate showman, craved attention and was rarely disappointed. In the 2005 trial conducted in the glare of the world's media spotlight, Jackson was cleared of child molestation charges.
