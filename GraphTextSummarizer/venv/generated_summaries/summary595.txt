Jamieson, vice president of marketing at a new-media advertising company, wrote President Barack Obama in January because her husband, Herv√© Fonkou Takoulo, was facing deportation to his native Cameroon. Investigators are looking to determine whether "appropriate separation" between Jamieson's letter to the president and Takoulo's deportation case were violated. I can't imagine that at the top of the Obama administration that they realize that something like this is happening," Jamieson told CNN. After he and Jamieson married on 2005, Takoulo applied for a green card based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. But they did get two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers waiting outside their East Village, Manhattan apartment on June 3 when Takoulo was leaving the apartment to go to the gym.
