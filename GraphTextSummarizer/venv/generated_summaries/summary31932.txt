Gonzalo Higuain got the stadium rocking with a goal in the 11th minute, as he latched on to a hopeful long ball that Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano completely misjudged, and fired past a helpless Victor Valdes. , Cristiano Ronaldo helped Real Madrid claim their first trophy of the season on Wednesday night against arch rivals Barcelona, who had to play for more than an hour with ten men after Adriano was shown a straight red card in the 27th minute. The Portuguese striker flicked a delightful ball over Pique before dispatching the ball into Valdes' bottom corner to leave the Barcelona defense in shell shock. Ten minutes later, Barcelona's capitulation was complete as Adriano, playing out of position at left back after a pre match injury to Dani Alves forced Jordi Alba to switch flanks with the Brazilian, was shown a deserved red card for hauling down Ronaldo as he broke through on goal. Barcelona had won the first leg 3-2, but Madrid's pair of away goals proved vital as their 2-1 win at the Bernabeau handed them the title on away goals.
