There were no immediate reports of casualties, but damage was reported in the cities of Paso Canoa, David and Puerto Armuelles. -- Dozens of families frightened by aftershocks slept outside overnight Wednesday after a magnitude 6.2 earthquake shook coastal Panama near the border with Costa Rica. Cyclists from Costa Rica, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Germany, who were in David for a bicycle race, also had to leave their hotel rooms. The quake was centered about 235 miles (380 km) west of Panama City, near the town of David, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . Family members told CNN that patients at the Regional Hospital of David went outside and refused to go back in because aftershocks were still being felt.
