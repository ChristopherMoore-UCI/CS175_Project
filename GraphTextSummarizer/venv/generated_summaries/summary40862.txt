After being released on bond with an ankle bracelet, Enright successfully completed both in- and out-patient alcohol rehabilitation, performed community service projects and attended Alcoholics Anonymous, where he became a lecturer and sponsor, according to Fisher. -- A man who stabbed a New York City taxi driver three years ago after asking whether he was Muslim will serve 9Â½ years in prison. Prosecutors originally recommended 18 years in jail for Enright before dropping it to 9Â½ years. In previous court appearances, Enright's lawyer said his client suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism. Enright made an eloquent statement to the court, blaming himself, taking responsibility for the crime and apologizing to the victim, his lawyer, Lawrence Fisher, told CNN on Wednesday.
