In June 1979, Alcala beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, authorities said. -- The Manhattan district attorney announced Thursday new indictments against Rodney Alcala, the so-called "Dating Game Killer," in connection with the deaths of two women in New York during the 1970s. Alcala, 67, is currently on death row in California for killing four women and a 12-year-old girl there. A year before his appearance on "The Dating Game," according to prosecutors, Alcala raped, sodomized and killed 18-year-old Jill Barcomb and 27-year-old nurse Georgia Wixted in California. Authorities asked for the public's help in determining whether any of the people in the photographs were victims of Alcala.
