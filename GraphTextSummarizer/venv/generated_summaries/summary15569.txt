Reigning four-time champion Sebastian Vettel got the better of great rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari for fourth place. -- Nico Rosberg capped a memorable week by winning the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim but Sunday's race will also be remembered for a frightening opening lap incident involving the unfortunate Felipe Massa. Earlier in the season, Massa was also involved in a 300 kph collision at the Canadian Grand Prix, accusing rival driver Sergio Perez of being "dangerous" as they battled for fourth and both ended in the barriers. The victory extended his title lead over teammate Lewis Hamilton to 14 points. It was the second race in a row in which the 33-year-old Massa has been the victim of a first lap incident, his hopes at the British Grand Prix ended when Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari careered off.
