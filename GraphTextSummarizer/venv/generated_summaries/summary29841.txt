An ISIS outfit based in northeastern Syria has been drawing up plans since at least the middle of last year to kidnap Westerners and others in neighboring countries, a Middle East security source told CNN on Friday. The source said the terrorists want to go into countries such as Lebanon and Jordan and bring hostages back to Syria, where they could be used in ISIS propaganda videos, according to intelligence gathered on the planning. There are many ISIS sympathizers in northern Jordan, which borders Syria, said Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a retired airman and a former U.S. military attach√© in Syria. After producing at least seven highly publicized clips in which hostages were beheaded, ISIS may believe it needs to kidnap more people. Another big concern, the experts said, would be that other groups could abduct people and sell them to ISIS.
