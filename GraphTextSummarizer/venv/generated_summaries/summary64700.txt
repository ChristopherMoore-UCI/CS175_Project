Since 2005, TED has granted wishes to three people a year and continues to work with past winners on achieving their wishes. TED Prize winners typically keep their wishes secret until the conference. "Whenever I've been to TED, I've been struck by how towards the end of the conference, you had a room full of influential connected people absolutely burning with the possibility of inspiration, and it felt like something could be done with that," Anderson said. TED began in the 1980s as a conference in California focusing on technology, entertainment and design but has since expanded to include virtually any subject and conferences in other locations. Anderson, who built and eventually sold a magazine publishing empire in the 1980s and 1990s, first attended a TED conference in 1998 and was intrigued that many people said it was the highlight of their year.
