Brazil now boasts the second highest number of Facebook users after the United States, and local tech industry leaders are fond of pointing out that Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger is from Brazil. Organized by 500 Startups, a Silcon Valley firm that helps fund emerging tech companies, the tour brought 42 tech insiders last week to Sao Paolo, Brazil. The Brazil tour was the latest in a series of Geeks on a Plane trips that have brought tech execs and investors to India, China, Japan and other countries. -- They are an exclusive group of globe-trotting Internet investors, startup founders and tech junkies. "We made five or six investments in Brazil over the last nine months," said 500 Startups co-founder Dave McClure.
