" Arizona execution raises questions over novel lethal injections Wood's slow death is fueling a debate stirred up as states look for new drug combinations for lethal injections, thanks in part to pharmaceutical companies' decisions to withhold or stop making drugs used in the past.

John McCain and others as tantamount to torture.
