The reason for the decline in deaths is that countries with greater risks during pregnancy and childbirth are taking more effective measures, such as training more midwives and strengthening hospitals and health centers to assist pregnant women, Chan said. "To achieve our global goal of improving maternal health and to save women's lives, we need to do more to reach those who are most at risk," said Unicef Executive Director Anthony Lake. -- The number of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth has dropped by a third in the past two decades, according to a report out Wednesday from four world bodies including Unicef and the World Health Organization. There are four major causes of death for pregnant women, according to the report: severe bleeding after childbirth, infections, hypertensive disorders, and unsafe abortion. "The global reduction in maternal death rates is encouraging news," said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan.
