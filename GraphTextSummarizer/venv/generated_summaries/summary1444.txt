"As alleged, rather than upholding and enforcing the law as they had sworn to do, these defendants made international gunrunning a family business," U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a news release. Rex Maralit, 44, an NYPD officer, and his brother, Wilfredo Maralit, 48, a Border Protection officer in Los Angeles, bought high-powered assault rifles, sniper rifles and pistols and then sent them to customers in the Philippines, the U.S. attorney's office said. "The brothers used their knowledge of the law to circumvent it, and sent dangerous weapons overseas without regard for the ultimate destination or targets." Between 2009 and March 2013, the brothers in America would special-order the desired firearms and send them internationally in disguised shipments, according to a complaint from the U.S. attorney's office. A third brother in the Philippines, Ariel Maralit, 43, took specific orders from customers, authorities said.
