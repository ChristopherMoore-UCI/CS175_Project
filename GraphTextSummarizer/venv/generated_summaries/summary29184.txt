In addition to the bike ride, Jackson and his group go into small Alabama towns seeking to persuade landowners to donate land where community storm shelters can be built. Jackson and his friends rode across the state to raise money not only to help rebuild but also to build community storm shelters. But these days sports legend Bo Jackson knows charity. Jackson has dedicated his post-pro-sports days to raising money to help restore the areas of his native Alabama devastated by a tornado in April 2011. Rocked by the news, Jackson, a native of Bessemer, Alabama, who starred in football and baseball at Auburn University, knew he couldn't just sit idly by as the community that supported him in his climb to success was now in ruins.
