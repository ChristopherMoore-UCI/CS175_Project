Two years ago, the Louvre asked the Prado to study this portrait with the aim of getting it on loan for the Leonardo exhibit to start late next month, Prado officials said. Many copies of "Mona Lisa" were painted years after the fact, but this copy is different, experts say, because evidence shows it was painted at the same time and in the same studio as the original masterpiece, probably by one of Leonardo's assistants or pupils. At a packed news conference at the museum, Prado officials said the "Mona Lisa" copy underwent a big change in the 18th century, when someone ordered the colorful background landscape to be painted over in black. Prado officials said much more study will now be done on the copy, including trying to figure out exactly who painted it. "This copy is now one of the most important sources of information for working procedures in Leonardo's studios," the Prado said in a statement.
