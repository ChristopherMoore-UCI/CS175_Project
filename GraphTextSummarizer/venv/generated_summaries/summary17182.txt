Despite wanting to strip their passengers of basic comforts like toilets and seat pockets, Ryanair is doing good business. Charging £1 for toilets The toilet removal wasn't a surprise to passengers and critics because O'Leary announced in 2010 that Ryanair would charge £1 or €1 for passengers to use the toilet. Charging extra £40 to print boarding passes Ryanair currently charges passengers £40 (US$63) to print their boarding pass at the airport. A spokesman for Ryanair said that Boeing had been consulted over refitting the fleet with "vertical seats." The no-frills airline recently announced plans to cut down to just one toilet per aircraft (see below), and that had us wondering: are announcements like their toilet fee and "fat tax" tasteless marketing ploys, or is Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary just really cheap?
