Tony Kail, creator of Worldview Consulting, which helps train U.S. law enforcement staff about religious practices, said the cartels embraced figures like Jesus Malverde because they "hear prayers from dark places -- prayers traditional deities like the Mother Mary don't." A shrine dedicated to Malverde is located in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. -- The legend of Jesus Malverde is a more than century-old story  handed down from generation to generation of disenfranchised Mexicans. The story about Jesus Malverde caught his attention. Malverde's name has become so inextricably linked with drug trafficking that busts and other paraphernalia of him have been used as evidence against defendants in drug trials. For the young Martinez-Gonzalez, sharing the first name with a railroad bandito legend was "pretty cool," but what appealed to him more were the stories of Malverde's philanthropy and how he made his legend by helping the poor hard-working families in the western state of Sinaloa, Mexico.
