Lewis said he agreed a ranking system for races isn't fair -- not for bake sales, and not in other aspects of life. " In light of recent threats made against supporters of the group, college Republicans from several other California universities showed up by the carloads and volunteered to help staff the event, held on a campus plaza, Lewis said. On one side, the Berkeley College Republicans hosted their "Increase Diversity Bake Sale" -- a satirical event that charged customers different prices based on race and gender. Events similar to the Berkeley bake sale have taken place at other colleges across the country, generally organized by college Republican groups. There was no physical situation, which is really great," Berkeley College Republicans President Shawn Lewis said Tuesday afternoon, as the bake sale was nearing an end.
