Tensions last year The relationship between Seoul and Pyongyang became particularly strained last year as North Korea hurled dramatic threats against South Korea and the United States. North Korea has in previous years called for the cancellation of the annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, but without success. But South Korea says it wants to see action not words from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime. In last week's statement, a North Korean government spokesman conveyed Kim Jong Un's "sincere stand to ease tension and ensure peace" while also slamming "ill-boding, provocative remarks ... from South Korea" as well as "powder-reeking war exercises" involving the United States. But South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Eui-do said later Friday that if the North is sincere about improving ties, it "must show action" that South Korean citizens and the international community can accept.
