Understanding tiger distribution allows scientists and forestry officials to designate protected areas and wildlife corridors that allow tigers to breed and disperse, and also to understand where best to patrol against poaching. By rezoning critical tiger habitat currently slated for deforestation, mining or agriculture into ecosystem restoration concessions, the Indonesian government can protect wildlife, support local communities and ensure that the forests are managed sustainably. Using camera traps, scat surveys and other scientific tools WWF and its partners are able to estimate the population size and distribution of tigers across Sumatra. If given enough habitat, plenty of prey and protection from poaching, tigers are breeding machines. It's tough to make the case for protecting tiger forests when faced with stiff competition from the highly profitable pulp, paper and palm oil industries.
