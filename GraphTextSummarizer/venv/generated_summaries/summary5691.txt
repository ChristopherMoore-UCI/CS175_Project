Hundreds of potential jurors were introduced to accused killer Aaron Hernandez during the first phase of jury selection on Friday. The day after opening statements, jurors will be taken by bus to see the inside of Hernandez's home, at the request of the defense. Prosecutors are also seeking immunity for Hernandez's fianc√©e and mother of his child, Shayanna Jenkins. The panel will also be shown the killing scene, about a mile from the home, and cellphone towers that allegedly captured a ping from Hernandez's phone in an industrial park the night of Odin Lloyd's death in that location. She also is a cousin of Tanya Singleton who spent time at Singleton's home, where a dusty silver SUV was discovered by police in Singleton's garage after Hernandez's arrest.
