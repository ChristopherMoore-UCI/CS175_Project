"Charlie Sheen has been discharged from a hospital in New York and is returning to Los Angeles today," Sheen representative Stan Rodenfield said Tuesday afternoon. Since police did not file charges relating to Tuesday's New York incident, it has no bearing on the Colorado case, the official said. An ambulance carried him from the hotel to New York Downtown Hospital at 1:30 a.m., a New York Police Department spokesman said. The son of actor Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen recently signed a new contract last summer to continue with his hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men." Police took actor Charlie Sheen to a hospital early Tuesday after responding to a call at New York's Plaza Hotel concerning "an emotionally disturbed person," a law enforcement source said.
