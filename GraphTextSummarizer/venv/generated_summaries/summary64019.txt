The shipment was handled by US Airways, which also has delivered imported fish from throughout the world to Pets Plus Pet Center for more than a decade, store manager Mike Mullarkey said. The body of Jon Kenoyer, a California man who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, was being donated to an Allentown, Pennsylvania, research group, Life Quest Anatomical. Mullarkey said police supervised the return of the shipment to US Airways, which rerouted it to Life Quest. "But something like that, I think, should be handled a little more delicately." US Airways issued a statement of apology: "Regrettably, there was an unfortunate mixup yesterday at the US Airways Cargo facility near Philadelphia International Airport. " A spokeswoman at Life Quest Anatomical declined to comment.
