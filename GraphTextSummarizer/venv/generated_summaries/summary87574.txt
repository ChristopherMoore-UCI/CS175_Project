"What we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space, and they never dreamed that [they] could," Branson said last year. " "The captive carry flight signifies the start of what we believe will be extremely exciting and successful spaceship flight test program," said Burt Rutan, founder of Scaled Composites, which built the spacecraft. He has said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of Earth travel, jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes. -- British billionaire Richard Branson's dream of space travel that thousands of people can afford took a leap toward reality with the maiden flight of the world's first commercial spacecraft over California's Mojave Desert. The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, going first to a free glide and then to a powered flight before commercial flights begin.
