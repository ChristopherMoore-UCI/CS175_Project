The mission will be Discovery's 37th to space, and the 30th shuttle mission dedicated to international space station assembly and maintenance, NASA says. -- Space shuttle Discovery was scheduled to launch early Tuesday morning for a mission to deliver equipment to the international space station. One of Discovery's seven astronauts, Nicole Stott, will remain on the space station as a flight engineer, replacing astronaut Timothy Kopra, who will return home aboard Discovery as a mission specialist, according to the NASA Web page for the mission. The seven-member crew was boarding the orbiter Monday night on Cape Canaveral's launch pad 39A. Commander Rick Sturckow and Pilot Kevin Ford will guide Discovery to the space station after launch, scheduled for 1:36 a.m. ET Tuesday, NASA said. Discovery rests on launch pad 39A at Cape Canaveral on Monday evening.
