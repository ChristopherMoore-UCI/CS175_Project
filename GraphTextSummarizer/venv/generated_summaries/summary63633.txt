They know that people aren't quitting Facebook, but that doesn't mean that users aren't frustrated or concerned (or would be if they understood what was happening). Facebook isn't just a space for users to share; it is built on the backs of people and profits off of the data people entrust to them. Do people really know who is included in their "Friends-of-Friends?" Facebook doesn't just need to fix its privacy settings. Facebook rightfully believes that it's important to give users control over their settings, to empower them to make decisions about what's accessible. In response, Facebook announced a new privacy model to address complaints that it's too darn hard to actually navigate privacy settings on Facebook.
