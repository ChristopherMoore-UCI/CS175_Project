Samsung sees graphene as the "perfect material" for next generation device, and the breakthrough could have huge implications for its commercial production. Graphene: 'Miracle material' will be in your home sooner than you think If this deficiency can be overcome, however, graphene could be used in a huge range of devices as a super-fast replacement for silicon transistors, which are already reaching their capacity. "We expect this discovery to accelerate the commercialization of graphene, which could unlock the next era of consumer electronic technology." It has not been revealed if Samsung plans to make the groundbreaking synthesis process public, a move that would rapidly accelerate the adoption of graphene into daily use.
