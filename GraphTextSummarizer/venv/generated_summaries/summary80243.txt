A spokesman for the White House National Security Council accused Cuban authorities Monday of using "tactics of intimidation and harassment to stifle peaceful dissent" as the pope's visit nears. Cuban authorities have released dozens of members of the "Ladies in White" group after detaining them, a dissident said Monday. "The detention of members of the Damas de Blanco this weekend in Havana in the lead up to Pope Benedict's visit underscores the disdain of Cuban authorities for the universal rights of the Cuban people," spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a statement. "We were doing our march as we usually do when women dressed in civilian clothes stopped us," said group member Katia Sonia, who said she was among a group of 22 demonstrators arrested Sunday. The organization, known as "Damas de Blanco" in Spanish, is composed of the family members of Cuban dissidents, many of whom have been jailed.
