But a Haitian judge has charged the 10 with child trafficking, they said. " "The intention was simply to go down and try to be an aid in ministering to children that had been orphaned in the quake," the pastor said. But that is kidnapping, and it is more serious because it's involving children. Mel Coulter, the father of Charisa Coulter, 23, who is among those arrested, told CNN affiliate KTVB on Saturday that the group members "want to bring kids out who have no home, who have no parents, who have no hope -- and this was an attempt to give them the hope that they've lost in Haiti." -- Ten Americans held in Haiti on charges of illegally trying to take 33 children out of the country were scheduled to have their first court hearing Monday afternoon, according to the U.S. State Department.
