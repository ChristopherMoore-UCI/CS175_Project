The flight experienced landing gear problems, according to a recording of a pilot's conversation with air traffic control. "Our preference would be to proceed over to JFK and execute an emergency landing over there ... and if it's not completely obvious, we just want to confirm, we are declaring an emergency." After the pilot told passengers about the issues with the landing gear, "We're envisioning belly slide the whole way, with sparks," Benzenberg said. The passengers who shot the footage, Chase Benzenberg and Alessandro Albero, said Monday on CNN's "American Morning" that what first seemed amusing soon turned into a serious situation. -- Cellphone video captured by two New York-bound Delta Air Lines passengers Saturday night portrays the fear of an impending crash and the relief that followed when the pilot averted a catastrophic landing. Two passengers aboard Flight 4951 from Atlanta, Georgia, to White Plains, New York, taped the dramatic moments of their flight's emergency landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
