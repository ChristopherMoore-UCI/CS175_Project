, Russian authorities said Sunday that firefighters were gaining control over blazes sweeping across thousands of acres in western Russia. At least 28 people have been killed and thousands left homeless by the wildfires, which are among the worst ever to hit western Russia. A hot, dry summer has been a key factor in the fires, drying out large parts of land and igniting the peat bogs that lie all over central Russia. "The most difficult situation with wildfires remains in the Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir and Voronezh regions and the Republic of Mordovia, where fires threaten several populated settlements," the ministry's information department said. Latest figures from the ministry showed that 128,500 hectares (317,530 acres) were burned or had burned, and 774 "hotbeds of wildfire" were counted as of 6 a.m. Sunday.
