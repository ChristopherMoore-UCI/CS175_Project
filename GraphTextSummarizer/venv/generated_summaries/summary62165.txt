-- Predawn gunfire and clashes from a violent military crackdown on protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Saturday left Egyptians feeling shocked, confused and angered in the hours that followed. The clashes came a day after large crowds of protesters amassed at Tahrir Square, many of them angry with Egypt's new military rulers. Hundreds of protesters -- calling for Egypt's ruling military council to prosecute former president, Hosni Mubarak -- fled the scene as clouds of tear gas billowed through central Cairo. After Mubarak's ouster in February, the military took control -- riding a wave of popularity for refusing to fire on pro-democracy protesters during 18 days of anti-government protests. " In scenes reminiscent of street protests last January and February, activists have once again blocked entry into Tahrir, using coils of barbed wire apparently left behind by the military.
