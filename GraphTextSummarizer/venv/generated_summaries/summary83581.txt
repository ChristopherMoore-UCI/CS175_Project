"However, 2014/15 is still a record season for Premier League spending, with clubs having spent over £900m, significantly ahead of the previous record of £760m. "This level of spending has been made possible in large part through the broadcast revenue Premier League clubs enjoy. Transfer deadline day marks the end of the period in which clubs are allowed to sign players -- meaning that once the window 'slams shut' at 11pm GMT, no further business can be done. While most of the business is done during the month long period, the frenetic nature of deadline day means some clubs are left waiting until the final minutes to get their deals done -- leading to masses of excitement, cynicism and often disappointment from fans across social media. In Spain, where the window closed on Friday, clubs spent $79.5 million during the transfer window up from $53.7 million at the same time last year. "While the summer window saw a record level of transfer spending, so far we have seen spending in January being slightly more reserved," said Dan Jones, Partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte.
