Hillary Clinton to decide on 2016 run around end of year Clinton supporters push back against the idea that there are bad memories for her in Iowa. "While Republicans continue to bicker, Hillary Clinton is focused on celebrating her good friend and former colleague, Sen. Harkin, and on helping candidates in Iowa get elected in 2014 who share in the Democrats' vision for the future," said Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for Correct the Record, an outside communications group defending Clinton. Clinton will return to Iowa on Sunday for the politically important Harkin Steak Fry, put on by longtime Sen. Tom Harkin. " "Hillary Clinton is headed to Iowa for the first time since 2008," reads the on-screen text atop clips of negative news coverage of the night Clinton lost. The Republican National Committee is starting a concerted effort Friday to remind their supporters and reporters who will be covering Clinton in Iowa that the Hawkeye State has not always been friendly to the former secretary of state and first lady.
