Born 2Â½ months early, Noah Pacheco weighed less than 3 pounds and was immediately put in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) -- a vital step for premature babies but often financially and emotionally stressful for families. "Dr. Daneshmand made me feel very at ease," said first-time parent Sofia Diouri, who at just 24 weeks pregnant had to have an emergency C-section earlier this month due to excessive bleeding. Families apply for assistance from Miracle Babies through hospital social workers. For years, Daneshmand gave patients money out of his own pocket before he started Miracle Babies in November 2009. The group provides financial assistance for items such as housing and medical expenses, baby supplies and transportation costs.
