No one was injured when K-9 search dog Ivan discharged a bullet as he indicated the gun's location, Lawrence Police Chief John Romero told CNN. As of Sunday, all three were being held in jail and awaiting a Monday arraignment, Romero said. After the men exited the vehicle, Ivan's handler, Essex County Sheriff's Lt. John Pickles, commanded the dog to search for a gun after a shell casing was found in the backseat of the car, Romero said. " After Ivan recovered and fired the weapon, the three men were arrested and charged with possession of a firearm, possession of ammunition, receiving a firearm with a defaced serial number and receiving stolen property, Romero said. "Everyone on the scene was startled, including Ivan," Romero said with a chuckle.
