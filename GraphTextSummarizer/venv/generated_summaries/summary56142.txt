Germany has produced exhibits on the Holocaust and Nazism before but never since World War II has one focused solely on the man who taught an entire nation to hate. Swastikas are banned in Germany but Thamer said museums have special permission to display them for historical purposes. Deborah Lipstadt, a scholar of the Holocaust, also felt such exhibits are important. Some 55 million people died in World War II, including 6 million Jews who perished in the Nazi-orchestrated Holocaust. She found powerful a similar exhibition of the power of Nazi propaganda at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
