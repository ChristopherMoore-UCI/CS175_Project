Stein, who was once solicitor general for Aruba, said authorities "are not certain of the motive in the case. -- The bodies of an American couple killed on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten were released to family members Tuesday as questions about their deaths remain unanswered. The bodies of Michael and Thelma King of South Carolina were discovered Friday at their oceanfront residence in Cupecoy, in what Stein described as "an ugly scene." A man arrested in connection with the stabbing deaths had been scheduled to appear before a judge Tuesday, but that appearance was pushed to Wednesday, according to the island's solicitor general, Taco Stein. "There are strong indications he is involved in the crime," Stein said Monday of the suspect, without divulging details.
