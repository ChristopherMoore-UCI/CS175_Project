American officials obtained a restraining order blocking any sale and preventing the painting from being moved after Italian authorities asked for help in connection to the prosecution of Gabriella Amati. The case involves a 1909 work by Picasso known as "Compotier et tasse" which had been offered for private sale in New York. She and her late husband, Angelo Maj, were charged by Italian prosecutors with embezzlement and fraud. The couple allegedly worked with an official for the city of Naples and embezzled approximately $44 million of the city's tax revenues, according to Italian court documents. Agents working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement located and recovered the painting in New York, where it was being offered for sale, on May 21.
