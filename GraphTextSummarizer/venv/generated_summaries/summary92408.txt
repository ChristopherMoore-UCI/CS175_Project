Among the courses he is alleged to have attended were Reconnaissance School, Sniper School,; Drill Sergeant Course,; U.S. Army Ranger School and several Special Forces schools and courses, the Army charge sheet says. Other charges say he knowingly wore up to fifteen service ribbons and awards he was not entitled to wear, including a Marine Corps Combat Action ribbon and a Presidential Unit Citation, which is awarded for an extremely meritorious or heroic act, usually in the face of an armed enemy. Maj. Stoney Crump, the senior enlisted officer for the Medical Center Brigade, had the "intent to deceive" when he submitted a false official record incorrectly stating that he had attended several military educational courses, according to the Army charge sheet. -- A top military official at Walter Reed Army Medical Center has been relieved of duty and charged with knowingly falsifying his personnel records. As the top enlisted soldier assigned to the Walter Reed medical brigade, Crump would have had continuous contact with wounded troops at the hospital who have won numerous medals and awards in the combat zone.
