Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Arsenal striker Robin Van Persie, the club announced on Wednesday night. Last summer saw Arsenal lose two of their start players, Samir Nasri to rivals Manchester City and club captain Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona. Van Persie was appointed Arsenal captain last season after the departure of Fabregas. "Manchester United is pleased to announce it has reached agreement with Arsenal Football Club for the transfer of Robin Van Persie," said a statement on the club's website. In July, Van Persie stunned Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger with a statement on his personal website that stated his "goal has been to win trophies with the team" and attempt to return the club to "its glory days."
