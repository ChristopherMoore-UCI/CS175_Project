Since Malala was 11, she has used her blog to encourage girls to go to school despite Taliban threats. "I was scared of being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education," she said last year. In January 2009, militants took over her once-tranquil city in Swat Valley and ordered schools to stop educating girls. " Her role as an activist led to the attack on the van carrying her and other girls home from school, two of whom were also hurt, but not as severely. She blogged about the Taliban's efforts to scare girls away from learning institutions.
