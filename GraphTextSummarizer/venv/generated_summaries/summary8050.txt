"It's just surreal how quickly someone can go, and how much we take for granted everyday," said Danvers High School student Chris Weimert, describing Ritzer as "the nicest teacher you could ever have. " Like Dzerkacz, Ritzer's aunt Shirley Martellucci said her niece never had any trouble with students -- including during the past two years, when she was at Danvers High. Students at Danvers High echoed that sentiment, as well as that of her school district describing Ritzer as "a dynamic and brilliant ray of light." "She was always the teacher (who would) go the extra mile for students, always the teacher to be there for students after school," said Kyle Cahill. Meanwhile, the tight-knit community of Danvers is at a loss to explain why someone might take the life of Ritzer, a 24-year-old known for posting inspirational messages on her Twitter account and offering students extra help when they needed it.
