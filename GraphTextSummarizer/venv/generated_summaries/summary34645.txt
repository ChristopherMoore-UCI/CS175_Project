-- After talking about spent nuclear fuel rods at Fukushima for more than two years, it is slightly disconcerting to suddenly be a few meters from them. "We have removed large debris (from the pool) and cleaned it with a water vacuum," said plant chief Akira Ono. In the four hours we were on site, our dosimeters showed we were exposed to 0.06 millisieverts, the equivalent of two week's radiation away from Fukushima, a TEPCO official told me. We were also escorted to the H4N tank area, the scene of a recent leak of contaminated water. Officials say they have done this more than 1,200 times before under normal circumstances.
