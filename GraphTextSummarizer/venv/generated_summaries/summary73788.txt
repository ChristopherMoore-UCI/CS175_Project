-- Google agreed Friday to delete data it inadvertently collected from unsecured Wi-Fi networks when compiling its Street View mapping service in Britain, authorities said. "I am very pleased to have a firm commitment from Google to work with my office to improve its handling of personal information," Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said. The British government and privacy advocates have long been concerned about the personal data Google may have collected when its Street View cars drove around the country taking pictures for the service, which shows panoramic photographic views from street level. "We don't want another breach like the collection of payload data by Google Street View vehicles to occur again. Authorities cracked down, even pulling over Street View vehicles to make sure they had stopped collecting personal information.
