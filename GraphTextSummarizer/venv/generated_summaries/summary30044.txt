The robotics competition -- called FIRST: For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology -- was designed to get high school students interested in math and science careers. Maria is successful in high school while so many of her peers are struggling. -- It's her lunch break on a sunny afternoon in Phoenix and instead of chatting with friends in the courtyard, 17-year old Maria Castro is standing in front of a white board inside Carl Hayden Community High School. Watch Maria in the trailer for "Education in America: Don't Fail Me" For Maria, that meant writing up a proposal for an accelerated math class, roping in 31 other students to take part, and then literally begging the principal to find the funding. Where many students would be disheartened by what they heard, Maria was spurred to achieve even more.
