Rangers, who form one half of the famous 'Old Firm' rivalry with city neighbors Celtic, are awaiting the outcome of a tribunal which will rule whether they owe Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) more than Â£50 million ($78m) in tax. In a statement on the club's website Whyte said it was clear since his takeover in May 2011 that "the club was facing massive financial challenges both in terms of its ongoing financial structure and performance and the potential consequences of the HMRC first tier tax tribunal." HMRC insist the club used the method as a way to avoid paying tax and Whyte said Rangers must prepare for the worst. Scottish champions Rangers have made preparations in court for the club to go into administration as they wait to discover if they will be forced the pay the UK government over $78 million in tax. "In blunt terms, if we waited until the outcome of the tax tribunal, the risk of Rangers being faced with an unacceptable financial burden and years of uncertainty is too great."
