-- Fallen Chinese Communist Party heavyweight Bo Xilai kept up his vigorous defense against corruption charges Friday in China's most politically sensitive trial in decades. Bo Xilai trial: Son Bo Guagua hopes father can 'answer his critics' CNN's David McKenzie and Steven Jiang reported from Jinan. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi ($3.6 million) in bribes from Xu and another Dalian businessman, Tang Xiaolin. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. Bo, 64, is on trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.
