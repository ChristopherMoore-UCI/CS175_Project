While some may say the Thanksgiving holiday has become too commercialized thanks to huge retails deals drawing consumers to shopping centers before most people have finished washing dishes, #GivingTuesday is not about competing with other events of the season. As the hashtag suggests, social media is central to the #GivingTuesday effort. "We believe that #GivingTuesday can not only inspire more donations, in terms of both donation dollars and volunteer hours, but can help change the dialogue about giving," Calvin said. It isn't just online that people can contribute to the #GivingTuesday event -- live events are also planned. The 92nd Street Y in New York hopes to change that with its social media movement #GivingTuesday.
