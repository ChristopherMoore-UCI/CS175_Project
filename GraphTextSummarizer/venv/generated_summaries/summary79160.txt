Last year's beaten finalist took just one hour and 41 minutes to defeat Beck and will face France's unseeded Paul-Henri Mathieu in the third round, who carded a 7-6 6-4 6-3 victory over compatriot Guillaume Rufin. There was reason to cheer for the home crowd, with New York native James Blake advancing to the third round at the expense of Canada's Peter Polansky. The fifth seed is the highest placed player to be eliminated so far in New York, and he was joined by fellow seed Marin Cilic, who also tasted defeat on day four. It was a similar story for the next two sets, with Cilic claiming a comfortable win in the third, only for world number 147 Nishikori to pick up another tie break success in the fourth before crushing his higher-ranked opponent in the final set. The Swiss, who won the Flushing Meadows tournament five times in a row between 2004 and 2008, is yet to drop a set at the New York event.
