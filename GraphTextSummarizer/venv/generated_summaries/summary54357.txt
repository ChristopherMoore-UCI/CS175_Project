According to psychologist and Wharton management professor Jennifer Mueller, research shows that even as people explicitly aspire to creativity and strongly endorse it as a fundamental driving force of positive change, they routinely reject creative ideas and show an implicit bias against them under conditions of uncertainty. " Kelley, recognized as one of America's leading design innovators, is passionate about democratizing creativity by helping people develop creative confidence. These negative associations tend to be unacknowledged, and there is evidence that they are unconscious, as in the case of executives who demand creativity but continue to reject creative ideas. "Frame something positively, and people will behave differently." David Kelley, founder of the design firm IDEO, observes, "Creativity is being comfortable with having ideas and not fearing being judged when you put your ideas out there. Herein, however, lies the dilemma: Creativity is what we need to help us get through times of greatest uncertainty and difficulty.
