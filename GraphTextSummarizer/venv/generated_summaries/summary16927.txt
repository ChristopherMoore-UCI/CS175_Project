It's halfway through the season, and we welcome you to share your photos from Bourdain's upcoming travel destinations: Tanzania (October 26); Iran (November 2); Provincetown, Massachusetts (November 9); and Jamaica (November 16). Instagram users and CNN iReporters followed along with Bourdain each week, sharing their travel photos from the places he visited. For this season of CNN's "Parts Unknown," Anthony Bourdain has been expanding our horizons to show us places such as Paraguay, Vietnam and even New York's often-unexplored borough of the Bronx. -- Travel photos open windows to the unknown. We will add photos from these locations after each episode airs.
