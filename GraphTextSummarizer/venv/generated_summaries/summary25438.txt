-- Archaeologists excavating a site in East London have made an "extremely rare and unprecedented" find -- a delicately detailed dish made of hundreds of pieces of tiny glass petals, the Museum of London Docklands announced Wednesday. The cemetery -- which, by law, lay outside the city walls -- spanned more than 400 years of Roman occupation from the late 1st to early 5th centuries The excavations that uncovered the dish are part of an ongoing dig at the extensive eastern cemetery of Roman London, which was then called Londinium. "Piecing together and conserving such a complete artifact offered a rare and thrilling challenge," said conservator Liz Goodman, who did the work. Such beautifully crafted vessels were in vogue in the 1st and early 2nd centuries, the museum said.
