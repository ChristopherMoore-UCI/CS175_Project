Many tourists visit the polar bears via a tundra buggy, an all-terrain vehicle that provides a safe haven for polar bear viewing and photography. The U.S. Geological Survey projects that two-thirds of polar bears will disappear by the year 2050, as climate change melts sea ice. This annual migration provides tourists, photographers and scientists from around the world the unique opportunity to view polar bears up close and personal. Polar bears top the food chain in the Arctic, and people view them as a majestic symbol of the far north, said Buchanan. Yet despite their mighty presence, polar bears are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, with eight of the 19 polar bear subpopulations in decline, according to Krista Wright, the executive vice president of PBI.
