-- The White House rejected criticism Sunday that President Obama has not delivered on his promise of "change" during his first year in office. " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, on the same program, countered that "if you look at the first year of this administration, we haven't made much progress." Obama's travels have established relationships with world leaders that "lay a foundation for keeping America safe and making us a partner around the world," she added. White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the president has brought about "enormous change. " "I think what we've seen is a dramatic difference in terms of how the United States is perceived around the world," Jarrett told NBC's "Meet the Press," on the final Sunday before the president's State of the Union address.
