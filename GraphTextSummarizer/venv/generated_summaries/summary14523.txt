Meanwhile, world No. 4 Andy Murray will take on Ukrainian third seed Alexandr Dolgopolov in Sunday's Brisbane International final. The 31st-ranked Raonic, named 2011 ATP Newcomer of the Year after winning his first title in San Jose, defeated Spanish second seed Nicolas Almagro 6-4 6-4 to reach his third final. World No. 15 Dolgopolov defeated French second seed Gilles Simon 6-3 6-4 to reach his third hard-court final and third overall, giving him the chance to win his second title in a clash with a player who has beaten him in both their previous meetings. The match was delayed by misty conditions, and world No. 6 Tsonga suffered one worrying slip on the greasy hard-court surface before completing a 7-5 6-3 victory in Doha. " Tsonga took his place in the final after world No. 3 and three-time defending champion Roger Federer withdrew before their semifinal due to a back problem.
