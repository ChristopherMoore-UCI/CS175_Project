Roy Peter Clark, a senior journalism scholar at the Poynter Institute, said tough economic times and lower ads sales have forced newspapers to tear down the ethics wall that separated a paper's front page from advertisers. The use of real newspaper stories, published previously in the newspaper, to make the ad appear to be a real front page is another issue, Clark said. "I'm particularly nervous about them running fake stories that are really real stories," he said. What he might have objected to five years ago, he could now accept it helps papers survive, Clark said. Los Angeles Times spokesman John Conroy said the "cover-wrap" was an "unusual opportunity to stretch the usual boundaries and design an innovative ad designed to create buzz."
