-- Italian football is facing new scandal after police raided the headquarters of a host of leading clubs in a tax evasion and money laundering probe, according to Italian prosecutors Tuesday. Juventus were stripped of the titles won in 2005 and 2006 and relegated to Serie B because of their involvement, along with several other top clubs, in match fixing. The warrant for the search and seizure of documents was issued by a court in Naples as seizures took place in the headquarters of dozens of Italian football clubs and some foreign clubs as well. "At the moment the LNPA (Italian Football League) is not planning to release any official statement," said the Lega Calcio, the regulator of Italy's top two division Serie A and B. The Naples police authorities began the investigation last October, initially looking into Argentina international Ezequiel Lavezzi's Napoli contract. The 28-year-old moved to Paris Saint-Germain in a multi-million dollar deal last summer, though Italian authorities have stressed that the players themselves are not under investigation.
