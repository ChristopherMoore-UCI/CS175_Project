" Clijsters faces Zvonareva rematch in Australian Open semifinals Murray dropped his first set of the tournament so far to world number 46 Dolgopolov, before eventually winning  7-5 6-3 6-7 6-3. Murray is aiming to reach his second consecutive final in Melbourne after losing to Roger Federer in 2010, and the third grand slam final of his career after also facing the Swiss in the 2008 U.S. Open final. He might be a little bit inconsistent from time to time but when his game's on, I'm sure he'll get deep into grand slams and the big tournaments just because of how tricky his game is," the Scot added. The result also means the end to 24-year-old Nadal's quest to become the first man since Australia's Rod Laver in 1969, to win four consecutive grand slam titles. The 22-year-old Dolgopolov has been a revelation in Australia, defeating 2008 runner-up Jo Wilfred Tsonga and two-time French Open finalist Robin Soderling on the way to his first grand slam quarterfinal.
