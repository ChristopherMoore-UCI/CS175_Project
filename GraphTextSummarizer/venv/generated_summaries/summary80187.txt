Saudi officials told CNN the punishment is an integral part of their system of Islamic law, and the only violation that took place at the macabre scene was the illegal filming of the act. Cell phone footage of the execution, leaked last week by activists, gives a rare glimpse into what human rights groups call a barbaric practice of public decapitation as a punitive measure handed down by Saudi Arabia's judicial system. It should not make us forget the rights of other parties violated by the perpetrators, which has to be seen with the same degree of respect, Mohammed al-Muadi, of the government backed Saudi Human Rights Commission told CNN when asked specifically about the practice of beheading. Abdulaziz Algasim, a former sharia law judge, said: "From a pure Islamic law point of view there is no limitation for developing capital punishment." The country executed 87 people in 2014, most by beheading, Human Rights Watch told CNN.
