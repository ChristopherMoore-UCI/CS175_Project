To capture his final image of Frankel, Levine first shot the horse with multiple cameras before conducting a complete 3D body scan to produce a virtual wireframe of its body. The finished product, which is 1.2 meters wide and 90 centimeters high, is the culmination of months of work which began when Levine asked to photograph Frankel. "We got an enthusiastic response and they were terrific and made Frankel available to me," said Levine. " Frankel might not be racing any longer but it didn't take long for Levine to understand why this horse transcended its sport.
