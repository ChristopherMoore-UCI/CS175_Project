Basking in the glory of winning back the fabled Ashes from traditional rivals England, Australia's cricketing fans turned up in world record numbers Boxing Day in Melbourne to see their side continue its domination of the series. Two late wickets with the second new ball for paceman Mitchell Johnson swung the initiative Australia's way to leave the majority of the 91,092 crowd at the MCG celebrating. Put in to bat by Australia's captain Michael Clarke, England made it to lunch for the loss of his counterpart Alastair Cook to Peter Siddle. But with Johnson fired up, Australia will look to quickly remove the remaining England batsmen at the start of the second day and post a big score of their own in their bid to achieve a humiliating series whitewash of their oldest rivals. Bell, who starred for England in the summer when they beat Australia 3-0 in a home series, still held hope that Pietersen could lift them into a good position on the second day.
