Similar and shorter delays also were reported at Chicago O'Hare International Airport; Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, New York's LaGuardia Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, and Newark International Airport. High winds canceled hundreds of flights Tuesday -- more than 500 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport alone --  along with dozens more in Minnesota. The system, which spawned at least 26 possible tornadoes Tuesday, brought snow and high winds across the Midwest. CNN iReporter Gretchen Pearl in Duluth, Minnesota, said the area was experiencing high winds, heavy snow and slick roads. The Minneapolis-St. Paul airport reduced air traffic from three runways to one for landings and takeoffs Tuesday because of high winds.
