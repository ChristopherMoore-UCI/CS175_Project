The same report noted that investigators found that Zhou had affairs with a number of women, trading "his power for sex and money." "What Zhou did completely deviated from the (Communist) Party's nature and mission, and seriously violated Party discipline," Xinhua said, citing the statement from the procuratorate. The decision comes amid a much touted anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping, one that has already ensnared several men who had once been prominent figures in government and the ruling Communist Party. According to a statement released Saturday by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, or China's prosecutor's office, an investigation determined that Zhou took advantage of his positions to garner profits for others "and accepted huge bribes personally and through his family," Xinhua reported. Zhou -- who had been one of nine members of China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, before stepping down in late 2012 -- was also expelled from the Communist Party, according to Xinhua, citing a decision made Friday at a meeting of the party central committee's political bureau. His behavior "badly undermined the reputation of the Party, significantly damaged the cause of the Party and the people and have yielded serious consequences."
