-- Police in Malaysia are holding 11 people on suspicion of involvement in a militant group responsible for planning acts of terror, police spokeswoman Asmawati Ahmad said Sunday. The violence in Thailand stems from ethnic Malay Muslim separatists. This year, they began targeting Thai Buddhist woman, killing them and mutilating their bodies, Human Rights Watch has reported. Police plan to detain other suspects as a preemptive measure, Asmawati said. The arrests were made in the city of Selangor, just outside the capital Kuala Lumpur, and in the state of Kedah, which borders on Thailand.
