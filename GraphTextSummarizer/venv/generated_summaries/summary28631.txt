Tracking the crisis in Ukraine as it unfolds Many people in Crimea and eastern Ukraine don't want the protection of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, the rest of the city is terrified by the presence of Russian military forces and are evacuating their families to central or western Ukraine. Yuri in Simferopol told me that it's a handful of pro-Russian extremists in the streets trying to make a scene for Russian video cameras -- they are showing that these are the Russians who request protection! I remember when I lived in Donetsk in the '90s, how scared we were that a candidate from western Ukraine would win an election and force us to speak Ukrainian. You might be asking what all this fuss is about in Crimea, the autonomous region of eastern Ukraine with strong ties to Russia.
