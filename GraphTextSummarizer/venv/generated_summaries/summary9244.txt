The impending deluge begins this month -- traditionally a slow period for new releases -- with the combination platform-hopping, game-building "LittleBigPlanet 2," which lets you create and share new levels or challenges. Hybrid puzzle and arcade game "Lost in Shadow," wherein players manipulate illuminated objects to make shadows take on new angles and forms, will also make its debut. From jaw-dropping shooter "Rage" to animated fighting game "Marvel vs. Capcom 3," there are many promising releases coming in the months ahead. But 2011 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for games, too. -- For video game junkies, blockbuster titles like Cold War-era shooter "Call of Duty: Black Ops" and post-apocalyptic role-player "Fallout: New Vegas" make 2010 a hard act to follow.
