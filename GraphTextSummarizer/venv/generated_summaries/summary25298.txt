He was released to representatives from the Red Cross, Cuba and Norway in a rural area of southeastern Colombia, then handed over to U.S. officials Sunday morning at Bogota's airport, the governments of Cuba and Norway said in a statement. He is from Willow Spring, North Carolina, and has won a number of awards, including an Army Commendation Medal and a National Defense Service Medal. "The United States is profoundly grateful to the Government of Colombia and commends its tireless efforts to secure his release," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Sunday. But despite Sutay's military background, Jackson said last month that the Army veteran had peaceful motives for visiting Colombia. Sutay's case drew attention from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who pushed for his release during a trip last month to Cuba.
