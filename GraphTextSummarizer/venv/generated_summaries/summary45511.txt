I currently organize a Buddy Walk with some other moms, and we use funds from the walk to donate care packages to families facing hospital stays due to complications of Down Syndrome. It is September 2003, and I just found out my daughter is going to be born with Down Syndrome. So I make up my mind that just because she has Down Syndrome, I don't have to give up all of my dreams for her. Down Syndrome can slow physical and intellectual development. Had she not been born with Down Syndrome I don't think I would be as good a person as I am now.
