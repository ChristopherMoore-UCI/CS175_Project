A second-half brace from Swedish striker Markus Rosenberg sealed a 2-0 win for Werder Bremen over Kaiserslautern, while 2009 champions, Wolfsburg -- who finished last term in 15th place -- also bagged three points with victory at Cologne. Newly-promoted Augsburg earned a 2-2 draw at home to Freiburg thanks to two second-half goals from striker Sascha Molders. Two goals from former German striker Patrick Helmes and one from Marcel Schaefer (recently stripped of the captaincy by coach Felix Magath) sealed a comfortable 3-0 victory. The first full day of the new Bundesliga season kicked-off Saturday with some promising wins for teams that struggled in last year's campaign. But last year's second division champions Hertha Berlin went down to a 1-0 defeat at home to Nuremberg in the late kick-off -- 22-year-old Czech striker Tomas Pekhart scoring the decisive goal ten minutes from time.
