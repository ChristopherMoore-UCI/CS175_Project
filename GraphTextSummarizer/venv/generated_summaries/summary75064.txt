New Delhi police have filed a case against Uber "under sections relating to cheating and violation of government rules and orders," said Deputy Police Commissioner Madhur Verma. Transport authorities in New Delhi on Monday announced a ban on Uber services in the Indian capital, saying their investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules. Commercial vehicles on national permit cannot operate as taxis ferrying passengers from one destination to another within a city. A U.S. tech journalist singled out by the executive said there was an"escalating and scary pattern of misogyny" at Uber, citing the way Uber has dealt with assault complaints from female riders and a recent promo offering free rides with beautiful women. India's federal government on Tuesday warned states against allowing unlicensed Web-based taxi services after an Uber driver was accused of raping a woman in New Delhi.
