Though she's in partial remission now, White has seen other friends with terminal illnesses suffer and would like "to have the option of aid in dying in California," the lawsuit says. He said organizations and lawmakers have tried and failed four times in California to pass legislation regarding "end-of-life options," usually calling the concept a variety of palatable names such as "death with dignity" or "aid in dying" to distract voters from what the issue really is: "assisted suicide. "I am suing the state of California to help me achieve a peaceful and dignified death at the place and time of my choosing," Christie White said Wednesday at a news conference. California Attorney General Kamala Harris is listed as the defendant on the lawsuit, as she's the only one who can overturn a previous law. White was joined by physicians, also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, who want the right to administer aid-in-dying treatments to patients without penalty.
