He finished just ahead of four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, who will be starting his 113th and final race for Red Bull before leaving for Ferrari. -- F1 championship leader Lewis Hamilton feels like a "kid at Christmas" thanks to the dominance of his Mercedes car which was underlined again Friday as he set the fastest time in both practices for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Hamilton needs to finish no lower than second to teammate Nico Rosberg in Sunday's final race of the season to clinch his second world title, but after edging the German out in either session could not have wished for a better start to the weekend. Valtteri Bottas of Williams was fifth best ahead of Daniel Ricciardo in the second Red Bull. He may have been heartened by the performance of Kevin Magnussen in the McLaren, who took third fastest in the second session.
