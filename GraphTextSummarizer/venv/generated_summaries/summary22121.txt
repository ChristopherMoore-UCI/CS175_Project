The attackers, believed to be from Unity state, stole thousands of cattle and killed 74 people. "We are asking ourselves why the county commissioner would come with such a heavily armed convoy," said Gideon Gatpan Thor, the minister of information for Unity state. Seven U.N. staff members and three local officials traveled to Mayendit County to investigate a wave of violence from cattle raiding on the borders of Unity and Warrap states. "Four pick-up trucks carrying armed men believed to be the SPLA (South Sudan army) and SSPS (South Sudan police service) then appeared and started shooting indiscriminately at the Mayendit county commissioner's compound," Zerrouk said. The latest clashes come after a particularly violent month of cattle raids in Jonglei state.
