Health.com: Head-to-toe solutions for stress "When we feel anxiety, our thoughts are rarely in the present," says Jenny C. Yip, a cognitive behavioral therapist in Los Angeles. Women suffer most -- we're twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, which involves excessive worry about a wide range of things (and requires medical attention). A 2012 review concluded that CBT can enlarge the prefrontal cortex -- the part of the brain associated with weighing thoughts and making decisions -- and reduce the size of the amygdala, the region associated with stress and fear. "Things feel more manageable when you remove worry's distortions," notes Tamar Chansky, author of "Freeing Yourself from Anxiety." Chronic stress has been linked to weight gain, depression, and even cancer.
