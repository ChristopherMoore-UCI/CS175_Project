Blackburn Rovers bounced back from their 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Arsenal last week with a 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers at Ewood Park. Mark Davies equalised in the 67th minute for Bolton but James McArthur's 76th minute tap-in sealed Wigan's fourth league win of the season. Suarez, who was starting his first match since returning from an eight-match ban for racially abusing United defender Patrice Evra last October, refused to shake the French international's hand as the team's lined up before the match. Chelsea slipped out of the top four as they lost to Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park. The win consolidates Spurs' grip on third place while leaving them five points behind leaders Manchester United.
