After another bruising on-track encounter between its drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at the Belgian Grand Prix, Mercedes is considering introducing team orders for the remaining seven races. "It has been our clear policy to let the drivers race this year but rule number one is: don't hit each other," Wolff told reporters in Spa. "To see that kind of contact, so early in the race, is an unacceptable level of risk to be taking out on track. Proving just how thorny the issue of team orders is in F1, Mercedes then asked: "To those who would prefer to see team orders implemented, how would you employ them? "To the 92% in favor of free racing, what sanctions would you impose for breaking the 'no contact' rule? It then posted two options, one in favor of team orders and another in favor of free racing. The team's head of motorsport Toto Wolff described Sunday's lap two clash, which effectively ended Hamilton's race and Rosberg's chance of victory, as "unacceptable."
