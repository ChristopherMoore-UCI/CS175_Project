Boehner didn't name names, but much of the damage with female voters is self-inflicted, and stems from some high-profile gaffes from GOP Senate candidates in 2012. The NRCC effort is more than messaging -- the party is urging candidates to create and sustain efforts to reach out to women, regardless of whether or not they are facing female challengers. Mindful of the damage done, the National Republican Congressional Committee is teaching male candidates who are running against female challengers or incumbents how to respond to specific questions about rape. As for the advice he would give to his colleagues who are facing off against female candidates next fall, Boehner said, "Well, I'm trying to get them to be a little bit more sensitive." House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who frequently touts the diversity of the Democratic caucus, quipped that Republicans have "made an art of running against women in ways that we think are inappropriate." Earlier this year the House GOP campaign arm launched Project GROW to recruit more female candidates and improve how the party frames issues to female voters.
