More than 1,000 people died after and hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates in the December 2007 election torched homes and hacked rivals to death. -- The International Criminal Court has excused Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta from his "continuing presence" at his upcoming trial on charges of crimes against humanity. A third suspect, radio personality Joshua arap Sang, is being tried alongside Ruto on similar charges. The ICC has also accused Deputy President William Ruto of orchestrating attacks. Kenyatta must be "physically present" in court during opening and closing statements, "when victims present their views and concerns in person," "the delivery of judgment in the case," and, "if applicable," sentencing hearings, the court ruled.
