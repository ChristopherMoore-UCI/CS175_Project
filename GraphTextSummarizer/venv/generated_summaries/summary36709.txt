This type of blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare, said Dr. Mary Cushman, director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the University of Vermont and chair of the American Society of Hematology's subcommittee on quality of care. Lipsitz makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms (sudden pain or swelling in the limbs, or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs) so they can spot them and get treated quickly. "That's why you might see two different (types of blood clots) in the same person." One in 2007 found the more frequently a person travels, the higher their risk of blood clots. Experts recommend anyone with a history of blood clots stand up and walk every couple hours during long trips.
