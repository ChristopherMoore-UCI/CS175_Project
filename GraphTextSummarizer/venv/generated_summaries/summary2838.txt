Although the horde managed some success in the first few days, capturing several of those elusive Pokemon, the sheer number of people now tapping commands into Twitch's chat window is causing the game's main character, Red, to wander back and forth over the same spot, bang into walls and check his inventory with neurotic frequency. "This is one more example of how video games have become a platform for entertainment and creativity that extends way beyond the original intent of the game creator," said Matthew DiPietro, vice president of marketing for Twitch. A user known only by the gamer tag "TwitchPlaysPokemon" set up the "social experiment" to accept chat commands as the equivalent of button pushes. "By merging a video game, live video and a participatory experience, the broadcaster has created an entertainment hybrid custom made for the Twitch community." Not in the same video game, mind you, but play the exact same game at once?
