Police said they arrested Cherdchai Utamacha in Bangkok over the weekend, hours after closed-circuit television footage showed him attacking Troy Lee Pilkington, an American citizen who had lived in Thailand for three years. Authorities allege that Cherdchai told police he was infuriated after Pilkington accused him of cheating and threw coffee in his face as the two argued over how much the American owed for a taxi ride. Security camera footage helped police track down the suspect quickly, Col. Thawatkiet Jindakuansanong said. -- A taxi driver in Thailand has been charged with murder after allegedly stabbing an American with a machete during a fare dispute. Police said the driver smacked and stabbed Pilkington multiple times.
