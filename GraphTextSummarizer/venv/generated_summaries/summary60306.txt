Preying on the desperation of people who don't have enough money to make it to their next payday, these lenders dole out short-term loans with exorbitant interest rates, forcing already cash-strapped customers deeper into debt. According to Adair Morse, assistant professor of finance at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, ActiveHours is a smart idea that's meeting a very real need for low cost alternatives to payday loans. Although people are only borrowing money they've already earned, Morse says it's still possible that when ActiveHours tries to withdraw money from a user's account on payday, the money will already be gone. Instead, ActiveHours makes money on tips, asking users to pay what they want. The bigger problem, he says, is convincing people ActiveHours isn't just another payday lender tricking people into a cycle of debt.
