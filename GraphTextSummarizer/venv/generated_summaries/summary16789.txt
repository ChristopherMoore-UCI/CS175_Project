Between 70 and 80 police officers took part in the predawn raid, Lille prosecutor Frederic Fevre told reporters. -- French gangster Redoine Faid, the subject of an international manhunt after his brazen escape from a prison last month, is back in custody, the country's Interior Ministry said Wednesday. Early Wednesday, French police arrested Faid, labeled France's "public enemy No. 1," at a hotel in the Seine-et-Marne region to the east of Paris, the ministry said. During his six weeks on the run, Faid had worn a wig and let his beard grow in order not to be recognized, Fevre said. As well as the jailbreak, Faid is suspected in the murder of a policewoman in 2010 and faces a possible life sentence, Fevre said.
