It is the ninth country in Europe to allow same sex marriage. Passing legislation to allow same-sex marriage was one of Hollande's election pledges in campaigning last year. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010.
