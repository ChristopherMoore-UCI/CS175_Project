-- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, facing a growing tide of sexual harassment allegations, has completed his two-week intensive behavior therapy a week early and will begin outpatient treatment, his lawyer said. Filner served 10 terms, or 20 years, in Congress before being elected mayor of San Diego last year. Eleven women have now accused Filner, 70, of sexual harassment while he was mayor or a congressman. The idea that Filner has now completed rehab and could come back to lead San Diego did not sit well with many of his constituents. You did what you did and now you want to stay as mayor," said William Sawaya, another San Diego resident.
