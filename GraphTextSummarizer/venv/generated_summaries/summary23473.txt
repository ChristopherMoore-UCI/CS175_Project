-- A man set himself on fire Tuesday outside the court in Norway's capital, Oslo, where Anders Behring Breivik is on trial over terrorist attacks last summer that killed 77 people. Norwegian daily newspaper VG reported that several court employees ran out with water bottles to pour water over the man. He admits carrying out an attack on a youth camp on Utoya Island and a bombing in Oslo that killed eight people. This week, the court is hearing testimony from some of those injured during Breivik's gun rampage on Utoya Island. Police were quick to put the fire out, and he has now been taken to hospital," Unni Groendal, head of media for Oslo police, told CNN.
