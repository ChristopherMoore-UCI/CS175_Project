Chrome use already had overtaken Explorer on weekends, when personal use presumably trumps office use, since October. According to Web analytics firm StatCounter, the most popular version of Google's browser, Chrome 15, edged out Internet Explorer 8 in early December to become the world's most used edition of a browser. The rise of Chrome comes as Google has expanded beyond its core product -- its search engine -- into such areas as mobile operating systems (Android) and social networking (Google Plus). While Google tries to erode Explorer's browser share, Microsoft is taking aim at Google's longtime dominance in search. The statistics Microsoft used on its blog, which showed Chrome use mostly flat, only looked at browser usage on Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system.
