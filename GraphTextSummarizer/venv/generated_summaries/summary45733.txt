-- As beer bottles flew and bonfires burned at the annual Pumpkin Fest in Keene, New Hampshire, over the weekend, those following the events online compared the "riotous behavior" near Keene State College to protests in Ferguson, Missouri. 'Apples to oranges' Such comparisons are complicated, experts say, because Keene and Ferguson arose from different circumstances. "While the use of tear gas reflects how normative these militarized population control measures have become, Ferguson is a political movement, and looting (in Keene) is quite different from the civil disobedience we're seeing in Ferguson." That's where the conversation took a productive turn, Murch said: by shifting the discussion from comparisons between Ferguson and Keene to differences in how society perceives black and white behavior. " Picking battles Journalism professor Douglas M. McLeod of the University of Wisconsin-Madison agrees that comparing the nature of the two events is "preposterous," seeing as Ferguson arose from "enduring, longstanding" issues related to race and inequality that keep the protests alive, unlike in Keene.
