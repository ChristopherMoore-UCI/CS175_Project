Gosnell also is charged with conspiracy, abortion at 24 or more weeks of pregnancy, theft, corruption of minors, solicitation and other related offenses. Gosnell also is accused of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance. The nature of the questions indicate the jury has completed the charge sheet for O'Neill -- who is charged with practicing without a license, not performing illegal abortions -- and have moved on to Gosnell. Defense attorney Jack McMahon has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion.
