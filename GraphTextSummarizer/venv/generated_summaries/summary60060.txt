Meanwhile new United manager David Moyes officially began work Monday after replacing Ferguson at the helm. Last year alone, United increased its value by 42% to $3.17 billion, according to Forbes business magazine. "When considering our partners, the club likes to ensure the company in question shares many of the same attributes that have allowed us to grow into the world's most recognized team," United group managing director Richard Arnold told the club's official website. Moyes, who has brought his own coaching staff from former club Everton, will work alongside assistant manager Steve Round, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods and first team coach Jimmy Lumsden. According to a press release issued by the club, around 70 million people in Thailand watched United's games in the first seven months of last season, though the club did not disclose how much the new sponsorship deal was worth.
