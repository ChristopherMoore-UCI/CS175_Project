Richard Yanis allegedly stole three handguns from his father and told police he planned to "shoot students in the school and then himself" at Pottstown High School, Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman said in a press release. "On the day of the planned shooting, Yanis said he was going to tell his friends to go home from school." John Armato, director of community relations at Pottstown Senior High School, described Yanis "as quiet, relatively introverted." "He did not have a great number of friends or a history of discipline problems," Armato said. Yanis, 15, was charged with attempted murder in adult court because juvenile law in Montgomery County excludes crimes committed with a deadly weapon, Ferman said. Yanis' parents had no comment, but family friend Brian Hanlon spoke on their behalf. The friend told a teacher at Pottstown High School what happened, and police were called.
