There's no showing for favorites such as "Bittersweet Bundle of Misery," off the most Blur-like album "Happiness in Magazines, and while there are half-hearted calls for Coxon's big Blur hit "Coffee and TV," it's never going to happen. Coxon has now produced eight solo albums and is entitled as much as Damon Albarn is to a life after, or even alongside, Blur. But melodies do shine through: occasionally on older songs such as "All Over Me" and the finale "Tripping Over," the volume eases for him to show what an interesting voice he has, one that was criminally under-used on the seven Blur studio albums. Coxon's virtuoso musical talent on guitar is also richly on show -- he has been described by Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher as the greatest guitarist of his generation. The long queue of admirers, many from overseas, is testimony to his fame, but if truth were told, most of them just want to meet the lead guitarist from Blur.
