Jeff Gaspin, chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, announced Sunday that the network was taking Leno -- formerly the host of "The Tonight Show" now helmed by Conan O'Brien -- out of the prime-time slot because the show "didn't meet affiliates' needs" despite performing at acceptable levels for the network. The whole scenario recalls the precedent set by a similar NBC fiasco 17 years ago, Naughton said, when Leno and David Letterman were dueling over "The Tonight Show." Even if O'Brien were to stick it out with NBC, getting bumped back to 12:05 is not optimal, said Christopher Naughton, a 20-year TV veteran and attorney who produces "The American Law Journal." "Pushing it back half an hour is huge," Naughton said. Fox reportedly went after him six years ago, which led to NBC offering him the "Tonight Show" chair after Leno's eventual departure. This announcement fueled rumors that O'Brien, who took Leno's spot on "The Tonight Show" in 2009, is considering making an exit.
