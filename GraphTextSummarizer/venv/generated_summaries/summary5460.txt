-- The extradition of honeymoon killing suspect Shrien Dewani to South Africa was temporarily halted Friday on mental health grounds, the High Court in London said. Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South Africa, while they were on honeymoon in 2010. British Home Secretary Theresa May ordered Dewani's extradition in September, but he appealed to the High Court, saying it would breach his human rights under European law. However, Dewani should be extradited to face criminal proceedings in South Africa once he recovers, which seems likely to happen in a reasonable time, the ruling said. The court heard from psychiatric experts that Dewani was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and was considered to have tried to take his own life early last year.
