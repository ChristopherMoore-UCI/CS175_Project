Already, Hemingway's Cuba writings have solved one mystery for Jenny Phillips. Curators estimate another $1 million is needed to save a collapsing guest house on the property, repair Hemingway's cracked swimming pool and build a workshop to restore thousands of original documents. How did that happen?" A letter from Cuba following Hemingway's father's suicide in 1928 provided the answer. One of the people who came to the house's rescue was Jenny Phillips, the granddaughter of Maxwell Perkins, the editor who first pushed for Hemingway's work to be published and worked with the writer for the rest of his life. "I realized we could help because of my connection to Ernest Hemingway through my grandfather," Phillips said.
