-- Clashes broke out between citizens and anti-riot police during a visit by King Abdullah to southern Jordan on Monday. King Abdullah's Monday visit came to announce $21.1 million worth of development projects in Tafileh, where protesters have recently called for the government's dismissal, the dissolution of parliament and greater efforts to combat corruption. In a speech designated to mark the anniversary of the Great Arab Revolt, the monarch announced a number of reforms, including relinquishing his power to form a government to the parliament, a greater separation of powers and further constitutional amendments. The incident comes a day after King Abdullah's royal address to the nation announcing sweeping political reforms that political observers see as steps to place the country on the path to a constitutional monarchy. Youths threw stones at security services who responded with force, according to eyewitnesses in the city, home to anti-government protests in recent weeks.
