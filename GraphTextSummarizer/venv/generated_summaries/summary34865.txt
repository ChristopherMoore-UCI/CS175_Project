-- Walmart found itself sending apology tweet after apology tweet Monday after the Twitterverse raked it over the coals for a major goof on its website. After Twitter users complained in droves, Wal-Mart took down the section and sent out multiple apology tweets. For whatever inexplicable reason, the retail giant's site featured a Halloween category, titled "Fat Girl Costumes." You won't find it there now, thank goodness, but it stayed there for a large part of the morning -- and long enough for multiple screen grabs. The presence of the category was first reported by Jezebel, which in turn was alerted by a reader who stumbled upon it while looking for costumes.
