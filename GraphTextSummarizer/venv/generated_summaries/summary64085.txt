From the buzzing message boards on local social networking site Red Social de Cuba, to the hip campus of the University of Havana, young residents of the island are riding a wave of optimism following the historic announcement of a new deal with the U.S. on December 17. "The Cuban government should provide a stronger legal basis for private businesses, giving them the same rights and duties as for the non-private companies", says graphic designer Nieto. "I hope for new investments in different areas of our economy," says Pepe Nieto, a young, privately-employed graphic designer in Havana. In anticipation those in the hotel business are renovating old hotels, building new hotels and retirement homes, and low-cost apartments. But private business can yield greater dividends.
