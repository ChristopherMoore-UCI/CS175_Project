The season picks up in the aftermath of the devastating wedding reception from hell, which proved, in case it was still unclear to anyone, that in the world crafted by novelist George R.R. Martin in his "A Song of Ice and Fire" fantasy series, no one is ever safe. We've already seen that Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) ends up in major trouble (what else is new?) and that new character Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal) -- will be attending the joyous occasion with less-than-love in his heart for the Lannisters. And my fishing buddy who's a few years older than me, Bo -- he hasn't read many books in his life. In King's Landing, brutal King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) is due to be married in an elaborate affair that will bring together a slew of characters, some old and some new, to -- er -- celebrate. As for our other main players: Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), with an army of freed slaves at her back and a trio of increasingly formidable dragons to keep in line, confronts the promise, and pitfalls, of her ascent to true power.
