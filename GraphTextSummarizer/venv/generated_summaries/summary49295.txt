-- When Anne Moyer told her best friend, Diane Ritchie, she was going to lose weight a few years ago, Ritchie politely replied, "Good for you. In 2010, Moyer developed sleep apnea, a disorder commonly associated with obesity in which breathing at night starts and stops.

Moyer allowed herself to eat fruits and bread but cut out soda and enriched flour.
