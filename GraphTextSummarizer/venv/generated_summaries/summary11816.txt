Wilfong, 30, is jailed on felony child abduction charges and made her first court appearance Tuesday, Sandusky said. Wilfong and Dobbs had accused Chekevdia of sexually abusing the boy, but authorities have said those allegations are unfounded, the Post-Dispatch said. They were reported missing in November, and in December, prosecutors charged Wilfong with felony child abduction. Diane Dobbs and Robert Sandefur, both 51, are in jail pending the filing of formal charges in the case, said Beth Sandusky, victim services coordinator for the state attorney's office in Franklin County, Illinois. They were released from jail on bond Monday, but were back in custody within hours, according to ABC News and CNN affiliate WSIL.
