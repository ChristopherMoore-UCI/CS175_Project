Barbara Walters is retiring but not going away Walters began her national broadcast career in 1961 as a reporter, writer and panel member for NBC's "Today" show before being promoted to co-host in 1974. On Friday's show, Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton and Michael Douglas made surprise appearances as they all joined the current "View" co-hosts in wishing Walters well as she leaves on-camera work behind. At that network, Walters launched "The Barbara Walters Specials" and "10 Most Fascinating People" before becoming a co-host and correspondent for ABC News' "20/20" in 1984. And when it came to Michael Douglas, who swore that Walters gives the best parties, the 84-year-old journalist couldn't help but inquire about the actor's relationship with wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, which hit a rough patch last summer. "I want to start by saying I can't believe this day has come and I can't believe it's for real," Clinton told Walters.
