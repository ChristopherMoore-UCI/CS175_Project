Student consultancy groups are a feature of many MBA programs, letting companies hire teams of MBA students to solve their business problems and giving the students a chance to put their education into practice. But it's not just small businesses that can see the advantage of student consultants -- Microsoft, Toyota, Procter and Gamble and Shell International have all taken part in the project. " At Cambridge University's Judge Business School, part of the MBA program requires students to take part in the Global Consulting Project (GCP). O'Neill told CNN that companies using the GCP benefit from the students' knowledge of up-to-date research methodology gleaned from the course and the fact that students have diverse backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. At Temple University's Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, MBA students can participate in the Enterprise Management Consultant Practice (EMCP).
