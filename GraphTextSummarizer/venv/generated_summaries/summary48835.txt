In Alta Badia, Italy, Marcel Hirscher tamed one of the toughest giant slalom courses in the world and said it was a confidence booster to beat American Ted Ligety. "It feels awesome for me to get a first win in the giant slalom," Weirather, fourth in Saturday's downhill and a Super-G winner last week in Switzerland, told reporters. " Hirscher increased his lead in the giant slalom standings to 60 points over Ligety and pulled to within 100 points of Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal in the overall standings. "I think I could have pushed a bit more, especially in the first run, but it's okay," Ligety told reporters. I have done everything I possibly could to get closer to Ted and it's tough to get faster ad faster, but it was worth it." Ligety still had reason to celebrate, claiming his 33rd giant slalom podium to tie Austria's Benny Raich for third on the all-time list.
