Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction. " Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying."
