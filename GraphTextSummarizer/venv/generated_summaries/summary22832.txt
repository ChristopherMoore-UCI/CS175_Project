"Cybersecurity is one of our most urgent priorities," said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano in making the announcement Thursday. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano seeks to hire up to 1,000 cybersecurity experts. " Department officials could not say precisely how many cyberexperts now work at DHS and its various component agencies such as the Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "This new hiring authority will enable DHS to recruit the best cyberanalysts, developers and engineers in the world to serve their country by leading the nation's defenses against cyberthreats," according to Napolitano. Napolitano said she doubts it will be necessary to fill all 1,000 of the authorized positions, but she is focused on making DHS a "world-class cyberorganization."
