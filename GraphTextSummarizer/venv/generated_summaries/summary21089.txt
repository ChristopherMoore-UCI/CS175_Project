Three teenage girls who set out from a Denver suburb apparently bound for Syria to join extremists fighting there are back home after their parents alerted authorities and the trio was stopped in Germany,  U.S. officials said. That is all the information we can provide at this time," said agency spokeswoman Sue Payne in Denver. The teens -- two sisters of Somali descent and a friend whose family is Sudanese, according to a Denver community leader -- were detained when their flight landed in Frankfurt on Friday after the FBI flagged their passports. It's not exactly clear how the girls planned their trip or how they were going to make their way to Syria, but authorities say their ultimate plan was to try to join extremists fighting there. They were flown back to Denver on Sunday, officials said.
