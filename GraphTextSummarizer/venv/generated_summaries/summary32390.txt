"It's aimed at saving families from impulsive divorces," Lin Wenhui, head of marriage registration at the Chang'an civil affairs bureau, told state media. Some have pointed to a government report that says a quarter of married Chinese women have suffered various forms of domestic violence. Since March 2012, the civil affairs bureau in Chang'an District of Xi'an City -- an urban area with more than 1 million residents -- has limited the number of divorce filings to no more than 15 a day. Since its 15-slots-per-day rule went into effect, Chang'an has bucked the trend and witnessed a decline in the number of divorce filings two years in a row. Last year, Xi'an -- where Chang'an District is located -- saw 17,670 couples go their separate ways amicably, while the number of divorces nationwide shot up to 3.5 million.
