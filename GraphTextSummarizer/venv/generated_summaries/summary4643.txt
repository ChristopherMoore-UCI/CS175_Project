-- Egyptian author Ahmed Mourad published his first novel in 2007, a political thriller on corruption in the regime of former president Hosni Mubarak. I decided that if anything happened to me it was God's will." Mourad, 33, was with Mubarak throughout the revolution and the 18 days of uprising that led to his resignation in February, and could not join the protesters in Tahrir Square. Mourad subsequently wrote a second political thriller about corruption -- again while working for Mubarak -- which is currently being adapted into a film. It "exposes the seedy underbelly of life in Mubarak's Egypt," according to its English-language publisher Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation. "The next president must always remember what happened in Tahrir Square, what happened to Mubarak."
