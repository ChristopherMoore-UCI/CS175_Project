Priebus told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday that he'd remain focused on the "mechanics" of politics -- including improving Republicans' collection of data targeting individual voters and its field operation in presidential battleground states. He said the RNC won't pull its staff out of presidential battleground states, and said "we need to have a full-blown field operation in place" by March 2015 in the key states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia. " "There's going to be a high level of disdain," Priebus said, "for candidates who spend their time trying to destroy other Republicans." Priebus pointed to wins this year in Senate races in Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina -- three states that President Barack Obama carried at least once -- as demonstrating that the GOP can win "in a purple state in a good environment with a good candidate," and offering hope ahead of 2016. His comments came with an eye on 2016, when Republicans fear the favorable electorate they found in this year's midterm elections will be drowned out by a much larger turnout among left-leaning voters.
