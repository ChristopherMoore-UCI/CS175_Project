Katherine Jackson also posted a YouTube video this month announcing her support for a tribute to Michael Jackson to be held June 26 in Beverly Hills, California. La Toya Jackson has been outspoken in her belief that Michael Jackson was the victim of a criminal conspiracy to kill him. They will take part in a tribute there, along with Katherine Jackson and their grandfather Joe Jackson. Rebbie Jackson, the oldest of the Jackson siblings, recently resumed her singing career. The grassy yard of the Encino estate is often filled with Michael's kids playing ball with four cousins -- the sons of Jackson brothers Jermaine and Randy -- who have lived there the past year with their mother.
