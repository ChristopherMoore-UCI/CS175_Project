The Globe defended its decision to visit the country saying that "a policy of inclusion, rather than exclusion, is more true to the spirit of Shakespeare." Called a Globe to Globe Hamlet tour, the group intends to travel to all seven continents -- irrespective of political situations. Human rights criticism "If the Globe Theatre goes to North Korea, they should read up on the reality of the country before they get there," said Niall Couper, a spokesperson for Amnesty International. The theater group is not the first to get blasted by human rights groups for performing in North Korea. The parallels of staging a drama about an epic family power struggle in Pyongyang, where the country's young leader Kim Jong Un had his uncle, Jang Song Thaek executed has raised a few eyebrows -- especially from human rights groups. The classic Shakespearean drama "Hamlet" is scheduled for a performance in North Korea in September 2015 by the Globe Theatre as part of a two-year tour to perform in every country.
