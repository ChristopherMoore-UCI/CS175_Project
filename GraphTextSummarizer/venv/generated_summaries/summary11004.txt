-- Audio released Friday purportedly captures an argument between Mel Gibson and ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, in which he launches into a racist, sexist rant against her. Toward the end of June, Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that the actor and director struck her in the face, People magazine reported. Earlier this week, the Malibu Hills Police Department opened an investigation into the alleged domestic violence dispute between Gibson and Grigorieva, 40, CNN has confirmed. Gibson has been caught in a custody dispute with Grigorieva over the couple's 8-month-old daughter. CNN reached out to both Gibson and Grigorieva's representatives for response and to verify the authenticity of the audio.
