" Spear was Miss Venezuela in 2004 and represented her country in the Miss Universe pageant the next year. In an interview with The Huffington Post last year, Spear said she left Venezuela because of the country's security problems. Spear and her ex-husband, Thomas Henry Berry, were driving in Venezuela's Carabobo state Monday night when their car broke down, officials said. "It is presumed that the motive was robbery," Venezuelan Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said. Movie stars, fellow soap opera actors, athletes and government officials expressed sorrow and condemned the attack.
