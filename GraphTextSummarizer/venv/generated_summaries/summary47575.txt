They're wearing blue Russian riot police uniforms, which the band said was a reference to "the violent clashes of police and the protesters fighting for change in Russia." "This song is for Eric and for all those from Russia to America and around the globe who suffer from state terror -- killed, choked, perished because of war and state-sponsored violence of all kinds -- for political prisoners and those on the streets fighting for change," the band said Wednesday. The dissident Russian punk band Pussy Riot has dedicated its first English-language song, "I Can't Breathe," to Eric Garner. " Garner, an unarmed black man, died in New York in July after a white police officer put him in a chokehold. The band recorded the track in New York in December, amid the protests following the grand jury decision not to indict Pantaleo.
