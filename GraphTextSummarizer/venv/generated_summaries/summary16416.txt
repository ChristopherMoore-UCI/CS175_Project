State power is ultimately limited by the people; control measures must have public support and cooperation. While the process may not overall feel very protective of individual rights, contagious diseases force a sobering realization. State quarantine statutes are subject to some constitutional constraints. The game changer here is that with an epidemic, the potential harm to the masses is tremendous, so large that it justifies virtually any invasion of individual rights. Then, we may all become champions of individual rights.
