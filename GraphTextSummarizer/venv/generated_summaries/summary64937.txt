Will crimes committed against women and girls across the globe finally come to be seen as harming and hampering not just women, but the communities in which they live? Reporters and politicians rushed to follow their lead, and discussions about girls' education and the crimes of Boko Haram at last punctured public indifference. This time it was a 22-year-old man on a quest for what he called his  "day of retribution," when he would torture and kill "good-looking people" before launching a "war on women" to punish girls and women who he said had "starved (him) of sex." It falls to each of us to see whether all the talk about the power of women and girls and the shame of harming them translates into on-the-ground change. The misogyny in the killer's more than 100-page diatribe led women to begin using the #Yesallwomen hashtag to push forward a conversation on Twitter and Facebook and Tumbler about the rarely discussed though frequently experienced issues of violence against women, from sexual assault to harassment to domestic brutality.
