"At this time we don't know when we'll be able to get flights in and out," Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson said via e-mail. The airline is allowing passengers with plans to travel to Haiti this month to change their plans without fee or penalty through February 14, spokesman Tim Smith said in an e-mail. Spirit Airlines, which operates one flight a day between Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and  Port-au-Prince also canceled Wednesday and Thursday flights. JetBlue Airways does not fly into Haiti, but the airline is waiving change fees and fare differences for passengers scheduled to fly into neighboring Dominican Republic on Wednesday. "The airport tower is badly damaged, and while I don't know the precise status of the runway, flights (including ours and Air France's) did make it out last night," Smith said Wednesday afternoon.
