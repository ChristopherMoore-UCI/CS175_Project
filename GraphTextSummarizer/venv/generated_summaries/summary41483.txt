"Although the circumstances were unimaginable, Bruce's wife and extended family will be forever thankful that he and his wife were together in his last moments," Clark's wife and family said Friday. Clark -- known by many as Kevin -- was a chief nurse in the Army who amassed many honors in his military career, according to his family. The longtime resident of Spencerport, New York, joined the Army in September 2006 and served, among other places, at the Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, according to a Beaumont Army Medical Center statement. " Clark's family said in a statement that they'd hoped for "a miracle" after his wife Susan saw what happened to Clark earlier this week, but "it was not to be." In addition, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed that all flags at state government buildings be flown at half-staff Monday in Clark's honor, as he's done with other Empire State troops who have died in combat zones.
