"They are still restructuring," But HSBC's need to still lay off workers "is probably the exception" than the rule when comparing it to other global banks, says Houston of Executive Search Group International. "HSBC in my view is terribly bloated," says Christine Houston, Managing Director of Executive Search Group International in Hong Kong. That realignment could see redundancies in HSBC's non-core markets -- "probably Europe and South America" -- while Asia will continue to be "a growth market," predicts Jonathan Hollands, managing director of executive search firm Carraway Group. The same for (Hong Kong-headquartered) Standard Chartered. "They're still not finished with redundancies," cautioned Hollands of Carraway Group.
