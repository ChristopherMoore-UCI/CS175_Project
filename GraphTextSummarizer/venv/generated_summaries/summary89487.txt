Rapiro isn't the first of its kind: BrickPi is a Raspberry Pi-controlled lego robot that was funded through Kickstarter. The credit-card sized, Linux-based PC known as Raspberry Pi is designed to work with the basic hardware of Rapiro, allowing you to program it to do many things, such as manage your calendar or tell you the weather, in addition to making the coffee. According to the website, the idea of the project is for a beginner to get into robotics and for an expert to create higher utility through Raspberry Pi. The kit was created by a Japanese company as a "catalyst between robotics and Raspberry Pi." Raspberry Pi makes the software easily customizable for users who are familiar with the technology.
