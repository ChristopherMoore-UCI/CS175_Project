Anelka, who was fined £80,000 ($130,000) and handed a five-match ban by the FA in February, denied being racist or anti-Semitic, saying the gesture was a dedication to French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala. -- Brazilian-born striker Brandao had been handed a six-month ban for headbutting Paris St Germain midfielder Thiago Motta at Parc des Princes on August 16. The 34-year-old can be seen on CCTV waiting around before striking Motta and then running off out of shot with the PSG man following in hot pursuit. Meanwhile in England Friday, Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto was given a three-game ban and fined £50,000 ($82,000) by the English Football Association (FA) for improper conduct after congratulating Nicolas Anelka on his "quenelle" gesture on social media. Brandao, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia managed by Claude Makelele, assaulted the Italy international in the tunnel following the match which PSG won 2-0.
