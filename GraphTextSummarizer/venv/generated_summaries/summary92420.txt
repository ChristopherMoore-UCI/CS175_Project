The attorney general's office said it has charged two other individuals with attempted fraud of One Fund Boston and that both are awaiting trial. A New York woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to collecting a fraudulent $480,000 claim from One Fund Boston, a nonprofit that benefits victims of the Boston Marathon bombings, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. Investigators were later able to secure the nearly half a million dollars that Gause stole and will return it to One Fund Boston, according to the attorney general's office. An investigation into Gause began after the Massachusetts attorney general received a tip that she was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, Coakley told a news conference in July. Audrea Gause, 27, pleaded guilty to a charge of larceny over $250 and was sentenced by a Superior Court judge to two and a half to three years in prison, according to a statement from state Attorney General Martha Coakley.
