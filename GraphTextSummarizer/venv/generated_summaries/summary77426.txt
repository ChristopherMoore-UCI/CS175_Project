As part of this, the President appears to be experimenting -- productively, domestically and internationally -- with a variety of ways to break the huge challenge of climate change into smaller bites and alternative pathways. The reality is that climate negotiations have long been stalled, lost in a Groundhog Day cycle of yearly meetings ending in plans for more meetings. Indeed, more than a dozen agreements over 40 years established communications channels and protocols to avoid accidental nuclear wars, and reduce nuclear weapon stockpiles from more than 25,000 each at the height of the Cold War to roughly 5,000 and 12,000, respectively, today. Here in the United States, a parallel process is already taking place, mobilizing existing resources to improve energy efficiency, step-by-step. But a global problem also requires international agreements, which is why -- rather than wait for the nearly 200 parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to come to agreement on a huge basket of climate-related issues -- the President is right in finding ways to work with other major greenhouse gas emitters.
