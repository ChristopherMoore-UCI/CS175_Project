The decision on Breivik's sanity ultimately rests with the courts -- and while the maximum sentence for homicide or terror acts is 21 years, Johnsen says there are two ways the Norwegian courts can keep Breivik under state custody well past his initial jail sentence. Breivik was allowed to read a prepared statement in court on Tuesday, but presiding Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen ruled that his testimony would not be broadcast -- rejecting his claim that airing it was a human right. While it is too early to tell how people will feel about Breivik as a threat to public safety in 20 years, Johnsen believes Breivik will walk free one day if he's determined to be sane by the courts. In a new courtroom specially built in the Norwegian capital for the trial, judges will consider whether Breivik was insane at the time of the killings, and whether he should be sent to prison or a mental facility for his crimes. -- The trial of Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted killing 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in Norway last summer, is under way in Oslo.
