"I want to emphasize the fact that she is safe, she is unharmed, she is OK," Medfield Police Chief Robert Meaney said Thursday morning. Meaney said Thompson's family headed to Coventry and were probably reunited with Thompson early Thursday. -- A developmentally delayed teen girl was found Thursday with a person of interest in Rhode Island, three days after she disappeared from a public library in Massachusetts, police said. The man with her was as an adult, older than Thompson, with an address in Missouri, Meaney said.
