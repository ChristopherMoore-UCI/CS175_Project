France's far right-leaning National Front party is threatening to sue after singer Madonna showed a video of party leader Marine Le Pen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead during a concert in Paris. Le Pen made a strong showing in the first round of France's presidential election. The party had warned that it would seek legal action if Madonna showed the image at her concerts in France. "The images that were projected draw a terrible link between the party and an ideology that we reject," party Vice President Florian Philippot said Monday. The daughter of party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, she pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and called for France to leave the eurozone and restore its currency, the franc.
