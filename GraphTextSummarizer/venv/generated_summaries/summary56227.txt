Watch Obama's victory speech Â» The festive mood in Grant Park on Tuesday night was not as apparent a few hours earlier in Hyde Park, Obama's South Side neighborhood. History gave Grant Park another chance Tuesday as the scene of a peaceful and jubilant celebration of Barack Obama's presidential victory. CHICAGO, Illinois ( CNN) -- Forty years ago, Chicago's Grant Park was the scene of violent political protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Behind the shops on 53rd Street sat Walter Granger, a homeless man who said he had seen Obama in the neighborhood with his daughters on occasion. "Look at these people -- old, young, black and white -- I've never seen anything like it, " said Vernita Gray, 59 surveying the crowd of up to 240,000 people after Obama's acceptance speech.
