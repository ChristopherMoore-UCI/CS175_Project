"Lord Infamous was the kind of person that never cared about having a lot of money or this or that," DJ Paul told Rolling Stone. -- Ricky Dunigan, better known as Lord Infamous, a founding member of the Oscar-winning rap group Three 6 Mafia, died of a heart attack last week, according to a release from Black Rain Entertainment. Rolling Stone reported that Lord Infamous had a heart attack and stroke in 2010, but had not been sick recently.
