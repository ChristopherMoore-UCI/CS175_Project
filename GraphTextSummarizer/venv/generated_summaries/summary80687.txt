For a show that was as much about his collaborators as it was his own career, Drake's major Young Money/Cash Money cohorts were nowhere to be found, making Club Paradise not quite the Summer Jam consolation many NY ticketholders had hoped for. "Same goes for the beautiful Ms. Nicki Minaj, so bare with me while I work out that Young Money World Tour." Despite looming controversy and some missing teammates, there wasn't much trouble in Drake's paradise, and he was emphatically clear that the fans on the floor were the real VIPs: "You can open your eyes to what they write about me, and open your ears to what they say about me, but I don't give a f**k about anyone besides the people in this room," he said with a slight smile as the show closed. From rising profiles ASAP Rocky and French Montana to veterans the Diplomats and Busta Rhymes, Drake paid ample homage to New York City hip-hop, typically a locals-only fundamentalist sect that regionless artists like Drake have since knocked off the pedestal of hip-hop's birthplace and sole proprietor. Still, when Cam'ron's New York anthem "I Really Mean It" blared from the amphitheater, Drake was a fan first: "The songs these dudes made have influenced all of our music," he said. After racing through some early hits at the top of his set, Drake promised to deliver "every motherf***er you want to see right here," before introducing the Weeknd for their haunting collaboration "Crew Love."
