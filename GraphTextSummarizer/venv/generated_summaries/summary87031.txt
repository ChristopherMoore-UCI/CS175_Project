Dietary supplements with DMAA have been promoted as a natural way to enhance athletic performance and speed up weight loss. The FDA said in the advisory last week that it is using "all available tools at its disposal" to eliminate supplements containing the stimulant dimethylamylamine, or DMAA, from the market. The FDA says it has received reports of 86 illnesses and deaths associated with supplements containing DMAA as of last week. The FDA said it "has found the information insufficient to defend the use of DMAA as an ingredient in dietary supplements," and it is finalizing a formal response to USPLabs to reflect the findings. In the meantime, FDA spokeswoman Tamara Ward said that 11 companies have received warning letters from the FDA over the past year asking them to stop marketing products that contain DMAA.
