Schumer said in a statement following the committee meeting that the issue of background checks remains the political "sweet spot" on gun control and promised continued efforts to find bipartisan support. "Supporters of this bill contend that if we only make background checks universal, criminals will not get guns. In opposing Schumer's measure, Sen. Chuck Grassley disputed whether tougher background check laws would prevent criminals from obtaining a gun. -- A Senate committee approved legislation on Tuesday that would expand background checks covering all U.S. firearms sales, part of a federal gun-control push prompted by December's school massacre in Connecticut. Schumer's bill would mandate background checks for all gun sales, including private transactions.
