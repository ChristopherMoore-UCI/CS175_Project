Control has done some of the work for him and narrowed the suspects down to five men, all nicknamed after characters from a children's nursery rhyme: Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) is "Tinker," Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) is "Tailor," Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) is "Soldier," Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) is "Poor Man" and Smiley himself is codenamed "Beggarman." Adapted from John Le Carr√©'s 1974 novel of the same name, the film is an exceptional treat for those who like to give their brains a little bit of a workout from time to time. Due to the clandestine nature of his task, Smiley is forced to recruit his team from the ranks of junior agents or the recently fired, including Peter Guillam (the always excellent Benedict Cumberbatch from the BBC's "Sherlock"), who in one ingeniously staged sequence, must steal documents from The Circus. In a year rife with films styled after the classic gritty and morally ambiguous cinema of the 1970s ("Moneyball," "Shame" and "The Ides of March"), the best of the lot arrives Friday with Tomas Alfredson's brilliant "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy." In the aftermath, Control is hung out to dry and forced to leave the service, taking with him his loyal lieutenant, George Smiley (Gary Oldman).
