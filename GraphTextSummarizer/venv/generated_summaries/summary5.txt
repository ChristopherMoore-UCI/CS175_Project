And I'm also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical Islam is a grave threat, we need Muslim leaders to denounce the individuals, not just the acts of violence," he said, adding that "it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation" of immigrants in the United States. "It's no surprise that Bobby Jindal would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people -- this is exactly what we've come to expect from Jindal here at home," Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Rebecca Chalif told CNN. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Monday stood by his criticism of so-called "no-go" zones in Europe, where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to Muslim immigrants, a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown. But pressed for specific examples of such no-go zones, Jindal demurred, saying he had met with "elected officials and others" to discuss them and noted a report in UK tabloid the Daily Mail that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas. The idea of "no-go zones" sparked controversy last week when a Fox News commentator raised the prospect of areas in France, Britain, Sweden and Germany where those countries' governments "don't exercise any sovereignty," and which instead are run largely by Muslim immigrants.
