This is her nation's time of greatest need, Suu Kyi told lawmakers, saying the help of Britain and other nations is needed if Myanmar is not to lose this opportunity to embrace true democracy. Cameron said it was a huge honor to welcome Suu Kyi to Britain, saying she has been "inspirational in her courage in fighting for democracy" in Myanmar. -- Aung San Suu Kyi appealed for international support for Myanmar's process of democratic reform Thursday as she gave a historic address to both of Britain's houses of parliament. Her first trip to Europe after years of house arrest signals the progress toward reform in Myanmar, also known as Burma, over the past year. Cameron said British lawmakers will visit Myanmar in July to scrutinize its progress toward full democracy, and will continue to support the country up to its planned elections in 2015.
