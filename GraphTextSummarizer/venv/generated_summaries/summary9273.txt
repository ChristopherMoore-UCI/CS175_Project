" Al Qaeda-linked group strengthens hold in northern Syria Spillover into Turkey, northern Iraq Turkey is already seeing fighting between the Kurds and other groups spill into its territory, with errant rocket fire killing several Turkish civilians over the past few months. Ankara doesn't want to see either al Qaeda or the Kurds prevail in northern Syria. Landis, who runs the blog Syria Comment, says al Nusra and another Islamist group, Ahrar al-Sham, "are working together more closely than ever both to counter ISIS and to take power from weaker factions of the Free Syria Army. The Kurds of northern Iraq have also been pulled into Syria's war, not least because the fighting has pushed tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds across the border. It is a complex conflict that pits al Qaeda affiliates against more moderate rebel factions and against Syria's 2-million strong Kurdish minority.
