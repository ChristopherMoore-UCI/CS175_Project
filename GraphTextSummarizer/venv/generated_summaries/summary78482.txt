Tiller, one of the few physicians who was still offering such abortions in the United States, "made an effort to live his life as normally as possible, knowing he could be a target at any time," said Peter Brownlie, president of the regional Planned Parenthood office in Kansas City, Missouri. "Third-trimester abortion is simply a part of abortion," Tiller told Wichita TV station KAKE in 1999. She said the threat of attack was often a concern for Tiller and is a worry for many doctors and medical students who choose to perform abortions. Tiller's practices had an effect on proposed abortion legislation. His Web site said his clinic had "more experience in late abortion services over 24 weeks than anyone else currently practicing in the Western Hemisphere, Europe and Australia."
