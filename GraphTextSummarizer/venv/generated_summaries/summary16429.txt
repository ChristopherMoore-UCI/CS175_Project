" What makes "See Dad Run" different, Baio said, is the fact that "it's a story about a guy who is not an idiot like a lot of TV dads are. ABC's "Last Man Standing," which stars veteran TV dad Tim Allen, will premiere its second season in November, while ABC Family's "Baby Daddy" will be back with season 2 in 2013. Of course, this isn't the first time Baio has cared for kids on TV. The former "Happy Days" and "Charles in Charge" stars' "See Dad Run" is making its time slot debut on Nick at Nite Sunday. As a dad, Baio told CNN it was the premise of "See Dad Run" that lured him back to the soundstage, the same one "Happy Days" was filmed on, no less.
