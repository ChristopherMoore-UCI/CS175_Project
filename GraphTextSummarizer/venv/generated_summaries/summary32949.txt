The competition, which was established in 2009, has produced another batch of stunning entries capturing the diversity and beauty of wildlife in the UK. An image of a jellyfish taken by Richard Shucksmith in the waters off Sula Sgeir -- an uninhabited island 41 miles north of the isle of Lewis, Scotland -- was declared the overall winner. The Young British Wildlife Photographers prizes went to 16-year-old Oliver Wilks for his "Fox Yawning" image, while Walter Lovell (aged eight) captured an amazing image of a frog and its spawn. -- The winners of this year's British Wildlife Photography Awards have been announced. Shucksmith picked up Â£5,000 ($7,800) for the shot with category winners being awarded Â£1,000 ($1,555).
