The Beth El and Maghen David synagogues exist today more as memorials to a former era than as functional Jewish temples. In Kolkata, Jewish families settled in what was known as "gray town," the central city neighborhoods that separated the whites from the "coloreds." It, too, like every other Jewish institution, faces a perilous future -- the last of the family in Kolkata, David Nahoum, is 84 and frail. Many Jews began leaving Kolkata, the city formerly known as Calcutta, after Indian independence in 1947; those who remained are slowly dying off. Katz said Jewish communities have died violent and forced deaths in other places.
