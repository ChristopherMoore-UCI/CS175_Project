Hear why al Shayea turned his back on al Qaeda Â» Al Qaeda propaganda videos glorify so-called foreign fighters in Iraq like al Shayea. A native of Saudi Arabia, al Shayea was just 19 when he went to Iraq to fight for al Qaeda against American forces. So now, Saudi officials say they are escalating their fight against homegrown al Qaeda militants. Al Shayea, who was disfigured during the attack, claims al Qaeda tricked him into becoming a bomber by asking him to deliver a tanker truck, which they had rigged with a bomb. Critics, mainly from the country's security forces, fear mistakes could allow some al Qaeda fighters back on the street.
