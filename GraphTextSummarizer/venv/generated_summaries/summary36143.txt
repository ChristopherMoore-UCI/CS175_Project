Daschle is on the health care advisory group of Obama's transition team and said he plans to write the health care plan that Obama submits to Congress next year. Former Sen. Tom Daschle, shown with his wife, Linda, says he will write Obama's health care plan. His wife, Linda Daschle, is a registered lobbyist for a firm that includes health care clients. In the book, he pushed for universal health care coverage to reach 46 million uninsured Americans by expanding the federal employee health benefits program to include private employer plans together with Medicaid and Medicare. "I hope to have the plan enacted by next year, and then it will take several years to implement," Daschle said last month.
