However, they have taken over from Leverkusen as the nearly men of German football, finishing Bundesliga runners-up in 2005 and 2007, German Cup runners-up in 2005 and German League Cup runners-up in 2007. Eight Bundesliga titles, six German Cups, six German League Cups, a Champions League winners medal, a UEFA Cup winners medal, a European Championship winners medal and a World Cup runners-up medal show how glittering Kahn's career was and it will be a long time before another player matches his medal haul for both club and country.

Brazilian playmaker Diego continues to be the fulcrum of the side, while young striker Aaron Hunt was a regular last season and is tipped to progress further.
