They all come from the Greenland ice sheet, a vast mass of frozen fresh water, hundreds of miles across and up to two miles thick. Cameraman Neil Bennett and I had traveled to the small town of Tasiilaq in southeastern Greenland to meet up with the Arctic Sunrise, a ship belonging to the environmental group Greenpeace. Traveling with Greenpeace allowed us to record powerful images of Greenland's accelerating melt. And we met independent scientists who believe the world must act boldly to slow down change that science is struggling to keep pace with. It's an inky blue body of water thick with floating, ancient ice.
