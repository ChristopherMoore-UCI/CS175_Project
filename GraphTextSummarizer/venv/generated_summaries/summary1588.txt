-- Organizers of New York City's Halloween parade have rallied public support and raised enough money to put on the annual event after facing financial woes stemming from losses caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The parade was canceled for the first time in its 39-year history in 2012 after Superstorm Sandy "Frankenstormed" the event In total, organizers raised $56,030 from over 900 donors -- more than enough to host the hundreds of puppets, more than 50 bands, and thousands of dancers, artists and costumed New Yorkers who will take part, according to organizers. Online organizers say that the parade will provide a much-needed economic boost to the area's local businesses, which was hard-hit by the storm. The financial losses from 2012's last-minute cancellation posed a "huge obstacle" to putting on this year's parade, they said.
