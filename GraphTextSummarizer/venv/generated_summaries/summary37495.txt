New York schools -- which provide meals for 1.1 million students daily -- offer principals vegetarian and nonvegetarian lunch options. Instead, they name rice and kidney beans, black bean quesadillas or tofu with Chinese noodles. "Whoever thought they would hear a third-grader saying that they liked tofu and Chinese noodles?" asked Dennis Walcott, New York City schools chancellor. The school's focus on healthier meals began three years ago when Groff noticed a majority of students were bringing their own vegetarian meals. It also tested meals on a small group of students, gathering feedback and changing the menu accordingly. Asked which school meals were their favorites, students at a public school in the New York borough of Queens don't say chicken fingers or meatballs.
