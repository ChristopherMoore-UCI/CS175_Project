During the hour she and Bieber spent at the shelter, they zeroed in on a 10-week-old husky mix and fell in love -- puppy love, that is. "I was told that [Gomez] was missing the dogs that she has at home." Gomez, who is currently on tour and performed in Winnipeg over the weekend, owns five rescue dogs and has advocated publicly on behalf of animal rescue. (PEOPLE.com) -- Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber squeezed in some very public displays of affection at a hockey game in Canada on Saturday night, but just one day earlier, they made a decidedly more private outing to a local animal shelter -- and quietly adopted a dog. "They spent a lot of time with the puppies," the rescue's chief executive officer, D'Arcy Johnston, tells PEOPLE. "I wasn't expecting her to adopt a dog while she was on tour and has a busy schedule," Johnston says.
