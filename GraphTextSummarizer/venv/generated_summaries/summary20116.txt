The industrial chemical formaldehyde and a botanical substance known as aristolochic acids are listed as "known human carcinogens" while six others, including certain inhalable glass wool fibers and styrene, used in Styrofoam, are listed as substances "reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogen," the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Friday. A colorless, flammable chemical, formaldehyde may be found in a wide range of products from plastics, synthetic fibers to hair straightening products and textile finishes. Exposure to captafol, cobalt-tungsten carbide (in powder or hard metal form), certain inhalable glass wool fibers, o-nitrotoluene, riddelliine, and styrene -- are "reasonably anticipated to increase carcinogenic exposure," the report states. Aristocholic acid -- a natural-occurring botanical substance -- may cause cancer of the urinary tract and permanent kidney failure, the report stated. -- United States health authorities have added eight commonly used substances to its official "Report on Carcinogens," saying they may put people at increased risk of developing cancer.
