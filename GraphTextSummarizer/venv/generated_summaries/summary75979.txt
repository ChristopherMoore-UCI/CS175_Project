We put forward seven names, along with pros and cons for each: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Apple Senior Vice President Jonathan In advance of Friday, the first anniversary of the death of Apple's co-founder, we published a story pondering a question many in the tech world have been asking for a while: Who will be the next Steve Jobs? Ive, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Paypal and Tesla Motors co-founder and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and SCVNGR and LevelUP CEO Seth Priebatsch. In fact, I think Amazon's innovations began to eclipse those of Apple even before Jobs' death. He may not have been as trendy as Jobs or had the eye for trendsetting like Jobs did (though, even that is arguable, as most of the work was done by Apple's fleet of designers), but he certainly has a better heart and mind.
