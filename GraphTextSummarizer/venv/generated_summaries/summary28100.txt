Nature Education started the venture in an attempt to reignite student interest in science, said Vikram Savkar, publishing director of Nature Education, who noted that 40 percent of students in the U.S. who start college studying science end up switching majors by the time they graduate. " While e-learning has been booming in recent years -- in 2007, nearly 4 million students in the U.S. took at least one course online, according to the Sloan Consortium, a nonprofit dedicated to integrating online learning into higher education -- a challenge educators often face is how to keep students engaged in virtual classrooms. A recent study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education found that "on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. "Our mission is to change people's lives," said Reshef, who also is the chairman of Cramster.com, an online study community for college students. "We believe the social networking we build around our programs will serve as a cement to keep students with each other and stay in our program," said Reshef.
