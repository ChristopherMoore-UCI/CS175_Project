It is not too easy to detangle a 40 ton animal," said Edward Lyman, the Large Whale Entanglement Response Coordinator in Hawaii for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "We know that these situations are not immediately life threatening, but the animal will eventually succumb to this if we don't rescue it," Lyman told CNN on Tuesday. "In the past year, 13 large whales have been reported entangled in gear and we cut one free successfully maybe two," Lyman said. A humpback whale has become tangled up in a synthetic line attached to a buoy off the coast of the island of Hawaii. "We are standing by waiting for certain things to come together," Lyman said.
