Werder Bremen claimed a Champions League spot and a third-place finish with a 1-1 home draw against Hamburg, Ruud van Nistlerooy's 82nd-minute equalizer canceling-out the opener from Claudio Pizarro. "It is important that we won here," Bayern coach Louis van Gaal told reporters after being drenched in beer by his celebrating players. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen -- who drew with Borussia Mochengladbach 1-1, Borussia Dortmund -- who lost 3-1 to SC Freiburg -- and Stuttgart -- who drew 1-1 with Hoffenheim -- claimed Europa League places finishing fourth, fifth and sixth respectively. Victory for the Bavarian giants -- who led the top division by three points from rivals Schalke going into the game -- came thanks to a 20th-minute opener from Ivica Olic and a second-half brace from star performer Arjen Robben. Bayern finished the campaign on 70 points, five ahead of rivals Schalke, whose title ambitions were cut short with a 0-0 away draw to Mainz thanks to a missed penalty from Miroslav Karhan.
