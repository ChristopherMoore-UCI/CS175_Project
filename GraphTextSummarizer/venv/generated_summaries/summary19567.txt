It was a thrilling grand prix, up and down all the time," said Vettel, who won in Abu Dhabi in 2009-10 but retired last year with his second world title already in the bag. Massa, who has had his Ferrari contract extended by another year, was seventh ahead of Bruno Senna -- who gave Williams a second driver in the top 10 despite an early collision with Sauber-bound Nico Hulkenberg. Vettel's lead was cut by three points to 10 as main rival Fernando Alonso finished second for Ferrari, and the Spaniard said he was happy after improving from sixth on the starting grid. However, the 2008 world champion suffered yet another mechanical problem as his McLaren developed fuel pressure problems -- it was the second time in five races the Englishman has retired while leading. His heroic showing overshadowed Kimi Raikkonen's first victory since 2009, and ended the Finn's slim hopes of a second world title ahead of the final two races.
