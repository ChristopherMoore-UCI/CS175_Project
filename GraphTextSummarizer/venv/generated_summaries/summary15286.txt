The explosion took place in Marcoule, in southeastern France, the EDF spokeswoman said, declining to give her name in line with company policy. France relies heavily on nuclear power, which now accounts for about 80% of the country's electricity production, according to the U.S. State Department. There have been no serious suggestions from mainstream politicians that France reduce its dependence on nuclear power, the State Department says. The explosion happened at a center for processing and decommissioning nuclear waste, said the safety agency, which is known by its French acronym ASN. Different activities take place at the large-scale site, including research by France's Center for Atomic Energy, said a spokeswoman for Areva, a nuclear company that has operations at Marcoule.
