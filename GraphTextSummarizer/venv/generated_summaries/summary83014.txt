The day after 25 House Republicans attempted to prevent Speaker John Boehner from getting a third term, Boehner says he's starting "a family conversation" with his critics. Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, who campaigned to replace Boehner as Speaker, agreed that moves to exact revenge would make any effort to unify House Republicans harder. He said "I'm looking forward to doing my job on the Budget committee, I'm looking forward to doing my job on the Financial Services Committee." As for the prospects that he might lose one of those positions Garrett said, "I don't think that's the nature of John Boehner." Boehner, when asked if there would be further repercussions for those who opposed him, only said "we're going to continue to have a family conversation." Two Florida Republicans who opposed Boehner - Rep. Daniel Webster, who got 12 votes for his own bid to become Speaker, and Rep. Richard Nugent, who voted for him - were removed from serving on the House Rules committee. Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, who voted for Boehner but has clashed with him in the past, cautioned against further sanctions.
