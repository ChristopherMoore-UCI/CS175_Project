Heynckes is currently in his third spell as Bayern coach having taken over from Dutchman Louis van Gaal in 2011. "In his place, the club has appointed Pep Guardiola as head coach for three years from 1 July 2013. "Pep Guardiola is one of the most successful coaches in the world and we are sure that he can give not just Bayern, but the German football, lots of shine. The 41-year-old Guardiola stepped down as Barcelona coach at the end of last season after four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs to take a year-long sabbatical. "FC Bayern today announces that head coach Jupp Heynckes has decided to retire when his current contract expires on 30 June 2013," read a statement on the German league leader's website.
