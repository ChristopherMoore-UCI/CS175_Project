The other players to be fined were Guillermo Ochoa, Francisco Rodriguez, Andres Guardado, Gerrardo Torrado, Pablo Barrera, Enrique Esqueda and Hector Moreno. -- The Mexico Football Federation has banned Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez from national team duty for six months, following reports the pair threw a party at the team hotel after their friendly in Colombia on September 8. Those 11 included Manchester United and Fulham pair Javier Hernandez and Carlos Salcido, as well as Tottenham Hotspur's Giovani dos Santos and New York Red Bulls' star Rafael Marquez. Mexico national team director Nestor de la Torre announced the reprimands at a press conference on Wednesday. "Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez will be suspended for six months from the date of these events (September 8), for calls for the national team, because there were faults in four sections of the national team rules," he said.
