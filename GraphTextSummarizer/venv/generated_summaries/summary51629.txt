He is trying to measure the emissions caused by a change from forest to palm oil plantations to give solid data on Indonesia's carbon emissions. Louis Verchot, a leading climate scientist, in Indonesia to measure carbon emissions through deforestation, illustrated the problem. The United Nations Environment Program estimated that between 2003 and 2006, deforestation and forest degradation reached 1.17 million hectares per year. "We're trying to understand how this change from forest through degradation to oil palm affects the emission of greenhouse gases." As part of its new commitments, in January 2011 Indonesia begins a two-year ban on any new clearing of forests.
