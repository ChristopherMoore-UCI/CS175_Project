European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called that signing "an outstanding moment for the European Union -- and for Croatia." "Today, we all acknowledge the hard work Croatia has done and its crowning success," Barroso said in a December 9 statement. Already a member of NATO, Croatia is now poised to join an EU bloc that includes its neighbors Slovenia and Hungary. According to official results, posted on a government website, about 66% of voters backed Croatia's entry into the EU and 33% sided against the move. -- Croatians voted Sunday in support of their country's bid to join the European Union, paving the way for the southern European nation to become the alliance's 28th member. In that statement, Barroso alluded to the economic crisis affecting much of the eurozone, including bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
