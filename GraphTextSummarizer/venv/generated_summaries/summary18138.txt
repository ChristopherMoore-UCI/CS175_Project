Pease taught Booth how to draw lines and quick sketches, techniques tattoo artists use to ink their customers quickly, "before they change their minds," he jokes. She'd gone to other tattoo shops in the St. Louis area and when she tried to explain her story -- why she was getting her first tattoo at age 37, what it meant to her -- it felt like no one listened. A lot of shops half-ass the things they do. "I wanted to take the smut and drama out of the image of a tattoo shop," said Booth, 42. After Booth apprenticed with him for a year, Pease encouraged her to take another step by purchasing a tattoo shop that was going on sale in Warrenton.
