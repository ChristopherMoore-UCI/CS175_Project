The other seven suspects were named as Luiz Henrique Ferreira Romao, Fernanda Gomes de Castro, Dayanne Souza, Elenilson Vitor da Silva, Sergio Rosa Sales, Wemerson Marques de Souza and Flavio Caetano de Araujo. The teen said Souza watched as the missing woman was asphyxiated, mutilated and fed to dogs, local police investigator Wagner Pinto told reporters last month. The man trying to prosecute a Brazilian soccer goalie and eight other people on murder charges in the case of a missing woman said Thursday that even though police have not found a body, he will proceed. The prosecutor filed the charges against de Souza and eight others in Contagem, Brazil, on Wednesday. Quaresma has said his client denies all the accusations and de Souza will not answer any questions for now.
