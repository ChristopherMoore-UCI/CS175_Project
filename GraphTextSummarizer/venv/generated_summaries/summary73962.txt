Chavez has pledged to run for re-election next year, dismissing speculation that his illness would force him out of politics. Just four months ago, Chavez underwent emergency surgery in Cuba after he was found to have cancer. -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, back in his home country after five days of medical tests in Cuba, said Thursday that he was cured from the cancer he was diagnosed with this year. The tests he underwent in Cuba in the past days showed that his body had healed from his surgery and that chemotherapy left no toxins in his organs, he said. Last month, the president was in Cuba for what he said was his fourth and possibly final round of chemotherapy.
