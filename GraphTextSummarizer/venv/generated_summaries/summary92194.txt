Shows scheduled for May 21, at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan, and May 24, at Osaka's Yanmar Stadium Nagai, have also been postponed. McCartney plans to reschedule the shows at Tokyo's National Stadium, which were originally planned for May 18 and 19. "Since contracting a virus last week that led to the postponement of tour dates, Paul received successful medical treatment at a hospital in Tokyo," according to a statement posted Thursday on his official website. His tour is scheduled to continue in Seoul, South Korea, on May 28, before coming to the United States on June 14. The former Beatle is on the road to recovery after falling ill during his "Out There" tour in Asia, where he was forced to postpone shows in Japan.
