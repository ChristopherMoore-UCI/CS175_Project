The ban will start with immediate effect, meaning Suarez will play no part in Liverpool's four remaining Premier League matches with the Uruguayan also ruled out for the start of next season. "Liverpool forward Luis Suarez has not appealed the suspension issued to him by an Independent Regulatory Commission this week," read an FA statement released on Friday. -- As British Prime Minister David Cameron called on footballers to act as role models, Liverpool's Luis Suarez chose not to appeal his 10-match "biting" ban handed to him by the English Football Association for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. "The charges against Luis were his to consider and we have to respect his decision to not appeal the 10-game ban," Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre said in a statement released by the club. Last season he was hit with an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.
