Six days later, hundreds packed a Tacoma, Washington, church to remember the lives of young Braden and Charlie Powell, describing them as intelligent, compassionate, joyful boys who made big impressions in a short time. Charles Cox said that the support they've received since their daughter went missing "helps us to be strong, and helps to know that there are good people." He also expressed thanks for the support his grandsons had received, saying, "All their teachers, their social workers, the police: Everyone was doing everything they possibly could to keep them safe, and to help them and love them." While Susan Cox-Powell has not been found, her father suggested that he believes she is dead -- and that she is now reunited with her sons in heaven. The boys' grandparents Charles and Judith Cox, who were engaged in a long and bitter child custody battle with Josh Powell, took the stage briefly. Charlie's younger brother, Braden, who also celebrated a birthday in January, turning 5, was remembered as a "budding puzzlemaster," "tickle monster" and loving boy in remarks from one of his pre-kindergarten instructors, Kristy King. Authorities say the boys' father, Josh Powell, snatched them from a social worker who was delivering them for a supervised visit Sunday, locking the doors before killing them, as well as himself, just minutes before his Puyallup, Washington, home exploded.
