It's a tricky balancing act to pull off, and lots could go wrong -- for instance, it's not exactly clear how smooth it will be to switch between the two types of Windows, or if you'll even be able to get the old Windows on certain types of tablets (that is, tablets that run the power-efficient ARM processors used by the iPad and most other tablets today). But Windows 8 will also run on regular old PCs, and underneath the new tablet-friendly interface, it will look and feel a lot like the old version of Windows. A year later, Microsoft 's Windows Phone platform is still at less than 2% market share, way behind Apple, Android and even the struggling BlackBerry. The problem comes down to a simple statistic that should scare the heck out of Microsoft and its investors: Five years ago, 95% of devices connected to the Internet were Windows PCs. But if past Windows launches are any guide, Microsoft will help its cause by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on high-profile TV ads, viral whisper campaigns and "co-marketing" money for its PC hardware partners and the resellers who push Microsoft software to big corporations.
