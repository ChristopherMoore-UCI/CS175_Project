They decided to stop medicating her so that she doesn't suffer anymore," mother Analia Bouguet said, according to Argentina's state-run Telam news agency. "They put the coffin on top of a stretcher and we looked for a little crowbar to open it because it was nailed shut," father Fabian Veron told a local television station in April. The baby had no vital signs when she was born, hospital director Dr. Jose Luis Meirino said. -- Doctors have withdrawn medications and begun palliative care for a premature baby who survived hours in a morgue refrigerator in Argentina, state media reported. Every, doctor, nurse and morgue worker who dealt with the baby at the hospital in northern Argentina where she was born has been suspended while authorities investigate, officials have said.
