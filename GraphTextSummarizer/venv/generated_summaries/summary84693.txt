To counteract that sense of wariness, Facebook is making sure future privacy considerations aren't just part of a settings screen, but also taken into account by engineers making new features and at the infrastructure level. "We understand that some people have felt that Facebook privacy has changed too much in the past," said Mike Nowak, a product manager on Facebook's privacy team. When Facebook updates a setting or adds a feature, there is often a privacy backlash, especially when new sharing settings make information public by default. It's not that they're over-sharers, they just haven't bothered to keep up with the social network's ever-changing and often confusing privacy settings. Facebook highlighted some of its minor new and future privacy features on Tuesday, including one aimed squarely at the people left behind by complicated settings.
