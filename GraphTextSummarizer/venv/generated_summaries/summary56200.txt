According to Sanchez Fuentes, Head Start officials advised local directors about enrollment procedures, bulked up on admissions training and now make unannounced visits to local programs. "We know the majority of Head Start programs across the country are doing the right thing." " A 10-year study released in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that Head Start kids are better prepared academically and socially to enter kindergarten. The issue is up for a 90-day comment period, but the rule won't change unless Head Start leaders decide it's the best course of action. "We will make sure that when we go out to see these local programs, that they are indeed doing the right things and that every federal dollar that goes to Head Start is not being misused." Still, they have not yet taken Kutz's suggestion to change the policies about keeping income eligibility documents.
