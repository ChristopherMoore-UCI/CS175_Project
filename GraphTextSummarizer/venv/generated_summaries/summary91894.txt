" Controversies over violent video games feel almost as old as video games themselves, dating back to the 1980s. Flipping the script on the typical good-versus-evil story, gamers play "Grand Theft Auto" titles as criminals -- from two-bit hoodlums trying to work their way up the ranks of organized crime to seasoned, rough customers hell-bent on revenge for wrongs done to them by other crooks. "GTA is easily one of the biggest game releases of the year," said Steve Butts, editor-in-chief of games and entertainment site IGN.com. "Games are an increasingly important part of our culture, and we all have a responsibility to find a more appropriate, inclusive context to debate what is and isn't appropriate entertainment for certain audiences."
