Anyene was killed along with her husband and four children when Dana Air Flight 992 crashed Sunday in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city. -- Josephine and Jennifer Onita were returning from the wedding of a close friend in Nigeria. In another American city, far from the wreckage in Lagos, friends and family dealt with similar, gut-wrenching grief. Houston pastor Banji Adesanmi knew the Onita family through the Redeemed Christian Church of God, based in Nigeria. Her parents, Solomon and Lola Onita, came to the Houston area from Nigeria three decades ago, harboring the dream of all immigrants.
