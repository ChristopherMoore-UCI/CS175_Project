In addition to the remains in the turret, there were shoes, coats, boots and other personal items -- as if the crew members had been discarding clothing to keep from being pulled down into the water as they tried to escape. "They view them as their ancestors, and they are there to honor all 16." David Alberg, superintendent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, said the burials are part of a long military tradition. The researchers also had other clues like the items and clothing left with the two men, including buttons from a uniform, a gold ring, a comb, some coins and a pair of mismatched shoes. The remains of two men found in the wreckage of the Civil War ironclad USS Monitor 11 years ago are being laid to rest Friday in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia after an extensive but unsuccessful quest to discover the sailors' identities. " The Monitor's 1862 battle against the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia was perhaps the most famous naval engagement of the Civil War, signifying the end of wooden warships and the move to ironclad ones.
