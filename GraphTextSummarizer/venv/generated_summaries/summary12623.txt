Facebook is constantly trying to find new revenue streams, testing out services such as paying to promote posts and Facebook Gifts. "Several commentators and researchers have noted that imposing a financial cost on the sender may be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and facilitate delivery of messages that are relevant and useful," says the post. But there's a second class of messages, including potential spam and notes from people not in your network, that the site's algorithms deem "less relevant." Facebook is now testing a solution to help messages avoid this limbo, the company announced in a blog post Thursday. Facebook is sprucing up its messaging system, and the most interesting change is a move to charge people to send a message to someone outside their network.
