"The public interest in Senator Edwards' deposition and the other depositions in this case is significant, while the privacy interests of Senator Edwards and the parties -- who voluntarily participated in events of significant public importance and have widely and openly discussed all of the events underlying this litigation -- are negligible," said the motion by the media companies. Superior Court Judge Carl Fox previously ordered the motion compelling Edwards to give his deposition, as well as the deposition itself, to be sealed from public disclosure. Edwards, a former U.S. senator and Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2004, has given a deposition in the lawsuit of his former mistress, Rielle Hunter, against former Edwards aide Andrew Young. Instead, it argues that most details in the case already have been made public by the parties themselves, and therefore the motions and depositions so far should be public records as called for under North Carolina law. -- A group of media companies on Wednesday asked a North Carolina judge to unseal court documents in a lawsuit involving the John Edwards sex-tape case.
