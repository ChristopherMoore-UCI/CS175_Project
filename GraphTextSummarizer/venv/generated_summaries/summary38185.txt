Panish -- the Jackson family's lead lawyer -- questioned Trell Thursday about his previous testimony that there were no "red flags" to alert AEG executives about Jackson's declining health. " The e-mail exchange happened less than four hours before Trell and other AEG executives visited Jackson's Los Angeles home. The Jackson lawsuit contends that AEG Live executives ignored red flags that should have warned them that Jackson was in danger from Murray's treatment. Panish then showed jurors an e-mail Trell sent on January 28, 2009, to Ted Fikre, AEG's chief legal officer, letting him know he was about to go to Jackson's home for the signing of the contract for his "This Is It" concert tour. He showed jurors an e-mail sent to AEG Live President Randy Phillips and Co-CEO Paul Gongaware by "This Is It" stage manager John "Bugzee" Houghdahl on June 19, 2009 -- six days before Jackson died.
