In recorded music, Strait, with his smooth Texas accent and traditional county style, has even outsold The Rolling Stones stateside, who RIAA lists with 11 multi-platinum, 28 platinum and 42 gold albums. -- Country music icon George Strait has announced his final concert go-round but stressed that he does not plan to ride into the sunset after his two-year "The Cowboy Rides Away Tour" ends in 2014. "It's a song that we've closed our show with for many years," Strait said, who also shared a memory of playing it for President George Bush, Sr. at Camp David, a week before he left office. When the stress of touring has evaporated two years down the road, Strait said he plans to spend more time playing golf and angling with a special partner. He stuck with it when he arrived back home, and while playing with country band "Ace in the Hole," promoter Erv Woolsey, who later became Strait's manager, discovered him and got him a recording contract with MCA.
