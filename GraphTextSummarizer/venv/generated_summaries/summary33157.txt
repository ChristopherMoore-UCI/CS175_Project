Many of the planes being ordered today in Dubai will replace aging planes in existing fleets. Then there's the sheer number of Boeing 777X planes being ordered. Of the 259 planes announced at the Dubai launch of Boeing's revamped long haul aircraft, Emirates, Etihad & Qatar bought 225 of them! Airlines found themselves with too many seats and too few passengers and had to mothball planes and slim down. The fact that Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airlines bought more than $150 billion worth of commercial planes on the first day of the Dubai Airshow has surprised no one, but at the same time worried just about everyone in the airline industry -- well, everyone who's not working for the Gulf airlines.
