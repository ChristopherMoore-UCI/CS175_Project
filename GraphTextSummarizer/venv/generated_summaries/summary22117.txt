"Many guides have reinvented their business models, becoming online booking services or increasingly doing business-to-business operations and looking to online advertising," says Mesquita. According to Mesquita's Nielsen BookScan Travel Publishing Yearbook, sales of printed world travel guides have declined by over 40% in the last seven years. " Personality and standing out from the crowd also helped the diminutive Luxe City Guides punch above their weight and gain a foothold in the international travel guide business. Set up by British couple James Lohan and Tamara Heber-Percy ten years ago, the luxury guidebook has carved a niche in a crowded marketplace by appealing to a particular demographic. Thatcher says that nearly 1.5 million Luxe City Guides have been sold since launch, while Lohan and Heber-Percy have no intention of doing away with their print editions, looking to China and Asia as the next places for their global expansion.
