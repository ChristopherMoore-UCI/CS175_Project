Although there were a number of inspections of DeCamp Bus Lines, it has not been cited for safety violations, said Marissa Padilla, a spokeswoman for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. As a result of the investigation and inspections, 52 motor coach companies were put out of business and shut down for safety violations such as failure to maintain their buses adequately, inadequate drug and alcohol driver testing and overwork of drivers. FMCSA officials said they re-examined the way they investigate passenger carriers to make their methods even more effective at preventing crashes. Police said at least 10 passengers were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries. The accident comes one week after U.S. transportation officials shut down 52 bus companies in 22 states and the District of Columbia due to unsafe motor coach operations.
