About a quarter of workers in the U.S. and U.K. say they spend more than an hour on social networking sites during office hours, according to a recent survey. However, a collaboration between Twitter and Apple could open a backdoor to a part of the corporate workforce that has been locked out of Ping during the crucial daytime hours. The Ping features -- available to users in the 23 countries where the iTunes Store sells music -- is an extension of Twitter's site overhaul last month that added a similar preview function for photos and video, a Twitter spokeswoman said. Many Ping pages had little recent activity, aside from profile notes about new music purchases, which can be set to post automatically. With Ping -- the social service that lives within Apple's iTunes program -- users can now post links to songs and albums to their Twitter accounts.
