The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta describes norovirus as a very contagious bug that can be spread by infected persons, in contaminated food or water, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Dozens of passengers on a four-night cruise aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship became sick with a stomach illness, according to a company statement. The cruise line said passengers affected by the illness had responded well to over-the-counter medication administered on board the ship. Sixty-six of the more than 2,500 passengers aboard experienced gastrointestinal issues, such as vomiting and diarrhea, Royal Caribbean International said. Last May, a fire broke out on the Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas cruise ship, forcing passengers to fly home.
