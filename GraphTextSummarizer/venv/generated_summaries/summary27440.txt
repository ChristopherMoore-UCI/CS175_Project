Well, that's what happened to Matthew Keys, online news producer for KTXL FOX40 News in Sacramento, California. "At some point, Adam started asking his mom and our dad about me and something in him pushed him to ask me on Twitter details about my biological mom," Keys says. "Neither of us can remember exactly how we came to meet, but we kept in touch off and on over the past year on MSN and Skype." Determined to solve the mystery, Keys fired up Skype and messaged Smith. Well, a few years ago, his mother told him that his father had other children, and mentioned a few names, including Keys's. Well, at nearly midnight, Keys saw a message that would lead to a pretty big piece of news that he didn't previously "catch" -- a message from a man named Adam Smith reading: "Hey is your mom's name Jackie?" Obviously, Keys was a bit freaked out.
