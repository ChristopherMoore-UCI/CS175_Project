Fifth seed Robin Soderling reached the quarterfinals last year, but the Swede's participation ended on Saturday with a shock defeat by Australian teenager Bernard Tomic. The world No. 93, a doubles specialist who lost in the second round last year, will next take on Spain's Feliciano Lopez -- who eliminated three-time runner-up Andy Roddick on Friday. Llodra, seeded 19th, has already bettered his best performance by passing the second round and will take on Djokovic after his 6-3 6-3 6-1 win over Lu Yen-Hsun, who last year became the first Taiwanese player to reach the quarterfinals. Djokovic was given a warning after smashing his racket into the ground three times, a petulant outburst that ensured the Centre Court crowd was firmly behind Baghdatis -- a 2006 semifinalist here after losing in the final of that year's Australian Open. Del Potro, now ranked 21st as he continues his comeback from long-term wrist problems, defeated French 15th seed Gilles Simon 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (7-5) 7-5.
