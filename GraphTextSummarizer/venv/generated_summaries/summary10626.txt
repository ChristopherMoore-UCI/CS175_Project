DJ/music producer Diplo learned that lesson the hard way on Wednesday, when Lorde stepped in to protect Swift on Twitter after Diplo made a gross observation about Swift's physique. "Someone should make a kickstarter to get taylor swift a booty," Diplo, who's worked with several of music's biggest names and is rumored to be dating Katy Perry, tweeted to his more than 1 million followers Wednesday afternoon. -- Everyone should know by now that Lorde and Taylor Swift are good friends -- and if you mess with one, you're messing with them both. The Grammy winner (born Ella Yelich-O'Connor) celebrated her 18th birthday on November 7, and she marked it with some quality time with her BFF Swift. Obviously, Swift's army of fans wasn't going to take that.
