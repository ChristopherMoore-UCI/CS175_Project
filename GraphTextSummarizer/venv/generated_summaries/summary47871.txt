Ferrer, the No. 7 seed, breezed through his match on the sheltered showpiece court, defeating 2009 U.S. Open champion Del Potro in just under two hours. His reward for reaching his first quarterfinal in eight years is a tie with world No. 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic. After a day punctuated by rain delays on Monday, Murray was able to wrap up a 7-5 6-2 6-3 victory with just one interruption before damp conditions halted the action on all but Centre Court. There was criticism of the tournament's organizers after Murray's match wasn't switched to Centre Court, which has a retractable roof, but he told reporters: "I honestly don't care which court I play on. "It makes no difference but obviously every player would rather be on Centre Court because you know you are going to get your match in regardless of the weather.
