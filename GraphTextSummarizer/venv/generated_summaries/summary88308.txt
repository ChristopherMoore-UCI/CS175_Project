Ahead of the strike, unions and government officials in many, but not all, of Spain's 17 regions agreed on minimum services, which generally call for about 30% of public transportation to run, while public hospitals and other essential services have reduced staff, similar to holiday levels. Government critics say it will be the first time the government really shows its hand on where to make deep cuts in specific programs and agencies. Spanish unions are protesting the new conservative government's labor reforms and austerity cuts. The strike comes one day before the government unveils its 2012 budget on Friday, with the aim of reducing Spain's deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic product this year, and to 3% next year, to meet European Union requirements. If they walk out, they will lose a day's wage, which for government workers could amount to several hundred dollars.
