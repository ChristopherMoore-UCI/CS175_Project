Kaamil, who perceives clear parallels between Lolita's life of captivity-for-profit and the human slave trade, was inspired to record "Let The Girl Go: Free Lolita," a bold music video about Lolita, and a courageous interview on the parallels of captivity between human slaves and performing orcas. Unlike any other known creature, unlike elephants and humans, orcas like Lolita never leave their birth family. "My own relatives, my family ancestors, were captured and forced into slavery." Captured in waters off Washington State in 1970, Lolita is an orca -- a killer whale. Lolita's fish-hunting skills are by now somewhere between rusty and nonexistent, but free-living orcas routinely share food. Thousands of miles away, Lolita's family has been without her.
