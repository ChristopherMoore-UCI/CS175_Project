-- Pope Francis spoke out against sexual abuse by Catholic clergy on Monday and said he plans to meet with victims in early June. The meeting at the Vatican will not be the first time a pope has met with sexual abuse victims, according to John L. Allen Jr., CNN's senior Vatican analyst. " When reporters asked about celibacy in the clergy, Pope Francis showed an open mind but didn't say he's ready to make a change yet. Stressing that sex abuse constitutes a horrific crime, he told reporters that three bishops are under investigation. A priest who abuses a child betrays the body of the Lord, the Pope said, according to pool reports.
