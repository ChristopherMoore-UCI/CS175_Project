They're all tied to climate change in one way or another, and they leave Arctic community leaders with a big job ahead of them. Our mission when we left Victoria, British Columbia in June was to find out how climate change is impacting Arctic communities. Ice floes are frozen seawater while icebergs are chunks of ice broken off glaciers in the High Arctic. Climate change is turning the spotlight on the Arctic, and hopefully that will mean federal government help where it is needed to aid the Inuit in making wise choices for their future. Many of the challenges brought to the Arctic by climate change and economic development are the same as those faced around the world.
