Like Geyser, Weier is next due in court August 1, when Weier's attorneys are expected to tell Bohren how much more time they need to prepare for a plea hearing. But the court-ordered report on Morgan Geyser's competency -- mentioned in a hearing in Waukesha on Wednesday -- isn't the final word on the matter, as Judge Michael Bohren granted the prosecution a chance to challenge the finding in an August 1 hearing. Also Wednesday, Bohren granted the prosecution's request for doctors to examine Geyser again, this time to determine whether she has a "mental disease or defect" that could have an impact on the case. Both defendants were silent, handcuffed and wearing blue jail clothes, as they attended separate procedural hearings Wednesday morning. Weier's attorneys haven't asked the court to determine whether she is competent, but her lawyer Joseph Smith Jr. told Bohren on Wednesday that he reserved the right to do so.
