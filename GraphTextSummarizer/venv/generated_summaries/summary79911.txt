Rooms and suites come with gourmet kitchens, living room fireplaces and Bulgari bath amenities. It boasts that kind of look-at-me d√©cor (think floral area rugs, studded leather chairs, crystal chandeliers and shaggy duvets all in one room) that might not be to everyone's liking, but most will be pleased with plenty of amenities and services. In addition to a stylish decor, you'll have a high-tech kitchen (which can be stocked with all of your favorite treats and drinks prior to arrival), walk-in closets in every bedroom, a small but private backyard, in-room dining from the hotel's Michelin-starred restaurant Madera, and car access within five miles of the property. And when you need to unwind, the 24-hour concierge can arrange all sorts of things, from private dinners to in-room spa treatments. Yes, these properties come with high price tags and these places aren't anything like home, but in many ways, they're better.
