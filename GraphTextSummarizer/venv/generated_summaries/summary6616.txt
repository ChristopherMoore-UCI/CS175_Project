Watching President Obama react to what he called his "shellacking" in the midterm elections had me remembering then-President Bill Clinton back on November 9, 1994 -- the day after he and his fellow Democrats lost control of the House and the Senate. As much as Obama doesn't want to do that, he's a politician, and politicians have a very powerful instinct for their own political survival, especially when they face re-election in two years. None of us knew what to expect from Clinton on that day 16 years ago, but he came out and was direct -- he said that he took responsibility for the political disaster. Clinton was in Little Rock in November 1992 when he was elected: Obama was in Chicago on November 4, 2008, when he was elected -- exactly two years ago today. I was then CNN's Senior White House correspondent and I vividly remember attending Clinton's news conference.
