"Afghanistan's villages are not the sanctuaries for these terrorists and Afghan lives should not be sacrificed for terrorism that has another base and home," the message said, making reference to militant bases across the Afghan border in Pakistan. The Karzai message, making reference to the toppling of the Taliban, called 9/11 "an act of international terrorism which consequently rescued Afghanistan from terroristic domination and resulted in the destruction of terrorist bases and sanctuaries inside of Afghanistan. Eikenberry said the United States is in Afghanistan "to prevent international terrorists from again establishing a safe haven for extremists who would plot to wreak havoc" throughout the world. "Our part of this task is to help Afghanistan achieve the stability, respected fair governance, economic well-being, and status in this part of the world so that international terrorists will find no ground on which to openly stand in this great country," Eikenberry said. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- whose country harbored the al Qaeda terror network when the group attacked the United States nine years ago -- used the September 11 anniversary to deplore the assault and call for an effective counterterrorism strategy in the longstanding Afghan war.
